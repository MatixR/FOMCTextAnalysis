6517,2001-03-20,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’m going to continue the tradition of   another tall, wavy-haired guy with glasses and refer to the charts that were distributed   this morning1/    On the first page the familiar forward rate  agreements depict in red the decline of US interest rates over the  last few months  After the Committee’s January meeting, both cash  and forward rates were stable at first but began to decrease as the  equity market fell under pressure, with announcements of earnings  shortfalls in the corporate sector, and as speculation regarding an  intermeeting move increased  That speculation was fueled by the  comments of a former Fed official, who in fact started giving  precise probabilities of an intermeeting ease  Currently, with the  three-month cash rate--the solid red line--already below 5 percent,  the market is anticipating further easing beyond any actions that  may or may not come from this meeting  And the chatter about a  75 basis point cut at this meeting has coincided with the spillover of  weakness from the NASDAQ to the broader stock indices  As of  early this week, most of the primary dealers were expecting a 50  basis point easing move at this meeting, though a minority, 10 out  of the 25, were forecasting 75  Another measure of expectations,  the April fed funds futures, is at about 484 right now, though it’s  difficult to disentangle the degree to which that reflects expectations  of a 75 basis point ease at this meeting or a 50 basis point move  today followed by an intermeeting move       Moving to the euro area--the blue lines--both cash and forward   rates have been largely stable since the beginning of the year  The  European Central Bank (ECB) has been symmetric in its rhetoric,  trying to prevent the market from anticipating an early ease and  taking what it is calling a wait-and-see approach  But I would note  that forward rates began to trade below cash rates around early  November, or roughly two months after the same dynamic was  observed in the United States  European officials have dismissed  suggestions that the market is sniffing out a euro-area slowdown  and have explained their forward market as being pulled by  movements in the US market  Maybe yes, maybe no  But both  forward rates and anecdotal surveys suggest that the market is  anticipating 25 basis points of ease from the ECB this spring and a  total of 50 basis points by the fall       In Japan--the set of green lines--we can see that rates basically   have made a round trip since last June  The Bank of Japan (BOJ)  initially raised rates in August and then pulled back in the last few  weeks with two cuts in the discount rate and a cut in the overnight  call rate  Then yesterday the BOJ announced a change in its  operating procedures; it indicated that it will target current account  balances on its balance sheet, possibly increasing its acquisitions of  Japanese government bonds (JGBs) rather than targeting the call  rate per se  Japanese markets were closed today, so we’ll have to     3/20/01 3  wait for reactions tomorrow in their markets  The call rate is  expected to trade near zero      Turning to page two, this set of charts is an updated version of   ones introduced last time as a measure of financial conditions,  taking the difference between two-year rates and the policy rates of  some of the major central banks  The policy rates of the various  central banks involve slightly different maturities; some use an  overnight target and some use a target of as much as two weeks   The top panel is the two-year government yield less the central  bank’s short-term policy rate and the bottom panel is the two-year  swap rate less the policy rate  In the top panel we show the German  two-year note versus the ECB’s refinancing rate  In the bottom  panel we used the euro swap rate versus that same ECB rate     Whether measured against the two-year note where the   inversions occurred first or against the swap rate where the  inversions followed a few months later, it seems that financial  conditions, if one accepts this as a good measure of them, were  rather tight by early this year  Now, since the January FOMC  meeting, the central banks of Canada, the United Kingdom, and  Japan also have eased policy  Only the ECB did not move  But the  degree of inversion was broadly similar, as was observed at the time  of the last Committee meeting     Turning to page three, I have shown some of the developments   in Japanese financial markets over the last few months  The top  panel has dollar/yen graphed on an inverted scale, and you can see  that the yen has been depreciating since December and is now in the  122 to 122-1/2 region  The market generally views the policy in  Tokyo as desiring a weaker yen, but Japanese officials have been  trying not to appear to be encouraging that weakening  But with the  Ministry of Finance (MOF) having taken a laissez faire approach,  the market is convinced that it is in accordance with their wishes   Nevertheless, the MOF is trying to walk that fine line, not wanting  to antagonize interests on this side of the Pacific      The middle panel shows the decline of JGB yields  That has   involved an interesting move from above 160 to about 115  percent, especially since the finance minister was quoted as saying  that the fiscal situation in Japan was on the verge of being  “catastrophic”  We have seen downgrades of Japanese banks, but at  least in the bond market that seems to have been outweighed by  expectations that interest rates would fall  Perhaps the market was  anticipating yesterday’s announcement by the BOJ  And regardless  of what we may think of it, the JGB market has been the asset of     3/20/01 4  choice during periods of stress in Japan  Even at yields of near l  percent, the carry, with a near zero financing cost, is still fairly  profitable  But there’s a sizable risk for the banks and the insurers  that have loaded up on these bonds, if confidence in this market  should falter     The bottom panel shows the Topix and the Nikkei indices    They are both down between 15 and 20 percent, perhaps not  surprising given what has happened in the economy, which I’m sure  Karen will discuss later  And with a decline of that magnitude, the  topic of bank capital adequacy has come back to the fore, especially  with mark-to-market accounting soon to be introduced  But  interestingly, the bank sub-index actually has performed in line with  the broader average  A widely held presumption is that the  government will pump more money into the banks as needed to  help with bad debt cleanup     On page four, the top panel has the euro-dollar exchange rate   since the beginning of the year, from the time when this Committee  first decreased rates in early January  The interesting point here is  the weakness of the euro, which has surprised traders and analysts,  given the reduced GDP forecasts for this country, the equity price  pressures we’ve seen, and the reductions in US interest rates  versus steady rates in Europe       The middle panel shows the degree of interest rate convergence   over the period since January 1, which is especially notable at the  short end  The green line shows the three-month spread in LIBOR  between dollar and euro time deposits, which has moved from about  150 basis points to near 20 basis points  The blue line is the two- year swap differential, and that has come down from around 100  basis points to about 40 basis points  The red line, the 10-year swap  spread, has been more stable  The less pronounced shift in that  measure may suggest that the market perceives the reduced return  on dollar assets to be a short-run phenomenon     The bottom panel charts the value of the US dollar on a year-  to-date basis against a range of currencies  As you can see, the  dollar has appreciated roughly 5 percent, give or take, against most  currencies  That appreciation has occurred despite some of the  negatives that I mentioned before  And market participants are  puzzled about what might explain it  Among the explanations is  that the market may just be getting it wrong, that a mis-pricing is  going on  Another is that a V-shaped recovery is being factored in  and that the market is looking beyond the valley  A less benign  interpretation is that the market is pricing in slowdowns in other     3/20/01 5  countries that are not yet embedded in economic forecasts  And  perhaps, though I’m not persuaded, there’s a safe-haven effect  going on  The reason I question that is because we have not seen  other indicia of a true safe-haven situation, such as a widening of  bid-ask spreads or other signs of stress in the market  Whatever the  cause, surveys suggest that portfolio managers may be  overweighted in euros relative to their benchmarks  So, from a  purely technical perspective, the risk for the euro in the near term is  that if portfolio managers move toward neutrality, the euro might be  in for a rough time at least on a short-term basis     Turning to the next page, the top panel reflects the lower yields   that we have seen in the coupon portion of our fixed income market   The recent steepening of the yield curve is evident; the curve is now  the steepest it has been since late 1998  Part of the reason for the  short end outperforming the long end is the expectation that policy  will continue to ease, to some extent because of a reallocation of  funds from equities to bonds, though that's a hard point to get a  handle on  But the underperformance at the long end might also be  at least in part a reflection of comments made by the Secretary of  the Treasury  Those comments raised questions in the minds of  some people about the Administration’s commitment to the buy- back program, which would affect the long end primarily, since  that’s where most of the purchases have been focused     I mentioned the safe-haven or flight-to-quality factor  Again,   there doesn’t seem to be much evidence yet of a true safe-haven  effect, although one area to keep an eye on is the emerging markets   The spread in the emerging market bond index (EMBI) has  increased by about 100 basis points in the last month and a half   And as you can see from the red line for Turkey and the green line  for Argentina--those are sub-components of JP Morgan’s EMBI-- the spreads have widened as the political situation in those countries  has deteriorated  The news overnight that the Argentine finance  minister has resigned may or may not help; we’ll see  The market  reaction so far, at least in early trading, has involved little change in  that spread, but I think the message is “stay tuned”     Page six provides an update on the commercial paper market in   a chart format you’ve seen before  The top two panels compare the  year-end 2000 spread--in red--versus the spreads in the previous  five years for 30- and 90-day commercial paper  The bottom panel  depicts the yields so far this year  The California power situation  and some downgrades of prominent companies like Daimler and  Lucent raised anxiety early in the year, but the amount of  outstanding commercial paper has actually declined in the last four     3/20/01 6  months  The reduction in A2/P2 paper outstanding was sizable,  about one-quarter of the total  The good news is that this short-term  debt has been refinanced with longer-term maturities and, in fact,  issuance of both investment grade and high-yield paper has been  running at a fairly strong pace year to date  But it’s noteworthy that  the A2/P2 spread has remained at a very high level relative to  A1/P1, even as interest rates have fallen  So it does create a bit of a  conundrum in that the market is willing to lend to some of these  lower quality rated companies on a long-term basis but is unwilling  to do so on a short-term basis     Finally, on page seven, a point or two on reserves as we head   into tax season  In the top panel the blue bars indicate the actual  levels of major tax receipts during the March-to-May period in  1998, 1999, and 2000  The red, green, and orange bars indicate the  projections of the New York, Treasury, and Board staffs for those  same months in 2001     In the bottom panel the blue line represents the New York   staff’s projected level of the Treasury’s general balance for the  period from March 15th to May 31st  We are forecasting elevated  levels of the Treasury’s balance at the Fed in late April-early May,  to between $15 billion and $20 billion  For perspective, this  compares to a peak of about $30 billion last year and an historical  peak of $52 billion during the 1997 tax season  The underlying  reserves over the period, assuming that $12 billion of long-term RPs  is rolled over and making a zero assumption for SOMA purposes,  are roughly $16 billion on average  We expect at the Desk to use a  mix of term RPs to deal with reserve needs in this period       Mr Chairman, there were no foreign operations during the   intermeeting interval; we will need a vote for the domestic  operations  And I’d be happy to answer any questions      I’m sure New York has the right answer!  I have not endeavored to   find out what the difference is in the models  I can only guess that there might be   differences in capital gains projections  Is that the case, Don?    That might account for some of the difference  "
6578,2001-05-15,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I will be referring to the charts  that were distributed this morning1      The top panel of the first page depicts US cash and forward 3-month   rates  The cash rate is down about 3/4 of a percentage point since the day  before the Committee’s intermeeting move on April 18th  The 3-month  forward rate has declined a bit less, by about 40 basis points, and the 9-month  forward rate is roughly unchanged  The 3-month and cash rates are roughly  on top of each other as we speak, and the 9-month forward rate is actually  above the cash rate for the first time since last September  Perhaps the market  is looking forward to the end of the easing cycle      Moving to the center panel, cash and forward rates in the euro area have   exhibited a saw-toothed pattern, as the market first became convinced that the  ECB would ease after the March IFO survey and then reversed its view after  the ECB convinced the markets it would not ease  Of course, that was just in  time for last week’s 25 basis point reduction in the refinancing rate!     The bottom panel reflects the downward pressure on Japanese money   market rates across all tenors since the March 19th change in the Bank of  Japan’s (BOJ) operational target  But it’s not just money market rates  The  two-year Japanese government bond (JGB) yield is currently yielding 6 basis  points       Moving to the second page, the top panel shows the 2-, 10-, and 30-year   U S Treasury yields since December 1st as well as the target fed funds rate   The 2-year rate has come down more than 100 basis points while the 30-year  has drifted up and the 10-year is roughly unchanged  That has led to a  steepening of the yield curve on the one hand, and also to a situation where                                                               1/  Copies of the charts are appended to this transcript        5/15/01     2   the 10- and 30-year yields are above the target fed funds rate for the first time  since May of 2000     The chart in the bottom panel depicts the fact that this is not just a   Treasury yield curve phenomenon  The US swap curve has steepened  substantially as well since last December, as have the UK and Canadian  yield curves, although by a lesser amount  The euro-area swap curve has  remained more or less unchanged, although it also has steepened in the last  day or two       Moving to the third page and taking a somewhat longer-term perspective,   I have shown the 2- to 30-year spread from January of 1989 through March  11th of this year  The shaded areas represent periods when the Fed was easing  policy  The sharp steepening of the curve from about –50 to +150 basis points  in the last few months has put the curve at its steepest since January of 1994   As the bottom panel shows, despite that steepening and the backup in yields,  the absolute level of 10- and 30-year yields is only slightly above the cyclical  low, which was reached in 1998       The chart at the top of page four shows domestic credit spreads to US   Treasuries of comparable maturities  The red line is the Merrill Lynch high- yield spread, which is on the left-hand scale  The A2 industrial corporates, the  US 10-year interest rate swap, and the 10-year Fannie Mae benchmark are on  the right-hand scale  In general, spreads have been narrowing since January  1st, although high-yield spreads are still wider than they were last summer,  perhaps affected by the weak equity market and the higher risk premium that  companies with more leveraged balance sheets are being charged   Nevertheless, issuance remained strong in the first quarter, especially in the  investment grade sector      The bottom panel shows the spread between A1/P1 and A2/P2 paper,   which has been drifting lower for both 30-day and 90-day issues  In part, that  may reflect a bit less risk aversion  But it may also reflect in part the fact that  some of the weaker A2 borrowers are having trouble rolling over their  commercial paper and have drawn on other sources of credit, such as backup  credit lines  Or more likely they have issued high-yield debt, a vehicle that  has remained open for many of these borrowers     Turning to the next page, I thought I would provide a quick review of the   tax season, now that it’s mostly behind us  In the top panel, the blue bars  show the growth of tax receipts for the last three tax seasons--that is, for April  and May  The red bar is the forecast for the current year, which is inclusive of  actual data through May 11th and thus actually reflects most of the period   The growth this year has been a bit slower than last year, but it is slightly  above what we saw in 1999          5/15/01     3   In the bottom panel, the red line depicts the Treasury’s general balance  between April 2nd and May 11th of this year  The Treasury’s general balance  topped out at about $70 billion in early May, but it remained comfortably  below TT&L capacity  Therefore, we were able to avoid the large reserve  drains and the associated buildup in the Treasury’s Fed balance that had  become the norm in the last few years  In fact, we looked back at historical  data and found that this was the first time in at least 15 years that the general  balance did not exceed the TT&L capacity and therefore spill over onto the  Fed  There were two reasons for this  One was that the Treasury made more  efficient use of cash management bills; secondly, the Treasury and the St  Louis Fed successfully campaigned with banks to bring additional collateral  into the TT&L program and thus raise capacity       Finally, on the last page I thought I would give the Committee a quick   update on our outright operations  It has been almost a year since we  established single-issue limits for SOMA holdings  And as the top panel  shows, we’ve had an increase in our outright operations  The blue portions of  the bars represent net portfolio expansion  The gray portions represent the  amount that has been purchased to offset the effects of redeemed securities   As you can see, before 2000 redemptions were relatively infrequent  But with  the sharp reduction of the size of auctions combined with our single-issue  limits, SOMA is having redemptions basically every month  In 2000 and in  2001 to date, as well as in our projection for the rest of the year, more than 50  percent of our outright purchases are to offset the effects of redemptions      The bottom panel depicts the number of outright operations that our Desk   has conducted since 1996  We are now operating on nearly one out of every  three business days  Performance is holding up; the bid-to-cover ratio on our  operations has stayed at 6 or higher  But the scale of the Desk’s activity is  growing at a time when the size of the market is shrinking, and that is placing  somewhat of a burden on our outright operations  We will be looking in  coming weeks at ways we can ease that pressure on our outright operations,  with one of the most likely ways being the expanded use of long-term repos   For the time being we’re planning to maintain the size of the repo book at $12  billion but we will be examining the scope for expanding that, and I will  report back to the Committee after we conclude our analysis     Mr Chairman, there were no foreign exchange operations in the   intermeeting period  I will need a vote to ratify domestic operations, and I  will be glad to take any questions      Especially recently, with the steepening of the yield curve, there has been   chatter in the markets about that as a possible explanation  I don’t know that forecasts of   inflation are actually rising  At least in my reading of the research and commentary, I haven’t   seen that people are raising their expectations for inflation  But it may be that they’re using that   explanation to explain a steepening of the yield curve that they otherwise can’t quite explain    Thank you  I’ll try to be quick  I circulated a memo late last week with   some housekeeping items relating to our foreign currency reserves  Two items were for   information  One item--the renewal of our swap lines with Canada and Mexico--requires action   by the Committee  I think everybody will remember that all of the other swap lines that we had   with the European central banks, the Bank of Japan, and the Bank for International Settlements   were discontinued coincident with the launch of the euro  The two that were retained were with   our NAFTA partners, Canada and Mexico    With the change in Administration, Karen Johnson and I initiated conversations with   Treasury officials to ask them about their view of the swaps and the utility they saw in the swaps    They were very open to the idea of having discussions with their counterparts in Mexico and   Canada to see whether they could perhaps be cajoled into viewing the swaps in the same way   that many people here and some at the Treasury do--namely, that perhaps they have outlived   their usefulness  The Mexicans in particular have some difficulties with ending the swaps this   year, although in principle they were open to the idea that the day may soon come when the swap   arrangements are no longer needed  The Canadians are still having some internal discussions   about the swap issue, but I think there’s a good chance that they may come around to that view   as well  So it seems that some more discussion is needed until everybody agrees  I think we   may be close, with “close” measured in months rather than weeks  So we may be there soon    Karen, do you want to add anything?    I don’t want to make a forecast  In part it may depend on how quickly the   Mexicans can negotiate a CCL with the IMF, and that’s very difficult to judge  The Canadians   need to have their own discussion  So again, I wouldn’t make a forecast in terms of weeks; I   think it may take longer than that  But I believe we all three--ourselves, the Canadians, and the   Mexicans--are on the same plane in that the time has come or will soon come to end the swaps     "
6602,2001-06-26," I’ll be referring to the package of colored charts that was  distributed this afternoon1   US short-term interest rates have continued to decline during the  intermeeting period, reflecting weaker-than-expected economic data and  weak corporate earnings reports Three-month cash rates fell 33 basis  points since the last meeting and 3-month forward rates declined 31 basis  points The 3-month deposit rate nine months forward, the yellow line, has  also fallen by a similar amount, but it continues to imply higher interest  rates for the first half of 2002, although I should add that anecdotal  conversations find few people who go along with that expectation  The  exception is the minority of market participants who believe that a sharp  recovery will manifest itself in the second half    In the middle panel, the euro-area cash rates have been stable since the  Committee’s last meeting  But the 3-month and 9-month forward rates  have been pulled down, as data have come in weaker for the euro area as a  whole and for Germany in particular     In the bottom panel are three snapshots of the Japanese government  yield curve from three months out to ten years  The three snapshot dates  were March 1st, a few weeks before the change in the Bank of Japan’s  operational target, May 15th, and June 25th At first, the bill sector was  bumping up against the zero axis, but now the short end of the coupon  curve is also being dragged down And as we speak, all Japanese  government bond maturities out to three years yield 14 basis points or less   On the next page is an update of a chart that you last saw at the March  meeting  The chart depicts the shape of the yield curve at the short end in  the major economies  The top panel shows the 2-year yield less the central  bank’s short-term policy rate  The bottom panel shows the 2-year swap rate  less the same policy rate  I should note that the policy rates used involve  slightly different maturities; some central banks have an overnight rate,  some a rate with a maturity of as long as two weeks  And the top panel  uses the German 2-year note versus the ECB’s refinancing rate  The  bottom panel uses the euro 2-year swap rate  Whether measured against the  2-year note or the swap rate, we observe fairly sharp inversions by year-end  2000 Since the easings of the past few months by the central banks of the   1 Copies of the charts are appended to this transcript  (Appendix 1)     6/26-27/01 2   United States, the euro area, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Japan, the  degree of inversions has lessened, or in some cases turned slightly positive  In the last few weeks, though, some yield curves have reinverted or seem  headed in that direction   Turning to the next page, the top panel depicts the 2-year, 10-year, and  30-year US Treasury yields since March 1st  Unlike the flat or inverted  short end of the curve, the coupon curve is steep  The 2- to 30-year spread  has widened another 5 basis points since the last Committee meeting to  about 166 basis points today The middle panel shows spreads of 10-year  A-rated industrial bonds, the 10-year Fannie Mae benchmark, and the 10­ year swap rate over Treasuries  The spreads, which had been narrowing all  year despite the strong pace of new issues and poor news from the corporate  sector, have begun to widen out ever so slightly in the past couple of weeks   In the bottom panel, we see the same kind of pattern with respect to the  Merrill Lynch high-yield index and the EMBI+ spreads  Again, most of  that widening has occurred in the past couple of weeks     Now, given the large amount of issuance by the corporate sector,  perhaps it’s not surprising that the market is digesting somewhat and that  spreads are backing up a bit An alternative hypothesis suggests that a bit  of risk aversion might be setting in, as some market participants may be  having second thoughts about the appropriate level of spreads if the timing  of the recovery is being pushed out   The top panel of the next page has the major US equity indices  indexed to April 17th, the day before the FOMC’s intermeeting move  As  we can see, equities appreciated sharply in the weeks after that move, then  went sideways for a while, but actually have fallen from their late-May  levels by between 5 and 10 percent, as corporate earnings  preannouncements have been largely negative   The middle panel shows a similar, if more pronounced, pattern to the  downside for major foreign indices  And, in fact, today European markets  were down another 2 percent on average  Perhaps there, too, we’re  witnessing some signs of risk aversion over the past few weeks, as  corporate and economic forecasts were being revised down  However, if  we saw pronounced risk aversion, then we might also expect to see an  uptick in implied volatilities on equity indices  But as the bottom panel  shows, the implied volatility on the S&P 100 futures, also known as the  VIX Index, has actually been trending lower and the absolute level is  toward the lower end of its observed historical range     Turning to the next page, let me say a word on the euro-dollar  exchange rate The top panel depicts that rate since the launch of the euro  in January of 1999 The middle panel charts the differentials between the     6/26-27/01 3   US and euro rates for 3-month deposits, the 2-year swap, and the 10-year  swap We observe the sharp narrowing during that time in the euro’s favor   But I would note that the 10-year swap spread stopped narrowing in  January, just as the latest bout of euro weakness reasserted itself, and that  spread still favors the dollar by about 60 basis points   The bottom panel has 1- and 12-month implied volatilities of the euro- dollar exchange rate for that same period  I would make two points  First,  volatilities have drifted higher for almost the whole two-year period after  the euro’s launch, as the euro depreciated and as most traders and analysts  were certain that the euro would and should rise  Second, volatilities have  actually been falling during this most recent period of euro weakness  The  bearish view accounting for this change in behavior is that the market is no  longer fighting euro weakness and has become comfortable with the euro  trading in the mid- to high 80s  The bullish view is that perhaps positions  that needed to be insured by options have been reduced Now, if the  weaker longs are out and hence the overhang of long euro positions has  been flushed out of the market, then ironically that may suggest that the  euro might finally begin to rise  Time will tell   Turning to the last page and a word about reserves, the top panel  graphs our forecast for currency growth for the rest of 2001  As of the May  FOMC meeting, we were still forecasting 5 percent currency growth for the  remainder of 2001, consistent with the relatively slow growth we saw in  2000 Since that meeting we have adjusted expected currency growth to 7  percent to reflect the faster growth observed in the most recent months and  also our anticipation that currency growth may revert toward the pace that  we had seen before last year   The bottom panel shows the implications of this change for our  operations This chart is an updated version of one you saw at the last  meeting, outlining the expected net growth of SOMA, shown by the blue  bars, and our total purchases of securities required to offset redemptions--if  the entire need were met by outright purchases--shown by the gray bars   We at the Desk expect to rely mostly on outright purchases to meet these  reserve needs, but I am a little reluctant to rely solely on outright purchases  given our already hefty presence in the market  To some degree we will  benefit, though very slightly, from the Treasury’s introduction of a four- week Treasury bill, which is expected in mid-July or August  We plan to  participate in the auctions for those bills and we will also look to expand  modestly the long-term repo book, which has been at $12 billion recently     Let me mention two other items if I may, Mr Chairman  Two memos  were circulated to the Committee last week The first is a note regarding a  technical adjustment to our collateral pool as it relates to Sallie Mae debt   The second memo, from Don Kohn and myself, provided an update on the     6/26-27/01 4   work that’s being done on the SOMA assets study and I’d like to make two  points about that second memo  First, there is a group of people  researching the possibility of adding Ginnie Mae debt to the list of assets  that we buy, and we hope to provide an update on that issue at the August  meeting of this Committee  There was also a typo in the cover note that I  wanted to correct Second, with respect to municipal debt and foreign  sovereign debt, as the memo indicates, we have looked at both possibilities   The municipal debt does not seem to show promise for our operational  needs, while the foreign sovereign debt has some potential  We would like  to explore the latter possibility further, but at the same time--with the  Committee’s concurrence--cease further work on municipal debt     Mr Chairman, there were no foreign operations in this period  I will  need a vote to ratify our domestic operations  And I’d be happy to answer  any questions   Not explicitly Some noise may be created so it may have some effect    But we think it’s likely to be very small, or at least that’s the assumption embedded in the   forecast   It’s possible that we may see that effect, but it’s very hard to measure and   to forecast so we have not really included it in our projections  Sandy, do you have anything to   add?   If that did happen, that would make the Desk’s burden even bigger   That’s right  I’m not familiar with the seasonal characteristics of this   index, but the pattern we have seen is that it tends to run between the low 20s--perhaps the high   teens--and the low 40s So on an absolute level, it’s fairly low, and I think it’s interesting to note   that the trend has been heading downward  I don’t want to make too much of it, but if one were   thinking that risk aversion was setting in, one might point to this as an indicator going the other   way   Again, there may be some seasonal there  I don’t know that it’s so   pronounced that it would affect the index in a meaningful way  "
6629,2001-08-21," Thank you, Mr Chairman  I will be referring to the  charts that were distributed at your places earlier this morning 1        The first chart depicts the standard 3-month cash and forward  deposit rates from early April through last Friday  As you can see, US  short-term rates continued to decline over the recent intermeeting  interval Weak corporate earnings, layoff announcements, and a Beige  Book that was perceived as downbeat were among many other factors  that affected sentiment during the period  Three-month cash and  forward rates declined by about 20 basis points over the period  Nine- month forward rates rose immediately after the June FOMC meeting  but then declined quickly and on balance fell about 35 basis points for  the period as a whole While the 9-month forward rate may suggest  that the market is building toward a tightening later in 2002, as perhaps  does the Eurodollar future strip, other indicators such as the   2-year  note are more ambiguous--a subject I’ll talk about later        In the euro area, cash rates have been stable since the last meeting,  but 3-month and 9-month forward rates have continued to be pulled  lower, by 16 and 21 basis points respectively  Forecasts for the euro- area economy have been trimmed and the market is cautiously building  in some additional easing, with many market participants expecting 25  basis points of ease at the end of this month  The largest changes in  rates occurred on August 8th and 9th after the Beige Book was released  here and the ECB’s monthly report, which was viewed as paving the  way for an ease in policy, was released in Europe         The bottom panel shows the Japanese government yield curve from  3 months out to 10 years  I’ve highlighted three snapshots coinciding  with the last two FOMC meeting dates and this past Friday, ahead of  the current meeting  The short end of the curve is below 20 basis points   1 The charts used by Mr Kos are appended to this transcript     8/21/01 2   out to 3 years, but the longer end of the curve has proved more resistant  to further prodding by the Bank of Japan The announcement by the  Bank of Japan on August 14th that it would increase its current account  balance target from 5 trillion to 6 trillion and also raise the pace of JGB  purchases has not noticeably affected the yield curve In fact, the  longer end of the curve is actually higher than it was on June 26th         Turning to page 2, I’ve provided a snapshot of asset prices in US  markets  All three markets--the fixed income, equity, and foreign  exchange markets--reflect a continually shifting sentiment and are  discounting a weaker outlook The top panel shows the 2-, 10-, and 30- year yields along with the fed funds target since April 1st The entire  curve has shifted lower and the 2- to 30-year spread has steepened by  another 10 basis points, from about 166 basis points at the time of the  last meeting to about 176 basis points at the close yesterday           I would make two points  First, benchmark long-term rates have  come down quite a bit in the last seven weeks  The 10-year is down  about 40 basis points and the 30-year is down somewhat less, by about  20 basis points Second, the 2-year note traded as low as 364 percent  during this period, the lowest rate since the 2-year note began to be  regularly auctioned in 1976 By way of comparison, during 1992 and  1993, when the funds rate was at 3 percent for an extended period of  time, the 2-year rate never fell below 366 percent  Given the  sensitivity of the 2-year note to the funds rate, if the markets were  building toward a tightening at some point--as suggested by the  Eurodollar futures and the forward rate agreements--then one might  have expected the 2-year note yield to be higher than it is now  So, its  behavior at least raises questions about the signals being given by some  of those other indicators         In the middle panel I’ve plotted the major US stock indices  indexed to 100 on April 1st, which also coincides roughly with their  lows for 2001 As reflected in the chart, those indices rose through  much of the spring but have been coming down--and have continued to  come down in the intermeeting period--as the market has adjusted to  the weaker outlook         The bottom panel shows changes in the trade-weighted value of the  dollar against other major currencies  The dollar has declined modestly  on a trade-weighted basis, but that masks sharper declines against some  of the major currencies, especially the yen, the euro, the Swiss franc,  and even some other currencies such as the Singapore dollar that have  been used as funding currencies in so-called carry trades  In part the  decline is probably due to perceptions about the recovery; in part it may  reflect some risk aversion  As economic activity seems to be slowing     8/21/01 3   globally, a little risk aversion may lead to a closing out of some carry  trades And finally, some of the ongoing chatter in markets about the  Administration’s posture toward the dollar may also be a contributing  factor         Turning to the third page, the top panel depicts the major European  equity indices, also going back to early April  They show a similar  pattern to that in US markets except that the decline has been more  dramatic for European equities, especially over the intermeeting period   In that interval most of these major indices fell between 3-1/2 and 10  percent, in part reflecting revisions in forecasts for growth as well as  weak earnings Interestingly, though, the euro actually had one of its  sharpest rallies since its launch, moving from about 85 cents to almost  92 cents during this period for reasons that are not fully clear, given  some of the news that was coming out of Europe  One explanation  might be that interest rate differentials are finally biting  Those interest  rates have been narrowing for almost two years in favor of the euro   The bottom panel shows the differentials between dollar and euro swap  rates These spreads continue to decline modestly but are still slightly  in favor of the dollar         Turning to the next page, the top panel depicts the dollar-yen  exchange rate A couple of noteworthy events have taken place in  Japan since the last FOMC meeting First, the Upper House elections  were held and the LDP and Prime Minister Koizumi did quite well--an  outcome that is expected to accelerate structural reforms in Japan   Second, on August 14th the BOJ announced changes in its operational  targets, as I noted earlier That combination would have been expected  to produce a weakening in the yen and a lift to the equity markets  In  the event, the yen actually has appreciated from about 125 to below 120  this morning and equity prices have continued their decline, as reflected  in the middle panel  The reasons for the yen’s appreciation are not  fully obvious Repatriation and the approach of the end of the fiscal  half-year have been mentioned yet again  Another possibility is that  there may be some risk aversion kicking in that is causing some of the  short yen trades to be unwound But it’s not immediately apparent why  the yen would be appreciating in this kind of environment   As I mentioned, Japanese equities have continued to decline with  only a brief interruption after the Upper House elections and the BOJ’s  operational changes The Nikkei, which was over 13,000 at the time of  the last FOMC meeting is now below 12,000 and at its lowest level  since 1984 The Topix Bank sub-index has also been falling again,  reflecting renewed doubts about the health of the Japanese banking  system  As the bottom panel shows, that sub-index is actually lower  now than it was during the 1998 banking crisis in Japan     8/21/01 4        Turning to the last page, the chart shows monthly growth rates,  seasonally adjusted, for currency during 2001 As you can see, we’ve  had elevated currency growth in July and also in August  Most of that  is attributed to cash shipments overseas, primarily to Argentina  The  growth of currency has been running at roughly double the rates  observed earlier this year, translating into deepening reserve needs over  the past intermeeting period  Those deeper needs were met primarily  by an expansion of the permanent SOMA portfolio and by a modest  increase in the amount of long-term RPs outstanding           Mr Chairman, there were no foreign exchange operations during  the intermeeting period, but I will need a vote to ratify the domestic  operations And I will be happy to take any questions  "
6689,2001-10-02," Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the   charts with the salmon cover that were distributed to you1  I will   break up my remarks into two parts  First, I will talk about general   market developments, especially since September 11th, and then I’ll   say a little about our operations in the aftermath of the attacks    The first chart shows short-term deposit rates for the United   States, the euro area, and Japan US short-term rates continued to   decline during the intermeeting period  Both cash and forward rates   had been declining even before September 11th, and the fall in those   rates accelerated in the days following  Cash rates declined after the   Committee’s September 17th reduction in the target fed funds rate,   though the 9-month forward rate barely moved, apparently reflecting   the lingering expectation among some market participants that rates   will be reversing course some time next year    As shown in the middle panel, euro-area rates followed a   similar pattern of heading downward gradually even before   September 11th And on September 17th the ECB reduced rates by 50   basis points several hours after the FOMC’s policy announcement    The Bank of Canada, the Swiss National Bank, and several other   central banks cut their rates as well    As you can see in the bottom panel, Japanese rates continued to   scrape along near zero Late on September 17th our time, early on the   18th in Tokyo, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) announced another so-called   easing of policy when it stated that its current account balances would   be targeted at above 6 trillion yen as opposed to the 6 trillion target it   had indicated previously In the days that followed, that balance grew   and by the last days of the quarter it rose to more than 12 trillion yen    By today, it had eased a bit to 103 trillion yen, still significantly   above the earlier 6 trillion target  Interestingly, forward rates actually    1 Copies of the charts are reproduced in the Appendix     10/2/01 2   ticked up a bit and the Japanese government bond (JGB) yield curve  was little changed after the announcement, suggesting to some that  the BOJ’s tweaks in the past few months had ceased to have an  impact on rates beyond the very short end of the coupon curve   The top panel on page 2 graphs the 2-year, 10-year, and 30-year  Treasury yields along with the target fed funds rate since August 1st  Two-year rates declined, beneficiaries of policy easing, a weak equity  market, and general risk aversion  The curve steepened to 255 basis  points from about 165 basis points at the time of the last meeting   The 10-year yield declined 32 basis points, while the 30-year fell a  more modest 6 basis points  Some market participants explained the  restrained move in 30-year yields as reflecting nascent inflationary  risks, while others attributed the price action to the canceled  September buybacks and the generally revised fiscal stance that  would lead to far higher Treasury supplies than had been anticipated  previously   The steepening trend observed in the U S Treasury yield curve  has also been seen in yields abroad, as reflected in the middle panel   The 2- to 10-year Bund spread moved almost in lockstep with  movements in our curve  And even the Japanese 2- to 10-year spread  steepened ever so slightly, primarily due to a shift in the 10-year JGB  yield   In the bottom panel we observe that in some segments of the  bond markets the reaction has varied  Spreads in the investment  grade sector--not seen here--have largely been stable  And in the case  of agencies and swaps, the spreads have actually declined slightly   But spreads on riskier paper have widened  The EMBI+ spread and  the Merrill Lynch high-yield spread both widened after the 11th  These high-yield spreads hit levels last seen on January 2nd, the day  before the FOMC’s first easing move in the cycle  Trading turnover  in emerging markets and on high-yield paper decreased after the  attacks And liquidity conditions deteriorated and have not yet  recovered to normal levels     The three graphs on the next page depict the percentage change  in various equity indices for the third quarter  The US indices are  shown in the top panel, major foreign indices in the middle panel, and  a representative sample of emerging market equity indices in the  bottom panel  Most indices declined between 15 and 30 percent and  nearly all had fallen substantially even before September 11th,  adjusting to downwardly revised growth and profit forecasts  Stocks  of less established companies fared worse than more seasoned  companies  In the United States the percentage decline in the     10/2/01 3   NASDAQ was almost double the fall of the Dow and the S&P   Internationally, emerging markets indices on balance fell somewhat  more than markets in more developed countries   Turning to page 4 and the major currencies in foreign exchange  markets, the dollar actually was little changed as measured by most  trade-weighted indices, but showed considerable variation in bilateral  rates In general, risk aversion was reflected in the appreciation of the  Swiss franc and the yen, in part because of perceptions about their  value as safe havens, and probably more importantly as yen- and  Swiss franc-funded carry trades were unwound  On the other hand,  currencies of countries with large commodity sectors, such as the  Australian dollar, the Canadian dollar, and the New Zealand dollar,  depreciated to near their all-time lows, as did the currencies of  countries such as Brazil, which have large external financing  requirements  While the downgrade in US growth has probably  reduced expected risk-adjusted returns on dollar assets, the  contemporaneous downgrade of overseas prospects may have offset  those adverse effects on the dollar   Turning to the middle panel, the yen had been appreciating  against the dollar since early August  With the retrenchment of risk  appetites, yen-funded carry trades were unwound and Japanese  investors were reportedly repatriating funds before their quarter-end   With the sustained upward pressure on the yen, the Japanese  monetary authorities intervened on September 17th and continued to  intervene in large amounts through this past Friday, the end of the  Japanese fiscal half-year In all, the Japanese monetary authorities  purchased $267 billion and 600 million euros, which the ECB  acquired as agent of behalf of the Bank of Japan  The aggregate  dollar purchases included $200 million which the Desk acquired as  agent for the Japanese on September 27th Within the foreign  exchange market, a major topic of discussion among traders is  whether the Ministry of Finance’s intervention was intended as a  bridge to get Japanese financial institutions through the fiscal half- year-end on September 30th or whether the intervention will persist   If the latter, that would be taken as a signal of a renewed attempt to  jump-start the export sector   As the bottom panel shows, all of the euro’s recent depreciation  occurred in early August Since mid-August, the euro has traded in a  narrow range The currency is perceived as neither a safe haven nor  an asset associated with an economic area that has higher growth  prospects than the United States  Therefore, asset returns are  expected to be no better and no worse than what will be available in  the United States       Turning to the next page, the terrorist attacks triggered an  increase in both observed and implied volatility in most markets, and  these graphs show the volatility of a sample of major asset price  relationships The top panel depicts implied volatility on one-month  euro-dollar and dollar-yen options  Both rose sharply on the 11th and  hit highs of about 14-1/2 percent on September 17th, the day that the  Committee and other central banks eased policy, but declined in  subsequent days These volatility levels, though sharply higher than  the volatility levels of 10 percent or so in early July, are modest by  historical standards In 1998 the volatility of dollar-yen options  reached a high of nearly 28 percent   The middle panel graphs the implied volatility of the December  Eurodollar contract and the bottom panel graphs the volatility of the  S&P 100, also known as the VIX Both volatility levels roughly  doubled from their levels in late August and both reached highs that  exceeded slightly the highs observed during the 1998 crisis  In the  case of the December Eurodollar contract, the implied volatility  exceeded the 1998 high by quite a bit  While the VIX index has  declined somewhat from its recent highs, its implied volatility and  that of the Eurodollar contract both remained at elevated levels     Turning to the next page, the top panel depicts total Federal  Reserve balances day by day since the last FOMC meeting  With the  disruptions caused by the attacks, the combination of discount  window loans, open market operations, plus autonomous factors  sharply increased balances to as high as $121 billion on September  13th Despite the apparent flushness of markets, even allowing for  higher demand for excess reserves, this was deceiving     The inset in the top panel shows balances, both borrowed and  nonborrowed, for the entire banking system for the five days starting  on September 11th The green bar in the inset shows the end-of-day  balances , which was having problems with  its clearing and settlement system  On September 12th, the entire  banking system held about $63 billion of reserves before borrowing    before  discount window borrowing and overdrafts  Distribution of reserves  continued to be a problem until the afternoon of the 14th when    began to make progress in clearing its backlog of  transactions  By early the following week, we began to work down  balances as they started to be distributed more efficiently   10/2/01 4     10/2/01 5   The bottom panel depicts the fed funds rate in the intermeeting  period The green line is the target fed funds rate  The red dots mark  the effective fed funds rate on each day, and the vertical line shows  the high-low range for each day  With four of the five major funds  brokers incapacitated by the attacks, banks largely traded directly  with each other rather than through brokers and they did so at the  target of 3-1/2 percent in something of a “gentlemen’s agreement”   This pattern persisted until late Thursday, September 13th, when the  weight of reserves in the system first began to show through and the  funds rate traded below its target  This pattern of low rates,  especially in later trading, continued in the period after the FOMC’s  intermeeting easing action on September 17th, particularly in light of  the Committee’s statement noting that the funds rate might  occasionally trade below its target  By the 19th the Desk began to  manage its operations with an eye toward restoring a sense of  normalcy in the money market, which had begun to take rates below 2  percent and even 1 percent for granted  Thus we began to nudge the  market back toward the target  In doing so the Desk continued to  balance that objective against the desire to respond to the financing  needs of dealers, but by that time dealers were not experiencing much  trouble getting their funding done through their normal sources   On page 7, the top panel shows three key autonomous factors  that affected reserves during the period  The grounding of air traffic  created an immediate spike in float to about $47 billion on September  13th The ECB’s three swap drawings added almost $20 billion at  their peak Those two factors added more than $60 billion of reserves  on that day Meanwhile, a near doubling of the repo pool drained  reserves  On balance, these factors added reserves during the first  few days of the crisis and thus reduced what might have been even  more traffic at the discount window on several days  By the week of  September 17th float declined and the foreign exchange swaps  matured but the repo pool remained elevated, in part because of the  large number of fails in the securities markets, and that was leaving  central banks with extra cash at the end of the day  There was also an  apparent desire for higher levels of liquidity, and in the case of  Japan’s Ministry of Finance the need to invest large amounts of  intervention proceeds   The middle panel depicts the mix of overnight and term  repurchase agreements used to manage reserves  We had no  operations on September 11th At first we relied on overnight RPs to  add liquidity and allowed several long-term RPs to mature without  replacement  When markets started working better, we increased the  level of long-term RPs to help meet underlying needs     10/2/01 6   The bottom panel shows for short-term RPs the level of  accepted propositions in red and the level of rejected propositions in  blue Normally, dealers submit a large number of propositions of  which we accept a relatively small amount  For four business days,  from the 12th through the 17th, our operations were driven by the  demand for financing rather than by reserve levels associated with a  given funds rate To better meet these demands, we operated later in  the day than normal, after dealers had an opportunity to assess their  financing needs Then for a couple of days, on September 18th and  19th, we accepted virtually all dealer propositions on our overnight  RPs This was done not so much directly to meet their demands but  to provide the level of reserves that was needed given that  autonomous factors, especially the repo pool, were draining reserves   After we arranged several long-term RPs that settled on the 20th, the  volume of our short-term RPs declined and the volume of accepted  propositions was just a fraction of total propositions     Turning to the last page, I want to give you a quick update on  our securities lending operations during the intermeeting period  On a  normal day, the Desk lends out a handful of securities from SOMA--  normally totaling less than $2 billion and frequently less than $500  million  With the disruptions caused by the attacks, not only to the  Bank of New York but to several major inter-dealer brokers and some  large dealers themselves, the number of fails rose dramatically  With  the flow of securities from usual sources disrupted or scaled back,  demand for SOMA securities rose despite our rather high pricing  structure We lent out about $10 billion on September 11th,  representing 70 different issues, and smaller though still high amounts  in the days following Volumes rose again last week in the run-up to  the quarter-end and remained high yesterday  Fails began to rise last  week for the 2-, 5-, and 10-year on-the-run securities for reasons that  are not fully clear  The dollar volume of our lending increased  beyond $10 billion, although the number of issues was less than on  the 11th, again because the number of fails was concentrated in the  small numbers of on-the-run issues     I want to make one final observation  On September 19th, the  very small volume of lending did not imply tranquility on that day   With the funds rate trading soft, the rate for general collateral fell  below 1 percent in the repo market  Since the Committee’s  authorization permits us to lend securities at a minimum of 1 percent,  the formula implied a negative financing rate  Hence it was cheaper  for dealers to fail and pay the near zero fails rate than to borrow from  the Desk, pay our higher price, and complete settlement  In  reviewing the securities lending facility in coming months, one aspect  that we plan to study is the pricing structure  In a low interest rate     10/2/01 7   environment, the general collateral rate could be susceptible to  occasional declines below 1 percent, thus making it difficult for our  securities lending program to meet its objectives   Mr Chairman, there were no foreign exchange operations   during the period I will need a vote to ratify the domestic operations   and I’d be happy to take any questions    Securities lending volume?   We did a bit over $10 billion yesterday   That’s right Apparently the volume of fails is still at a very high   level   There are almost as many explanations as there are market   participants It is an issue that the market is struggling with, though  But they’re still--  In answering, let me try to package those questions together  I   don’t think we viewed the target funds rate as a floor  What we were trying to do was   return to some sense of normalcy in the functioning of the market  The low rate itself   was creating problems  There were problems for investors  For example, money market   funds had trouble investing money; there were complaints from investors who could not   get banks to take their money  These and other problems were being created by the very   low funds rate and those issues had to be considered  What we also tried to do was to   leave the market with enough liquidity, but there was a sense that if the rate remained too   low for too long, some of these unintended adverse affects would continue   If you look at the bottom of page 7, you can see that for several days beyond   September 17th we were basically accepting all the propositions that the dealers were   giving us We were trying to respond to the financing demands from the dealers  And   even in the subsequent period, once we got past the 19th and 20th or so, there were days   when we tried to respond to the financing needs of the dealers even though it wasn’t   necessary for reserve purposes One of the ways we did that was by having the Treasury   increase its balance That way we could respond by providing the dealers with more   financing than might have been dictated by the numbers  So my message is that we   really did not view the funds target as a floor  A lot of the trading was below the target   rate but there were days, especially in the mornings, when the rate was firm  That often   reflected efforts by European banks in particular to get their financing done early in the   day So we got a pattern with the rate firm in early-day activity and lower in reduced   trading at the end of the day     I don’t know if I answered your questions     10/2/01 10   Yes, I think that’s an important point  A large part of that market   was in effect bottled up     10/2/01 11   That’s a good question and one that doesn’t have an easy answer    In my own view, the shift is not so much an indication that people view inflationary risks   as imminent or that they have very strong expectations of future inflation  I think it   reflects more a concern about the fiscal side, given the talk of stimulus coming out of   Congress, the cancellation of the Treasury’s buyback program, and the prospect for lower   federal revenues In the New York Times or one of the major papers yesterday there was   an article saying that perhaps we’ll have a fiscal deficit  So the fiscal outlook has really   changed Now, the short end of the curve will tend to follow policy, or at least it has so   far But the long end is where the Treasury has been especially active with the buyback        10/2/01 14   program and that’s where we might see concerns or a shift in expectations about the   fiscal side   I’ll work on it! [Laughter]  "
6712,2001-11-06," Thank you, Mr Chairman I will be referring to the charts that were handed   out this morning  1/   The top panel of the first page depicts US and euro-area cash and   forward rates US 3-month cash rates, the solid red line, declined about 1/4   percent since the last meeting, while 3-month and 9-month forward rates   declined by similar magnitudes as the string of data released reinforced   expectations that policy rates would continue to be reduced  In the euro area,   cash rates fell about 12 basis points but 9-month forward rates fell by more than   1/4 percentage point, widening the spread between cash and forward rates  The   rate movements reflected reactions to weak data for the euro area as well as   heightened expectations that the total amount of easing to come from the ECB   would be larger than had been previously anticipated    This morning’s two-week refinancing operation by the ECB was   under-subscribed by about 25 billion euros and the operation actually drained 23   billion euros, as banks expecting to be able to buy cheaper funds after this   Thursday’s ECB meeting did not have much demand for 2-week money    Overnight rates moved to about 4 percent after the operation’s results were   announced      The bottom panel provides three snapshots of the Japanese yield   curve in 2001--for February 28th, August 14th, and November 2nd Broadly   speaking, the curve continues to exhibit a very flat trajectory out to three years   and then steepens for maturities beyond that out to 30 years  Rates at the very   long end have stayed near 25 percent, reflecting both a premium for the longer   maturity and the lesser market liquidity of bonds beyond 10 years  But the long   rates perhaps also reflect worries about the prospect of significant government   debt issuance, which may be necessary to finance a cleanup of the banking  sector    1/ Charts used by Mr Kos are appended to this transcript     11/6/01 2   Staying with the Japanese markets for a bit on page two, the top panel  shows the 5-year Japanese government bond (JGB) yield and the 5-year yen  swap rate since January 2000 The middle panel depicts the 10-year JGB and  swap rates for the same period  In both, the spread between the swap rate and  the JGB yield trended near 25 basis points in early 2000, then began to narrow in  late 2000 and early 2001 as yields started to fall and rates at the short end  approached zero By the summer, the 10-year differential went to zero and was  even negative on some days  The 5-year differential narrowed a bit later and is  now also near zero So bank obligations in a country with known banking  problems are being priced as substitutes for government credit  One  interpretation would suggest that the market is already presuming that Japanese  bank risk is sovereign risk  Another explanation can be found by looking at the  flows that are creating this relationship  Japanese banks have been very large  buyers of 5- and 10-year swaps That is, they are receiving a long-term fixed  rate and paying a short-term floating rate, which lately has been near zero  That  is functionally similar to buying a JGB and financing it in the short-term repo  market  The sellers of these swaps reportedly have been foreign commercial and  investment banks  Japanese banks have added to their swap positions rather than  purchasing more JGBs because of a preferential accounting treatment   With small probabilities that short rates will move higher any time  soon, the situation probably does not pose near-term concerns  But Japanese  banks do have a stake in spreads staying tight and, given that the banks are also  large holders of JGBs, in rates remaining low  Ergo, one quickly gets into the  circular logic of the situation The possible need to clean up bank balance sheets  may force the government to issue more bonds to finance that endeavor, which in  turn will raise yields and inflict losses on banks holding large JGB positions and  large swap positions as well   As for the markets’ views on the state of Japanese banks, the bottom  panel graphs the Tokyo stock exchange composite index and the bank sub-index   Both are down substantially since January of 2000  Interestingly, the bank sub- index has had its greatest underperformance in the last 12 months, precisely  during the time that swap spreads began to narrow   As we go through the next three pages of charts, I will briefly review a  number of asset price relationships in major markets in the eight weeks since  September 11th The top panel of page three indexes the dollar’s exchange rate  against the euro, the yen, and the Swiss franc since August 1st  Despite the weak  data on the US economy, the dollar is back to levels where it traded in mid- August, having recovered from the post-September 11 losses against both the  yen and the euro It is still somewhat lower against the Swiss franc  The middle  panel graphs implied volatilities, which have continued to come down to around  10 percent, compared to 12 percent in mid-August and 14 percent in mid- September     11/6/01 3   Another vantage point into the seeming tranquility of the foreign  exchange market is through risk reversals  This is an options trade that reflects  whether market participants are willing to pay an added premium for protection  against the risk of a rising dollar, in which case dollar calls are expensive relative  to dollar puts Alternatively, in the case of trying to protect against the risk of a  falling dollar, dollar puts are favored   Immediately after September11th the marketplace bid up dollar puts,  but since then this indicator--quite unusually--has moved to absolute neutrality  for all three major currency pairs  The optimistic view is that market participants  believe that exchange rates have achieved something of a sustainable  equilibrium  Probably the more plausible explanation is that there is a lack of  conviction among traders about the likely course of exchange rates  That  hypothesis is also supported by anecdotal evidence in that there has been a  pulling back of risk-taking in the foreign exchange market   On page four, the top panel depicts a number of the major global  equity indices since August 1st, but re-indexed to their closing levels on  September 10th In general, the major indices have moved in a correlated fashion  back to pre-attack levels   The middle panel graphs selected major emerging market indices   With the exception of the Argentine Merval index, most have recovered but not  as much as the indices of developed country markets  There appears to have  been more discrimination among emerging markets and between emerging and  developed markets  Unlike the calm prevailing in the foreign exchange markets  and despite the recovery of stock prices, implied volatility--at least as measured  by the VIX in the bottom panel--has gone sideways at between 30 and 35 percent  since the last meeting, but it is still somewhat elevated relative to historical  patterns   As shown on page five, spread relationships in fixed-income markets  tell a similar story  Spreads continued to widen on higher risk assets, such as  debt of emerging markets, as seen in the top panel  The high-yield spread has  stayed relatively flat since the last meeting, but it has also remained at elevated  levels despite the rally in equity markets  In contrast, spreads have actually  narrowed for better quality obligations, such as agencies and swaps   Interestingly, the rising tide did not lift all boats in the investment-grade  corporate sector The spread in A2 corporate issues widened slightly  But even  there, one needs to consider that absolute yields for A2 paper declined modestly   Moreover, the market absorbed a massive amount of supply, including that  coming from several issuers who were refinancing maturing commercial paper  and willing to pay the premium spread in order to get the deals done  Finally, at  the short end, the implied volatility on near-term Eurodollar contracts has again  been rising recently, pointing to some lingering uncertainty at the short end     11/6/01 4   Turning back to the government yield curve, the top panel of page six  depicts the benchmark on-the-run issues in yield terms along with the target fed  funds rate since August 1st Until the middle of last week the pattern of recent  months persisted, with gradually falling yields--especially at the short end--and  thereby a steepening of the yield curve  The Treasury’s refunding announcement  last Wednesday, which included plans to revise the buyback program and to  suspend issuance of the 30-year bond, surprised the market in its timing and for  that matter also surprised the Treasury in the extent of the market reaction  Yields fell sharply on Wednesday and Thursday as traders rushed to close out  short positions in their trades, whereby they had been long the 2-year note or  similar duration paper and short the 30-year bond  By this morning the long  bond yield was at 486 percent or almost 40 basis points lower than the closing  yield on the day before the Treasury’s announcement   The bottom panel depicts yield curves for A2 industrial corporate  bonds, Fannie Maes, swaps, and Treasuries as of September 10th and as of  November 2nd In general, the pattern observed in the Treasury yield curve has  spilled over to the other curves as well  Since September 10th, interest rates are  generally lower and yield curves are steeper   Moving to the commercial paper market, the theme there is that the  year-end has come early to that market The top left panel graphs the spread  between 30-day A1/P1-rated paper and A2/P2 around year-end for three recent  years The 1997-98 period, in blue, was typical of many years until very  recently  The black line depicts last year’s sharply widening spread and the red  line represents the current spread    The top right panel shows the same set of relationships for 90-day  paper The trends are similar, though last year’s widening began later and the  size of the widening probably was influenced by the suddenness with which the  California utilities had difficulty rolling over their commercial paper  This  year’s widening began soon after the events of September 11th The  downgrading of several corporations has reportedly made some managers  unwilling to hold A2/P2 paper at year-end for window-dressing reasons, but  many other fund managers have become unwilling to hold any A2/P2 paper  under any circumstances  The wider spreads have been necessary to draw in new  buyers, such as European institutions, to pick up the slack  Still, the A2/P2  sector has contracted by nearly 50 percent this year in terms of the amount  outstanding   The bottom panel shows the spread of 90-day A1/P1 commercial  paper to 3-month Treasury bills on the left and A2/P2 paper relative to 3-month  Treasury bills on the right These two graphs indicate that the widening of the  A2/P2 spread, at least so far, is strictly a matter of deterioration in the A2/P2  sector Of note is how well the A1/P1 sector is holding up, with issuers able to  sell paper at a cost of only 10 basis points or so more than Treasuries     11/6/01 5   Finally, the last page depicts the relationship between the rate for   general collateral (GC) in the repo market, the so-called “specials rate” for on-  the-run securities, and the incidence of fails to deliver  The top panel graphs the   GC rate in blue and the 5-year specials rate--that is, the rate to finance the on-  the-run 5-year security--in green  The gray bars at the bottom represent the   volume of fails reported by primary dealers for that security  The interest rates   are all daily, while the volume of fails is collected weekly; the number represents   the volume of fails on the reporting date      The bottom panel has the same set of information for the 10-year note    The specials rate can be volatile from day to day, as dealer financing needs   change The upper boundary is the GC rate, which roughly tends to track the fed   funds rate The lower boundary is zero When a security is very scarce, the cost   of financing that security can fall to or near zero  But if dealers who are short the   issue cannot borrow the paper, a fail will result  More cynically, a dealer can go   short the issue and not deliver, knowing that with the specials rate so low there is   almost no financial penalty to the fail      While the fail situation in the aftermath of September 11th garnered a   lot of attention and was extraordinary in its size, securities at times do go on   special for extended periods of time, so a spike in the volume of fails is not that  unusual For example, as seen in the bottom panel, in May of 2001 the scarcity   of the 10-year issue led to a surge of fails until the May refunding was   completed      I want to make two points here  First, as short-term rates have come  down, the GC rate has come down as well  Second, the amount of elbowroom  for the specials market to move around has decreased  The rate doesn’t have to   move very far from the GC rate to get to zero and create a situation that can lead   to a rise in fails  Thus, even without future incidents of the kind seen on   September 11th, in a low interest rate environment there is the risk of more   instances where fails accumulate, at least for short periods of time      Mr Chairman, there were no foreign exchange operations in the   intermeeting period  The temporary swap facilities with the ECB and the Bank   of England both expired without being renewed in mid-October, and the amount   of the swap facility with the Bank of Canada reverted to its normal size      I will need a vote to ratify domestic operations, and I’d be happy to   take any questions    I don’t think so The cash market continued to function normally  There did   not seem to be a spillover into the cash market  That might have occurred if the on-the-run/off-the-  run spreads had widened, but we did not see that  The problem remained a back office problem that   did not spill over into the front office  Of course, there is the risk that that might happen at some   point but thus far it has been contained to the back office   That’s right   I think it’s the risk that I mentioned--that if the back office gets clogged up,   then it affects how the traders behave   I can’t think of an instance when it has  In 1998 we had a different situation   where liquidity was an issue, and on-the-run/off-the-run spreads widened then  But I can’t think of   an instance where we had that kind of spillover problem because of fails  Again, that was a risk that   the Treasury was contending with, and I think it is the reason they made the decision that they did   There’s a preferential accounting treatment for swaps relative to JGBs; the   latter go on their balance sheets   In part I think for reasons related to capital  Also, a bank may be influenced   by not wanting to balloon its balance sheet, which is published  The Japanese accounting authorities   are looking at changing that preferential treatment because the Japanese banks are using it as a   loophole The swap is designed to be what they call a macro hedge--that is, it is designed to hedge   assets--and it can be excluded from the balance sheet  However, as the Japanese accounting   authorities see it, the banks are using these swaps to hedge liabilities, which more or less turns the   intent of the rules on its head So the accounting authorities have been looking at this and thinking   about whether to close that loophole There is some pressure on them to continue to keep that   loophole open, and I think the banks are waiting to see how the Japanese accounting bodies will rule   Well, in terms of how the markets are functioning, I think they are functioning   fine In terms of how market participants are discriminating among risks, I would have no reason to   second-guess the assessments they are making  They seem to be putting in a greater risk premium   on high-yield assets and on debt of emerging markets  So, to the extent that they are viewing the   economic outlook as being weaker than had been the case, they are putting in a higher risk premium   to those kinds of assets, which seems to be rational   I don’t recall that there has been any meaningful widening of bid-ask spreads   in the fixed income markets  And the on-the-run/off-the-run spread has not moved very much  So   those indicators are not pointing to problems with the functioning of the markets  "
6737,2001-12-11," Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the charts that   were distributed to you this morning 1    The top panel on the first page shows US and euro-area cash and forward   rates The 3-month US dollar deposit rate, the solid red line, is little changed   since your last meeting and as you can see the 3-month forward rate largely   tracked the cash rate  But the 3-month deposit rate 9 months forward, the red   line with narrow dashes, reflects the volatility of expectations in the past month    First, the 9-month forward rate moved upward after release of the stronger than   expected retail sales report on November 14th Then it declined about 1/2   percentage point after the November 27th Michigan Confidence report was   weaker than expected and comments by Governor Meyer were perceived as   keeping the door open for a further easing of policy  Subsequently, on   December 5th, that rate rose again after the nonmanufacturing NAPM index--an   indicator that generally receives little notice--rose sharply and heightened   expectations for a near-term recovery  Friday’s weak employment report did   not alter the optimism that is built into forward rates  That leaves the market in   a somewhat unusual position of having priced in a bit more ease in the near   term--indeed 22 out of 24 primary dealers expect an easing at this meeting--but     then an aggressive tightening beginning sometime in the second half of 2002       1 The charts used by Mr Kos are appended to this transcript     12/11/01 2    In the euro area the ECB reduced policy rates by 50 basis points on  November 8th, two days after the FOMC action, and cash rates--shown in the  solid green line--have been stable since then  Forward rates fluctuated mostly  in response to US data On balance, the market expects that short-term rates  probably will decline by another 25 to 50 basis points over the next few months     As you can see in the bottom panel, interest rates in Japan remain very  low The discussion in Japanese financial circles is about what further steps the  Bank of Japan (BOJ) can take to make policy even more accommodative  So  one might ask why forward rates are beginning to drift higher  The answer is  not fully clear Certainly, there is no expectation that the BOJ will abandon its  zero interest rate policy any time soon  One possibility--and I stress it’s only a  possibility--is that forward rate agreements, which are obligations of banks, are  beginning to reflect a credit risk premium that is not showing up, at least not  yet, in other money market instruments     Turning to page 2, the charts on the top half of the page depict the  volatility of Treasury yields over the past 45 days  The top left panel graphs the  2-year yield along with the target fed funds rate  The top right panel graphs the  10- and 30-year yields In general, these yields moved in very much the same  pattern as the 9-month forward rate I mentioned earlier  They rose in early  November because of optimism about the economy, retraced that rise as the  optimism cooled, and then spiked higher despite data on some days, such as  Friday’s weak labor market report, that would typically be associated with  lower, not higher, interest rates On balance, 2-year yields have risen a bit more  than 1/2 percentage point over the intermeeting period and the spread between  the 2-year note and the fed funds rate has risen to 100 basis points, the largest  this year Yields on 10-year and 30-year Treasuries rose about 75 basis points   The complaints from market participants about volatility can be supported  by the data in the bottom chart on page 2  The red line is the volatility of daily  yield changes in the 2-year note, measured in basis points on the left scale, since  February 1988 Fluctuations have been smoothed by using a 60-day moving  average In general, during most of that period this measure of volatility moved  in a range of 3 to 6 basis points and usually between 3 and 5 basis points   Recently, the volatility of the 2-year note was as high as 7 basis points; that  level had been approached briefly a couple of times in the mid-1990s and was  exceeded only in the late 1980s  The chart also graphs the target fed funds rate  over the same period The relationship between the two rates is not perfect, but  casual observation suggests that spikes in volatility are frequently associated  with anticipation of the end of a monetary policy cycle or are coincident with  the beginning of a new one For example, the volatility spike in 1992 occurred  at end of the early 1990s easing cycle and the 1994 spike coincided with the  tightening cycle that began in February of that year  Again, the relationship is  not precise and I don’t want to make too much of it  Nevertheless, it is possible     12/11/01 3    that at least some of the volatility in recent weeks reflects indications that the  bond market is beginning to adjust to expectations that the forward markets are  taking more seriously, namely that this cycle is nearing a conclusion   Another question is why have yields on coupon securities risen so high?  Expectations about economic recovery are certainly part of the story  The rally  in the equity market suggests that this factor is at work there as well  But it is  difficult to explain the scope and speed of the move by that explanation alone   The second factor at work may have been positioning among dealers,  speculative funds, and other investors  A number of strategies involved going  long in Treasury bonds, especially at the short end of the curve  This worked  fine for most of the year, but the trading attracted many imitators and created  ingredients for a pronounced effect if everyone were to head for the door at the  same time  Third, corporate supply has continued at a rapid pace  And a fourth  factor cited recently is the reputed impact of hedging by large mortgage  investors With rates rising, mortgage investors tend to sell Treasuries to  maintain their duration targets, a point I’ll talk about a bit more in a minute   Finally, there may have been a calendar effect  November 30th is the fiscal  year-end for a number of large investment banks and December 31st the year- end for almost everyone else  With dealers scaling back positions and  individual traders protecting their bonuses, it was not an opportune time to have  large demands for liquidity from both investors and hedgers on the same side of  the market  Ultimately, the dealer community absorbed this supply but only  with a large price adjustment  Perhaps any one of these reasons alone would  not explain the fluctuations we’ve observed, but a shift in perceptions, a  position overhang, a price insensitive group of hedgers, and a risk-averse dealer  community came together at a delicate point in time     The fourth factor I mentioned was the importance of the mortgage market   That market has grown substantially in recent years, increasingly influencing  the Treasury market  The top panel on page 3 graphs the outstanding supply of  publicly held Treasuries and the outstanding supply of mortgage-backed  securities (MBS) Five years ago the Treasury market was twice the size of the  MBS market  Now the two are converging  And if one takes a broader  definition of the MBS market, its size is bigger still   The bottom panel graphs the yield on the 10-year Treasury note and the  estimated duration of the aggregate MBS market from September 4th to  December 7th of this year I should stress that this is an estimate by one  investment bank and differing assumptions regarding prepayment speeds could  change the duration, though the overall pattern should be similar  When yields  fell in September and October the duration of mortgage-backed securities also  fell, as prepayments rose and investors received cash flow sooner than  expected In that environment, asset managers will buy Treasuries or swaps to  maintain their duration target  Even if the hedging is via swaps, ultimately  swap dealers will hedge themselves with Treasuries and the net result will be     12/11/01 4    the same  When Treasury yields rose in November, the duration of mortgage- backed securities, shown in the blue line, rose sharply  Following their models  in such circumstances, large mortgage holders sell Treasuries, which  contributes to rising rates, which in turn extends the duration of mortgage  portfolios and leads to more selling until the process finally dissipates     Because mortgage portfolios are managed against a duration benchmark  and because hedging behavior is driven by similar models, asset managers will  to some extent be price insensitive  If the volume of those sales or purchases is  large enough, given the set of liquidity conditions, it could influence prices in  ways that are counterintuitive to new pieces of information  That may have  been the case last Friday when the weak labor report was followed by higher,  not lower, yields Finally, given the swiftness with which American  homeowners refinance mortgages in response to lower yields, mortgage-backed  securities are becoming more concentrated in fewer pools than in the past  And  this implies that as a mortgage pool gets closer to the point where refinancing is  economically advantageous, the impact of related hedging will be larger  As of  November 30th, mortgage-backed securities paying coupons of 6-1/2 to 7  percent represented 60 percent of the entire outstanding MBS market     Turning to page 4 and the corporate market, the top panel graphs the  spread between A and AAA corporate bonds and also the spread between BBB  and AAA corporate obligations  On balance, spreads were relatively stable  despite the continuing large supply and the Enron bankruptcy; the BBB spread  rose slightly while the A spread narrowed  The spread of high-yield bonds to  Treasuries, not shown here, actually narrowed from 850 basis points to 715  basis points   The bottom panel depicts changes in commercial paper spreads as the year- end approaches The red line shows the A2/P2 minus A1/P1 spreads for 1997- 1998 The green line is the spread for 2000-2001 and the blue line is the spread  for the current year to date  On the left side are the 30-day spreads and on the  right side the 90-day spreads Both the 30- and 90-day spreads widened earlier  this fall after 9/11 but actually have begun to narrow more recently  And both  are narrower than in the comparable period last year  One reason, and perhaps  the main reason, is that the A2/P2 sector has shrunk substantially as many  A2/P2 companies exited their CP programs and instead issued longer-term  obligations, generating breathing room but also increasing their interest cost   Turning to page 5 and developments in Japan, the top panel graphs the  dollar-yen exchange rate since September 3rd The dollar has been appreciating  gradually since the BOJ’s late-September intervention and the close of the  Japanese fiscal half-year  In part, the yen’s depreciation may be due to the  performance of the Japanese economy, which has deteriorated, with few  forecasts looking forward to a strong recovery in 2002      12/11/01 5    Recently the dollar-yen exchange rate has also been influenced by a   boisterous, if sometimes confused, debate in Tokyo about the BOJ’s monetary   policy Within some Japanese policy circles, the BOJ is being urged to buy   foreign bonds as a way of easing its monetary policy still further  Now,   whether the BOJ buys Japanese government bonds (JGBs) or foreign bonds, the   reserve impact in yen is the same  While stepping up purchases of JGBs may   add more liquidity and weaken the yen, buying foreign bonds is viewed as a   more direct way to influence the exchange rate  Hence, the foreign exchange   market is monitoring this very closely for signs as to whether monetary policy   and more traditional foreign exchange intervention will be converging  Adding   confusion to this mix is uncertainty about the US response to the idea    Newspaper stories have suggested that the Administration favored it, or more   subtly that a weakening yen would be acceptable as part of the broader effort to   counteract deflation in Japan    The middle panel shows the 10-year JGB yield over that same period    JGB yields have stayed low despite recent downgrades of Japan’s debt by both   Moody’s and S&P and despite the talk about the Bank of Japan purchasing   foreign bonds Presumably, such an action by the BOJ would remove or reduce   the activity of a very big buyer of Japanese government debt      The bottom panel depicts the Topix composite index, which has risen   slightly since its post-9/11 low But the Japanese stock market has not had as   much of a recovery as those in other countries  Bank shares continue to decline,   as confidence in Japan’s ability to clean up the bad debt problem deteriorates   still more    Finally, let me say a word on domestic reserves management  Since the   last meeting we have been building up our holdings of long-term RPs to help   meet needs associated with the seasonal growth in currency  We expect that   currency will have increased about $23 billion from its late-October level to its   peak in early January before beginning to unwind  Over this roughly two-  month period, our holdings of 28-day RPs will have risen a net of about $8   billion and are expected to peak at $32 billion or so before reverting to the low   $20 billion range by sometime in February    Mr Chairman, there were no foreign operations in this period  I will need   approval of our domestic operations, and I will be happy to take questions    I have had conversations with lower level officials of the Treasury  The views   have been somewhat vague in the sense of suggesting that if the yen goes down because of actions   taken to stimulate the economy, that’s one thing  But if there’s a deliberate attempt to weaken the yen,   that would be another   Absolutely, that’s the difficulty   I haven’t looked at that  One should look at it over a decade or so and we   haven’t looked at it back that far  But I think--and this is only a hypothesis--this correlation has been   getting tighter over time and the reason relates to the trends depicted in that top chart on page 3  That   is, the mortgage market has been getting bigger and there are more methods for hedging and managing   the mortgage books  As mortgage books first of all become concentrated--and there are some very     12/11/01 7    large holders of mortgages out there--and as models become similar, the impact is greater both   because of the size and the technique   I don’t, but that is work we will do   I haven’t looked at that  "
6762,2002-01-29," Thank you First, on the domestic side, we recommend that the Committee   reaffirm the Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations and the Guidelines for the   Conduct of System Operations in Federal Agency Issues in their present forms  I would note   with regard to the “Guidelines” that a reaffirmation would involve the continued suspension of   paragraphs 3 to 6  This will allow us to continue to take mortgage-backed securities as collateral   in our domestic open market operations, a practice we’ve engaged in since October 1999   On the foreign side, the Desk operates under the following Committee    instruments the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations, the Foreign Currency Directive,            January 29-30, 2002 Page 6 of 194  and the Procedural Instructions with Respect to Foreign Currency Operations  I recommend that   they all be renewed without amendment  1 Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the charts that were  circulated earlier this afternoon The top panel of the first page shows three-month  cash and forward dollar deposit rates, represented by the red lines  Those rates  moved in a relatively narrow range during most of the intermeeting period  They did  fall following the Chairman’s January 11 speech but quickly retraced their decline  over the next two weeks The three-month forward rates are now above the cash rates  for the first time since November 2000; the current spread is about 3 basis points  In  the euro area the three-month cash deposit rate, the solid green line, was stable for  much of the period, but forward rates rose as market participants came to view   1 Materials used by Mr Kos are appended to this  document (appendix  1)                 January 29-30, 2002 Page 9 of 194  another easing in ECB policy as less likely and by yesterday had priced out further  ease by the ECB The nine-month forward rate is beginning to build in a tightening  later this year In Japan, with interest rates scraping along the zero axis, as shown in  the bottom panel, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) announced several operational changes  intended to increase the amount of liquidity in the system  The changes announced  on December 19 were an increase in the target current account balance to between  10 trillion and 15 trillion yen as well as an increase in the BOJ’s monthly purchases  of Japanese government bonds (JGBs) from 600 billion to 800 billion  On January 16  the BOJ announced that it would widen the range of collateral acceptable in its  temporary operations to include asset-backed commercial paper and other types of  asset-backed securities  One option they did not pursue was the idea actively debated  in Tokyo at the time of the last FOMC meeting, the purchase of foreign bonds   Apparently a combination of political and legal factors weighed against going that  route   Turning to page 2, the top panel graphs the two-, ten-, and thirty-year Treasury  yields along with the target fed funds rate  Treasury yields also moved in a fairly  narrow range for most of the period  The heightened volatility observed in October  and November moderated in the intermeeting period  Mortgage-related hedging in  particular was less of a factor on prices in recent weeks  The spread between the two- year note and the target fed funds rate was wide during the entire period, as the  markets began to anticipate an end to the easing cycle  The last time the spread  between the two-year note and the funds rate was this wide for any length of time was  in February 1995 In the bottom panel is a graph of the Dow, the S&P, and the  Nasdaq re-indexed from October 1 During most of December, equity markets were  stable or rising, as investors anticipated an economic rebound  That enthusiasm  waned in the first week of January and equity prices began to erode, as investors  began to get a bit more pessimistic about the near-term economic and earnings  outlooks This downward trend continued today, and the major equity indexes were  down between 1½ and 2 percent a short time ago     Turning to foreign exchange markets, the dollar has been stronger against most  major currencies—not only against the euro and the yen but also against other  currencies such as the Canadian dollar, which fell to a record low a few days ago,  although it has recovered somewhat  As shown in the top panel, the euro traded  between 88 and 92 cents over recent weeks until the last few days, when it  depreciated more rapidly The most often cited reason is the belief that the US  economy will recover sooner and more vigorously than will the European economy   Some technical factors may be at work as well  Short-term traders reportedly bought  euros in late December, anticipating that the currency would appreciate once the note  and coin transition was concluded In the event, the euro began to fall, and these  traders unwound their positions, thereby accelerating the speed of the decline  The  middle panel depicts changes in the value of the yen against the dollar, the euro, the  sterling, the Korean won, and the Taiwan dollar since October 1  The yen has been  depreciating since mid-November, as sentiment about the economy, the Japanese  financial system, and the political system’s ability to deal with these problems all                       January 29-30, 2002 Page 10 of 194  deteriorated Two other factors may have been at work  First, the changes to the  BOJ’s operating procedures that I mentioned earlier, which were intended to add  liquidity to the system, may have had an effect on the external value of the yen,  although the yen’s depreciation was already in full swing for a month before  December 19  Second, the constant drumbeat of official commentary by Japanese  government officials was taken as reflecting either tolerance of a weaker yen or  outright encouragement to the market to weaken the yen further  The bottom panel  graphs the ten-year JGB yield, which rose steadily in the last few weeks, perhaps  reflecting some unease about the government’s handling of the problems in the  financial system  Their rates are still low by global standards though the yield, at  about 145 percent, is at the high end of its range in the last twelve months   Turning to page 4, let me say a quick word on Latin America  Argentina’s  problems were very prominent in the news and among market participants in recent  weeks However, despite the continuous stream of adverse news in December and  January, markets in Brazil and Mexico were marching to their own beat  The top  panel graphs movements in the EMBI+ subcomponents for Mexico and Brazil since  October 1 Since that date Mexican spreads have narrowed about 140 basis points  and Brazil’s about 350 basis points  As shown in the middle panel, the Mexican peso  was relatively stable, and the real actually appreciated sharply over that entire span  Meanwhile, local interest rates, represented in the bottom panel by the thirty-day  swap rate, were actually falling in both countries  Some suggested that the prospect  of better growth in the United States and later in Europe was a more important  influence in these markets than the distress in Argentina   Turning to page 5, I want to report briefly on the distribution of collateral in our  temporary operations  This chart, which summarizes for both 2000 and 2001 the  average daily value of outstanding RP agreements, was included in the Desk’s  Domestic Annual Report  It breaks out, in dollar terms and percentages, amounts of  outstanding RPs according to the three types of collateral dealers can submit   Treasuries, direct agency debt, and agency-sponsored mortgage-backed agency debt   In general, while the percentages move around from one operation to the next, the  average amounts outstanding stay in more stable ranges, with direct agency collateral  accounting for about a quarter of the collateral, mortgage-backed securities somewhat  more than that, and Treasuries slightly less than half of the total  By way of  comparison, before we expanded the collateral pool in October 1999 to include  mortgage-backed assets, the distribution between Treasuries and agencies would vary  widely In the year before going to the current system, agencies accounted for about  60 percent of the collateral on RPs   Mr Chairman, there were no foreign operations in this period  I will need a vote  to ratify domestic operations, and I would be happy to take any questions  "
6789,2002-03-19,"1  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I will be referring to the set of charts that  has been distributed In the top panel on the first page, US cash and forward deposit  rates are shown in red  The forward rates—the dashed red lines—moved higher in a  more pronounced manner after a string of stronger-than-expected economic data and  Chairman Greenspan’s Senate appearance on March 7  The three-month forward rate  is trading at 2½ percent, about ½ percentage point above the cash rate, and the nine- month forward rate rose nearly a full percentage point in the past five weeks or so to  almost 4 percent  European rates, the green lines, showed the same general pattern  though not to the same degree as US rates  Traders apparently believe that European  interest rates, which did not fall as much as US rates did in 2001, will not rise as  much in 2002 Japanese interest rates stayed low, and the Bank of Japan continued to  provide significant liquidity to the yen money market  As we approach the end of the  fiscal year, there is no hint of a Japanese premium in yen money markets and only a  very slight premium that shows up periodically in dollar money markets—at least  based on traditional indicators such as the British Bankers Association poll   However, market reports suggest that unsecured lending to Japanese banks has been  scaled back significantly  Meanwhile, Japanese banks have resorted to raising dollars  via foreign exchange swaps with non-Japanese banks wherein they are swapping in  dollars in exchange for yen The foreign banks doing these trades are able to raise the  yen at negative interest rates, so even if invested at a zero interest rate they can earn a  positive spread   Turning to page 2, Treasury yields began to rise in late February in response to  the same factors that moved short-term interest rates  From February 26 through  yesterday, the two-year yield rose about 60 basis points  And the spread of the two- year note over the fed funds target was at 185 basis points yesterday, the highest  spread in that relationship since January 1995  Similarly, the spread between the ten- year note and the fed funds target was 355 basis points, the widest since May 1994   Finally, the spread between the thirty-year bond—or I should say the twenty-nine­ year bond—and the target fed funds rate was just shy of 400 basis points, the widest  since May 1993  In the private sector, accounting and disclosure issues hung over the  corporate market during much of the period and securities of individual firms were  periodically repriced But spreads as a whole were steady or even narrowed slightly    1 Materials used by Mr Kos are appended to this transcript (appendix 1)                March 19, 2002 Page 4 of 117  The spread of the BBB over the AAA yields bounced around as rumors hit specific  names or sectors, but on balance it hovered near 125 basis points  As shown by the  solid blue line, the spread between A and AAA yields actually narrowed somewhat  during the period The trend of narrowing spreads is more pronounced in the lower  quality sectors of emerging-market debt and high-yield markets  Both the EMBI+  and the Merrill Lynch high-yield indexes narrowed dramatically, as investors’ risk  appetite seemed to revive and they priced in increasing odds of a global recovery   The Merrill Lynch high-yield spread narrowed to its lowest level since September  2000, and the EMBI+ spread narrowed to its tightest level since July 1998, but the  recent recomposition of the EMBI index exaggerates the scale of that improvement     Turning to page 3, volatility trends in major asset markets are shown in the top  panel The S&P 100 Volatility Index, also known as the VIX, has been declining for  some weeks now into the low 20s—at the lower end of its range of the last six or  seven years of 20 to 35 or 40 percent In general, high levels have been associated  with periods of stress and falling equity prices  Some analysts have asserted that the  current level of implied volatility suggests a complacent attitude among investors   Others, however, note that equity volatility above 20 percent is a relatively recent  phenomenon; before 1995 equity volatilities were frequently in the 10 to 15 percent  range These analysts suggest that, with the boom and bust behind us, a period of  more-modest returns may be consistent with a reversion toward lower volatilities   The middle panel graphs the implied volatility of the Eurodollar interest rate futures  contract That volatility had stayed at a high level in the months after September 11  but recently has declined to its lowest level since that date, though it remains at  elevated levels compared with its historical average  Finally, the bottom panel  depicts the one- and twelve-month implied volatilities in the euro-dollar exchange  rate With that exchange rate trading in a fairly narrow range between 086 and 089,  the volatility has eased into single digits, and the one-year implied volatility is at its  lowest point since November 1999   Turning to page 4, let me say a few words on Japan and Japanese assets The yen,  which had been exhibiting weakness early in 2002, had a dramatic about-face starting  in mid to late February  For most of January and part of February the talk in markets  was about the possibility of a major crisis around the end of the fiscal year  This led  to a “sell Japan” mentality and the prices of equities, JGBs, and the value of the yen  all declined As the talk about the crisis swelled, markets began to look forward to  two events in late February—the release of the government’s “anti-deflation plan”  due to come out on February 27 and the Bank of Japan’s policy board meeting on  February 28 In the event, the government’s anti-deflation plan was leaked slowly in  the days before its release, and it contained little that was new or viewed as being  truly helpful in fighting deflation The one concrete step was a tightening of short  selling rules on equities This was coupled with the announcement—a few days  before the plan was released—of sanctions by the FSA against four foreign firms for  violating the then-existing short selling rules Between aggressive buying by public  pension funds and a short covering rally, the Nikkei rose about 26 percent from its  low in early February to its peak in early March  On February 28 the Bank of Japan’s                       March 19, 2002 Page 5 of 117  policy board, under severe pressure from the government, decided to increase the   pace of its JGB acquisitions from ¥800 billion to ¥1 trillion per month  JGB yields   declined 10 basis points in the three weeks after that, to about 145 percent  With   Japanese asset prices rising, the yen appreciated sharply in late February, though it   has depreciated to a level of about 131 in the past day or so    Turning to page 5, a word on domestic reserves management  The top chart  shows monthly rates of growth in currency over the past year and our forecast for the  next few months  Currency growth has been well above trend in many recent months   Late last year, just when it looked as if it was getting back to normal, we experienced  unexpectedly rapid growth for several months  Argentina has been part of the story,  but domestic demand for currency has also been strong  The bottom panel shows, by  maintenance periods, the aggregate size of domestic financial assets held by the  Federal Reserve  The gray line represents our permanent SOMA holdings, and the  red line shows total holdings, including repurchase agreements, both long and short  term  Aggregate holdings will simply reflect the behavior of autonomous factors and  demands for Fed balances  The underlying changes in this series over time mostly  reflect currency growth The size of our total RP holdings rose quite suddenly in the  aftermath of September 11, as we stopped our outright activity for a few maintenance  periods while currency growth remained robust  Total RPs grew to more than  $30 billion, and the long-term RP book reached about $24 billion in October  In that  month we began to buy outright for SOMA once again; and over the past five months,  SOMA has expanded by over $25 billion, which in absolute terms is about as  aggressive a pace as we have ever sustained over any extended period  But the rapid  growth in currency has continued to surprise us over the past several months, and the  rapid pace of SOMA expansion still has not allowed us to bring down our holdings of  RPs, including long-term RPs, below the October levels Looking ahead, while  currency growth is expected to moderate, we plan to maintain the recent rapid pace of  SOMA expansion, which should allow us to bring RPs, including long-term RPs,  down modestly from the current levels Again, though, we are talking about forecasts,  and there is a lot of risk to those forecasts   Mr Chairman, there were no foreign operations in the intermeeting period  I do  want to mention that yesterday the Desk made its initial purchase of French bonds for  SOMA’s foreign portfolio as part of our effort to diversify the Euro portfolio beyond  German debt  I will need a vote to ratify domestic operations, and I would be happy  to answer any questions Thank you, Mr Chairman     I think you’re absolutely right that there is a suppression of the exchange rate   by the various rules and regulations, both formal and informal, that are being applied  How   much that is suppressing the exchange rate is hard to quantify, and I wouldn’t want to hazard a   guess But a lot of people in the analytical community think that we could see a further—and   perhaps even sharp—depreciation if and when a more open market is allowed to develop  As for   how that will spill over into broader markets or the society, I think it’s very hard to guess  But   it’s difficult to be optimistic about the situation   Yes Don and I will make some brief opening comments on that topic  At   this point the staff has done a fair amount of background work on how we might go about   acquiring for the System Open Market Account a portfolio of GNMAs and also on structuring a   portfolio of RPs (repurchase agreements) against foreign sovereign securities  Where we are   now is that quite a bit more—in fact a substantial amount—of rather nitty-gritty operational work   needs to be done both to study and to prepare for an actual implementation of either program    That then becomes a resource issue because a lot of the same people would work on both of   these projects  So there’s a competition for those resources between these two projects and also   on the contingency-related issues And that just makes it impossible for us to expedite the   contingency planning work and also work on GNMAs and the foreign sovereign debt    Therefore, we wanted to get some guidance from the Committee as to which one of the two   options for the portfolio the Committee wanted us to focus on  There are pros and cons for each,   which we tried to lay out in the paper that was sent to you  As we noted in that memo, there are   both tactical and strategic questions that the Committee may want to consider  Don and I would   be happy to answer any questions, but I won’t review the actual contents of that paper  Don, did   you want to say anything about some of the other topics on which staff work is being done?     March 19, 2002 Page 11 of 117  Just two brief points On the question of other assets that have the full faith   and credit designation, there is the credit issue and then there’s the liquidity issue  So, as we        March 19, 2002 Page 25 of 117  look at potential assets, the Desk might decide that a particular security meets our credit screen   but it might not meet our liquidity screen because not enough of that issue is outstanding  So we   wouldn’t necessarily automatically be in the posture of buying that asset  On President   Santomero’s point with respect to the foreign sovereign debt and which countries would be   included in the collateral basket, just to be up front I should note that we are in that posture now   with our foreign portfolio, where we do maintain a book of euro-denominated repos  At present   we take securities of six countries from the euro area that meet our credit and liquidity screens    So we are in that posture now, although it’s not as prominent because it is a small portion of our   portfolio  "
6812,2002-05-07,"1  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the charts that were  just circulated The top panel on the first page gives two snapshots of the Eurodollar  deposit futures strip, as of March 19 and as of noon yesterday, representing contracts  out to September 2004 The entire curve has moved sharply lower by between 50 and  80 basis points during that period as the market has scaled back expectations of rising  rates that had been built into the term structure  Among the reasons for the shift are  that the macro data moderated, corporate profit reports turned soggy, equity prices  exhibited weakness, forecasts for spending by businesses were revised down, and  tensions rose in the Middle East And there were comments by members of this  Committee that were interpreted as suggesting that a tightening of policy would not  come as soon as had been built into the forward rate structure  The same pricing-out  of tightening expectations can be observed in Treasury yields The middle left panel  shows two-year Treasury yields down about 50 basis points since the middle of  March, whereas ten-year yields are down a bit less—about 30 basis points from their  peak—over roughly the same period  Treasury yields began to decline in mid to late  March, as tensions in the Middle East increased and as the equity markets began to  sag and then continued to fall after the Chairman’s testimony to the Joint Economic  Committee on April 17  As shown in the bottom panel, the ten-year TIPS spread,  which had widened in February and early March, stabilized as expectations of a  strong recovery moderated and as commodity prices stabilized after rising earlier this  year Supportive comments by the Treasury about the TIPS program and the  announcement of plans to increase the frequency of TIPS auctions may also have  played a role   The generalized decline in nominal Treasury yields has occurred despite the more  bearish factor for Treasuries that the markets have had to contend with in recent  months, namely the shifting fiscal picture  The most recent event highlighting the  change in the outlook was the Treasury’s announcement that it now anticipates  $1 billion in net financing needs for the second quarter rather than the $89 billion  paydown that it had forecast only three months ago  The top panel on page 2 shows  one way of looking at the higher financing needs  This chart compares the average  issuance by maturity of the various benchmark issues this year relative to last year  In  the bill sector, issuance is twice as large as it was last year  This year’s monthly two- year auctions have been running at a record $25 billion in size compared with about   1 Materials used by Mr Kos are appended to this transcript (appendix 1)                        May 7, 2002 4 of 81  $10 billion last year Today’s five-year auction will be a record $22 billion, and the  size of the ten-year auction also has increased from last year  The thirty-year bond  has been eliminated, of course, but that was being issued semiannually and made up  only a very small portion of total issuance  After complaints about a shrinking supply  of Treasuries in the last several years, the market has absorbed this higher level of  issuance so far without any evident strains     Despite the increase in supply, as I noted earlier yields have fallen in recent  weeks, suggesting that the higher levels of supply have not affected nominal rates   But higher levels of supply may be showing up in spread relationships  The bottom  panel graphs the US ten-year swap spread since January 1, 1998  The swap spread  has narrowed about 10 basis points since the last meeting and currently is roughly at  levels not seen since the summer of 1998, just before the Russian default  The  reasons for both the widening and the narrowing are complex, including the level of  corporate issuance that is swapped, the stance of monetary policy, demand for  hedging by mortgage and other accounts, and other short-term technical factors  Thus  one can’t ascribe movements to any single factor  Still, it’s noteworthy that spreads  widened during the period of higher budget surpluses and then began to narrow as the  surplus first began to shrink in fiscal 2001 and as the forecast turned to deficits in  fiscal 2002 This may suggest that at least part of the widening of spreads represented  a repricing of government credit risks relative to other risk assets  Spreads of other  debt instruments such as agencies and corporates show a similar pattern, though not  as pronounced These spreads have not fully retraced their climb and returned to the  very low levels seen in the summer of 1998   The corporate bond market was affected by issuer-specific and sector-specific  news in the past few weeks, with the backdrop of continuing worries about event  risks emanating from accounting-related concerns  Despite the constant drumbeat of  headlines about earnings shortfalls, SEC investigations, and continuing pressure on  some companies—especially those in the telecom area—to refinance their  commercial paper, there appears to have been no generalized tiering in the corporate  sector Spreads in that sector are depicted on page 3  The top panel graphs spreads  relative to AA industrial corporates As can be seen in the top left panel, among  investment-grade borrowers BBB spreads have risen modestly while A spreads have  narrowed Meanwhile, in the high-yield sector, BB credit spreads have narrowed as  well Looking at the broad spectrum of corporates relative to Treasuries, the spread  has been relatively stable, as seen in the red line of the lower graph  However, the  telecom sub-index, which is where the problems are most acute and where a large  proportion of the borrowing was concentrated in the late 1990s and early 2000,  widened dramatically     Turning to page 4, the very busy graph in the top panel shows changes in the  value of a number of foreign currencies—the euro, the yen, the Swiss franc, the  British pound, the Australian dollar, and the Mexican peso—against the dollar since  January 1 The values above 100 represent appreciation of the foreign currency  relative to the dollar  In recent weeks, most foreign currencies have been                        May 7, 2002 5 of 81  appreciating against the dollar, raising concerns about a sustained period of dollar  weakness The Mexican peso is an exception to this trend; it has fallen in recent  weeks due both to local factors and to the perception that a slower US recovery will  delay the recovery in Mexico  Despite the dollar’s recent depreciation, we should not  exaggerate the movement  It has moved only modestly lower since the beginning of  the year, and by most measures the effective value of the dollar is at levels last seen  during the strong dollar period of the mid-1980s  Still, sentiment toward the dollar  has deteriorated in recent weeks  Market talk has focused much more on the potential  adverse effects of the current account deficit than it has in quite some time  What has  taken the market aback in recent weeks was that the dollar’s fall was as broad as it  was and that it occurred despite the strong first-quarter GDP number  Particularly  surprising was that the dollar’s weakness spread even to the dollar-yen exchange rate,  whereas expectations only a few weeks ago were that the dollar would rise against the  yen One argument that some analysts have made in recent years is that the higher  expected returns in the United States relative to returns in other countries have  supported a higher dollar In recent weeks the dollar skeptics have used the same  logic and pointed to the underperformance of returns in the United States to explain  the dollar’s weakness The equally busy middle panel on page 4 shows the  performance of selected major equity markets relative to the S&P 500, taking into  account exchange rate moves So a line above the zero axis does not necessarily  imply that a particular equity market had positive returns  Rather, it measures how  much better that market did than the S&P 500  Adding up both equity market  changes and exchange rate shifts, each of these markets outperformed the S&P 500  since January, some by double-digit amounts  The bottom left panel depicts three- month interest rate differentials between the dollar and the euro  These differentials  have been at about 150 basis points in favor of the euro for some time now  At the  long end, shown in the right panel, the US dollar ten-year swap now yields about  25 basis points more than the euro swap, but that differential has narrowed from  75 basis points in January So at least during this relatively short period of about four  months, foreign investors in developed markets generally would have done better at  home than in the US markets  Should this trend continue, the dollar’s exchange rate  could come under further pressure     Looking at Japan a bit more closely, the top panel of page 5 graphs the Bank of  Japan’s month-end current account balances since January 2000  The target has been  10 trillion to 15 trillion yen since December, but in practice 15 trillion has been the  floor recently  And in the run-up to the end of the fiscal half year, the current account  balance temporarily topped out at more than 27 trillion yen  The middle panel depicts  Japan’s monetary base over the same period, from January 2000 through April 2002   Despite the reduction in short-term interest rates to near zero and the increase in the  current account balance over 2001, the monetary base did not begin to grow until late  in 2001 That growth occurred as the Bank of Japan stepped up its acquisition of  assets and targeted ever-higher levels of current account balances  That the monetary  base has been growing at annualized rates of nearly 50 percent in recent months has  caught the attention of some market participants  It is taken by some as either a  positive sign about the near-term outlook for the economy or as a signal that the Bank                           May 7, 2002 6 of 81  of Japan will hold the financial system together, or both  Whatever the direct cause,  this sentiment toward Japan for the near term, while not positive, is at least less  negative The yen had been depreciating in early 2002 along with a decline in  Japanese equities—and to a lesser extent, Japanese bonds—during the “sell Japan”  phase With the steps taken by the authorities to prop up equities in late March and  the realization that the Japanese would muddle through the fiscal year-end without a  major crisis, equities began to rise, the yen began to appreciate, and JGB yields began  to decline In short, the “sell Japan” phase was replaced by a “buy Japan” phase   Yields on JGBs have declined despite their downgrade to double A minus by  Standard & Poor’s and their possible downgrade by Moody’s in the next few weeks  to the high single A level   With respect to domestic reserves, the Desk at times faced challenges in the   intermeeting period because of uncertainty about the Treasury’s balance, given the   shortfall in tax revenues Overall, however, this tax season was less eventful than in   some other recent years when the Treasury was running up against its TT&L   (Treasury Tax and Loan account) constraints  That was not an issue this year    Finally, I wanted to note two items regarding the Desk’s operations  First, the   Desk began buying French bonds as part of SOMA’s foreign portfolio diversification   and also on behalf of the ESF (Exchange Stabilization Fund)  The Committee had   previously approved this diversification of the euro portfolio  Second, the Desk   announced a modest change to its Securities Lending Program, effective May 15, as   was described in a memo to the Committee dated April 22    Mr Chairman, there were no foreign operations in this period  I will need a vote   to approve our domestic operations, and I’d be happy to take any questions    Yes   I don’t know I haven’t looked at that specifically   Yes, I think that is worth looking into     I was not trying to imply that this was necessarily driving interest rates  My   point was that it was a factor, along with many other factors, that may have been affecting these   spreads in—   Well, this is one of many  But I wouldn’t claim that it’s the only one or even   the primary one, only that it is one     Sure I think most of the people around this table will remember that last   year at this time forces were aligned where there was a possibility that it might be in everybody’s   interest to do away with these swap lines  Among the forces that made that a possibility were the   new leadership in policymaking positions in all three countries and some events occurring in   Mexico—mainly the negotiation of a contingent credit line (CCL) that the Mexicans were   working on with the IMF As it happens that piece has not worked out  For various reasons, the   Mexicans have not been able to agree with the IMF on a CCL, and that has made them less                    May 7, 2002 9 of 81  willing to give up the swap lines  They very strongly would like to maintain the status quo, at   least for the time being  So, my recommendation to the Committee is that the swap lines be   renewed Of course, we’d look for opportunities in the future—should they arise and if the   Committee so desires—to do away with the swap lines  But my recommendation at this time is   that they be renewed for a year  "
6836,2002-06-25,"1  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the charts that were  just circulated to you The intermeeting period in financial markets was characterized  first by some signs of risk aversion in selected asset markets and second by a  readjustment of expectations regarding the strength of the recovery and, in turn, the  implications for the interest rate outlook     The top panel on page 1 provides three snapshots of the Eurodollar futures strip,  representing contracts out to December 2004  Between the March and May meetings  of this Committee, the Eurodollar futures curve declined between 50 and 80 basis  points In the period since the eve of the May meeting through yesterday, the curve  moved lower as much as 74 additional basis points, as market participants continued  to revise down their growth forecasts and their expectations regarding the degree and  pace of tightening by this Committee  Among the reasons for this shift were reduced  forecasts for growth in Q2 and the second half of the year, falling equity prices, a new  wave of earnings warnings by various companies, continued uncertainties regarding  the geopolitical outlook, and comments by members of this Committee that were  interpreted as suggesting that the FOMC would be in no hurry to tighten policy   Although market participants appear uniform in their expectations for short-term  interest rates in the near term, they are less certain about the likely path of rates later  in the year The middle panel graphs the implied volatility of the December  Eurodollar futures contract It has risen over the last three months from about  30 percent to about 38 percent With perceptions that short-term rates are likely to  stay low in coming months, the focus is increasingly on the possibility that rates  might change in the fourth quarter and hence more focus on and volatility in the  December contract  This scaling back of expected short-term interest rates was  reflected in Treasury yields The bottom panels graph two- and ten-year yields, both  of which have declined sharply since topping out in late March  Treasury securities  may also have benefited from some risk aversion, as weakness in riskier assets may  have sent investors toward Treasury securities  The rate declines at the long end may  be due in part to speculative flows—in anticipation of potential hedging by mortgage  investors looking to hedge duration changes in their portfolios   1 Materials used by Mr Kos are appended to this transcript (appendix 1)                June 25-26, 2002 4 of 179  The top panel on page 2 graphs the dollar’s exchange rate since March 1 against  the euro, the yen, the Swiss franc, the Australian dollar, the British pound, and the  Canadian dollar The dollar’s depreciation, which was beginning to manifest itself at  about the time of the last meeting, continued during the recent intermeeting period   The dollar declined against a wide range of currencies  Looking at a broader sample  of sixteen major actively traded currencies since the beginning of the year, the dollar  has declined against all of them except the Mexican peso and the Brazilian real   Early yesterday the dollar traded at just above 98 cents versus the euro—its weakest  level against the euro since February of 2000—and just below 121 yen  The decline  against the yen came despite occasional intervention by the Japanese authorities in  attempts to stem the yen’s rise  On four occasions in late May and early June the  Japanese authorities intervened in the market, purchasing a total of $20 billion  They  intervened again yesterday, buying another $35 billion, thus bringing their total  intervention over the period since late May to $235 billion  The weaker US outlook  is the most commonly cited reason for the dollar’s decline  But concerns about the  outlook for equities and the seemingly constant flow of adverse reports pointing to  weakness in accounting disclosure and corporate governance were prominently cited  by market participants as reasons for foreigners to shy away from continuing to  accumulate corporate securities  And, of course, concerns remain about the size of  the US current account deficit   With the continuing depreciation of the dollar, implied volatilities—as shown in  the middle panel—have ticked higher, especially in the past week  The one-month  implied volatility on dollar/yen, the blue line, has risen about 2 percentage points, to  nearly 12 percent The implied volatility on the euro-dollar exchange rate, the red  line, which had barely budged through most of the spring, also rose about  2 percentage points, coincident with the euro’s rally in the last two weeks  While this  level of implied volatility is notably higher relative to levels in the recent past, it is  not very much different from its historical range  Still, with investors and  corporations having been trained over the first three years of the currency’s life not to  hedge short euro exposures, it may not take much more of a rise in the euro to bring a  burst of hedging from a variety of accounts   In the late 1990s, one factor that market participants had discounted in explaining  exchange rate moves was relative interest rate differentials  At the time, the  explanation was that the dominant flows that influenced exchange rates were foreign  direct investments and long-term equity investments  Currently, with the composition  of capital flows changing, there is a small but growing minority that is focusing on  interest rate differentials increasingly as a guide to help explain exchange rates,  especially with respect to the euro  With the exception of Japan and Switzerland, the  United States now has about the lowest short-term interest rates among the major  industrialized countries And at the long end, the situation is similar  The bottom  panel shows ten-year government bond yields as of yesterday, June 24, for the United  States and ten other major industrialized countries  With the exception of Japan, this  country has the lowest yields of the group, whereas in 1999 and most of 2000, ten­                June 25-26, 2002 5 of 179  year US government yields were as high as, and in most cases higher than, those in  many of the countries listed in this graphic   Turning to page 3, the US equity markets have declined steadily and sharply at  times since March 1  The same set of factors that boosted bond markets and weighed  on the dollar—corporate governance, earnings shortfalls, geopolitical concerns, and  so forth—are cited to explain the weakness in equities  In the middle panel is a graph  of the S&P 100 volatility index, also known as the VIX, which has risen sharply in  recent weeks to a high of about 32 percent, coinciding with the recent weakness in  equities That rise is somewhat unusual for this time of year  Often the VIX is  seasonally soggy as we move toward summer  High volatility is often associated, by  some analysts at least, with market bottoms  Nevertheless, the recent peaks in the  VIX are not nearly as high as the peaks in the fall of 1997, the autumn of 1998, and  the period after last September 11, when this index peaked between 35 and  50 percent I should note that the weakness in equity markets has been a global affair   The bottom panel graphs a sample of major international equity indexes also re- indexed to March 1 Their price levels generally have moved lower with the US  market  We’ve had profit warnings as well by some major European corporations,  worries about debt levels at some of the major telecom companies, and concerns  about the pace of European recovery Still, with the dollar falling and the drop in  US equity prices, overseas investors would have done better on a relative basis by  staying at home    Turning to page 4, let me say a word about spreads  Despite the concerns about  corporate governance and risk aversion, the picture in credit markets is mixed  In the  investment-grade sector spreads on balance are a bit tighter  Spreads in swaps and  agency debt, shown in the top left panel, have tightened along with lower Treasury  yields As can be seen in the right panel, spreads on A-rated industrial corporate debt  tightened slightly, although there is some noise in that series because of downgrades  among some prominent names in the telecom sector  Still, on balance, spreads have  tightened somewhat, as have those on mortgage-backed securities  Anecdotally,  market participants report that a wide variety of institutions have been acquiring  mortgage-backed securities, which have become sufficiently expensive that some of  the government-sponsored agencies have slowed their pace of acquisition  In the case  of Freddie Mac, it actually has reduced its mortgage-backed portfolio in each of the  last two months  As can be seen in the bottom panel, among somewhat riskier assets  there was more evidence of risk aversion  Unlike the tighter spreads in the  investment-grade sector, spreads in the high-yield sector, measured by the black line,  have widened modestly  Emerging-market bonds have had a more notable widening,  especially with political and economic conditions deteriorating in Latin America, and  in particular in Brazil   Turning to domestic open market operations and a word on reserves, the top panel  on page 5 depicts the recent pattern of currency growth and our forecast for the rest of  the year, along with our forecast as of the May meeting  The Desk reacted to the  strong growth in currency by stepping up the pace of our outright purchases for the              June 25-26, 2002 6 of 179  System Open Market Account (SOMA)  So far this year we have acquired about   $39 billion in outright purchases of Treasuries  The bottom panel graphs for the   period from 1996 to date our total outright purchases of securities  The breakdown   depicted there shows net additions to SOMA in the blue bars while the gray bars   reflect purchases necessary to offset redemptions caused by our guidelines on single-  issue holdings During the past few years of declining issuance by the Treasury, the   Desk frequently could not roll over the full amount of maturing proceeds and   therefore had to acquire other securities to offset the drain caused by the securities   being redeemed      I want to make three points about this chart  First, the needs for 2002 as a whole  will be quite substantial  We forecast that SOMA will grow by about $65 billion this  year Second, the changed fiscal picture has caused the Treasury to increase issuance   As a result, we have had no redemptions so far this year and don’t expect any for the  remainder of the year  And finally, with SOMA having grown in size from about  $400 billion to over $600 billion in the past few years, the current $12 billion leeway  to increase the portfolio during the intermeeting period continues to shrink as a  percentage of SOMA’s now-larger size  Several times this year we have nearly hit  the upper limit of the leeway, particularly in long intermeeting periods such as the  one just concluded The Desk has managed to remain within the current limit, and in  the medium term I expect we can continue to do so  Still, given the expected growth  of currency and in turn of SOMA’s portfolio, this limit will become increasingly  binding Therefore, I expect to return at a future meeting to request an increase in the  intermeeting leeway to a level higher than $12 billion     Mr Chairman, there were no foreign operations in this period; I will need a vote   to ratify the domestic operations   "
6864,2002-08-13,"1 Thank you, Mr Chairman  Good morning  I’ll be referring to the  charts that were circulated a short time ago  On the first page, the top panel graphs  US and euro-area three-month interbank cash deposits rates as well as rates three  months forward and nine months forward  The US rates are in red, and those for the  euro area are in green The US cash three-month deposit rates edged lower by a few  basis points in the intermeeting period  But the three-month forward rate fell about  30 basis points and now trades slightly below the current three-month cash rate  The  three-month rate nine months forward fell nearly 1 percentage point  All of these  rates were influenced by lower equity prices, economic data that came in weaker than  the market had hoped, and budding expectations of lower official rates at some point   The euro-area rates, shown by the green line, exhibit a similar if somewhat less  pronounced pattern in recent months  Forward rates for the euro area are now at or  below cash rates The market’s fling in early May with a possible tightening of  policy has evaporated, as market participants downgraded their forecasts of the  economic situation in the euro area and as the euro’s appreciation came to be viewed  as doing some of the ECB’s work for it  In the bottom panel, Japanese short-term  rates continued to stay low, and there’s not very much to say there  US Treasury  yields moved lower in the intermeeting period, responding to the same economic and  equity market news that affected US forward rates  Liquidity in the US Treasury  market has been good, as is the case generally in the mortgage backed and swaps  markets     But one segment that has frayed a bit is the corporate sector, which is covered on  page 2 The top panel on page 2 shows—with the dark bars—weekly issuance of  investment-grade corporate debt for the year to date  March and early spring were  active, as many corporations termed out commercial paper into longer-term liabilities   Issuance subsequently turned down and in the most recent weeks has slowed to a  trickle Perhaps there are seasonal effects, though that is only part of the story  As  depicted by the red line, issuance held up during this period in 2001 with the  exception of the July 4 week, which is always a week when there’s little or no  activity On the demand side, investors who have taken losses in their portfolios in  recent months have been reluctant to expand the amount of credit risk in their  holdings And on the supply side, companies appear to be a bit more restrained about  raising funds in the current atmosphere   The middle panel depicts the spread over Treasuries of investment-grade debt  since April 1 This is a Lehman Brothers index, which indicated a spread that was  hovering mostly between 175 and 200 basis points for much of the spring  That was  an already elevated spread, but perhaps understandable given the accounting and  corporate governance issues that investors have had to factor into their pricing  From  late June until early August, spreads widened another 50 basis points, to more than   1 Materials used by Mr Kos are appended to this transcript (appendix 1)                  August 13, 2002 5 of 92  250 basis points Liquidity in the corporate sector decreased during this period, with  dealers widening out spreads and reducing the amount for which a quote would be  good down to about $5 million in many cases  This has made it very difficult for  investors to transfer larger positions   While telecom names have been problematic for some time, new sectors have  become tainted  Energy trading and power companies are one example  And in the  past few weeks, the bonds of the auto companies have also been repriced downward   Representative of that, I’ve shown in the bottom left panel the spreads over Treasuries  of Ford Motor Credit and GMAC bonds since July 23 The spreads for both have  widened sharply in the two weeks, particularly for Ford, which was hit by rumors of a  possible downgrade The 7¼ percent bond of 2011 widened from 350 to 450 basis  points, and other Ford bonds rose to as high as 500 basis points over Treasuries in the  past few trading days The bottom right-hand panel depicts the bid-asked spread,  expressed in basis points, for the same two bonds shown at left  This spread in a  normal environment might be 2 or 3 basis points  By late July it had already widened  out to 5 basis points for GMAC and 10 basis points for Ford Motor Credit  The  spreads then ballooned to 20 and 30 basis points, respectively, in the first seven or  eight trading sessions in August     As the equity markets declined and fixed income markets turned volatile, the  price of insurance expressed by implied volatilities rose  The top panel on page 3  graphs the implied volatility on the S&P 100 equity index, which had been rising  steadily since late May but spiked higher in July and peaked at about 50 percent in  late July and again in early August  This is slightly higher than the peaks reached in  1998 and higher than the peak in September 2001 after the terrorist attacks  The  middle panel shows the volatility index for short and intermediate swaptions  These  are implied volatilities on options that give the holder the right but not the obligation  to exercise and roll into an interest rate swap  These instruments are used extensively  in hedging operations, especially by mortgage investors  Both indexes have hit very  high levels recently The short-term swaption index has nearly doubled to almost  45 percent By way of comparison, that index peaked at about 20 percent in 1998 and  at 36 percent in the aftermath of September 11  The intermediate-term index is also  at elevated levels and is currently near levels observed in October 1998  In contrast,  implied volatilities on currency options rose in late June but quickly began to trend  lower again None of the three major currency pairs is now near the peak levels  observed in either 1998 or 2001 Part of the reason currency volatilities have been  restrained is perhaps that speculative positions appear to be relatively small; hence  there is less demand by that segment for hedging purposes  It may also reflect the  market’s lack of conviction about the future course of volatility in exchange rates, as  the major economies are expected to move broadly in sync   Turning to page 4, the top panel graphs the dollar’s exchange rate against the  euro, the yen, the Swiss franc, the Canadian dollar, and the Australian dollar re- indexed to April 1 The dollar had been falling against all major currencies through  mid-June, and it continued to depreciate against the euro, the yen, and the Swiss               August 13, 2002 6 of 92  franc But the US dollar actually began to appreciate against the Australian and  Canadian dollars, as investors came to view a slowdown in the United States as  adverse for major commodity currencies  More recently, the reassessment of growth  prospects in Europe has resulted at least in a pause in the dollar’s trend to the  downside against other currencies The reduced growth prospects overseas can also  be seen in equity markets  The middle panel depicts changes in the S&P 500 and  major global equity indexes since April 1  All major indexes are lower, though those  for France and Germany, with heavy representations of telecom and media firms,  have performed worse than the others  Finally, in the bottom panel is the spread on  ten-year minus two-year government yields for the United States, Canada, Japan, the  United Kingdom, and Germany  As growth expectations have come down, the curves  have steepened, primarily by virtue of the two-year note declining faster than the ten- year note in each of these countries  The exception, of course, is Japan, where yields  at the short end can’t go any lower than they are now   Mr Chairman, there were no foreign operations for the System account in this   period, and I will need a vote to ratify our domestic operations  I would be happy to   take any questions Thank you    I don’t know that there was any single event  There were rumors at about   that time that Ford Motor might be downgraded  Since then those rumors have taken on even   more steam     Yes, I agree with that Again, what seemed to be involved was a liquidity   shift and not really a single event  Now, corporate governance and accounting stories were   circulating, but these companies were not tied to those  I think that’s one of the more interesting   aspects about these bonds The issuers are not in industries that have been tainted by those   problems, which does point to some interesting questions             August 13, 2002 7 of 92  This is a very short period; it’s only about two weeks Again, these spreads   had already begun to rise earlier They were then stable for a few days and subsequently began   rising again If I could approach your question in a slightly different way—I think if we looked   at a number of companies, the patterns in their spreads might depend in part not only on   perceived creditworthiness but on how much debt they have outstanding  Ford Motor Credit is, I   believe, the largest issuer in the bond market  It’s a very, very large issuer, and of course,   GMAC is as well A year or two ago investors wanted to hold these jumbo issues  They were   considered desirable because investors perceived them as having a lot of liquidity  Now, we   know what has happened to some of the jumbo issues like those of WorldCom  Suddenly   investors don’t want to have these big positions on their books  They actually prefer to have debt   of issuers that don’t come to market that much, which will help to diversify their portfolios  So   to some degree a firm’s having lots of paper out there was perceived to be an advantage from the   investor’s perspective two years ago, and it is not viewed as advantageous today   Well, it’s a mix  To some extent it may be that investors have some   questions about the auto companies specifically  They’re selling a lot of cars—auto sales have            August 13, 2002 8 of 92  been strong—and yet they don’t seem to be making any money  So there may be a repricing of   their creditworthiness as well   Exactly   I don’t have the exact numbers in mind, but if I remember correctly, they   haven’t had quite this kind of deleterious performance   Broadly, they do tend to move together, but we can have periods when the   correlation is fairly low  It seems that at times—such as now, when the perception about the              August 13, 2002 10 of 92  outlook for the economy is changing—they tend to move together  At other times, they’ll move   on local factors and not as much on international ones   I think the answer to your question is “yes, often”  But at times the   correlation will break down     Well, the amounts of outstanding commercial paper have come down  I   would note two developments in particular in that market  One is that commercial paper for a   long time was a very low cost way of raising money  But having seen the commercial paper   market shut down to so many issuers, other corporations now are thinking twice about how to   structure their liabilities They’re being a little more cautious about how much they want to rely   on commercial paper There is also an interesting effect between commercial paper backup lines   and credit default swaps That is, a firm wants to issue commercial paper and needs to have   backup lines of credit The firm gets these cheap backup lines, and the people who provide the   backup lines then run out and hedge through the credit default swaps  We then have this effect   that Vince mentioned that the credit default swap rates go up and that makes it appear as if the   market has less confidence in the creditworthiness of those specific issuers  It has this   unintended consequence for the issuer And I think people are finally beginning to figure that   out To some degree I think issuers are having some second thoughts about how much paper                      August 13, 2002 11 of 92  they want to issue, given that there’s this avenue through which other people might view them as   being less creditworthy  "
6889,2002-09-24,"1  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the charts that were  circulated just a little while ago The top panel of the page 1 shows three-month US  dollar cash deposit rates, the libor fixing, and also the three-, six-, and nine-month  forward deposit rates, from June 3 to September 20  Since your last meeting, three- month cash and forward rates traded in a narrow range as market participants reacted  to mixed economic data  The three- and six-month forward rates continued to trade  below the cash rate, suggesting that market participants were assigning some  probability to a reduction in short-term rates, especially once the equity markets  began to decline again after the early August bounce     While short-dated deposit rates moved in a narrow range, Treasury yields fell,  especially in the middle of the yield curve  As shown in the two middle panels on  page 1, yields on Treasury issues have been falling for some time  The two-year note  was yielding about 188 percent this morning, a new low for that security, with the  latest decline in yield coinciding with the equity market sell-off  The most  pronounced decline in yields since the middle of August occurred in the five- and ten- year areas The five-year yield was at about 270 percent this morning, and the ten- year yield was at about 363 percent  The explanations for the sharp fall in yields are  many, though none by itself is fully satisfying Market participants have cited a weak  economy, although interestingly most forecasts for third-quarter GDP were raised in  recent weeks  Poor business sentiment was also cited, as were the corporate scandals,  geopolitical concerns, and occasional rumors about problems at particular financial  institutions   However, since the biggest moves were in the middle of the curve, it would seem  that mortgage hedging was in part the cause and in part an accelerator of the sharp  downward move in yields As interest rates declined since December, the volume of  mortgage refinancing increased, prepayments shortened the duration of mortgage  portfolios, and the quickest way for a portfolio manager to bring the portfolio  duration into alignment was to buy noncallable Treasuries  Those typically are in the  five- and ten-year sectors An added factor in recent weeks has been the expectation  by many market participants of increased hedging needs of Fannie Mae, which last  week reported a duration gap of minus fourteen months compared with its target of  plus or minus six months  Apparently many dealers and investors did some back-of­  1 The materials used by Mr Kos are appended to this transcript (appendix 1)              September 24, 2002 4 of 115  the-envelope calculations and concluded that Fannie would need to buy a very large  amount of Treasuries to close the gap  While there is no evidence that the  government-sponsored entity conducted any such transactions in the Treasury market,  those who cleverly thought they would front-run Fannie may have added to the  buying wave Not surprisingly in this kind of market, volatilities have been high   The mortgage hedging needs show up in volatility measures as well  The market for  options on swaps is a key risk-management tool among investors in mortgage-backed  securities The bottom panel depicts the Mortgage Bankers Association refinancing  index and the three-month option on a ten-year swap  Implied volatilities have risen  to more than 30 percent along with the recent refinancing wave, as investors tried to  stay ahead of the prepayment cycle     Let me turn to the corporate market on page 2  During the summer the corporate  bond market was one of reduced issuance, wider spreads relative to Treasuries, wider  bid-offered spreads, and generally reduced liquidity, making it difficult for investors  to adjust the risk in their portfolios  In the intermeeting period, the situation  improved at the margin, but that improvement was from some very extreme  conditions, and sentiment in this market remains very fragile  Spreads on investment- grade debt narrowed to about 225 basis points—still very wide but better than early  August levels—as shown in the top panel Issuance has also picked up, as you can  see in the middle panel, though the markets have been very discriminating about  which companies have had access  Conditions in the secondary market have  improved since your last meeting  Liquidity is reportedly better  And the very wide  bid-offered spreads reverted to more-normal levels in the week or two after the last  meeting  The high-yield sector showed some signs of improvement in mid-August,  as the equity markets rallied and the August 14 deadline for certification passed  But  in September, issuance has been weak, and spreads again are beginning to widen   Finally, in the commercial paper market, there has been at least some stability at  lower levels of issuance I would note that one market that has continued to function  well is the asset-backed market, including the market for asset-backed commercial  paper But even this development suggests that investors are demanding obligations  that have an added dose of protection   I think investors can be excused if they remain skittish—as one might expect after  this year’s concerns about accounting, corporate governance, and reduced earning  prospects—and if they feel a bit burned by the corporate market  The bottom panel  graphs the monthly incremental return that an investor has earned from corporate  bonds relative to Treasuries of the same duration  In the early to mid-1990s, the  monthly incremental return was about 5 basis points, with a standard deviation of  about 29 basis points Since 1998 that incremental return has actually been minus  13 basis points—that is, the return on Treasuries has been higher—and the standard  deviation has more than doubled  In short, investors who have concluded that the  corporate market has high risks and low returns would not be out of bounds, at least  based on the experience of the past four years or so                September 24, 2002 5 of 115  Turning to page 3, Japanese equity markets have fluctuated widely as another  fiscal period end approaches In the run-up to March 31, almost six months ago, there  was talk of a crisis in the banking system, given the decline in equity prices on the  Nikkei to below 10,000 In response, the authorities imposed a series of rule changes  on short sales, which triggered a sharp short covering rally  Last week the markets  had to absorb a different surprise when the Bank of Japan announced that it would  buy stocks directly from the banks  The announcement had a short-lived effect on the  equity market, though bank stocks—the green line in the top panel—did bounce  The  effect quickly dissipated since the market is waiting to see what else, if anything, will  be done by the government to clean up the bad debt situation  Interestingly, the effect  on the bond market so far has been more pronounced  The ten-year JGB yield, shown  in the middle left panel, was heading toward 1 percent as gloom about Japan’s  prospects built up  Over the past three trading sessions the yield shot up from about  103 to 130 percent, and this morning it was at about l28 percent  The irony is that  in the near term the announcement has not done very much for stocks but has  adversely affected JGB prices, which itself is a major asset class for Japanese banks   While the long end of the curve is backing up, the short end is in demand, at least  for the time being, even at rates that are effectively or actually at zero  The Ministry  of Finance’s Treasury bill and financing bill auctions have been stopping out at about  01 basis point Now, you might think this would be an asset that would not be in  much demand  But the bid-to-cover ratios in recent auctions have been about 700 to  1 or 800 to 1, and in fact, it appears that about half the accepted bids at recent  auctions were at par That is, investors were incurring the administrative cost to buy  the bills at no return rather than take the credit risk of just leaving the money in a  commercial bank   As for the banks themselves, they, too, have a lot of cash looking for a home  The  middle right panel shows the growth of deposits since the early 1990s and also the  contraction of loans during that same period  With that much excess cash sloshing  around the markets—and little in the way of investment opportunity—market  participants expect the current environment to persist and, if anything, see more of the  yield curve get pulled down toward zero The bottom panel graphs the current yield  curve, the solid red line, along with two other snapshots—from one year ago and  from eighteen months ago before the Bank of Japan reverted to its zero interest rate  policy The current two-year yield is at about 5 basis points, and the middle of the  curve is being tugged lower by the weight of all that cash looking for a home  As yet,  however, this strategy has not helped to pull Japan out of its period of stagnation     Turning to euro area markets briefly on page 4, the top panel graphs the three- month euro deposit libor rate, shown in black, and the three-month, six-month, and  nine-month forward rates of that same three-month deposit  Those forward rates,  which earlier this summer had been trading at a premium to the cash rate are now  trading about 30 basis point below it, despite word from the ECB suggesting that it is  very comfortable with the current stance of policy  In part the same set of economic  and political factors that affected US expectations are affecting euro area rates                                   September 24, 2002 6 of 115  Forecasts for growth are receding quickly, a fact that has also been reflected in  equity markets  European stock indexes have fallen sharply this summer  Since  June 3, the Dow-Jones euro stocks index—a broad index of major companies in the  euro area, represented by the solid red line—has fallen more than 30 percent,  including declines yesterday and today The sector that has been hit hardest and led  the decline is the insurance sector—the dashed red line—which has seen its market  value cut in half during that time  Europe’s insurance industry has been hit by losses  not only related to the terrorist attacks, the floods in Europe, asbestos suits, and the  like but also notably by the sharp drop in equity prices and losses in their credit  portfolios One question that has been asked over the past year or two, as the levels  of defaults grew, was which balance sheets were absorbing these losses since few  indications seemed to be popping up with banks and securities houses  Well, it has  taken a while, but we finally seem to be getting some of the answer  Just for  comparison, the US insurance sector has also seen its shares clipped  The dashed  blue line is the S&P insurance sub-index, which fell about 20 percent over that  period, about the same as the broader index     Following the pattern of the US and other major markets, long-term bond yields  in the euro area have declined as well The yield on the ten-year bund to take one  example—shown in the bottom panel—has fallen about 90 basis points since early  June, including this morning’s price action  Given the weakness in major European  economies, one might ask why yields, which are still nearly 65 basis points above  comparable US yields, did not drop even more  Part of the reason might be the  outsized influence of the mortgage market in the United States, but part may also be  related to concerns about backsliding on Stability Growth Pact targets by several of  the major euro area governments   Finally, let me say a word on reserves  The graph on page 5 shows the growth of  currency over the past two years During that period, currency grew mostly in a  monthly range of 7 to 12 percent; through June the growth rate fluctuated around  10 percent, which was above longer-term trends  Since June, the monthly growth rate  has fallen sharply into the low single digits and shows little sign of a turnaround   This has allowed the Desk to slow its outright purchases of Treasury securities and  also to reduce the size of its long-term repo book from about $18 billion this spring to  about $11 billion now   Mr Chairman, there were no foreign operations in this period  I will need a vote  for approval of the domestic operations  And I’d be happy to answer any questions   It’s both domestic and international                   September 24, 2002 7 of 115  It’s everything It’s from a number of regions, and there’s also a slowing in   the domestic component  Really, the growth in currency is slowing in all areas   It’s an excellent question  And the problem at least in part is that the data are   not great What one hears are anecdotal reports        Yes, but I think what people typically focus on is the cost of credit, which   often is provided by the banks So if the question is what is the cost of credit and the borrower is   getting credit from the banks, that information is a little harder to get I don’t have the exact   spreads on the tip of my tongue   Oh, do you? Good   Let me make two points, President Jordan  First, the commentary from the   markets was that generic mortgage hedging and hedging of mortgage-backed securities   portfolios was associated with the decline in yields, which was one aspect of the story  Then in   the last week, since Fannie Mae announced its duration gap, this other aspect arose, which was   the expectation that Fannie Mae itself would be jumping into the hedging game  Now, in talking   with dealers, nobody has seen any of these flows And Fannie Mae in other settings has said that   they really don’t use Treasuries in this way There are other alternatives they could use to try to   bring down the duration gap—a step-up in purchases of mortgage-backed securities, for           September 24, 2002 11 of 115  example, or an accelerated calling of debt—short of actually doing what people expect them to   do And Fannie is fairly sophisticated, enough so that they probably would not do what   everybody expects   I can’t speak for the interworkings of how they manage their hedging  What   I was trying to do was to explain the commentary in the Treasury market  My point was that   Fannie Mae has other means of hedging—alternatives in terms of accepting the risks, which may   have an impact on their earnings if rates go the wrong way on them  So my message was that the   course of action that was expected by some in the market and that was showing up in Wall Street    Journal articles was not necessarily the one they had to follow     That’s a possibility, yes   Well, I think some of that is going on as well, though perhaps not as much as   in Argentina where people have been buying safes  But certainly we have heard some   commentary about people keeping cash as opposed to putting it into a bank  Let me make one   other point regarding your question about why residents haven’t taken their money out of Japan    There is a risk aversion aspect related to the fact that several times in the last ten years when   money has started to flow out there have been exchange rate losses  The most prominent case   was in 1988 when the exchange rate began to depreciate rapidly and the Ministry of Finance   began intervening aggressively to cut off that avenue  They basically said we’re not going to let   the yen depreciate As a consequence, there was a 30 yen swing the other way in a matter of   days That kind of experience is something that stays with people; they remember the pain, and   that makes them risk averse for the future until that memory wanes  So I think that’s another   aspect that we shouldn’t overlook   Well, I think in part there may be an aversion to credit risk  Earlier this year   we were hearing that one thing the Japanese banks were doing to fund their dollar assets was   foreign exchange swaps, swapping US dollars for yen  They were doing these trades with   foreign banks, non-Japanese banks, which then had yen that they were raising effectively at   negative interest rates So what one could then do was to invest at zero and still capture a   positive margin  You would rather buy a bill at zero, let’s say, than put funds into a bank where   you didn’t like the credit risk So that was one class of action where it was rational and it made   sense There are other classes I gather that I’m having a harder time trying to explain  "
6913,2002-11-06,"1  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the charts that were   distributed a short while ago The top panel of the first page shows the three-month   US dollar libor fixing in black and the three-month deposit rates three, six, and nine   months forward in red Forward rates had a minor roller coaster ride, first declining   immediately after your September meeting, rising in mid-October as equities bounced   off their October 9 lows, and then heading downward again as the economic data   were perceived as pointing to economic weakness  Although much of the decline in   forward rates had occurred by October 26, the day of the Washington Post article that   heightened expectations about a possible ease in policy, the article did strengthen   market participants’ convictions about the near-term direction of policy The three-   and six-month forward rates both are now trading below cash rates  In the Treasury   market, the two-year note moved broadly in line with shifting expectations for official   policy The yield fluctuated widely, going as low as 166 percent on October 9 and as   high as 222 percent around midmonth  The long end of the curve was affected by   many of the same factors as the short end, though the long sector once again was   probably affected by hedging of mortgage-backed securities (MBS) portfolios      The middle panel graphs the ten-year yield in blue on the left scale and an   estimate of the duration of outstanding mortgage-backed securities—in red on the   right scale—since June Many mortgages had been clustered in the 6½ percent   coupon bucket and, with rates falling, these mortgages became attractive to refinance    Hence the estimated duration moved even lower from June to September  To hedge   against that shortening of duration, MBS investors could buy Treasuries or fixed   receiver swaps, either of which would have at least some impact on yield levels,   given the size of mortgage market  As that wave of hedging slowed, Treasury yields   suddenly jumped about 62 basis points in mid-October  Some investors, in fact,   reportedly overdid their hedging and in mid-October had to sell some of the positions   they had just bought The other factor that had a day-to-day effect on yields—and   even an intraday effect at times—was the movement in equity markets  The bottom   panel shows one way of looking at this relationship  It graphs the 100-day rolling   correlation between the S&P 500 and the ten-year note yield since January 1988  I   would note two points First, for much of this period the correlation was modestly    1 The materials used by Mr Kos are appended to this transcript (appendix 1)                           November 6, 2002 4 of 122  negative, but in late 1997 it abruptly turned positive and, though choppy, has on  balance remained positive Second, the correlation, which was already high, has been  increasing this year and is now higher than it was even during September 1998     The intermeeting period continued to be difficult in the corporate bond market   Investment-grade spreads—shown in the top left panel on page 2—remained  elevated, though they are off the peaks they reached a few weeks ago and also earlier  this summer  Meanwhile, high-yield spreads—shown in the top right panel—topped  1,000 basis points in early October before easing very slightly  The only other time  that index exceeded 1,000 basis points was in January 1991  Fixed-income investors,  whether in investment-grade or high-yield securities—most of which are measured  against the benchmark index—are in risk-averse mode, after having taken hits in  many parts of their portfolios  Another way of looking at the corporate bond market  is to take the investment-grade universe and divide the bonds into buckets according  to their spread relative to Treasuries The middle panel shows three snapshots of  this—as of October 25 in 2000, 2001, and 2002 The percentage of the investment- grade universe trading at up to 100 basis points over Treasuries has been hovering at  about 10 percent over these past couple of years  More than half of the investment- grade issues traded at a spread of between 100 and 200 basis points two years ago, as  shown by the tall red bar That category has now declined to about 40 percent,  reflecting in part a migration of credit downwards  But perhaps the most striking  development is the proportion of corporate bonds that are still investment grade but  are trading at more than 400 basis points over Treasuries  From a small number  earlier, that group now makes up one-fifth of the market, as you can see by the tall  green bar on the far right   That higher number reflects mostly the repricing of the debt obligations of some  very large issuers, a phenomenon illustrated in the bottom panel  The panel depicts  for the year 2002 to date the spreads on the fixed-income securities of four of the  largest issuers All four of these companies have seen a doubling or even tripling of  their spreads at times  And while they are still investment grade in name, they are  priced as if they were high yield Because of their high and regular issuance, the  bonds of these companies comprise meaningful chunks of mainstream fixed-income  benchmark indexes and are widely owned Now, I should note that not all large  issuers have experienced a widening of their spreads  For example, Bank of America  is trading at a spread of about 105 basis points, and Citigroup, despite negative  publicity, is at about 115 basis points     Also, while liquidity in the corporate bond market has been episodic, it has shown  some signs of improvement recently  Meanwhile, liquidity in Treasury, MBS, and  asset-backed securities markets has generally been good throughout the period   Finally, I should note that the level of outstanding nonfinancial commercial paper  continued to decline in recent weeks and is now nearly 40 percent lower than it was a  year ago And as we approach year-end, the A1-P1/A2-P2 spreads have begun to  widen just a bit, especially for thirty-day paper, but at least so far that widening has  been much less pronounced than we saw a year ago                     November 6, 2002 5 of 122  Turning to Europe on page 3, the top panel graphs the three-month euro deposit  libor fixing and three-, six-, and nine-month forward rates  Forward rates, which  were trading above cash rates early in the summer, have been steadily declining as  forecasts for euro-area growth have continued to be reduced  Forward rate  agreements are now trading below cash rates, and the market widely expects a  reduction in the ECB’s official target rate before year-end, perhaps as early as  tomorrow  With Europe’s slowdown, euro-area corporate spreads have also widened,  although perhaps not by as much as parts of our own bond market  In Europe the  widening has been most pronounced at lower quality levels, such as the BBB, shown  in the green line of the middle panel  Meanwhile, issuance—shown in the bottom  panel—has been falling as in the United States, but the full credit picture in Europe is  more difficult to gauge given the greater reliance on bank financing by European  companies   Moving to Japan on page 4, the market there has been on a bit of a roller coaster  ride recently, reacting to every little report about the likelihood, timing, size, and  speed of the government’s plan to clean up the banking system  At the time of your  last meeting, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) had just announced its intention to buy equities  from Japanese commercial banks  At first, Japanese government bond (JGB) yields  spiked higher to about 13 percent, but they quickly retraced that rise as the market  began to doubt the economic significance of the BOJ’s announcement Then the  cabinet reshuffle and the nomination of a new economic and regulatory czar raised  the possibility that stronger action might be forthcoming to cleanse the  nonperforming loan problem  While that might have been viewed as a negative for  JGBs, given the prospect of large government expenditures, in the short run the effect  has been to firm up sentiment that keeping money in the banking system is risky  So  JGBs again have become attractive as a safe haven  The government’s plan, when  finally announced, was viewed as rather general and a bit less than was hoped for or  expected With reform on a slower track again, JGBs continued to decline below  1 percent The last time that JGB yields were below 1 percent was in November  1998 The other development was the BOJ’s own announcement on October 30 that  it would increase the pace of its JGB purchases and its current account balances  target But that was shrugged off, as much as anything, by the marketplace   Meanwhile, bank stocks fell with the cabinet reshuffle, suggesting that investors in  these stocks at least were taking the probability of reform more seriously  The  biggest fall in stock prices—the bottom panel—was for stocks of the three large  banks thought to be at risk of a government takeover   Finally, let me say a word on reserves The chart on page 5 depicts, for each  maintenance period, average values for the three basic components of our total  holdings of domestic financial assets—that is, for the permanent System Open Market  Account, long-term repurchase agreements, and our short-term operations  This chart  shows actual or projected values for the one-year period from February 2002 through  February 2003, starting and ending at the seasonal trough for currency Through July  2002, currency growth continued to contribute to a steady expansion of our total                       November 6, 2002 6 of 122  domestic financial holdings, achieved almost entirely with growth in our permanent  SOMA holdings From July to October, the total size of the portfolio generally has  been flat, and it even shrank a bit recently  This shrinkage reflected essentially flat  currency growth combined with movement in some autonomous factors that added to  reserve balances, most noticeably the foreign repo pool  To maintain the total  domestic portfolio at the appropriate level, long-term repos were compressed, falling  from $18 billion in June to just about $6 billion in late October  Having the long- term repo book allowed us to compress our balance sheet quickly without selling  assets from SOMA or engaging in longer-term draining operations     In upcoming maintenance periods we face seasonal currency growth, and we  expect a resumption of seasonally adjusted currency growth to more normal levels   The resulting reserve needs will be met primarily with a buildup of long-term repos   Some resumption of outright SOMA purchases is also planned, but we will proceed  with that very slowly for the time being By the end of the seasonal currency swing,  long-term repos will have been built back up to about $16 billion, a level at which we  plan to hold them steady for a while   Mr Chairman, there were no foreign operations in this period  I will need a vote   to approve our domestic operations      The person responsible [Ms Perelmuter] is to my left   Yes, I think you can see that views had already been moving toward an   expectation of an easing move But there’s always the issue of how much conviction lies behind               November 6, 2002 7 of 122  that expectation and the degree of dispersion around it  To some  extent what Berry’s article did   was not necessarily to lock in that expectation but to raise the level of conviction about it  Even   if the expectations themselves didn’t change, the level of conviction did    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Recently, Vincent Reinhart and I sent a  memo to the Committee on the SOMA alternative assets study  Before we turn to the  main part of today’s discussion, let me just remind you that in March we sought  guidance from the Committee on prioritizing resources for the continuation of our  work on this issue  At that time the Committee instructed the staff to focus first on  the possibility of buying Ginnie Maes outright for the portfolio and second on the  possibility of accepting foreign sovereign debt as collateral on repos  But Committee  members indicated that to the extent there was a resource conflict—and there was—  the staff was to finish contingency planning for tri-party repos at our third site    So from the time of that meeting through about the August-September time frame  we were focusing almost exclusively on finishing the work on contingency planning,  and only recently have we begun to look at the issues of how Ginnie Maes might fit  into our outright portfolio Given that limited amount of time, most of our work has  been in the area of preparatory planning—thinking about how long certain tasks  might take, especially some of the settlement accounting, front office work, risk  management, and very critically the systems changes that might need to be made   Each of these issues is surmountable, but the work involved is time consuming  And  if the Committee were to approve expanding the allowable assets in the System Open  Market Account to include Ginnie Mae securities, the time before we actually would  begin buying them would be measured not in weeks but more likely in months and  quarters It probably would take at least eighteen months or so before we could make  all the necessary arrangements and begin to implement such a decision     In the interim, another element of the work that the FOMC had commissioned is  ready for the Committee’s review, and that is the study the staff has finished on the  auction credit facility  Rick Lang led that work, so let me turn the floor over to him  to describe the paper on that issue, which you also received recently   What I would propose then is that at some point over the next few months, at   a meeting next year, we come back to the Committee with a proposal for what a Ginnie Mae   program would look like  That is, we’d try to give you some concrete sense of the size of the   program that we would envision and how we would buy the Ginnie Maes  With the front office   there are some accounting issues that we might be able to resolve by then  We would try to              November 6, 2002 111 of 122  assess the implications in terms of costs so that you have a sense of what it would cost the   System or the New York Fed to do this  So the next document would be more concrete than the   general approach that we have taken to date when we’ve been looking at alternative approaches    That would be my suggestion for some time early next year    "
6938,2002-12-10,"1  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the charts that were  circulated a few minutes ago  The top panel on the first page graphs three-month  cash deposit rates for the dollar and the euro as well as three-month deposit rates  three months and nine months forward  The US three-month deposit rate—the solid  red line—declined in anticipation of an easing at the Committee’s November 6  meeting and fell further after the 50 basis point reduction in the target fed funds rate   While the three-month forward rate tracked movements in the cash rate, the nine- month forward rate diverged from the cash rate and actually rose about 25 basis  points over the intermeeting period, as many in the market began to weigh the  possibility that the end of the easing cycle had been reached  In recent days, the  three-month forward rate has fallen slightly, reacting to some weaker than expected  data, including the ISM data and the unemployment rate   Meanwhile, deposit rates in the euro area also were declining steadily in the  intermeeting period, as the market increasingly anticipated an easing move by the  ECB at its December 5 meeting Deposit rates in the euro area continued to fall in the  past few days, in reaction to the ECB’s surprising 50 basis point cut in its minimum  refinancing rate In contrast to the relationship between cash and forward rates  observed in the United States, forward rates in the euro area continued to trade at or  below cash rates, suggesting that market participants expect further easing by the  ECB   US Treasury yields have fluctuated widely, tending to rise after the Committee’s  November meeting as risk aversion receded  But yields subsequently declined as  several weak data reports again attracted flows into government bonds  The bottom  panel of chart 1 shows recent rates on the two-year Treasury note along with the  target fed funds rate The yield on the two-year note actually rose in the aftermath of  the Committee’s November meeting, and the spread to the target funds rate widened  to 75 basis points in late November, the widest such spread since early July  One of  the reasons cited was the more positive sentiment triggered by the easing action itself  Second, some participants viewed the election results as positive  Third, technical  factors related to positioning of the two-year note also may have played a role   Finally, as I noted earlier, there was a sense that the November cut in the funds rate  was perhaps the last move in the easing cycle   1 The materials used by Mr Kos are appended to this transcript (appendix 1)                                December 10, 2002 4 of 87  Turning to page 2, the situation in credit markets has improved markedly since the  last meeting  Bid-offered spreads have narrowed to more-normal levels, liquidity is  improved, and issuance has revived in recent weeks  Spreads relative to Treasuries  have narrowed, in some cases significantly  As shown in the top left panel, the spread  of mortgage-backed securities to Treasuries declined only slightly since the last  meeting, but it had declined about 25 basis points since mid-October, to below  100 basis points   More pronounced has been the improvement in investment-grade corporate  spreads—shown in the top right panel—which declined from a recent peak of  220 basis points to about 140 basis points  The spreads for high-yield bonds—the  middle left panel—exhibited a similar narrowing, falling from over 1,000 basis points  to about 800 basis points The EMBI+ spread, driven in part by a recovery in Brazil,  also narrowed similarly    Another way to view the situation in the corporate debt market is to look at how  much of the outstanding stock is trading at distressed levels  For this exercise, we  arbitrarily defined distressed investment-grade bonds as those trading at a spread over  Treasuries of 500 or more basis points, and we defined distressed high-yield bonds as  those with a spread of 1,500 basis points or more  As shown in the lower panel by the  red bar on the left, on October 15 about 12 percent of the investment-grade universe  met that definition of distressed  That percentage dropped sharply one month later in  the days immediately after the Committee’s meeting, and it fell still more as of this  past Friday as shown by the green bar on the bottom left  As can been seen on the  right side of the bottom panel, there has been improvement in the high-yield sector as  well, though proportionately not quite as much as in the investment-grade sector         Looking at volatility across asset markets—page 3—volatility measures have  trended lower recently, but they have risen somewhat in recent days, coinciding with  the release of some weaker-than-expected data  The S&P 100 volatility index, or  VIX, fell from about 50 percent in early October to about 26 percent in late  November, coinciding with the rally in the major indexes  In recent days, this  volatility index rose again into the low 30s as equity prices began to decline  Interest  rate implied volatilities also fell sharply over the intermeeting period  The middle  panel depicts the implied volatility on eurodollar deposit futures contracts  From  extremely elevated levels of between 50 and 60 percent in late October, it fell sharply  in the days around the Committee’s meeting  Even though it has drifted back up to  about 30 percent, still a relatively high level for this contract, it is half the level of  only six weeks ago Finally, twelve-month foreign exchange volatilities for the major  currency pairs have remained low and short-dated volatilities were lower still  In  particular, the one-month volatility of the euro-dollar cross rate was briefly below  7 percent, as the currency pair appeared stuck near parity   Let me turn briefly to the behavior of the commercial paper market, as we  approach year-end The top panel of page 4 graphs A2/P2–A1/P1 spreads from  September 1 to the end of February for the years 2000-01 and 2001-02; for the                     December 10, 2002 5 of 87  current year it shows the spreads from September 1, 2002, to date  The top panel  depicts this spread for thirty-day paper on the left and for ninety-day paper on the  right In 2000—the black line—the spread between A2/P2 and A1/P1 spiked sharply  in late November, triggered by the crisis in the California electricity market  Last  year—the gold line—spreads similarly widened, affected by both the aftermath of  September 11 and the Enron crisis  To date this year—the red line—spreads for both  maturities are only slightly wider, and market conditions reportedly are showing none  of the stress exhibited in the last few years      The bottom panel on page 4 graphs commercial paper spreads around the year­ end relative to Treasuries  The left side depicts yields on ninety-day A1/P1 paper  relative to three-month Treasury bills  The bottom right shows the same relationship  for A2/P2 paper Once again the black and gold lines represent the spreads for the  last two years, and the red line depicts the spreads for this year through last Friday   The rate on A1/P1 paper has barely budged relative to Treasuries, and that on A2/P2  paper has widened somewhat, though less than in previous years  The reduction in  risk aversion that helps explain the narrowing of credit spreads is probably relevant  here as well But the other factor at work is the notable shrinkage in the commercial  paper market in the past year, as the most vulnerable issuers withdrew from the  market and termed out their debt   Turning to page 5, European markets have coped with weak data, lower forecasts  of future growth, a weakening fiscal outlook in major countries, uncertainty about the  Stability and Growth Pact rules, and—until last week—uncertainty about the  willingness of the ECB to ease policy to counter slow growth  European equity  markets along with the US and other global markets fell in September and early  October before recovering somewhat  The German market lagged, as the outlook  regarding the strength of the German banking system in the near-term was viewed as  particularly bleak Despite that bleakness, in the euro area bond spreads narrowed in  line with global trends The middle panel graphs BBB-rated and A-rated bonds  relative to German ten-year bunds  The lower-rated BBB bonds in particular  narrowed sharply in relation to bunds  And issuance in the euro area bond market—  as shown in the bottom panel—reversed course in November, roughly tripling from  October’s depressed levels   Finally, turning to page 6, Japanese markets continue to be nothing if not  interesting The dollar-yen exchange rate, though trading in a relatively narrow range  recently, has been susceptible to bouts of short-term choppiness  Comments by  finance minister Shiokawa eight days ago, suggesting that an exchange rate of 150 to  160 per dollar was appropriate, initially weakened the yen  Mr Shiokawa backed off  in subsequent days, and the yen retraced its decline a bit, but on net it was modestly  weaker against most major currencies over the past month  Market participants  generally still presume that the Japanese authorities prefer a weaker yen, though so  far the price action has been limited  The fact that the exchange rate has been stable  in the face of these comments is viewed by some as evidence that statements by  officials have little effect beyond the very short run  But others note that the volatility                        December 10, 2002 6 of 87  has been low for another reason—because the Bush Administration has not engaged   in a tit-for-tat public exchange and reaction to comments by Japanese officials, such   as those made by Shiokawa  According to this view, it was those types of back-and­ forth exchanges that made markets nervous in previous years      In the fixed-income markets, the ten-year Japanese Government Bond (JGB) yield  has been stuck at around 1 percent despite the uncertainty about the Takenaka Plan,  which involves the potential for significantly higher issuance of JGBs  Indeed, the  JGB curve has trended down during 2002 The middle panel depicts two snapshots of  the JGB yield curve—as of January 2 of this year and as of yesterday  The entire  curve is lower, especially at the long end where thirty-year yields are about 65 basis  points below their levels at the beginning of the year  Finally, neither the Bank of  Japan’s announcement of its equity purchase plan in September nor the Takenaka  Plan has so far inspired confidence among equity investors  The Nikkei index has  traded mostly below 9000 in recent weeks, a level that is thought to be problematic  for portfolios of many banks and insurers  The Bank of Japan began its equity  purchases from banks on November 29; these purchases in the aggregate could be  rather modest at about 2 trillion yen     Mr Chairman, there were no foreign operations in this period  I will need a vote   to approve our domestic operations  And I’d be happy to take any questions    I think the lower refinancing risks probably were a factor, but the mortgage   market is rather complicated, and the optionality in mortgages is something that obviously is   hard to predict It’s difficult to disentangle the refinancing aspect of the mortgage market from   the broader trends that were narrowing spreads more generally  "
6964,2003-01-28,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  As this was the organizational meeting I thought   I would propose a couple of housekeeping items for the domestic authorization and the   “guidelines” for operations in federal agency issues, which go along with the authorization  I   would just say a few words on each   I am proposing that the Committee approve the Authorization for Domestic Open Market   Operations with one amendment  The amendment has to do with the minimum lending fee for   our securities lending program  When the Committee first approved this minimum lending fee, it   was set at 1 percent  That was a reasonable number given that interest rates were then far higher    With interest rates where they are today, there is the risk that if the general collateral rate goes   below 1 percent or if the Committee at some point should choose to lower interest rates to   1 percent or less, that would then effectively shut down the securities lending facility  If there   were some kind of disruption or otherwise a need for us to lend securities, it would not make   economic sense for anybody to borrow at a negative interest rate  So the proposal that I am   making is for the Committee to provide that the Manager would have discretion to set the rate   depending on the circumstances  Having said that, I must tell you that I have no intention of   actually changing the rate anytime soon if the Committee should approve the amendment  But,   again, this amendment would give the Manager discretion to act if need be  The objectives   would stay the same—that is, the program would remain a secondary source for borrowing   securities and a rather temporary source  I’d be happy to answer any questions on this proposal   January 28-29, 2003 5 of 195     Thank you  The second item has to do with the Guidelines for the Conduct   of System Operations in Federal Agency Issues  In August 1999, the Committee suspended four   paragraphs of these guidelines  Prior to that action, the guidelines had not been amended since   1977  In that year, agency issues were a large and actually growing portion of the System Open   Market Account  By 1981, agencies were 7 percent of SOMA holdings  Since then, that number   has been coming down, first because we stopped buying agencies and then because since the   mid-1990s we have allowed them to roll off at maturity  But as we expanded the collateral that   we take at the Desk, a couple of the provisions in the guidelines got in the way—inadvertently, I   think— of our accepting Ginnie Mae securities as collateral  So we had the odd case in which   we were able to take mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by government-sponsored   enterprises but not by Ginnie Mae   In 1999, the Committee took several steps to deal with potential liquidity strains in   money and financing markets in the period around the century date change  One such step was   to broaden the range of acceptable collateral for repos  The way the Committee did that was to   suspend temporarily—until April 30, 2000—paragraphs 3 to 6 of the guidelines  Every year   since then the Committee has extended the suspension of those paragraphs Since mortgage-  backed securities have become an almost routine part of System open market operations, rather   January 28-29, 2003 6 of 195    than my coming to you every year and asking for another annual suspension I am proposing that   the Committee repeal those four paragraphs  Given that agencies in the outright portion of the   portfolio are de minimis now and actually will be at zero by the end of the year, this should have   no material effect  But it is a cleanup of the existing guidelines for the Desk    Well, you ask a good question  In fact, the proposal brought to the   Committee in 1999 was to repeal the entire set of guidelines  As I understand it, there was a   view in the Committee that the first two paragraphs provided a sense of how the Committee felt   about federal agency issues  Retaining those two paragraphs didn’t constrain the Desk at all  So,   certainly if the entire set of guidelines were repealed, that would be fine from my perspective    But it’s up to the Committee whether it wants to retain some sense of how it views agencies in   this context    Finally, the third item is a proposal to renew without amendment the Foreign   Currency Authorization, the Foreign Currency Directive, and the Procedural Instructions with   Respect to Foreign Currency Operations  2  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the package of charts  that is being circulated  The first graph shows three-month cash deposit rates in the  United States and the euro-area and three-month deposit rates three, six, and nine  months forward for both the dollar and the euro  The cash rates were stable in the  intermeeting period, but forward rates declined, particularly for the euro  The three- month-forward dollar rates traded through cash rates, partly in response to data that  became available as the intermeeting period progressed  Disappointing outlooks from  several major corporations and risk aversion driven by geopolitical risks were cited  by market participants as reasons that short-term rates were likely to stay low longer  than had previously been expected  Some were even building in further reductions to  come     In the euro area, reduced expectations for growth, changing sentiment about the   prospects for structural reform in some major economies, and a stronger euro that  might curb exports were cited as reasons that interest rates might decline there  For  nearly two years now euro-area short-term rates have been higher than dollar rates of  comparable maturity  That divergence was not really remarked upon for much of that  period  Long-term capital flows, such as foreign direct investment and equity  portfolio flows, more than covered the US current account deficit  But with those  sources drying up more recently, the expected returns on short-term investments have  become much more important to the financing of the deficit  Hence, short-term  interest rate differentials have become more of a topic of conversation in markets     At the longer end, as shown in the bottom panel of page 1, ten-year yields on   German and US government bonds recently have shown a rate advantage for the  German bonds  Although that spread has nearly converged as of today, German  yields have had an advantage over US yields since May 2002  In general, an  underlying theme in currency markets recently has been the reduction of expected  returns on dollar assets     Turning to page 2, in the past two months the dollar has shown a steady decline   against most major currencies, with the decline of the dollar against the euro most  pronounced  The euro has gained about 10 cents versus the dollar in the last two  months and is now trading at its strongest level since October 1999  But the dollar  has also been falling against the Swiss franc, the Australian dollar, the New Zealand  dollar, the pound sterling, the Norwegian kroner, the Canadian dollar, the yen, and  almost every other currency except the Mexican peso  Geopolitical concerns in one  form or another have been cited as the reason  But if investors have concerns about  Iraq, it’s not clear why European currencies would be immediately attractive  And if  the concern is North Korea, it’s not clear why the yen would have a spark  Falling                                                     2 The materials used by Mr Kos are appended to this transcript (appendix 2)   January 28-29, 2003 61 of 195    stock prices in the United States are sometimes mentioned, but European stocks have  fallen even more     One variation on the geopolitical factor that may have a bit more attraction in   terms of concerns is the extent of generalized uncertainty  That explanation suggests  that uncertainty among businessmen and investors has led both groups to stay on the  sidelines until the air clears with respect to these geopolitical risks  Given the losses  that investors in general have had in riskier assets in the last few years, that yearning  to “stay home” is understandable even without the uncertainty generated by event  risks  But if Japanese, European, and other investors stay home and the US current  account deficit still needs financing, the result is that pressure builds on the exchange  rate—and perhaps even on asset prices  A second aspect of developments in the last  few weeks involves uncertainty about today’s testimony by the incoming Treasury  Secretary  Some market participants had speculated that he might take a different  approach toward the dollar policy  Finally, another underlying theme in the markets  was that some influential central banks were reallocating reserves from dollars to  euros       The yen also appreciated versus the dollar despite the continuing stream of bad   news out of Tokyo, although the rise in the yen was less pronounced than that of  other major currencies  In part, the cause of the yen’s appreciation may also be  related to asset reallocation, this time by Japanese institutions from yen and dollar  assets into euro assets  But another factor may have been the intervention by the  Bank of Japan  Since mid-January, the Japanese monetary authority has intervened  very, very quietly in markets  In total, they have acquired $56 billion over that  period  Markets have not caught on to this activity yet, though they will by early next  week when the Bank of Japan’s month-end financial statements are released     As for the dollar’s value more broadly, as shown in the bottom panel, on an   effective basis the dollar is roughly back to the middle of its trading range since 1995  and is also at the average of its value since 1985  While some commentators have  taken that as a sign that the currency is perhaps getting close to some sort of  equilibrium, others have pointed out that the dollar moves in long multiyear cycles  and is prone to overshoot on the upside and also the downside     Turning to page 3 and moving to domestic markets, there have been some signs of   a revival in risk appetites and of easier financing conditions  But these signs are  tentative and perhaps not all that convincing in the end  The top left panel shows that  the investment-grade corporate bond spread has narrowed sharply in the past three  months  Issuance has also shown some signs of picking up  The top right panel  shows a similar pattern of narrower spreads and a pickup of issuance for high-yield  bonds  Although the trends are favorable, the absolute levels of both spreads and  issuance still point to markets being not quite back to normal  The middle panel  graphs for the period since January 2000 the monthly corporate bond spread to  Treasuries—for investment-grade bonds (in green on the right scale) and for high- yield bonds (in red on the left scale) Spreads are down from their highs for both, but   January 28-29, 2003 62 of 195    essentially they have retraced the spike after last summer’s corporate scandals and in  absolute terms are still on the high side  Similarly, over a longer perspective,  issuance also has stopped growing  The bottom panel shows aggregate corporate  bond issuance—both investment grade and high yield—by quarter for 2001 in red and  for 2002 in blue  In each quarter of 2002 issuance was lower than in the comparable  period in 2001  So far this month, through January 24, issuance has totaled  $47 billion compared with nearly $85 billion for the full month last year and more  than $100 billion in 2001     Market participants also point to absolute levels of Treasury yields as another   indication of risk aversion As shown in the top left panel page 4, the two-year yield  remains near its record low at about 165 percent  Longer-term yields have declined a  bit less, but they, too, remain at low absolute levels  The result is that the curve has  steepened again The middle panel graphs three views of the curve’s steepness since  January 1991  The red line depicts the thirty-year yield minus the three-month rate,  the blue line shows the ten-year yield minus the three-month rate, and the green line  graphs the ten-year yield minus the two-year rate  Each is at a very steep level and is  comparable to the peaks recorded in 1992  The positive spin on this steep yield curve  is that it is forecasting an economic recovery as it did in the early 1990s  The  negative interpretation that some are taking is that longer-term rates, although low in  absolute terms, have remained unusually high despite the fall of short-term rates  In  the latter view, that’s either (1) because the return of budget deficits is forecasting a  substantially higher supply, which is being priced into the curve, or (2) because  foreign investors in particular are demanding a higher rate of return to keep  accumulating US assets  Given the short-end policy rates, that higher rate needed to  attract foreign investors is showing up at the long end  The picture in equity markets  has been mixed, with signs of risk appetites recovering early this year  But with the  declines of stock prices in the past two weeks and the spike in volatility, as shown in  the bottom two panels, risk aversion seems to have the upper hand there as well        Turning to the next page, I just wanted to say a few words about some intra-  European developments  The top panel graphs from last November the S&P 500, the  DAX, and the Dow Jones Euro Stoxx index  In general, despite the rally in the euro,  the situation in euro-area markets has not been very rosy—especially in Germany   The DAX has depreciated more than the S&P and for that matter more than other  European indexes  Germany has been criticized in the markets for moving too slowly  on structural reform and for letting its finances breach the Stability Pact threshold   Somewhat less noted among analysts has been the compression of spreads relative to  Germany among European sovereign bonds  French government bonds have traded  close to German bonds for some time  But Italian and Spanish bonds, which were  traditionally grouped in the so-called periphery—and typically yielded 2 to 3 percent  more than German paper before the launch of the euro—have seen their spreads  compressed  As shown in the bottom panel, despite Italy’s budget problems, its  sovereign debt is now trading less than 20 basis points over Germany’s  Spanish  government bonds are trading on par with France’s, at only a handful of points over   January 28-29, 2003 63 of 195    Germany’s  A number of market participants have noted that Spain has actually  moved among the fastest in the EU on the structural reform side     Turning to page 6, I have just a few quick words on reserves  The graph there   shows the composition of the System Open Market Account in terms of its three main  components—the permanent SOMA, long-term RPs, and short-term RPs acquired  since January 26, 2002  You’ll recall that after currency unexpectedly drained  reserves in the fall, the Desk compressed the System’s balance sheet, mainly by  reducing the size of the long-term repo book to $6 billion  As we moved toward  year-end, a more normal seasonal pattern of currency growth emerged, and the Desk  accommodated that primarily by expanding the long-term repo book back up to  $26 billion  As the seasonal pattern reversed, the long-term repo book has been taken  down to $14 billion, a level we feel comfortable maintaining for the time being     Mr Chairman, there were no foreign operations in this period  I will need a vote   to ratify domestic operations, and I would be happy to take any questions      Well, the people citing that view are perhaps not taking the analysis as far as   you’re suggesting  I think it’s probably more mechanical—looking at the dollar’s highs and   lows and figuring that, since it’s somewhere in between, it might be approaching something of   an equilibrium  But, again, many people tend to look at these exchange rate movements as   having very long cycles; they tend to think that we may have more to go on the dollar    That’s a very good point, President Minehan  I think that is reflected in the   concerns about some of the corporate reports that have been coming out and about the weakness   in the production and employment data  It’s very hard to put percentages on that, but that type of   uncertainty about the underlying strength of the economy is certainly part of it  Much of the   market commentary has been that there are a lot of uncertainties involving big events that could   go one way or the other way in the next few weeks and months, and market participants are   having a hard time pricing for those risks because there are quite a number of them    I don’t want to comment on the forecast or what the market might or might   not be expecting with precision  I think many have an assumption that the second half will be   strong  So that’s one of the factors for which there might be—    Well, the way that I would put it is that the forecasts for the third and fourth   quarters are relying upon a lot of positive things happening in the next few weeks on the   geopolitical front and also on the assumption that the data will get better  Now, if things do not   turn out that way, then quite a bit of risk might lie ahead in several markets  That’s the way I   would think of it    Well, if we go back to the 1997-98 period, spreads were extremely tight  If   anything, they were probably too tight and were not factoring in as much risk as people were   undertaking  So in that sense I’ve intentionally left that out  But if we exclude that period, at   least based on the sense I get from people in the market, “normal” would be something south of   these numbers but not as low as the 50 basis points seen in that earlier period on some bonds that   were bordering on junk   So the area we would be thinking of is something higher than that but   lower than what they are today  Certainly for the high-yield bond the spreads are about 800 basis   points now, and I believe they bottomed out at about the mid-200s, which was extremely low    So a spread in the 400s or the 500s is intuitively what people in the markets feel might be a bit   more “normal,” if you will    Another way of looking at this is that these spreads now are roughly where   they were in January 2001, when the Committee first started easing and when there was a lot of   risk aversion, especially in the high-yield market  They are also close to the levels of October   2001 right after the terrorist attacks  So they’re back to levels that most people in the market   would not view as necessarily reflecting a healthy state of affairs    I believe it is straight corporate debt  I would have to check on that, but I   don’t believe it would include Ford ABS, for example       Yes, some clearly have  That was especially true in the fall, when a lot of   corporations could not issue straight debt, and they went that route because it was still available   to them    Certainly there was a run-down in commercial paper being “termed out”   There was also some paydown of commercial paper financed by running down cash balances    Some of that was going on as well  "
6993,2003-03-18,"1  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the charts that were  distributed a short time ago  Since your last meeting, markets have been  characterized by a high degree of risk aversion—driven, first, by uncertainty about  the timing and extent of war in Iraq; second, by uncertainty about the underlying  condition of the US and other global economies as growth forecasts were being  trimmed; and third, by data on the real economy that tended to disappoint market  expectations  During most of the intermeeting period, investors favored government  bonds; their yields declined to new lows in many cases, while equities fell sharply  and the dollar depreciated  In the last three or four trading sessions, however, many  of those trends were partially or fully reversed, and the price of oil has declined   Some attribute these recent price moves to investors’ optimism about the outcome of  the war that now seems imminent  Others see the recent price moves as another  variation of uncertainty, only this time the response was to revert to a neutral posture  vis-à-vis their benchmarks       The first page in the materials distributed shows US and euro-area three-month   deposit rates  For most of the intermeeting period three-month cash rates were  relatively stable in the United States, as shown by the solid red line  However, three- month deposit rates three, six, and nine months forward (the dashed red lines) began  to fall in early March, as the gloom deepened and the data deteriorated, especially  after the employment report of March 7  Surprisingly, forward rates snapped back  late last week and the three-month rate nine months forward is back to 15 percent,  near where it traded for most of the period  Part of that reversal may have been due  to technical trading factors, but the revival of equity prices and the growing sense that  your meeting today would not result in a change to the target funds rate also played a  role  European forward rates (the dashed green lines) continued to trade below the  cash rate, suggesting that markets expect further easing from the ECB  Many market  participants had expected a more aggressive 50 basis point cut at the March 6 meeting  of the ECB  The contemporaneous uptick in euro-area forward rates suggests that  those rates often remain influenced by their US counterparts in the short run                                                         1 The materials used by Mr Kos are appended to this transcript (appendix 1)      March 18, 2003 3 of 101    In Japan, the announcement of a new governor of the Bank of Japan did not alter  expectations of persisting deflation  With Japanese short rates at zero and the  economic outlook unchanged, the BOJ’s continued infusions of liquidity and a search  for yield by investors have pushed funds out the yield curve  The ten-year Japanese  government bond yield hit a new low of 72 basis points on March 12; that compares  with a yield of 145 percent one year ago  In fact, the entire yield curve has been  pulled down by the weight of the BOJ’s infusions, as shown in the bottom panel   While the BOJ’s so-called nontraditional monetary operations have successfully  brought down the JGB yield curve and corporate spreads apparently have followed,  still the amount of borrowing in the private sector and in the securities market is  limited, and prices on other assets such as equities and property continue to fall      Turning to page 2, another way of looking at monetary conditions in major   economies is depicted there  The five graphs on that page show the main policy rates  (the blue lines) since December of 2002 for the United States, the euro area, the  United Kingdom, Australia, and Canada, along with the two-year swap rate for each  currency (the red lines)  By early March the two-year swap rate was trading below  the short-term policy rate in the euro area, the United Kingdom, and Australia,  suggesting that markets were expecting a weaker outlook and possibly some  monetary ease  In this country, the two-year swap rate fell 83 basis points from  December through early March, tracking the two-year note, which itself hit a record  low of 133 percent on March 10  In all four cases the swap rate moved sharply  higher last week—more than ¼ percentage point—as markets at least temporarily  were willing to consider that the glass was half full  Interestingly, Canada’s pattern  was quite different from the others  In Canada, swap rates began their turnaround at  year-end, and the Bank of Canada tightened policy 25 basis points on March 4       Turning to page 3, the dollar continued to trade with a soggy tone for much of the   intermeeting period  Part of the dollar’s decline was attributed to weaker economic  data, which seem to have had a more pronounced effect on the US currency than  weak data had on either the euro-area or Japanese markets and currencies  The  reason typically cited is the United States’ reliance on imported capital due to the  current account deficit  A second factor mentioned by some was the widening budget  deficit forecast, and a third concern was the financing of the war  Traders recall that  the United States was reimbursed for the vast portion of its expenses in the first Gulf  War, a factor that narrowed the current account deficit at that time and was thought to  have benefited the dollar  A similar benefit is not expected this time around     Notwithstanding this sentiment, the dollar strengthened in the last week along   with most riskier dollar assets  The euro weakened sharply in the past week to about  $106 as we speak, and European equities rallied  Some attributed the euro’s  weakness to technical factors; others cited discord within Europe on both foreign  policy and economic performance issues  Still others pointed to the seemingly  increasing volume of bad news coming from European banking and insurance  businesses To give one example, in recent days there have been calls by prominent   March 18, 2003 4 of 101    Germans for the government to prepare for the possibility of having to take over one  of the large German banks       The yen’s exchange rate has been rather more subdued  The middle panel graphs   the dollar–yen exchange rate and shows (in gray) periods of Japanese intervention   Although claiming to have no exchange rate target, the Japanese monetary authorities  have intervened consistently when the dollar–yen rate has been in the 116 to 118 area   During the intermeeting period, the Japanese bought about $106 billion and  €700 million  That is in addition to the roughly $56 billion they bought in January   So-called repatriation flows, which actually cover a wide variety of book-closing  maneuvers, tend to wear off by mid-March as the necessary transactions are  completed  With the onset of the new fiscal year and a new team installed at the  Bank of Japan, the market will be focusing intently on the policy choices by the  government and central bank officials to revive the economy       Finally, the dollar also has been weak since last December against other   currencies, as shown in the bottom panel, although it has had a bit of a bounce in  recent days against those currencies as well  The British pound has benefited least  from the dollar’s weakness, perhaps in part because of the suspicion that the UK  economy is decelerating  But some observers have suggested that the economy may  experience some negative backwash from the government’s decisions regarding Iraq     Turning to page 4 and moving back to US fixed-income markets, corporate bond   issuance in January and February in both investment-grade and high-yield markets  was fairly strong, in contrast with the lower year-over-year levels we were seeing for  much of 2002  As shown in the top left panel, the investment-grade corporate spread  continued to trade below 175 basis points, which while rather high historically is a  significant improvement from October  Actually, perhaps the news here is that there  was no widening in the spread despite the uptick in supply and the weak equity  market  High-yield and emerging-market spreads also held fairly steady, as shown in  the top right panel, especially among selected emerging-market borrowers such as  Brazil, which has performed well since the election  Market commentary suggests  that, with investors craving higher yields, these asset classes offered a fairly attractive  risk–reward ratio at those spreads over Treasuries       Volatilities in fixed-income markets have remained at somewhat elevated levels, as   shown in the middle panel  This panel graphs the implied volatility on options to enter into a  swap  The purple line graphs the volatility index of options of short-dated swaps, and the  blue line depicts that measure for intermediate-term swaps  These instruments are the  hedging tools of choice among large mortgage investors, and implied volatilities tend to rise  during periods of heightened refinancing activity  In recent weeks, the Mortgage Bankers  Association refi index hit a new high—a level much higher in fact than last autumn’s peak   In that context it’s not surprising that implied volatilities among these instruments are high,  and it may be a surprise that they are not higher still      March 18, 2003 5 of 101    The bottom panel graphs another aspect of the refinancing boom  The blue line is  an estimate of the duration of the mortgages in the mortgage-backed security  universe; the burgundy line is the yield on the ten-year note  These two do tend to  move together since one way for investors to hedge a shortening of portfolio duration  due to a refinancing wave is to buy Treasuries  Conversely, they hedge by selling  Treasuries when rates rise and duration extends  With the significant growth of the  mortgage market, hedging activities among these investors can—and often do—have  an impact on the Treasury market  Now, I should mention that one small aspect of  the recent heavy volume of refinancings is speculation that higher prepayments will  cause a mismatch among some large MBS holders unable to adjust their positions  quickly enough  In particular, some traders apparently thought that Fannie Mae  would report a much higher duration gap, as it did during last autumn’s prepayments  wave, and that this would imply large purchases of Treasuries and still lower interest  rates  In the event, Fannie Mae reported last week that its duration gap for February  had widened by one month, from minus four to minus five months, which was much  lower than the market had expected  And the gap stayed within Fannie’s desired  range of plus six to minus six months  Part of the reversal in the ten-year note last  week was apparently triggered by disappointment that this gap was not wider, which  caused some short covering  On the bright side, some have suggested that, with the  spotlight on GSEs, they are hedging a bit more conservatively to avoid the negative  publicity that Fannie Mae in particular garnered last September and October       Let me turn to page 5 and a quick word on reserves  Several meetings ago I   mentioned that currency growth had slowed unexpectedly in late summer and early  autumn  The Desk responded by ceasing outright operations and shrinking our long- term repo book to $6 billion  As currency growth resumed, in the holiday period we  first increased the long-term repo book, and in the intermeeting period we resumed  our outright purchases for SOMA, as shown in the panel on page 5  During the  intermeeting period we acquired almost $11 billion of securities, or just $1 billion  short of the intermeeting leeway  Looking prospectively, we do not anticipate that  the onset of armed conflict will have any significant effect on the demand for excess  reserves or otherwise upset financing markets  In a review of banks’ behavior during  the 1991 Gulf War, there was no evidence that banks increased their demand for  excess reserves  However, analyzing that period is made more difficult because of  the sharp reduction in reserve requirements that became effective in December 1990,  a few weeks before the war began  Nonetheless, we will be on the lookout for any  signs that shifts in financing patterns or flows across asset markets might be upsetting  normal conditions in financing markets, and we will adjust our operations or  provision of excess reserves accordingly     Mr Chairman, there were no foreign operations  I will need a vote to approve   domestic operations, and I’d be happy to answer any questions     That’s a great question  The Committee spoke about the Canadian situation   last time as something of an outlier, and one can see that here as well  I think one way to view   this is that the market probably does consider the prospects for the United States and Canada as   somewhat better than for the euro area and the United Kingdom  The case of Australia is a bit   more interesting  I don’t know to what degree technical factors are involved there  The   Australian economy has performed extremely well, and perhaps the markets are sniffing out a   slowdown that’s not in the forecasts  At least most forecasts that I’ve seen for Australia don’t   show that its situation will become similar to that which the euro area and Japan are in now or   toward which many people think the United Kingdom is heading  So we might be getting an   inkling here that perhaps the market is indeed looking for a better performance prospectively in   the United States as they are for Canada    Yes, I could have used the two-year note, but that creates a different problem   of credit differentials among countries  So, I decided to take the two-year swap rate across all of   March 18, 2003 7 of 101    these countries  But I think we would see the same kind of pattern—although the level would be   different—if we used the two-year note  The numbers would be somewhat lower because of the   differential between the two-year note and the two-year swap rate    Yes, I think that’s a good interpretation, and I believe that’s the analysis that   most in the market have made  Interestingly though, one would have thought, that being the   case, that Freddie would be rewarded with a higher PE in its equities, but one doesn’t see that    One could argue that they are being more prudent and are protecting against risk a little better,   but that is not showing up in the way investors are assessing their equities      It has been faster because Fannie is willing to take more risk, which is your   point about how much insurance a GSE is willing to take out    I think it’s very difficult to parse  If you pushed me, I would probably say   that the market in the last year has become more inclined to think that deflation has become ever   more entrenched  Therefore, market participants tend to feel that the risk of being badly burned   in the near term by buying a ten-year bond is low, which I think is probably a mistake  So I’d   say it’s probably more price expectations than the demand for liquidity, but obviously it’s a very   difficult issue to parse    Yes, that’s an interesting point, and I’ve asked about that  One explanation   I’m hearing is that liquidity is improving, which it probably is  The other one is that we’re not   March 18, 2003 9 of 101    seeing much supply  Japanese corporations are still not borrowing, and investors are starved for   yield  One can buy a lot of government paper at a return of close to zero percent  So if one can   get some ten-year paper with a 2 percent handle, that looks pretty good—the risks   notwithstanding    I don’t know of any  Karen, have you seen anything?    It is interesting in one sense, though, that the curve has been pulled down    Interest rates are lower, and spreads have come in; yet the economy really does not seem to be   able to respond  So it does raise the question of whether a flat yield curve produces better   prospects for the economy  "
7009,2003-03-25,"1  Yes  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I can be very brief, aided by the  material that Vincent Reinhart sent out I believe either last night or this morning   As  for the financial markets, the price changes are covered on the graphs in that material,  and I think much of that will be familiar to the members of the Committee  So I  thought I would just say a few words about conditions in the markets  In general  they’re fine  Liquidity is reported as either good or adequate in almost all market  segments  The volume in the foreign exchange market has actually been above  average  On the EBS system, which is the primary means of interbank trading,  volume has been above average for the last few weeks  Liquidity in the Treasury  market is reported to be okay  In some of the other markets it is variable, but it is not  ragged in any case, although in specific areas such as the TIPS market, where some  unique factors are involved, liquidity is a little below average  In the agency and  swap markets, perhaps just because of their much larger size, market participants are  saying that it’s somewhat more difficult getting large trades done  But that’s only for  the largest trades  The more or less run-of-the-mill hedging operations that investors  need to do are reportedly going quite well  In the equity market the story is similar   Volume was actually below average for most of February; it then picked up with the  rally and now is down again  But on the whole, liquidity there is said to be fine  Bid- offered spreads in most markets are also reported to be within their normal ranges  I  think I can stop there, Mr Chairman      Yes, we’re doing it as we speak  We had been planning that for weeks, and   we decided not to defer it      With respect to Governor Bernanke’s question about the TIPS purchase, I   wanted to report that we did the TIPS pass  We bought $572 million, mostly in the eight- to   twelve-year range, and there was no discernible market effect  "
7018,2003-04-01,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I will try to be very brief  The markets  over the last week were once again driven by headlines about the war  At times when  market participants thought that the war would be short, they tended to be bullish for  the dollar and for equities  Most of the time, though, their views were at the other end  of the spectrum—expecting a more protracted conflict than they had been thinking  previously—which was bullish for bonds and conversely bearish for the dollar and for  equities  So in the last week the two-year note has come down by about 13 basis  points and the ten-year note by about 11 basis points; and the dollar has depreciated  against the euro to about 109 and also was down to 118 against the yen  Equities  have declined a couple of percentage points, depending on the index one uses       Interestingly, volatilities in the equity markets have actually fallen, which is   counterintuitive  The VIX is down 3 percentage points; the pattern historically has  been that, when equities have declined, the VIX has tended to rise  The other  development that’s a little counterintuitive is that corporate spreads have narrowed  both in the investment-grade and in the high-yield sectors by about 7 or 8 basis  points     Market conditions in the Treasury and corporate sectors in general are described   as good, although issuance of corporates has been a bit lighter than at the same time  last year  In the secondary market, dealers report that they are able to do the business  that needs to get done without a problem  Moreover, bid-offered spreads as well as  the ability and willingness of dealers to take positions are described as good   Liquidity in agencies, mortgage-backed securities, swaps, and in other markets is  reported to be choppy at times, and volume is a little less than normal  But on the  whole, people are willing and able to do the business that they want to do  So all in  all, market conditions are described as fine  I think I can stop there, Mr Chairman    "
7027,2003-04-08,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  As I was last week, I can be rather brief   The markets have continued to function in an orderly way  There really have been no  disruptions in any of the major markets that we follow  Liquidity reportedly has been  normal and bid-offered spreads are also at normal levels  Let me say a few words  about the fed funds markets  I mentioned at the last FOMC meeting that we would be  on guard for any signs of increased demand for excess reserves  There have been no  signs of that, so that was a non-event  The funds market has been functioning well,  and if anything, the fed funds rate at times has been a little on the soft side  To the  degree that we have had challenges at the Desk, they have involved forecasting the  Treasury’s balance and forecasting the weather and its effects on float  Float has  been created because of bad weather the last two days here on the East Coast and the  last week or two in the Midwest  The capital markets, as I think everybody knows,  have tended to move on headlines related to the war  But on net both investment- grade and high-yield spreads are narrower, equities are higher, and implied volatilities  among most asset classes are lower  So the signs of risk aversion or anxiety are  pointing in the other direction—that is, there is less anxiety as some of the uncertainty  that preceded the war has ebbed somewhat       One thing that people have noticed is that to some degree markets have focused   slightly more on the economic data than they did in the past few weeks, when all the  markets were reacting to nothing but the headlines regarding the war  For example,  the recent employment data were scrutinized closely by economists and other market  observers  They had expected a bad number so that can explain to some degree the  market’s counterintuitive reaction, and at least the focus has begun to turn toward the  economic statistics  The other thing that has been noted in the corporate market is a  return of headlines regarding corporate governance issues  HealthSouth was one  example, and there were one or two other, lesser situations  But the markets have  actually absorbed that news and taken it in stride; it has not had the effect that Enron  or other notable incidents had last year  So all in all the markets seem to be working  fine  I think I’ll leave it there, Mr Chairman      I’m sorry, I didn’t hear that   April 8, 2003 3 of 31   "
7044,2003-04-16,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  The markets have slowly shifted their  focus from headlines about Iraq to headlines about the economy  But the data the  markets are getting currently are viewed as contaminated by the effects of the war,  and therefore, market participants are really looking ahead toward the clean data that  they expect to get in coming weeks   So with that setting and a rather wide range of  expectations about how the economy will be performing, the markets have tended to  churn in fairly well defined ranges  The Dow Jones, to take just one example on the  equity side, has fluctuated between 8200 and 8400 for most of April, and the ten-year  Treasury yield has traded in a range between 39 and 4 percent or thereabouts  The  dollar also has traded in a relatively narrowly defined corridor against both the euro  and the yen  So with that kind of “range” trading, implied volatilities have trended  downward  The VIX, for example, has moved down to the middle to high 20s from  the mid-30s that had been typical for most of the spring and late winter  Spreads,  both high yield and investment grade, have been narrowing slowly  The interesting  point, at least for me, is that cash levels are fairly high and there is demand among  investors  But issuance has trended downward, especially in the last few weeks   Whereas in January and February issuance of investment-grade bonds was at or  slightly above year-ago levels, March issuance was $36 billion compared with  $66 billion a year ago, and in April for the month to date it has been $19 billion  versus $41 billion last year  That just may suggest that there is less demand for  funding—that corporations either are funding through internal cash sources or are not  seeing investment opportunities  Let me stop there, Mr Chairman    "
7068,2003-05-06,"1  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the charts that were  distributed a short time ago  Since the last Committee meeting, markets have been  characterized by a mixture of uncertainty about—among other things—the outlook  for the economy, residual geopolitical risks, and SARS  Simultaneously, the degree  of risk aversion decreased and spreads narrowed, volatilities declined or stayed at low  levels, equities rallied in most markets, and a consistent theme among investors was  the search for yield       The top panel on the first page graphs the US dollar three-month Libor deposit   rate in black and the three-month deposit rate three, six, and nine months forward in  the dashed red lines  Since your last meeting, forward rates have traded in fairly  narrow ranges, as markets were pushed and pulled with conflicting news—the mostly  weak economic data and a corporate earnings season that, while unspectacular, did  not come close to many of the most dire expectations in the markets  Forward curves  and futures prices are still pricing in another ease in policy at some point, though  those same curves suggest that a tightening cycle will follow shortly thereafter  Of  course, this pattern of expecting lower rates to be followed by higher rates some  months later has persisted for quite some time now     As shown in the middle two panels, two- and ten-year Treasury yields also have   moved in a fairly narrow range  One factor that did not seem to affect prices and  yields was last week’s record refunding announcement  The Treasury will auction  $58 billion of three-, five-, and ten-year notes in the next few days, with almost all of  that bringing in new cash  Further, all forecasts of future deficits continue to rise   While analysts have commented about the risks that the increased supply poses, those  worries have not yet shown through to yields, though perhaps they will in time as the  competition for funds increases Two possible reasons for the lack of reaction were  cited  First, worries about future supply are already reflected at the long end of the  curve and hence partly explain the steepness of the curve; and second the decrease in  recent quarters in private-sector issuance is allowing the Treasury to borrow what it  needs without bidding up rates                                                         1 The materials used by Mr Kos are appended to the transcript (appendix 1)   May 6, 2003 3 of 115    The bottom panel graphs the investment-grade spread, which has continued to  fall  If one excludes some very large issuers such as auto companies that have special  stories surrounding them, the remainder of the index is trading near spring 1998  levels  Swap spreads, in fact, are already back to those levels  Part of this narrowing  probably is a correction from what are now viewed to have been extreme levels in the  autumn of 2002, when corporate governance scares were peaking  Part of the  narrowing is simply due to supply and demand  Inflows continue to come into bond  funds and need to be invested       On the supply side, although issuance did tick up in late January and February, it   fell again as the war approached, and it has stayed low since then  Dealers note that  corporations are using free cash flow and what little corporate issuance there has been  to repay debt and de-lever their balance sheets  This helps to explain the credit  quality improvement, though it also implies that less is going into investment than  would normally be the case       Meanwhile on the demand side, investors have pushed out the maturity and credit   risk curves in the search for higher yields  The bottom right panel graphs the  narrowing of high-yield and emerging-market spreads  Funds specializing in both  asset classes have had inflows, and with only a limited supply coming to the market,  the competition has been intense and spreads have narrowed sharply  Just to take one  example, Brazil issued a $1 billion five-year global bond that was six times  oversubscribed  A week ago the bond was issued to yield 107 percent, and it has  rallied in the week since then  It now yields 98 percent  The issue also included a  collective action clause, which did not appear to affect demand  The Brazilian real,  Mexican peso, and South African rand were among the currencies that benefited from  investors’ search for higher yielding currencies and asset markets     Consistent with the narrowing of spreads and less risk aversion in recent weeks,   implied volatilities have decreased or stayed at relatively low levels  Page 2 graphs  long-term implied volatilities on the S&P 100, the two main exchange rate pairs, and  the ten-year Treasury futures since January 2000  The better performance of US  equity markets in recent weeks—the S&P 500, for example, is up 15 percent—has  coincided with the fall in implied vols  As shown in the top panel, which depicts the  S&P 100 volatility index, that measure of equity volatility is back to below the  25 percent level for the first time since corporate governance worries heightened after  the WorldCom collapse  Currency volatilities continued to trade in well-worn ranges,  near the 10 percent level that has prevailed for some time  These volatility levels  have been maintained both during the appreciation of the dollar in the beginning of  the period and during the more recent period of dollar depreciation The implied  volatilities in the ten-year Treasury futures contract have continued to ebb in recent  weeks to levels observed in the first half of 2001  Part of that recent falloff in  volatility may also be due to the decline in the Mortgage Bankers Association’s  Refinancing Index, as prepayments have slowed  That also may have lessened the  demand for hedging by mortgage investors and corporate treasurers       May 6, 2003 4 of 115    Turning to Europe, the top panel on page 3 graphs the Libor fixing for euro three- month deposits in black and the implied rates three, six, and nine months forward in  green  The forward rates continue to trade below the cash rate and market  participants expect further easing from the ECB, as forecasts for European growth are  still being trimmed  In the middle panel, credit spreads in the euro area continue to  narrow as well  In particular, the lower end of the investment-grade universe has  outperformed the rest  But unlike the case in the United States, issuance actually  picked up early this year, as shown in the chart at the bottom left, so supply there is  holding up  One possibility is that European companies are now going through some  of the same dynamics that US companies went through in 2001 and 2002, when they  issued debt heavily in order to refinance and restructure debt and to extend the term  of maturing commercial paper     In the foreign exchange markets, the euro has continued to rise past 112 and is   now at the 113 level against the dollar—its strongest level since February 1999,  which was roughly six weeks after the euro’s launch  Investors shifting assets into  the euro area reportedly include central banks, Japanese insurance and pension  companies, and European institutional investors who have preferred to keep funds at  home rather than move them overseas  Although we don’t think of the euro as a  high-yielding currency per se, both short- and long-term rates are meaningfully higher  than those for the two G-3 counterpart currencies       Turning to page 4, Japanese markets show no signs that the deflationary pressures   in that country are abating The banking situation continues to post challenges for  Japanese policymakers, and the recent declines in Japanese stocks have accentuated  those worries  The Nikkei stock index fell below 8,000 during the intermeeting  period for the first time since 1983  This has again raised talk in Japanese policy  circles about measures such as so-called price-keeping operations to stem the declines  in equity prices and hence conserve capital resources of the banks and insurers   Unlike most other major equity markets, the Nikkei did not rally in mid-March  That  divergence from other equity markets is depicted in the top panel  The S&P and  DAX, to take just two examples, came off their lows rather sharply, whereas the  Nikkei continued its steady decline toward and then below the 8,000 level  Today it  is just above that level  The Japanese bond markets also have been gloomy, as shown  in the middle panel The ten-year yield is trading at about 61 or 62 basis points, and  the yield on the twenty-year bond is at 94 basis points  Among benchmark issues,  only the thirty-year yield, trading at 106 percent, has a positive integer before the  decimal point, though not by very much      The BOJ’s policy stance has pushed investors out on the yield curve and to some   degree into private-sector and foreign assets  The right middle panel shows the recent  narrowing of private-sector spreads in Japan, which is not unlike the patterns  observed in dollar and euro area fixed income markets  But let me note three points  of caution  First, as we know, companies in Japan rely more on bank financing; bond  market issuance is low compared with both their US and European counterparts   Second, the data are poor  But net new issuance is probably flat or perhaps even   May 6, 2003 5 of 115    negative in the lower-rated segments, which would help to explain some of the spread  compression  Third, spreads widened substantially in late 2001 when some fund  managers were faced with large losses, and the ensuing liquidation widened  spreads—especially for lower-rated paper  Those spreads are only now reverting to  the levels we saw in the summer of 2001     The noisy chart at the bottom left graphs the TOPIX bank sub-index and the share   prices of the four major Japanese banks, all of which are down substantially as the  prospect for improvement in their business recedes  Mizuho, for example, reported a  $19 billion loss a week ago  Ironically, the spreads on Japanese bank debt have  nevertheless narrowed during 2003  The bottom right panel graphs the spread for  each of the four major banks between their five-year senior debt and the five-year  JGB yield  I would make two points  First, all the spreads have narrowed and are  converging, suggesting little in the way of differentiation among the banks—or at  least less than had been the case some months ago  Second, these spreads obviously  represent very low absolute yields  With the five-year JGB yield itself at 21 basis  points today, a spread of 10 basis points on Sumitomo’s debt, for example, means that  the bank is able to sell five-year debt at 31 basis points       Moving to the next page, one of the stars in the currency market has been the   Canadian dollar  In recent trading sessions the Canadian dollar has risen above  70 cents and is now trading at its strongest level since 1997  Among the reasons for  the Canadian dollar’s performance are Canada’s strong economic performance,  higher yields, less overcapacity in Canadian industry, a large energy sector at a time  when prices have generally been high, and the Bank of Canada’s move to tighten  monetary policy  Canadian ten-year yields are about 1 percentage point higher than  those on comparable US instruments; and at the short end, Canadian interest rates  are about 2 percentage points higher  The divergence in policy has also had a  different effect on the yield curve  The middle panel graphs the two-to-ten-year US  Treasury curve in blue and the comparable data for Canada in red  While the US  curve has been steep at between 220 to 240 basis points all year, the Canadian curve  has actually flattened by about 60 basis points and is currently only half as steep as  the US curve  The World Health Organization’s decision to issue a travel advisory  for Toronto had periodic but only transient effects on Canadian markets     The Hong Kong and Chinese markets, on the other hand, had at times a more   pronounced reaction to SARS-related news but perhaps less than one might have  expected given the sheer volume of coverage the story received  At the bottom left in  blue is a graph of the Hong Kong dollar, which is fixed at 78 to the dollar The one- year forward rate moved upward in mid- to late April to 783 but since then has eased  back somewhat  At the bottom right, China’s spot exchange rate is depicted in blue  and the implied one-year renminbi nondeliverable forward rate in red  The discount  on the renminbi has narrowed somewhat, but all in all the reaction was fairly modest   Equities in both Hong Kong and China, however, did fall, although again perhaps not  as dramatically as one might have expected       May 6, 2003 6 of 115    Mr Chairman, there were no foreign operations in the intermeeting period  I will  need a vote on domestic operations  And I’d be happy to answer any questions          I’m not an expert in that particular area  Certainly some of the stigma   associated with the CAC will be taken away  One of the concerns that officials had worried   about was that there would be some stigma associated with being first off the block with a CAC    With Mexico and Brazil having moved to include CACs, there may be less of a stigma so it may   be easier to get them in  But I wouldn’t want to make a forecast that they will become a routine   part of such contracts    I believe so, yes    That’s true, yes    Yes, I think for us it was a question of data that were available on short   notice  But I think you’re right that that would be a better way of presenting it   Yes  It’s May, which means that it’s time to take up the renewal of those   swaps  They expire in mid-December; but because of the six-month notice that would have to be   given if the Committee chose not to renew them, this is the proper meeting to vote on renewal  I   sent out a short memo on this last week, and my recommendation is that the Committee renew   the NAFA swap lines with Mexico and Canada  "
7094,2003-06-24,"2  Vincent has outlined the strategic aspects to the conduct of monetary   policy at very low short-term interest rates  I will be reviewing some of the tactical  issues the Desk might confront in implementing policy if the funds rate target either  could not fall any further or if the Committee chose not to let it fall beyond a certain  point  Some of the approaches that I’ll review would require a change in the  composition of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet, whereas others would lead to an  expansion of the balance sheet  The Fed’s consolidated balance sheet is reproduced  in my exhibit 1  The “domestic financial portfolio” includes our outright holdings of  Treasury securities in the domestic SOMA as well as temporary operations—both  RPs and reverse RPs—that are arranged in the market  I will restrict my remarks to  operations in assets and liabilities in which the Desk is currently authorized to  transact  In particular, I will be focusing on the outright holdings in our domestic  SOMA  Some of the operational methods I discuss, however, would require a change  in the domestic authorization  A broad historical perspective on the size and  distribution of our Treasury holdings by maturity buckets is presented in exhibit 2   Virtually all the increase in the total size of the SOMA has been a byproduct of the  growth in currency notes outstanding  The longstanding concentration of our  holdings in bills and short-term coupon securities reflects the importance the  Committee has attached to having a relatively liquid portfolio to meet unforeseen  contingencies   The bottom panel in exhibit 2 demonstrates how the composition of                                                    2 The materials used by Mr Kos are appended to this transcript (appendix 2)      June 24-25, 2003 10 of 211    SOMA can change and has changed over time  In reviewing the alternative tactical  approaches the Desk could adopt, I will also be distinguishing between (1) operating  methods that are associated with the simultaneous pursuit of a positive federal funds  rate target and (2) methods in which this rate is allowed to fall to its lowest attainable  level consistent with lending risks and transactions costs in the market  So I’ll start  with a little background on what targeting the funds rate implies for our domestic  financial portfolio       We keep the federal funds rate close to its target by providing a supply of bank   reserves—or “deposits of depositories,” as it’s more accurately labeled—on our  balance sheet, at a level consistent with demands  This relation between the target  level of the funds rate and the level of excess reserves is portrayed in exhibit 3   Historically, the period-average level of excess reserves demanded has been fairly  stable within a narrow range between $1 billion and $2 billion over a wide range of  target rates  When the level of excess reserves supplied over an entire maintenance  period deviates from demand, even by relatively minor amounts, it can cause very  sharp swings in the funds rate, although daily swings in excess levels within a  maintenance period can be wide  In order to target the funds rate at any positive  level, the net size of our domestic portfolio—SOMA holdings plus RPs less any  reverse RPs—must be adjusted to provide a level of excess reserves that falls within a  very narrow band around this level of demand  The size of the portfolio is also  determined by the level of banks’ requirements to hold reserves and by the level of  autonomous factors on the balance sheet, most notably our currency liabilities  The  composition of our portfolio is not really important for this purpose, so long as we  have the necessary flexibility to offset volatility from day-to-day factor movements   The chart also conveys our sense that just getting the funds rate down to its lowest  attainable level would not require a significant expansion in the size of our portfolio,  although the increase in the level of excess reserves might be large on a relative basis   This would be true even if there were considerably more elasticity in the relation  between the funds target and excess reserves at very low rate levels  Vincent  mentioned a possible strategy of committing to maintain short-term rates at low levels  for a long period of time  Such a strategy, by itself, would not require any changes to  the Desk’s operational approach for policy implementation  We would continue to  target the federal funds rate from day to day just as we do now, though some of the  tactical approaches I’ll discuss could be used to support such a strategy     The alternative approaches that would involve changes to how the Desk operates   are summarized in exhibit 4  The alternatives that could be adopted while changing  only the composition of the balance sheet are listed in the top panel  These include  (1) extending the average maturity of the outright holdings in the SOMA, (2) setting  explicit ceilings on longer-term Treasury yields, and (3) using derivative instruments   Because only the composition of the balance sheet changes, excess reserves can be  kept at low levels and under the Desk’s control, allowing the Desk to continue  targeting a positive funds rate  The bottom panel lists a number of methods that entail  expanding the size of the balance sheet  Most of these are just variations on the three  approaches I just mentioned  In one case they are combined with the use of reverse   June 24-25, 2003 11 of 211    RPs and higher requirements  These tools could be used to sterilize the impact of an  expanding portfolio on excess reserves, and thus still allowing us to target the funds  rate  Alternatively, the impact on excess reserves could be left unsterilized by choice,  so long as the consequence of short-term rates falling to zero were acceptable   Finally, there is the option of setting an explicit quantitative objective for a high level  of excess reserves     The top of exhibit 5 summarizes the issues that I will touch on when presenting   these alternative methods  These include the operating objective that would be  associated with each approach, which is not always self-evident  I will discuss the  instruments and means of market intervention, highlighting where these differ from  current practices  I’ll try to identify the circumstances under which we could expect  to be successful in achieving our objectives  Some approaches may pose particular  problems for arriving at a clean exit strategy, and others would require a need to  closely coordinate our operations with Treasury debt-management policy  Finally,  some carry a greater potential for realized capital losses on our balance sheet     Approaches that change the composition of the portfolio but not its net size  The   first option the Committee might consider involving a change to just the composition  of the portfolio is to lengthen the average maturity of our outright holdings, with no  explicit objectives for yields  Historical movements in the average maturity of the  SOMA and of the public’s holdings of Treasury securities are shown in the bottom  portion of exhibit 5  The Committee could, for example, instruct the Desk to  lengthen the average maturity of the portfolio, as one way for the Desk to “move out  the curve” and attempt to influence longer-term yields  Or the Committee could set  more-detailed objectives for the distribution of our holdings by specific maturity  buckets  Either way, the objectives would be pursued using traditional operating  techniques  Purchases could be preplanned and arranged in an orderly fashion at a  time and of a size of our choosing  We would likely want to be very open with the  market about our objectives for the restructuring of the portfolio rather than try to  gain some tactical advantage through the element of surprise in our purchases     Exhibit 6 presents a simple example of how an objective to extend the average   maturity of the portfolio might be aggressively pursued while still maintaining control  over of the size of the balance sheet  In this example, which holds other autonomous  factors constant, we redeem $200 billion of our maturing bill holdings over a six- month period—that’s about $8 billion per week—to make room for a similar amount  of coupon purchases each week  These are distributed evenly over the three-to-ten- year sector of the curve in this example  At the end of this period, the average  maturity of the SOMA will have risen from forty-two months to sixty-four months,  which would represent a significant increase above our historical norms  Our  holdings of securities in this maturity range would grow to about one-third of the total  outstanding  However, our holdings of bills would drop to just under $40 billion,  exhausting much of the liquidity that exists in the domestic SOMA, and leaving us  vulnerable to circumstances that could call for a large and quick reduction in the  portfolio    June 24-25, 2003 12 of 211      The initial announcement of a portfolio shift of this magnitude and the   commencement of operations could have a profound, even tumultuous, impact on  trading and rates  Recall that the announcements by the Treasury to institute the  buyback program in early 2000 and the plan to eliminate the long bond in October  2001 had sizable short-term price effects  However, after the dramatic announcement  effects, it is unclear what effect either change had in subsequent quarters and years    In fact, as Vincent noted, beyond the short term, empirical evidence does not provide  much confidence that this type of operation would have a significant sustained effect  on relative premiums  I’m hesitant to put forward an estimate for the yield effect in  that sector of the curve where purchases in this example were concentrated  But a  range around a 25 basis point decline—or perhaps even as high as 50 basis points— seems consistent with empirical estimates, though again it is likely that the immediate  announcement would generate more-pronounced reactions  The reason for such  modest estimates is the observed high degree of substitutability across maturities  A  larger and more durable effect on yields probably would require a greater degree of  segmentation in the Treasury market than exists     An operating objective that entails shifting the composition of our portfolio   probably stands a chance of being successful only if the Treasury’s debt management  were neutral in terms of the maturity distribution of net new issuance  Certainly, any  change in the pattern of debt issuance that takes advantage of an incipient flattening  in the yield curve induced by a concentration of Desk purchases in longer maturities  could reduce the effect of such a strategy     The prospect of setting explicit ceilings on Treasury yields raises a host of issues,   shown in exhibit 7, regarding the design and coverage of the ceilings themselves, the  structure of open market operations to enforce them, and their possible coordination  with other tools as part of a broader policy strategy   As for the design features,  ceilings, rather than pegs, would make the most sense given the objective, except  possibly at the very short-end of the curve, where rates would be so closely linked to  the target funds rate that the distinction might not matter  Ceilings could be set to  cover either the entire yield curve or just discrete portions  The initial ceilings might  remain fixed over particular maturity segments, or they could roll down the curve  with time so as to always apply to the same specific issues  Presumably ceilings  would be announced  If not, market observers would soon come to recognize their  existence and infer their levels  Conventional outright purchases of Treasury  securities would be the primary operational mechanism to back-up ceilings  To  maintain simultaneous control over the funds rate, purchases would need to be closely  coordinated with any redemptions of securities, with our temporary operations, and  with any needed outright sales     Outright purchases might be arranged in one of two ways, corresponding to what   one might refer to as “hard” ceilings or “soft” ceilings  These are meant to  characterize our tolerance for deviations in rates from the ceilings  A hard ceiling  would require immediate purchases of whatever size was necessary, whenever rates   June 24-25, 2003 13 of 211    drifted above their ceilings  It would be a virtual standing facility if not a literal one   With a soft ceiling, if rates drifted higher, the Desk would arrange a more limited  quantity of purchases each day, but it would be prepared to continue such purchases  day after day for as long as necessary  This approach would permit closer  coordination with sterilizing operations needed to target the funds rate  The tradeoff  is to allow some deviation in yields from their ceilings for a short period of time in  order to keep the funds rate close to its target  As yields drifted up to the ceiling, the  Desk would purchase Treasuries  One important question about design is whether the  Desk would begin to sell and thereby lighten the SOMA’s inventory if and when  yields fell beyond some defined threshold under the ceilings  Being symmetric in this  way would prevent the SOMA from acquiring successively larger portions of  Treasury debt   On the other hand, a successful program of purchases and sales  would, in effect, create a yield corridor that would damp two-way risk and potentially  undermine market forces even more than just ceilings would      Perhaps the most critical feature of ceilings on longer-term Treasury yields is how   they would fit into a broader policy strategy  Notwithstanding the scale of  adjustments that could be made to our portfolio and the tactical finesse the Desk  would bring to enforcement operations, it is doubtful that ceilings could be enforced  over time if they were inconsistent with market expectations for the path of future  short-term rates  Success in enforcing ceilings that were not consistent with these  expectations would hinge on there being a high degree of market segmentation in the  sectors covered by ceilings  By the same token, this segmentation might also suggest  that success in holding down Treasury yields by force of operations may not translate  into equal success in bringing down corresponding private-sector rates     The need for coordination with Treasury debt management would be even more   crucial than if we were just extending the maturity of the portfolio  And there is no  clean exit strategy  The market would no doubt test our resolve to maintain the  ceilings  With each successful “defense,” the credibility of the ceilings would  increase, and the scale of carry trades would rise  Ironically, the likely scale of this  positioning across all money market and fixed-income classes means that we very  likely could not hold back the speculative pressures that would be unleashed at the  first hint that the ceilings might be abandoned  If the imposition of ceilings were  linked to stated intentions about the future path of policy rates, the need for  supporting open market operations would be reduced and possibly even eliminated,  so long as the structure of ceilings were closely coordinated with the commitment   Moreover, the existence of ceilings might reinforce the credibility the market attached  to any policy commitment  But it could be difficult to translate a commitment on  short-term policy rates into a structure for ceilings on longer-term Treasury yields   Could the announcement of the ceilings themselves, not linked to any clear  commitment, generate the kind of expectations in the market necessary to ensure their  own success, without the need for massive Desk intervention?  An affirmative answer  would seem to require one of two conditions  Either the market would have to read  into the announcement an unspoken commitment or at least a strong expectation  within the Committee about future policy actions on short-term rates, or the market   June 24-25, 2003 14 of 211    must be so intimidated by the Desk’s perceived firepower that it does not dare  challenge rate ceilings  The likelihood that either support mechanism will endure for  very long is one I think unlikely     The Committee could sanction the use of various derivative instruments on   conventional Desk operations as a way to influence longer-term yields, which is  outlined in exhibit 8  Options of some form are a possibility, as are forward  operations  For example, we could sell a sequence of options on term RPs, covering  interlocking time segments that collectively extend as far into the future as desired   In this way, longer-term yields could be influenced and a visible signal of the Fed’s  desired path of interest rates could be demonstrated  Forward operations in term RPs  could be structured in a similar fashion  Alternatively, we could sell put options on  longer-term Treasury securities at strike prices associated with desired longer-term  yields  Of course, the operating objectives set for the sale of derivative instruments  would determine their proper structure and should be carefully formulated first  I’ll  come back to this subject after going through some of the logistical issues  I’m also  going to focus primarily on options for RPs specifically, as these have certain  advantages over forward operations for the kinds of policy purposes under  consideration     The sale of any options, or forwards for that matter, would not affect the domestic   portfolio immediately and, in the case of options, may never do so  Auctioning  derivatives is something we already have experience doing  In the event that options  were ever exercised, the impact on the portfolio would be profound, assuming that  more than just a symbolic amount of contracts were sold  Simultaneously controlling  the funds rate means that any reserve effect would need to be immediately sterilized   The volume of options sold might be limited because of this concern  Alternatively,  options contracts might be configured to make a net cash payout if exercised, perhaps  by structuring them as interest rate caplets or pairing them with offsetting trades with  the Desk at then-current market prices  This would insulate the size and composition  of the balance sheet, but the payouts would appear very visibly as losses on the  income statement     Of course, a successful program would be one in which any options sold would   never be exercised  Achieving this result, just as with interest rate ceilings, would  depend on how well the characteristics of the options—the strike price and the  expiration dates—corresponded to market expectations for future rates  In this  regard, options on RPs with the Desk have a strong advantage over, say, options on  Treasury yields because the policy rate over which the Committee has direct  influence could be more directly linked to shorter term RPs than to longer-term  Treasury yields  For these same reasons, options on Desk RPs could be structured to  correspond directly with a policy commitment on the path of future short-term rates,  and they could be effective through one of several channels  First, even a relatively  small program would undoubtedly add symbolic weight  Second, they would  represent a monetary cost to the Federal Reserve of deviating from the implied path  of future short-term rates, which might be seen as further binding the Committee to   June 24-25, 2003 15 of 211    that path  For this effect, the more options sold the better  Third, a large volume of  options sold could reduce risk premiums embedded in longer-term rates, independent  of the level of credibility about any policy commitment  Here too, the more sold the  more effective  As with interest rate ceilings, the question could be asked how  effective the sale of options, either on Desk RPs or Treasury securities, would by  itself be in reducing longer-term yields  No doubt, an initial impact would be felt   But ultimate success would hinge on the quantity of options sold—that is, how big a  bet the Federal Reserve were willing to make  The more options sold, the greater the  chance they would have the desired effect on longer-term rates even if not associated  with any policy commitment, either by raising the costs to the Fed associated with  options being exercised, or by lowering risk premiums on longer-term rates  But of  course the risks to the portfolio, to reserve levels, and of capital losses would rise in  equal measure  And an exit strategy for options may not be as straightforward as it  seems, even apart from the possibility of their being exercised  Of course, the Desk  could stop auctioning new options at any time  But a decision to stop selling more  options or not to issue new contracts with later expiration dates as time passes likely  would be interpreted in the market as a statement about future policy intentions  The  resulting rush to unwind market positions would likely be very disruptive and send  yields sharply higher     Approaches that change the size of the portfolio  Let me now move on to   approaches that involve an expansion of the balance sheet  Reverse RPs or higher  reserve requirements could be combined with any of the options already described— extending the maturity of the portfolio, setting ceilings, or use of derivatives—to  sterilize the effect on excess reserves of these alternative approaches  Some of the  issues surrounding use of these additional tools are presented in exhibit 9  These  might be seen as being preferable to redemptions of bills or outright sales  Using  these tools would expand the scale upon which these alternative approaches could be  pursued, perhaps thereby improving the prospects for their success while still  allowing us to keep tight control over the level of excess reserves and to target a  positive funds rate  However, there are serious questions as to whether use of either  would be effective or even plausible  Large-scale use of reverse RPs would require  careful structuring of operations to ensure adequate participation, given our dealer  counterparties’ natural position as borrowers in financing markets  A regular and  predictable auction cycle and use of term operations would probably be needed  Even  so, having to finance through dealers’ balance sheets could constrain our ability to  secure the necessary level of funding without considerable upward pressure on the  rates dealers show to us  There is also some question as to whether the Treasury  collateral we would deliver back out on these reverse RPs would partially negate any  price effect of our original purchases  There is ample historical precedent for  adjusting the level of reserve requirements to absorb excess liquidity in the market   In the current environment, however, raising requirements might be costly to banks  because interest is not remunerated, might prove ineffective because of sweep  programs, or might be undesirable because of its effects on the volume of bank  lending      June 24-25, 2003 16 of 211    Exhibit 10 shows the different approaches that would involve an expansion in the  level of excess reserves  Objectives for extending the average maturity of the  portfolio, rate ceilings, or use of derivatives could all be pursued when any effect on  excess reserves were left unsterilized  The operational flexibility available to pursue  any of these other objectives would be increased considerably, just as with the use of  reverse RPs or higher requirements  Of course, the higher excess levels associated  with any expansion in the balance sheet would quickly push short-term rates toward  zero  In theory, short of meeting one’s operating objective or acquiring the total  available supply of Treasury debt in the process, there is no clear limit to the potential  growth in excess reserves  Alternatively, setting a quantitative target for excess  reserves far above the level needed to bring short rates to zero could be its own  objective  Operationally, this objective probably could be achieved with little trouble,  through an orderly purchase of Treasury securities in the secondary market  This  objective could also be easily paired with a secondary objective for an extension in  the average maturity of the portfolio or even some specific distribution for the  SOMA  Alternatively, a preference might still be given to holding bills to preserve  the liquidity of the portfolio  The economic effects of replacing Treasury debt in the  hands of the public with higher excess levels, and of zero short-term rates in general,  might not depend on whether there were an explicit target for higher excess levels or  whether high excess were a byproduct of other operating objectives  A quick exit  strategy—the ability to resume implementing monetary policy with a positive federal  funds rate target—could be very difficult to achieve operationally in any scenario in  which excess had built up to sizable proportions  The more short-term bills acquired  to achieve the expansion of the reserve base, the faster excess could be brought back  down relatively quickly and painlessly simply by letting maturing bills roll off  A  temporary expedient could be to raise the level of reserve requirements, which raises  the same issues discussed before     I’ll conclude by making a few summary observations, which are outlined in   exhibit 11  In terms of our being able to achieve the narrow operating objectives that  might be set for us, there seems little doubt that we could be successful, with the  possible exception of explicit ceilings on longer-term Treasury yields  But many of  these alternative approaches would have as an implicit intermediate objective a  reduction in longer-term Treasury yields; and in the case of rate ceilings, this would  be the explicit operating target  While our ability to change the composition and size  of our domestic portfolio measured in absolute terms is undoubtedly huge, it is still  questionable how sizable and durable an effect Desk operations alone would have on  relative market-determined rates  As Vincent noted, however, changes in market  expectations about future short-term policy rates can have a profound effect on  longer-term yields without any adjustment to the central bank’s balance sheet  Such  changes could be induced by a communications strategy to shape interest rate  expectations  The tactical approaches I have described could very effectively  reinforce some form of communication about the future stance of policy  For  purposes of shaping market expectations about future short-term rates, however, it is  unlikely that the adoption of any of these alternative operating approaches by  themselves would be an adequate substitute for some clear communication coming   June 24-25, 2003 17 of 211    from the Committee  Finally, all the approaches that I have described raise issues  about exit strategies, coordination with Treasury debt management, and potential for  capital losses, some of which I have mentioned  But in general, it seems that  concerns associated with these issues would be greater if we were relying on changes  in the composition and size of SOMA holdings to be the primary channel through  which we were trying to influence longer-term yields  Thank you      Governor Ferguson, if I could just add a comment  I think your first point is   the one that I would have started with, namely the problems in the financial system and the   inability to intermediate credit, which have shown up in so many ways  We are fortunate that at   least right now we don’t have those kinds of problems in the United States, so Vincent and I did   not have to delve into that issue in our presentation  It would certainly complicate matters if we   were facing a situation in which the banking system was having problems like the ones that the   Japanese have had    We wouldn’t be changing dramatically what we do now in the sense that the   operating target would still be the fed funds rate  We would still be targeting—in your example,   let’s say, a 1 percent fed funds rate—and we’d have a secondary objective of enforcing a ceiling    But at that point, as Vincent says, we would be operating with both levers, so to speak—on the   one hand, pulling money in and, on the other, putting money out  So it could get rather busy for   Spence and his colleagues on the Desk, who would be buying and selling at the same time  In a   sense it’s a lot like sterilized foreign exchange intervention in which the Desk is offsetting with   the right hand what the left hand is doing  So there is a question about the effectiveness of that   and what it would mean for other, broader policy objectives     3  Yes  Thank you Mr Chairman  Moving on to the regular market  report, I’ll be referring to the paper with a class II cover  Since your last meeting,  markets have been characterized by lower interest rates and expectations of further  policy ease in the major economies, narrower spreads, higher equity prices, a weaker  dollar, and a reemergence of headlines about corporate governance after the  management changes at Freddie Mac  Although the Committee’s decision to keep  the funds rate target unchanged at the last meeting was largely expected by the  market, the contents of the accompanying statement had a major impact on global  financial markets The explicit mention of the unwelcome probability of further  disinflation was interpreted as a signal that the Committee would not tighten policy in  response to faster economic growth alone  Some commentators went even further,  saying in effect that a 1994-style preemptive strike against inflation was off the table  for the foreseeable future  The market reaction was to price in lower interest rates  and the expectation that short-term rates would stay low “for a long time”  This view  was reinforced in the days and weeks after the meeting by comments from various  Fed officials highlighting the risks of deflation and voicing a preference to combat  deflationary pressures  Initially the market viewed a 25 basis point reduction in the  fed funds target as the most likely outcome for this meeting; but as time went by, the  expectation of a 50 basis point reduction became more entrenched, peaking with last  week’s article in the Washington Post       This shift in expectations can be seen in the top panel on the first page, which   plots implied rates on Eurodollar futures contracts through December 2008  The blue  line graphs the Eurodollar futures curve as of May 5, the day before your last  meeting  The red line plots that curve as of June 16, which was the date the curve  reached its lowest level  In short, the movement between May 5 and June 16  represents a large pricing out of future tightening and, because of term premiums, a  longer period of time that interest rates are expected to stay low  The Eurodollar  futures curve went back up slightly in the last few days, as seen in the black line,  following last week’s CPI report, some stronger manufacturing surveys, and Friday’s                                                     3 The materials used by Mr Kos are appended to this transcript (appendix 3)   June 24-25, 2003 60 of 211    article in the Wall Street Journal asserting that a 50 basis point reduction at this  meeting was not a certainty     Treasury yields fell dramatically over the intermeeting period, pushing well   through the historically low yield levels reached in March just before the war in Iraq,  though they backed up sharply in the last few days The two-year yield, shown in the  middle left panel, moved down 39 basis points over the period and at about  114 percent is now 11 basis points below the current funds rate target  On June 13,  the two-year yield hit an intraday record low of 106 percent The ten-year yield  dropped even more, falling 57 basis points during the period, to about 331 percent;  and on June 16, it, too, touched a new low, hitting 307 percent on an intraday basis   With data on the economy mixed, Treasury yields were driven largely by evolving  monetary policy expectations  Early in the period, the pricing out of potential  tightening pulled yields lower  Subsequently, the solidifying expectations for a rate  cut at this meeting, including the possibility of a larger easing than 25 basis points,  added to the decline in yields  In short, as expectations for the duration of low short- term rates were extended, the more attractive carry trades came to be seen       I should mention that, although deflation received considerable attention in the   marketplace following the FOMC meeting, on balance market participants appear to  assign fairly low odds of experiencing absolute declines in price levels  Inflation  expectations as measured by the spread between nominal and inflation indexed  Treasury debt edged lower by a modest 12 basis points over the period and, at  170 basis points, returned to levels that prevailed earlier this year     Credit spreads continued to tighten as the search for yield and prospects for this   extended period of low interest rates brightened the corporate outlook as well  The  spread of investment-grade debt to Treasuries, shown at the bottom left, narrowed  6 basis points during the intermeeting period  The additional tightening of credit  spreads this period extends a dramatic rally in the corporate bond market from the  distressed levels experienced in October of last year  For example, the investment- grade spread has narrowed by 141 basis points from the widest levels in October to  just 125 basis points currently       Likewise, the spreads on high-yield and emerging-market bonds, shown in the   bottom right panel, tightened further  The high-yield spread is 560 basis points, near  its historical average and roughly one-half the 1,036 basis point spread observed in  October 2002  The historically low corporate borrowing rates and generally receptive  financial markets have spurred corporate issuance across the credit spectrum  There  was a flurry of new issuance in May and June, particularly in the high-yield sector   The majority of borrowers, however, seem to be refinancing existing debt at lower  rates or extending the duration of their debt profile to take advantage of lower long- term rates  Of particular note was the announcement this week of a $13 billion deal  from General Motors in order to shore up pension liabilities  An issuance of such size  from an automaker was virtually unthinkable just nine months ago      June 24-25, 2003 61 of 211    The improving sentiment toward the corporate sector is, of course, most evident  in the equity market  Expectations of more-accommodative monetary policy,  stimulative fiscal policy, a weaker dollar, and the dividend and capital gains tax  reductions were all factors  In addition, the outlook reported by some major  companies surprised investors—not so much because sales and profits are expected to  suddenly expand rapidly but more that, after several years of continuous downward  revisions to their outlooks, there are signs of businesses stabilizing and some even  showing modest improvements       The top panel on page 2 graphs the three major US equity indexes since April 1    All three are higher by double-digit amounts  The Nasdaq, all but given up for last  fall, is up more than 19 percent since April 1 and also on a year-to-date basis  But  equity prices have been rising almost everywhere in recent months  The middle panel  graphs the FTSE, the DAX, the Dow Jones Euro Stoxx index, the Nikkei, and the  Toronto Stock Exchange 300; all rose at least 10 percent since April 1  The DAX had  the most pronounced bounce, perhaps aided by expectations of an interest rate cut by  the ECB, which did reduce official rates by 50 basis points on June 6  But markets  rose even in those cases where central bank policy was going the other way  For  example, the Canadian equity market has risen despite the tightening by the Bank of  Canada and worries about SARS  Finally, as seen in the bottom panel, emerging- market equity markets showed similar gains, as sentiment about prospects for global  growth improved     Turning to page 3, in exchange markets the dollar was generally weaker  On a   trade-weighted basis the dollar has declined 27 percent since May 5  The top panel  graphs on an inverted scale the euro’s exchange rate against the dollar since April 1   At the time of the Committee’s last meeting, the euro was trading at about $113  In  the subsequent days, the euro continued to rise as market participants came to the  view that dollar interest rates would stay low while euro-area interest rates would  remain higher given perceptions that the ECB was still focused on inflation  In mid- May two sets of comments by Secretary Snow were taken by many market  participants as being a conscious attempt to move the Administration away from the  so-called strong dollar policy  The dollar depreciated further after each of those  comments  Because it came so soon after the FOMC meeting, some commentators  asked whether there was actually a coordinated anti-deflation policy between the Fed  and Treasury involving both lower rates and a weaker dollar  The value of the dollar  stabilized somewhat against both the euro and the yen after comments by President  Bush in late May and early June reiterating the so-called strong dollar policy, though  many traders in the market were left confused about the Administration’s view of the  dollar     The value of the dollar against the yen was also affected by another factor, official   intervention by the Japanese government  Despite the continuing economic problems  in Japan and event risks such as the capital infusion into Resona Bank, the yen  showed a tendency to appreciate  Holding that pattern back was at times heavy  intervention by the Ministry of Finance (MOF)  Acting as agent for the MOF, the   June 24-25, 2003 62 of 211    Bank of Japan (BOJ) has purchased, including today’s activities, a bit over  $37 billion since the last FOMC meeting, bringing its total dollar purchases since the  beginning of the year to about $56½ billion  Total Japanese reserves are now more  than $500 billion, of which US dollar reserves account for more than $400 billion     As the bottom panel shows, the trade-weighted value of the dollar has fallen about   17 percent since early 2002 and is now at its lowest level in several years  As I  mentioned earlier, some traders have complained about the apparent confusion with  regard to the Administration’s dollar policy  But a number of high-profile members  in the leveraged community actually are giving the Administration credit for what  they believe has been a conscious policy of talking the dollar down and doing it  without any adverse movement in either bond or equity prices, at least so far       Turning to page 4, the European growth outlook has deteriorated and interest rates   in the euro area have been falling The top panel graphs the three-month libor fixing  in black and euro area three-month deposit rates three, six, and nine months forward  rates in green  Cash rates fell in anticipation of the ECB’s 50 basis point easing on  June 6  Forward rates, however, maintained a cushion below cash rates and imply at  least another round of expected ECB easing  Accommodative conditions were also  reflected in the corporate market, as shown in the middle panel  Spreads—especially  among riskier assets—continued to narrow  The BBB spread narrowed to 115 basis  points, the tightest level since April 2000       Finally, in Japan the BOJ continued to attempt to pump liquidity into the system    As shown in the bottom left panel, the BOJ has successively raised its target range for  current account balances on its balance sheet  Part of that increase is technical and  reflects a shift in Japanese post office funds into the current account balance category   The most recent increase in the target followed the infusion into Resona and SARS- related concerns in neighboring countries  Recently the BOJ announced that it would  purchase asset-backed securities collateralized by loans to small and medium-sized  enterprises with below-investment-grade ratings  JGB yields have fallen sharply all  year, as shown in the bottom right panel, and hit a record low of 45 basis points on  June 12  The benchmark thirty-year JGB hit a low of 98 basis points the same day   For reasons not very clear, JGBs sold off suddenly last week, and the ten-year rate  spiked to about 70 basis points  This being Japan, some saw that as a buying  opportunity, and yields promptly fell back to about 60 basis points but have edged  back up to 65 basis points now     Turning to page 5, the management changes and accounting issues surrounding   Freddie Mac occupied the market over the last two weeks or so  The top panel graphs  the equity prices of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, along with the S&P 500, since  January 1  The share prices of Fannie and Freddie began the year moving together   Freddie Mac shares began underperforming in mid-January after it announced a  disagreement with its auditor that would result in a restatement of results for the last  three years  Also affecting Freddie Mac shares was a slowing of its MBS purchases,  including an outright shrinkage of the MBS portfolio in April  Freddie Mac’s MBS   June 24-25, 2003 63 of 211    portfolio was also experiencing faster prepayments for reasons that are not entirely  clear  In any case, the gap in performance widened after the June 9 management  shakeup  By way of comparison, Fannie Mae’s stock has only slightly  underperformed the S&P 500  The middle panel depicts spreads of ten-year Fannie  Mae and Freddie Mac debt over Treasuries  Both spreads have widened somewhat  but remain substantially narrower than they were earlier this year  Initially after the  June 9 shakeup, there was some selling pressure on Freddie Mac’s debt; but as  spreads widened, investor interest reappeared, including reportedly among some large  official reserve holders  Investor concerns also have been mitigated by Freddie’s  aggressive support of its own debt in the market  Freddie Mac bought back  $10 billion and €2 billion worth of its own debt  It has ample cash on hand, and the  new management team has been moving to restore confidence       The bottom panels show how the two housing government-sponsored entities are   faring compared with each other  The bottom left panel graphs Freddie Mac’s  funding costs at the ten-year maturity sector less Fannie Mae’s  Freddie had been  enjoying a relative borrowing advantage over Fannie ever since the latter announced  its unexpectedly high duration gap in August 2002, leading to a widespread view that  Freddie was less risky because of more-aggressive hedging of interest rate risk  The  management shakeup and the criminal probe have reversed that borrowing advantage,  although not by much  The widening of the MBS spread, shown at the bottom right,  does not so much reflect concern about the relative credit quality of the MBS but  rather concerns that Freddie will be constrained in its ability to grow its own portfolio  in the future  Hence it may not be able to support its own MBS through portfolio  purchases       Mr Chairman, there were no foreign operations in the intermeeting period  I will   need a vote to approve the domestic operations  I’d be happy to take any questions     That’s a good point  There is a perception that corporate creditworthiness is   improving  Some of the issuance is being used to refinance debt—to delever for one thing—  June 24-25, 2003 64 of 211    which, again, is better for the credit holder  But also liquidity is improving as maturities are   being restructured  Now, in a sense the downside, as people have pointed out, is that   corporations are not using as much money for investment as they might have  And, as the   delevering takes place, the amount of net new issuance is not actually as large as the gross   issuance numbers imply  So there are people getting money back from repayments of debt, and   there is competition for the available supply    "
7120,2003-08-12,"1  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the charts that were  just circulated  Fixed-income markets in the intermeeting period were characterized  by a high degree of volatility, as market participants readjusted their expectations for  the future path of monetary policy in response to the Committee’s June 25 statement,  comments from various Committee members emphasizing near-term growth  prospects, the generally positive economic data, and a relatively strong corporate  earnings season       The top panel on the first page graphs the US three-month deposit rate in black   and the three-month deposit rates three, six, and nine months forward in the dashed  red lines  In the weeks before the June meeting, rates were trending down, as further  easing by the Committee was anticipated in light of the various comments by Fed  officials about the risk of deflation and the need to take aggressive measures to  counteract it  The 25 basis point easing move at the June meeting—less than the  50 basis point cut many had expected—combined with language that suggested a  better outlook for the economy, led markets to re-price short-term interest products   Many concluded that the easing cycle was perhaps finished and that there was only a  small probability that the Fed would take so-called unconventional monetary policy                                                     1 The materials used by Mr Kos are appended to this transcript (appendix 1)   August 12, 2003 3 of 110    actions  That move toward higher expected interest rates accelerated on July 31 with  the release of the second-quarter GDP data, which came in higher than expected, and  the continuing strength in some of the manufacturing and service sector surveys     Treasury yields had declined sharply in May and into early June, based on the   same set of expectations  Market participants expressed their views by putting on  carry trades along the Treasury yield curve as well as in other sectors such as swaps,  agencies, and mortgages  As these expectations were revised, the liquidation of  positions—aided by some very strong technical factors that I’ll get to in a second— accelerated, and yields rose along the curve  The two-year note traded to an intraday  high of 193 percent on August 1, creating an unusually wide spread between its yield  and the funds rate, especially taking into account the various statements by  Committee members that the funds rate was likely to stay low for a long time  The  two-year note yield subsequently eased back a little to 1¾ percent  Similarly, the  yield on the ten-year note moved to an intraday high of more than 4½ percent from  about 31 percent or so  The bottom chart graphs the “breakeven” rate on ten-year  TIPS since January 2000, calculated by subtracting the TIPS yield from the nominal  yield  The breakeven rate has traversed a well-worn range of between 125 and 225  basis points  I would make two points  First, despite the market’s apparent fixation  on deflation during the last few weeks and months, the breakeven rate drifted down  only slightly and did not get far below 175 basis points before reversing recently   Second, the recent rise in nominal rates has been mostly an increase in real rates,  which could be seen as consistent with expectations for an improved macroeconomic  environment       Still, the question remains What were the factors that led to the sharp selloff in   fixed-income markets?  While incorrect expectations for policy played a role, at least  as large a role was probably played by the dynamics of the mortgage-backed  securities market  Unlike earlier cycles, the mortgage market is now larger than the  Treasury market  Anecdotal reports indicate that a large percentage of MBS holdings  are actively hedged by fund managers, all of whom are using fairly similar models       The top left panel on page 2 graphs the distribution of MBS coupons as of   December 31, 2002  The largest concentration of coupons was at 6½ percent  The  shaded area to the right represents a very rough estimate of the portion of the  distribution of mortgages that were candidates for refinancing based on December’s  average mortgage rate of 605 percent  In short, the shaded area represents the  portion in which the homeowner’s option to prepay is in the money  These estimates  are crude and require the usual health warnings, but the trends are interesting and  revealing nonetheless  The top right panel depicts the comparable distribution as of  May 31, 2003  By then the thirty-year fixed-rate mortgage had come down to about  5½ percent and was still falling as we were heading into June  Nearly the entire  distribution was in the money  However, with the backup in yields, mortgage rates  rose even faster than other rates  By late July, the thirty-year fixed rate was reported  by Freddie Mac in its survey to be at 614 percent  The most recent distribution of the  coupons, which is as of June 30, gives a picture of the degree to which mortgages   August 12, 2003 4 of 110    went from being in the money to being out of the money  Adding up the three bars in  the unshaded area of the middle left panel indicates that a total of about $1 trillion of  mortgages was suddenly out of the money       Now, as rates were falling, fund managers were buying Treasuries as fast as   possible to hedge against a shortening of duration caused by prepayments  Once rates  began to back up, the risk was an extension of the portfolio  At that point the model  suggested selling Treasuries to keep duration from increasing  Since the structural  position of the mortgage market is well known, some speculators were no doubt  front-running those flows and adding to the liquidity demands  The middle right  panel graphs an estimate of the duration of the universe of fixed-rate mortgage- backed securities  In a span of about five weeks, that duration increased from about  one-half year to more than three years  The increase was the largest ever seen over  such a short period of time  The bottom panel on page 2 attempts to quantify the  hedging needs generated by the backup in yields  Each bar represents the estimated  purchase or sale of ten-year Treasury equivalents for each half-month period since the  beginning of the year  The red line is the ten-year Treasury yield  As with most  estimates, these figures are to be treated gingerly  The calculations assume that the  entire MBS universe is actively hedged  That is not the case  But even if only half is  managed in this way, the numbers are still very large  On the other hand, this graph  does not include whole loans held by banks, thrifts, and the GSEs, some of which we  know are managed actively  Nor does it include the activities of the mortgage  servicers      As the hedging in the mortgage-backed market reached something of a climax in   late July, the activities of MBS investors increasingly pressured the swap market,  which is the other major hedging vehicle for mortgage investors  The top panel of  page 3 graphs the ten-year swap spread, which jumped more than 30 basis points in  late July  Scattered reports of spotty liquidity circulated during this period  But for  dealers and some investors the important point is not necessarily the level of the swap  spread itself but the rate of change, since risk-management models make assumptions  about the speed with which positions can be hedged     The middle panel shows the standard deviation of the twenty-day change of the   swap spread going back to 1993  Typically this measure of volatility was very small,  less than 1 basis point, until 1998 when it suddenly spiked to about 4 basis points in  the aftermath of the Russian default  In recent years, swap spreads have become  somewhat less volatile as the spread narrowed  In July the volatility shot up again to  a level comparable to or higher than that seen in 1998 and mid-2000  Occasional  rumors circulated again about some bad positions and some losses in the dealer  community, and liquidity was reported to have decreased as demand for fixed payer  swaps rose  Nevertheless, the markets generally worked well  And as shown in the  top panel, the spread itself has dropped more than 20 basis points from its peak   Mortgage and agency spreads also widened suddenly in late June and July  That is  not surprising given the shifts in the mortgage market and, in the case of GSEs, the  entity-specific news that buffeted them  On the other hand, the corporate market and,   August 12, 2003 5 of 110    for that matter, the equity markets were not noticeably affected  The bottom panel  graphs the investment-grade corporate spread year-to-date  Although it has ticked up  in recent days, it moved slightly lower over the intermeeting period and is  substantially down from January 1  The high-yield and EMBI spreads in the bottom  right panel show broadly similar—and benign—patterns  US equity markets on  balance are slightly higher and traded in a narrow range over the period       Turning to page 4, the reversal in our bond markets is not isolated  This page   graphs the ten-year yield since April 15 for the United States, Germany, Canada,  Sweden, Australia, Japan, and Mexico  All of these sovereign yields reached their  lows in mid-June and then rose together  While part of the explanation may be that  the economies are more interrelated, the more convincing explanation may be that  bond markets are more interrelated and are especially sensitive to US yields  I have  just two minor points to add  First, the ten-year yield is now higher than that of the  German Bund for the first time since May 2002  Second, the more than doubling of  the ten-year JGB yield—from about 43 basis points to about 110 basis points at the  peak—created much discussion about the losses on the books of Japanese banks  But  it was little more than discussion, in part because the rally in the NIKKEI, it was  argued, offset some or all of those losses  More recently, ten-year yields in Japan  have retreated to about 89 basis points     The top panel on the next page graphs the euro-denominated three-month cash   deposit rate and the rate three, six, and nine months forward since mid-April  With  weak sentiment and downbeat data, the market expected that the ECB would ease  policy, which it did on June 6, cutting rates by 25 basis points  That is not marked on  this graph, I should point out  The forward rates suggest that the market expected  further easing, though less, through much of July  However, as the global bond  market selloff accelerated, euro area forward rates trended higher and spiked on July  31 after the US GDP report  The nine-month forward rate has eased off a bit since   The dollar has risen modestly against most currencies since June, consistent with the  higher yields and the more upbeat view of the economic outlook  The dollar–yen  exchange rate, shown in the middle right panel, continued to trade in the 117 to  120 range that it has been trapped in all year  The Ministry of Finance (MOF)  continued to intervene, buying $19 billion in the period and raising its total  intervention for the year to $75½ billion  In general, the yen has been depreciating or  stable against most currencies  The bottom panel graphs the Australian dollar, the  Canadian dollar, the euro, the pound sterling, and the US dollar against the yen since  January 1  The first three currencies have risen against the yen while sterling and the  US dollar have moved little  The US dollar–yen relationship looks rather like a  straight line since January 1 but perhaps mostly because of the frequent intervention  by the MOF  The days Japan intervened in dollars are marked with small boxes on  the red line      Turning to page 6, let me say a word on reserves  The Desk has faced an   unexpected decline in the growth of currency, as shown in the top panel on the page   That slowdown is due mostly to reflows from overseas for reasons that are not fully   August 12, 2003 6 of 110    clear  Regardless of the reasons, the slowdown and the resulting overall pattern in  autonomous factors have led us to shrink the System Open Market Account (SOMA)  slightly by reducing our holdings of long-term RPs and essentially ceasing outright  purchases for the time being  This is the second instance in the past year when we  have had to contend with an unexpected need to temporarily contract SOMA  We  have used the flexibility inherent in the long-term RP book to do that  But we have  found that a book of RPs with a maturity of twenty-eight days at times does not give  us enough flexibility to adjust the balance sheet on very short notice  So in order to  give us more flexibility, I plan to shift the long-term RP book from a typical maturity  of twenty-eight days to fourteen days at our regular Thursday operations  The change  is purely a technical measure and does not require a change in the authorization, but I  did want to advise the Committee before we implement the change  We plan to  announce this modification to the primary dealers later this month and manage the  shift in late September  Again, the main benefit of this change would be to provide  the Desk with greater flexibility in addressing the demand for banking system  reserves over the two-week length of the maintenance period  We will, however,  continue to arrange operations with an original maturity of up to a maximum of sixty- five business days when reserve needs are expected to persist for relatively longer  periods of time  That is often the case around the year-end, for example, when the  total volume of temporary operations typically peaks in response to seasonal growth  in currency     Mr Chairman, there were no foreign exchange operations  I will need approval   of the domestic operations  If possible, after I take any questions on my regular  report, I would like to make a few comments about Ginnie Maes      It’s basically everywhere  It occurred in all regions, I believe, except   Africa—and Iraq, as President Parry reminds me  There are reflows of currency from Latin   America, eastern Europe, and all of the other major regions      I wish I could  I don’t know if Mr Reinhart has any insight, but it’s a bit of a   mystery   August 12, 2003 7 of 110     It’s everywhere    I have not seen any data on that  I don’t believe that the ECB makes those   data available if they have them  Obviously, the euro is becoming used more actively  Some   countries in eastern Europe have currency boards, but I don’t know that that would explain the   shift in the reflow of US currency  I don’t believe the size of those countries, which is fairly   modest, would be large enough to explain what we’ve seen      Well, in this case the first thing we need to do is to respond appropriately in   terms of our balance sheet management  Then, I agree with you, the next order is that we need to   understand it a little better    I agree  I presented the picture in this way for simplicity because of the   difficulty of making that kind of calculation—locking in the closing date and the like—which is   what one would really need to do to calculate this with precision  I was not trying to be   absolutely precise but to give a sense of scale in terms of how these mortgages can move in very   large sizes into and out of the pool of candidates for refinancing, if you will      The volume of aggregate fails has been very large  It actually has been larger   in the aggregate than what we saw in the aftermath of September 11  The biggest component of   the fails has been in the current on-the-run ten-year note  The precise cause is difficult to pin   down  Certainly there seems to be a large short base in that issue in particular—and in some   others as well—which is creating a demand for that specific security, and the size of that issue is   modest That’s one point I would make  The second thing I would say is that there are no   concentrated positions, so we can’t point to one or two dealers that seem to be boxing this  The   third point is that the fails have not affected the cash market  That is, even though the back   office hasn’t been settling these trades the way they would be settled normally, that has not   affected yields or how the traders are looking at the marketplace  What I’m trying to say is that   so far it has been a back office event; it has not migrated from the back office to the front office   Let me mention two other things  First, the FICC, the former GSCC, did attempt to do a   netting among its members to try to clear this up  But because that group doesn’t include   nonmembers, the problem basically reappeared immediately  So that did not work  The hope is   that with the new ten-year note that was auctioned last week, which also will be reopened in a   month, there will be enough supply to clear this up  We’ll see  That may be more information   than you asked for!  Sorry    They’ve been functioning fine  I think the situation has created concern   among some of the dealers that as these fails age, higher capital requirements will kick in under   the SEC’s rules  So there’s been an effort to get some regulatory relief, if you will, on that side    I would agree with your opening statement that it’s impossible to answer that   with any precision  It’s very hard to assign percentages to the causes  In my own mind, the   dynamics in the mortgage market clearly were a very important factor  Anecdotally, dealers do   suggest that some of them in fact believed that so-called unconventional monetary policy actions   might well be implemented around the middle of this year  Exactly who believed what and the   responses that those beliefs triggered is hard—    Well, there was something already there  But it’s interesting to look at the   chart on the breakeven rate on page 1, which I like a lot, in part because it suggests that, at least   in this segment of the market, people were not really buying the deflation story  So, yes, there   were some disconnects here, and it’s hard to put all the pieces together in a tidy story    Yes, let me say a quick word on that  The Committee will remember that last   November you directed the staff to come up with a proposal about how we might incorporate   Ginnie Mae mortgage-backed securities into the System Open Market Account  This was part of   the alternative assets work that we began some time ago  We’ve essentially completed that   work, and we’ve learned a lot from the process  Initially I had intended to bring this issue to the   Committee either at the June meeting or at this meeting, but other topics took precedence    Currently, with the market’s rather intense focus on unconventional monetary policy measures   and also the recent volatility in the MBS market, there is the strong possibility that any decisions   the Committee might make in this area would be misinterpreted  In addition, given the fiscal   situation and the slowdown in currency growth, there really is no immediate pressure to add to   SOMA’s list of available assets to purchase  So after some consultation with Vincent and in turn   with the Chairman, the suggestion was made to defer consideration of this topic until early next   year when the environment might be more conducive  So that’s the suggestion that I come to   you with today   August 12, 2003 12 of 110     If I could, I think one of the issues here was the wording of the question used   to ask the dealers about their assessment of the likely balance of risks statement  We found that   we had to go back to some of the dealers, in some cases more than once, to get clarity because   they did not—    That’s the way that some dealers interpreted it, yes      Again, the question may have been posed slightly differently, and there may   have been different follow-ups   "
7166,2003-09-16,"1  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the charts that are on  the table in front of you  During the intermeeting period, fixed income and equity  prices were first driven by growing expectations of a strong pickup in the global  economy in the second half of 2003 and into 2004  Global yields and equity prices  both rose during August  Those expectations have been tempered somewhat in recent  days because of some disappointing data in the United States and as questions about  the sustainability of the recovery became more widespread     The top panel on page 1 graphs the US three-month cash deposit rate in black   and the three-month deposit rate three, six, and nine months forward in the dashed red  lines  The three-month deposit rate nine months hence continued to rise in the  intermeeting period to nearly 2 percent after the ISM report on September 2  The  wide gap between that rate and the cash rate was consistent with expectations in the  futures markets at that time suggesting a tightening of policy by next spring   However, after comments by Governor Bernanke and other Committee members on  September 4 and the weaker-than-expected employment report on September 5,  forward rates fell sharply, and adjusting for term premiums, that took out most of the                                                     1 The materials used by Mr Kos are appended to this transcript (appendix 1)   September 16, 2003 9 of 106    expected tightening that had earlier been priced into the forward curve  In a similar  pattern, Treasury yields initially rose after your August 12 meeting, despite the  Committee’s announcement that policy would likely stay accommodative for “a  considerable period”  The two-year note yields, shown in the middle left panel,  pierced 2 percent in early September  Around that time, some market commentary  briefly raised concerns about nascent inflationary pressures, but those concerns  proved to be short-lived, and the two-year note yield fell sharply after the  employment report  This morning it was trading at about 16 percent  The ten-year  yield traded around the pivot point of 4½ percent for most of the period before  declining to a range around 4¼ percent  The strong technical factors that had  accelerated the upward move in yields, especially the hedging of mortgage securities,  ran their course, and trading conditions were somewhat less volatile in recent weeks     A separate issue that could affect Treasury yields prospectively is supply  With   the deteriorating fiscal situation, the Treasury has had to increase the frequency and  size of auctions to finance the growing deficit  This could become the subject of  increased market focus, especially if it should be coupled with a weaker dollar   Finally, the bottom panel on page 1 depicts the breakeven inflation rate, calculated by  subtracting inflation indexed yields from nominal yields  The red line graphs the ten- year breakeven rate and the blue line the five-year rate  Both have stabilized in the  2 to 2½ percent range after rising earlier this summer       For the euro area, the top panel on page 2 graphs the three-month deposit rate in   black and the three-, six-, and nine-month forward rates in the dashed green lines   With the more upbeat sentiment about the economic outlook in the United States  early in the period, the nine-month forward rate rose in much the same pattern as its  US counterpart  Like the US nine-month forward rate, it fell back in the past two  weeks, typically responding more to US data and suggesting that market participants  still view a US recovery as key to better European performance  Long-term bond  yields also reflected this improved sentiment about the global outlook The middle  panel graphs the ten-year yield of UK gilts and yields on ten-year securities of the  four major euro-area governments  All had risen sharply since their June lows before  edging down in recent days—again as questions about the sustainability of the  recovery emerged  Finally, the bottom panel graphs a sample of both developed and  emerging country equity markets since May 1  All have appreciated sharply,  especially markets, such as those in Korea and Taiwan, that are perceived to be more  leveraged to the global economy  Whereas changes in global bond yields seem to  reflect a reappraisal of the intermediate outlook, equity markets have continued to rise  and, therefore, are perhaps more vulnerable should disappointing news arise       Interestingly, among developed markets, the strongest equity market in recent   months has been Japan’s  As shown in the top panel of page 3, the Nikkei and  TOPIX indexes have risen about 30 percent since May  Overnight the Nikkei rose  more than 1½ percent  The bank sub-index has risen even more, as perceptions about  the global recovery grew and the bailout of Resona Bank earlier this year removed  what had been very negative sentiment toward the financial sector  That rally   September 16, 2003 10 of 106    continued overnight, and bank stocks rose another 8 percent  With Japan reporting  somewhat better economic data in recent weeks and months, the JGB market—which  even by Japanese standards had reached extremely low yields in mid-June—began to  be repriced to reflect that stronger growth  By August some market participants even  began to talk about the Bank of Japan (BOJ) moving away from its zero interest rate  policy at some point next year  The middle panel graphs two snapshots of the yield  curve—as of June 12 and September 12  The entire curve moved sharply higher and  steepened in that three-month span  With yields rising that quickly, the BOJ moved  in recent weeks to calm the markets in two ways  First, in late August, the BOJ  conducted two operations involving long-term repos with maturities of nine months  in an effort to signal that the market was getting ahead of itself  Both operations were  conducted at 45 basis points  Second, Governor Fukui on September 3 offered  reassuring words that the policy stance would be maintained and that in his view  long-term yields had risen too far too fast  As shown in the bottom left panel, the  Bank of Japan’s current account balances remained at the upper end of its target range  of 27 trillion to 30 trillion yen, well above requirements of about 6 trillion yen  In  recent days, Japanese money markets have stabilized somewhat  However, the steps  taken by the BOJ may have established a new minimum benchmark that the market  will expect the next time the BOJ’s commitment is tested  That may have raised the  hurdle for an exit strategy whenever that point may come       There is little new to report regarding the yen’s movements against the dollar in   exchange markets  The rate continues to be trapped between 119 and 116   Commercial and speculative flows again have tended to place upward pressure on the  yen  However, continuing to counteract those pressures was aggressive intervention  by the Ministry of Finance  Since late August— and including the activity  overnight—the Japanese authorities have purchased about $41½ billion in the  intermeeting period, most of it in September  That has raised their total intervention  for the calendar year to date to $1137 billion  Having established a firm line in the  sand at about 115 to 117 yen, the Ministry of Finance has its own exit strategy to  consider  Various analysts expect the pace of intervention to be maintained until the  upcoming LDP elections and possibly even until the general elections that are  expected to follow later this fall       Turning to page 4, the Treasury and mortgage markets have been grappling with   the problem of chronic settlement fails, a subject you’ve heard about in recent weeks   Let me spend a few minutes on this issue  As a starting point, fails are a routine  feature of the landscape and are usually caused by miscommunications about the  details of a trade in the confirmation and settlement process  Typically a fail to  deliver is cured after a day or two  The party that has been failed to has use of its  cash an extra day  A fail that lasts longer than a few days can lead to credit exposures  if the price of the security has moved in the interim  For that reason, the SEC applies  capital charges to aged fails  Elevated and chronic fails have the potential to diminish  liquidity in the market if market participants step back from trading because of  uncertainties about settlement, concerns about credit exposures, or concerns about the  capital that they may need to allocate for aged fails  The top panel on the page graphs   September 16, 2003 11 of 106    aggregate fails in Treasuries and Treasuries only for trades cleared through the Fixed  Income Clearing Corporation, or FICC  Many of you will know that organization by  its predecessor name, the GSCC  Although the level of fails varies, it was relatively  low until May That level rose sharply as the short base grew—particularly in the ten- year on-the-run—given the backup in yields and the demands to hedge other  instruments with the ten-year Treasury  Typically, dealers will short Treasuries and  deliver by borrowing that security from custodians and other securities lenders,  including the Federal Reserve  Fails have been most concentrated in the ten-year note  maturing in May 2013, as shown by the red bar in the top panel  That security  continues to trade consistently at the fails rate in the specials market  Chronic fails in  that ten-year issue reflect a sizable short base that has accumulated during its on-the- run life  The persistence of fails reflects, in part, the minimal cost of failure in the  current interest rate environment and the correspondingly low incentives for holders  of that security to make their supply available for lending  Although this situation has  created disruptions in the back office, to date there has been no spillover that we can  see into the front office  Recent weeks have witnessed reductions in fails in the  aggregate and in the May ten-year issue  The trend is in the right direction but fails  volumes remain high by historical standards and continue to be a matter of  considerable market attention  The tightness across the specials market has resulted  in a noticeable increase in borrowing from the SOMA securities lending program, as  can be seen in the bottom panel  Unfortunately, SOMA’s holdings of the May ten- year note in particular are meager, at only $251 million, preventing the program from  providing the relief that it might if our holdings were more sizable       Let me turn briefly to the functioning of the fed funds market during the blackout   in the Northeast on August 14 and 15  All in all, the fed funds market continued to  function reasonably well for clearing purposes, but disruptions to payment flows  caused by wire transfer problems at individual institutions were a source of some  dislocation, primarily among foreign institutions  The top panel on page 5 graphs  total Fed balances  As shown by the top red bar, on August 14 there was some  borrowing at the discount window, mostly by one foreign institution that was short at  the close of the wire  On Friday August 15 the Desk did a large $20 billion RP and  provided a very high level of excess reserves  But these reserves had a surprisingly  limited effect on reducing rate pressures in the funds market—again, as it turns out,  primarily because of a few foreign banks that were experiencing systems problems  that prevented them from making payments  This can be seen in the shaded inset of  the top panel, which shows the distribution of end-of-day Fed balances between  foreign banks in red and all depository institutions in blue  Typically foreign banks  have virtually no balances, given that the vast portion of their liabilities is  nonreservable  On August 15, however, foreign banks as a group ended up with  $177 billion in Fed balances  More than $15 billion of that was held by just two  moderately sized foreign branches that were not able to make payments until late in  the day, or not at all, and hence they absorbed much of the liquidity that the Desk  injected that day  With that background, it is not surprising that the funds market on  Friday was elevated, but rates never exceeded the primary credit rate that day despite  all of these problems  Two institutions did borrow funds in the market at rates above   September 16, 2003 12 of 106    the primary credit rate on Thursday  They paid about 2½ percent for a total of $14  billion  One was a foreign institution that did not have collateral eligible for  borrowing at the discount window; the other was a domestic institution that we heard  did not want to borrow from the window  Perhaps more significant for evaluating the  effectiveness of the new primary credit facility, however, over $7 billion was traded  in the funds market at 2 percent on Thursday, indicating that the primary credit  facility was acting as a ceiling for most institutions      Finally, let me go back to a subject we looked at last time—currency growth—on   which several Committee members had questions at the August meeting  The bottom  panel updates the same chart shown last month and, as indicated, currency growth  slowed sharply and suddenly this summer  It has shown a bit of a rebound lately,  however  I should note that the last bar for August—estimated on the chart—has  been finalized, and in that month currency actually grew at a 56 percent rate  Getting  back to the reasons for the dramatic downward shift in currency growth, it was  depressed in June and July because of exceptionally high foreign reflows on top of  weak domestic demand  Foreign reflows have been fairly persistent for many months  now from Latin American countries, acting as a partial offset to domestic demand   But this was compounded by large reflows from the Middle East despite the currency  shipments to Iraq following the end of the major combat operations there in April   Again, that source of reflow has abated  In addition, our contacts among note dealers  in Europe suggest that consumers in some countries—Russia, in particular—are more  willing to hold domestic currency notes  As I mentioned a little while ago, domestic  demand has shown a pickup in August from its recent sluggish pace and seems to  have coincided with some signs of strength in consumer spending  As a result of the  pickup in currency growth, we have returned to the market, purchasing securities on  an outright basis recently for the first time since mid-May      Mr Chairman, in this period once again there were no foreign operations  In fact,   this coming Monday, September 22, will mark exactly three years since the last US  intervention in foreign exchange markets and will extend what is already for this  country the longest period of non-intervention in the floating rate era  I will need a  vote to approve the Desk’s domestic operations, and I’d be happy to take any  questions      I don’t know that I can give you a single answer  In part it may be that the   general economic performance of the United Kingdom has been better, so real yields are higher    Another possibility is that because there seems to be a 25 to 35 basis point difference—      Yes, and the fact that the United Kingdom has a 2½ percent inflation target   whereas the ECB has a target of 2 percent or less may also account for the difference in yields     I’m offering various explanations; you may think of them as a menu from   which you can pick the ones you like      I’m happy to have assistance where I can get it!    I’m pretty comfortable with the way it worked  I’m comfortable given that   on Thursday—and for that matter on Friday—we didn’t have a spike beyond 2 percent for the   September 16, 2003 14 of 106    most part, again except in the limited instances I cited  And we had a lot of trades that took place   at 2 percent or just below 2 percent, so the primary credit rate did seem to act as a ceiling    Obviously, for whatever idiosyncratic reasons, some individual institutions may have decided   either that they couldn’t or didn’t want to come to the window  But that’s just one of those data   points that we may have to live with  On the whole, I think the discount facility did its job in   capping the funds rate  Over time, as institutions get used to the new facility, we hope that the   residual stigma on borrowing will fade even more  "
7191,2003-10-28,"1  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the charts that were  circulated a short while ago  During the first part of the intermeeting period, market  participants looked at incoming data and concluded that the glass was half empty   Then for most of October, they tended to see the glass as half full  Interest rate  developments largely mirrored these shifting views  The other topic that has  occupied markets in the aftermath of the G-7 summit in Dubai is the dollar’s  exchange rate and the feedback effects that a further fall in the dollar might have on  asset markets       The top panel on page 1 graphs US and euro-area three-month cash deposit rates   and the three-month rate three, six, and nine months forward  During much of  September, markets were disappointed by US data, culminating with the weaker- than-expected Chicago PMI and consumer confidence numbers reported on  September 30, and US forward rates (the dashed red lines) fell sharply  However,  starting with the September employment numbers, released on October 3, the outlook  began to take on a more positive tone  GDP forecasts were upwardly revised, and  forward rates started moving higher  Comments by President Parry and Treasury  Secretary Snow in mid-October caused market participants to price in a higher  likelihood that short-term rates would rise sooner than had been anticipated  But that  flurry of angst quickly ebbed as stock prices began to give back some of their gains  after news of disappointing outlooks from a couple of bellwether companies  On  balance, forward rates are roughly where they were in late August  Short-term rates  in the euro area, both cash and forward (the green lines) traversed the same general  path as US rates, as the outlook there was also perceived to be a bit more positive   Once again, euro area rates tended to show a more pronounced reaction to US data  and announcements than to European ones       Yields in the Treasury market also followed the same general pattern, as shown in   the bottom two panels on page 1  When ten-year yields briefly fell below 4 percent,  some market strategists speculated that another wave of convexity hedging by  mortgage accounts might kick in  In the event, that did not materialize  However,  even without that, Treasury yields across the curve were choppy on a day-to-day                                                     1 The materials used by Mr Kos are appended to this transcript (appendix 1)   October 28, 2003 3 of 126    basis  The ten-year note of May 2013, which is now once off the run, has continued  to trade with a high degree of scarcity value in financing markets and with a high  level of fails  In earlier meetings when I was asked about the fails situation, I said  that it was largely a back-office event that had not spilled over into the cash market   However, in the past week we have noted a decrease in transaction volume in this  note, and it has begun trading very rich relative to the current on-the-run ten-year  note  The May ten-year note is now yielding about 15 basis points less than the on- the-run August ten-year note, and the issue is trading at negative rates in the repo  market Given the very limited supply and reports that more investors are demanding  delivery, it is not at all clear how this situation will resolve itself     Despite the ups and down of the Treasury market, spreads continued to narrow, as   shown at the top of page 2 The investment-grade spread (shown in the top left panel)  continued to narrow  This index hit a low of 103 basis points on October 20  The last  time the spread was that narrow was in April 1999  High-yield and emerging-market  debt spreads also narrowed, as shown in the right panel  The high-yield index  narrowed to a low of 453 basis points, the lowest level in about 4 years, while the  EMBI+ spread hit its lowest level in 5½ years  A year ago the spreads on both of  these indexes were at about 1,000 basis points  While a narrowing of spreads is  expected during an economic rebound as the quality of credit improves, several  strategists are voicing concerns about whether a liquidity-driven rally has pushed  spreads to unsustainable levels—particularly in the emerging-market sector     The apparent lack of fear also showed through in some volatility indexes  The   middle panel graphs the volatility index on the S&P 100, also known as the VIX  On  October 21, the VIX hit a low of 16½ percent, its lowest level in more than three  years  Now, one volatility measure that rose was that of the dollar’s exchange rate   The bottom panel graphs the one-month implied volatility of the euro–dollar and  dollar–yen exchange rates As shown in that panel, the volatility of the dollar–yen  exchange rate, which had been trapped in a narrow range by Japanese intervention,  spiked higher—from 8 percent to more than 12 percent in the days surrounding the  Dubai summit and coincident with the suspension of Japanese intervention activity   The G-7 summit in Dubai gave the markets a lot to mull over  The dollar had already  been under downward pressure before the summit  That, coupled with statements  from the Administration earlier in September pushing for more exchange rate  flexibility among Asian currencies, made the markets look cautiously toward the  summit, but most observers did not expect much from the communiqué  In the event,  reaction to the communiqué ranged along a wide spectrum  Some viewed it as a  milestone that finally buried the so-called “strong dollar” policy; some were confused  about what, if anything, the G-7 was saying; and some were convinced that nothing  had changed and that the communiqué did not signify any policy shifts by the G-7     In that environment it is not surprising that the dollar continued under some   downward pressure  The top panel on the next page graphs the euro’s value against  the dollar  After a dip in late August, the euro appreciated sharply in the run-up to  Dubai and in subsequent days  European policymakers at that point were expressing   October 28, 2003 4 of 126    some concern that the bulk of any adjustment to the dollar’s exchange rate would  have to be borne by the euro if many Asian currencies in particular continued to be  fixed against the dollar  Asian currencies appreciated somewhat against the dollar, as  shown in the middle panel, with the exception of the Chinese yuan, which continued  at its fixed rate  Some central banks reacted with traditional intervention to stem the  rise of their currencies; others resorted to capital controls, restrictions on access to  local banking systems, and various forms of moral suasion  Although the Chinese  yuan spot rate stayed fixed, the upward pressure on the yuan showed through in the  nondeliverable forward (NDF) market where the one-year NDF implies a 40 percent  appreciation of the currency  The Hong Kong dollar also strengthened in the days  after Dubai, at first without actions from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority  Given  the currency board system in Hong Kong, the lack of intervention surprised those  who were short Hong Kong dollars and had perceived the currency board to be  symmetric  The actions taken by a number of central banks in the region have added  a sense of two-way risk to Asian currency rates, which perhaps was lacking before   A less favorable view expressed by some was that a new risk premium had been  introduced into Asian markets  In any case, with reserve levels in Asia rising, traders  are asking a number of questions  What is the end game for this process?  How do  these countries counter capital inflows?  Do the central banks have the instruments to  sterilize their foreign exchange interventions?  And that list doesn’t even include the  broader macroeconomic questions that are relevant, such as the risks of overheated  economies  The bottom panel graphs the dollar–yen exchange rate  That rate had  traded in a narrow range until September 16, when the Japanese stopped intervening   The rate promptly depreciated sharply to the 110 region, whereupon the Ministry of  Finance (MOF) again resumed intervention  This morning the yen/dollar exchange  rate hit a three-year low of 10810 amid token intervention by the authorities  During  the period, the MOF purchased $25½ billion, including $400 million that the Desk  purchased as agent on behalf of the Japanese authorities     Given the large scale of Japanese intervention this year, I thought I’d spend a few   minutes on this topic  The top panel of page 4 depicts net yearly intervention by the  Japanese monetary authorities since 1989  With two months left in 2003, the MOF’s  intervention exceeds $139 billion so far this year—more than double the previous  high  The middle panel shows how Japanese intervention has evolved over the years   Each dot is a daily intervention purchase or sale of dollars over the period from 1989  to date  Between 1989 and mid-1995, Japanese interventions tended to be frequent,  but each operation was relatively modest in size—at least by later standards  With a  change in leadership at the Ministry of Finance in mid-1995 came a different  intervention style  Over the next seven years, Japanese intervention episodes were  much less frequent but much larger in size  Individual operations were frequently  larger than $5 billion and in a few cases more than $10 billion  Ironically, the largest  single operation is—appropriately perhaps—off the chart and was a sale of $20  billion dollars in April 1998  For reference purposes, the largest dollar–yen  intervention by the US monetary authorities was $833 million in June 1998  Since  the beginning of 2003—coinciding with another leadership change at the MOF— Japanese intervention tactics have shifted yet again; interventions this year have been   October 28, 2003 5 of 126    frequent and large  In short, the two previous styles have been combined  The  bottom panel looks at the effect of Japanese interventions on volatility during the  major intervention episodes in the last nine years  The red bars show the intraday  range, expressed in yen, on days the MOF did not intervene, and the blue bars show  the range on days when it did intervene  Since intervention typically imparts some  information to the markets—whether that is intended or not—markets generally react  with a higher degree of movement than usual, and volatility rises  Indeed, that is the  pattern we observe  However, during the January to July 2003 period, this traditional  and expected pattern does not apply  The daily range was actually lower on  intervention days, suggesting that intervention was constraining the “normal” elbow  room, if you will, that the exchange rate uses in a typical day  That is also consistent  with a strategy that appeared to be aimed at preventing the exchange rate from  moving further rather than at attempting to engineer a reversal     Mr Chairman, once again, the Desk did not conduct any foreign operations in this   period I will need a vote to ratify domestic operations     Well, I’m not sure I would go that far    Academics have long argued about the effect of intervention  Certainly the   size of the Japanese intervention has been incredible this year     That’s yet another set of issues  Nevertheless, the rate is about 12 yen lower   than it was at the end of last year despite this very, very large intervention  Compounding the   situation is the question of whether the intervention is sterilized or not    I don’t think I would argue with that  In fact, one of the points that   commentators have made over the years is that, in the absence of the Japanese financial system   being able to recycle these funds, it is left to the authorities, through intervention, to do that    Even so, the scale of this year’s intervention is very large and far exceeds the current account   surplus  So they’re recycling the current account and then some  The amount of intervention is   quite pronounced this year    I have watched foreign exchange markets for about eleven years, which is   nowhere near as long as you’ve been watching them, and I would never want to forecast   exchange rates because it seems so impossible to do  So that’s my first point  On your second   question—whether the spot rate captures all the information that is knowable—I wouldn’t even   want to venture a guess  I don’t know if Karen wants to give us some views on this question    In a recent paper, Professor Ito calculated that the Japanese actually have   made significant profits because of the carry—the interest rate spread between the cost of   financing, which has been essentially zero in the last few years, and what they’ve earned on their   treasuries  So there has been a significant profit  Exchange rates have fluctuated, and the   Japanese have been buying at different rates  But on the whole apparently the intervention has   been quite profitable for them    The way that the MOF finances its intervention is that it issues financing   bills, which in the first instance are underwritten by the Bank of Japan  Subsequently, some   number of weeks later, the MOF sells new financing bills to the market, and then it can refinance   and repay the Bank of Japan  So the one-to-one yen relationship that one would typically see   when a central bank is intervening, we really don’t see because of the secondary route, which   October 28, 2003 10 of 126    then gets unwound  Now, when I spoke to people at the Bank of Japan about this issue, they   didn’t see what the fuss was about  Their view is that the MOF is doing its thing, we’re doing   our thing, and we don’t think of it in terms of sterilizing foreign exchange intervention  They’re   looking at it in terms of targeting current account balances—full stop     Yes, but what I’m describing is the mechanism involved and what the people   at the Bank of Japan have said to me      I’m confident in saying that this is not unsterilized intervention  I think that’s   as far as I want to go  Whether it’s something in between—a little of this and a little of that—  I’m not so sure about that      I think you make a good point that spread relationships in a low interest rate   market might be somewhat different from those in a high interest rate environment Again, I   don’t want to overstate what is depicted here on page 2  I thought it was somewhat noteworthy   that we were seeing some interesting levels that we hadn’t seen in a while  As for the equity   volatility, I would take your point that these kinds of volatility numbers were not unusual in the   early 1990s  So I would agree with that  They are low, however, compared with the late 1990s   and early 2000s  On the fixed-income side, it’s not a question of fear but that in some quarters at   least I think there’s a degree of discomfort with the level of the spread relationships, especially   on emerging-market debt    "
7216,2003-12-09,"1  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the package that was  circulated a short time ago  The intermeeting period was characterized by generally  stronger data both in the United States and abroad but with a divergence of views  about what that implied for near-term movements in interest rates  In addition, the  dollar continued to depreciate regardless of the tenor of the accompanying data     The top panel on page 1 graphs current three-month deposit rates and three-month   deposit rates three, six, and nine months forward for the dollar and the euro since  September  Dollar rates are in red and euro rates in green  In the days after your last  meeting, the initial GDP report, manufacturing survey releases, and the October  employment report were all stronger than expected, and forward rates (the dashed red  lines) rose Those rates subsequently retraced that rise after a succession of comments  by Committee members emphasized that policy would not be tightened any time  soon  The upward revision of third-quarter GDP to 82 percent, coupled with market  sentiment that the Committee would remove the “considerable period” language from  its statement, drove forward rates higher yet again  But this past Friday’s                                                    1 The materials used by Mr Kos are appended to this transcript (appendix 1)      December 9, 2003 3 of 133    employment report and the Washington Post article about the possible content of your  statement for this meeting caused a sharp reversal in forward rates, and on net  forward rates are much as they were in mid-October     Euro forward rates largely moved in sympathy with US rates; but in Europe, too,   the data improved, and European growth forecasts were revised higher  In particular,  in Germany machinery and factory orders for October turned positive after several  weak months  In addition, increased talk about the “stickiness” of European inflation  emboldened those who are expecting the ECB to be aggressive if signs of inflation  appear  Rate hikes by the Bank of England and the Reserve Bank of Australia and  increases in some commodity prices provided traders with periodic reminders about  the risk of not being positioned for a possible turn in the cycle  Shown on the bottom  panel of page 1 are the two-year Treasury yield and the fed funds target since July 1,  2002  After a year-long period of narrowing, the spread between the two started to  widen after the June reduction in the funds target and did so again more recently as  the market was bringing forward the horizon for higher short-term rates  Even with  Friday’s narrowing, that spread is fairly wide by recent standards     Looking at a longer time period, the top of page 2 graphs the spread between the   two-year note and the fed funds target since 1990  The recent peak in the spread is at  the high end of the range since 1995  It is narrower, however, than the spread  frequently observed in the 1991-93 period, when the funds target was anchored at  what was perceived to be an unusually low rate at that time—30 percent  There have  also been false alarms such as in early 2002, when the spread shot up to 200 basis  points only to be walked back down by disappointing data in subsequent months   There is less ambiguity with credit markets, which continue to perform well  Spreads  have continued to narrow even as they have approached 1998 levels  Optimists point  to improving credit quality, a global recovery that will lift all boats, and anecdotal  reports of less leverage in the system  Cynics counter that there is too much investor  confidence and hence complacency, given the small room for error, and that the  recovery is no sure thing—especially for more-leveraged companies and weaker  emerging-market borrowers       The two middle panels reflect the continued contraction of risk spreads  The   investment-grade corporate spread narrowed to less than 100 basis points—the  narrowest level since July 1998 and down from 265 basis points during the distress of  early October last year  The middle right panel depicts the Merrill Lynch high-yield  and EMBI+ spreads to Treasuries  At 425 basis points, the high-yield spread is at its  lowest level since August 1998, just before the Russian default  The combination of  low Treasury yields and narrow spreads has led to the lowest nominal borrowing rates  for lower-rated borrowers since before 1990, as shown in the graph at the bottom of  page 2       While equities and fixed-income markets have performed well this year, the dollar   has continued its steady depreciation  The chart at the top of page 3 shows the value  of the dollar against five major currencies from January 1, 2003, to date The pace of   December 9, 2003 4 of 133    depreciation has accelerated somewhat since early September  Part of the explanation  is purported to be the G-7 communiqué in Dubai  But the dollar has continued to  depreciate despite all the positive data of the last 2½ months  The dollar is at its  weakest point against the euro since the euro’s inception—at about 12260 as we  speak  The British pound recently hit an eleven-year high versus the dollar, and other  floating currencies have also hit multiyear highs  Part of the reason ascribed to the  dollar’s fall relates to reduced long-term private capital flows such as FDI or long- term equity investments  Instead, the funding for the current account deficit relies  more on short-term capital flows such as official purchases  Excluding Japan and  Switzerland, dollar interest rates are lower than those of most major currencies across  the yield curve  The middle panel shows the yield advantage that five-year  government bonds of Germany, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Australia have  over the five-year Treasury  The picture looks similar at other maturities  With lower  interest rates and an absence of long-term capital flows, what appears to be giving  way is the value of the dollar  So far, the dollar’s fall has been gradual, and  volatilities have been low  The bottom panel shows implied volatilities for the euro– dollar and dollar–yen exchange rates  There has been little movement in euro–dollar  volatility despite the move to successive new highs for the euro  This suggests some  comfort with the direction and pace of euro appreciation  The implied volatility for  the dollar–yen has continued to decline following its mid-September spike  surrounding the G-7 summit in Dubai and the temporary intervention pause of  Japan’s Ministry of Finance  During the intermeeting period, the Japanese monetary  authorities purchased another $17½ billion, bringing cumulative purchases for 2003  to $157 billion     Moving on to page 4 and activity in the System Open Market Account (SOMA),   tomorrow will mark something of a milestone  Fannie Mae’s ten-year bond that was  issued on December 10, 1993, will mature, and that is the last agency instrument held  outright in SOMA  The top panel graphs the evolution of SOMA’s outright holdings  of agencies going back to 1970  At its peak, SOMA held about $9 billion dollars of  agency debt, accounting for about 6 to 7 percent of SOMA’s holdings  That number  shrank rapidly in absolute size and as a percentage of overall SOMA holdings with  the decision in 1981 to cease outright purchases and to roll over maturing securities  only when suitable new securities were available in the primary market  With the  maturity of the Fannie Mae issue tomorrow, our outright agency holdings will be  zero  The Desk does continue to accept agency debt as collateral in its repo  operations, as shown in the bottom panel  Until the late 1990s the amount of agency  collateral held was small, though as a percentage even that small number accounted  for 10 to 30 percent of our collateral  That number shot higher in the late 1990s with  the shrinkage of the Treasury market and the run-up to Y2K  In addition, the Desk  also started to accept agency-sponsored mortgage-backed securities in late 1999, as  shown by the green bars of the lower panel  The absolute level of our collateral  comprised by agencies, including mortgage-backed securities, has declined in the past  two years  As a percent of the overall collateral pool, the numbers are back to the  high end of their historical range      December 9, 2003 5 of 133    Mr Chairman, There were no foreign operations  I will need a vote to approve  domestic operations      I’m not sure that I have a third  The way I would tend to look at it is that, to   some degree, official holdings have had to fill in the gap to the extent that officials elsewhere   have made a policy choice not to let their currencies appreciate  Now, exactly how that relates to   the substitutability of domestic assets—    Yes, and that’s the unknown  I don’t have a way of quantifying that  I agree   with you that it is the crucial question, but all we can see is the end result  Exactly how we got   there is the more difficult question, and I’m not sure I can give you an answer that would be   robust and would make sense in a full-scale econometric model    I think the answer is “no”—I don’t have a view going forward  Certainly,   there’s a lot of discussion in the markets—if one looks at what is going on in the junk bond   market, for example—that low interest rates and the perception of abundant liquidity have helped   to support risk assets be they high-yield bonds or equities  I don’t know whether or not that’s   true, but that certainly is a perception  The flip side of that coin is that, if monetary conditions   were to change, some of those markets would be at risk    Well, that’s an excellent question  The way I tend to look at it is that we have   a current account deficit and that deficit has to be financed somehow  The cost of financing that   deficit can rise or fall at any given point in time  One way that the cost of financing can rise is   that we have to offer higher rates to attract funds and interest rates here go up  Another way is   that the dollar goes down  That is, a foreigner gets more US assets for the same amount of local   currency assets  So I think the exact mechanics of that are somewhat difficult to pinpoint  But   that’s at least a simple model of how I would look at this  There are a certain number of   investors who are willing to buy dollars at a lower exchange rate with the expectation that the   dollar will appreciate at some point  Now, that’s a question of time horizon, and different   investors will have different time horizons      It’s a puzzle absolutely    I think that’s a good point    I don’t have the specific number, but I believe about 10 percent of Japan’s   overall reserves are held at the central bank      Of their overall reserves    The rest is in the Ministry of Finance  All of the intervention-related activity   is by the Ministry of Finance  The bigger risk to the Bank of Japan’s balance sheet is probably   their holdings of government securities at interest rates of zero and credit risks based on   borrowings from the Bank by some lower-rated entities  Recently you may have seen some   press references to a loss that the Bank of Japan reported      Exactly what the market would do with any particular situation is hard to   predict  But in cases where some other central banks have had low or even negative capital   positions there hasn’t been any material effect that I can think of  Mexico, for example, had this   problem recently when its capital account was depleted  The market didn’t seem to be concerned   by that  That situation has reversed, and now they are back to a more normal capital posture    But I don’t know that the market would react very much if the Bank of Japan reported the   depletion of its capital    There is a minority that would say that the low interest rates here are   affecting the dollar  They would also say that that doesn’t mean that our policy isn’t the right   one  It’s just that one of the side effects of having that policy is that the dollar will depreciate     December 9, 2003 37 of 133   "
7241,2004-01-27,"  One amendment to the authorization is proposed, and I think the memo   speaks for itself on that  I’d be happy to answer any questions     January 27-28, 2004 4 of 238     I recommend that the Committee reaffirm those three documents as they   currently stand  Again, I’d be happy to answer any questions    There is a $5 billion warehousing limit, which is a part of the package of   authorizations and instructions under which we operate  That limit was mentioned in the memo    That’s right  The Committee voted to revert to a limit of $5 billion in 1997   after it had been raised from $5 billion to $20 billion in 1995 to facilitate US participation in the   program to aid Mexico    1       I was just going to summarize briefly some of the points that were  made in the memo and discuss the one-page set of graphs that I circulated today  The  Committee will remember that this topic goes back to the time when we were worried  about the stock of Treasuries shrinking rather than expanding and we were looking at  alternative assets for the SOMA  The Committee in November 2002 directed the  staff to continue to look at GNMAs as a possibility and to come back with a proposal  about how we might use them in transactions for the SOMA if the Committee decided  to do so  The memo describes how we might do that  We would propose to have the  Desk do the front office tasks in house but to outsource the back office work—the  clearing, settlement, custody, and associated tasks as well as the prepayment  estimations     I think we learned some interesting information in the course of this exercise   Clearly, this is an important market, and it has become more important  The top chart  in the page that I circulated today shows the growth of the mortgage-backed market in  totality and the fact that it has outstripped the Treasury market over the last few years   However, the GNMA market itself actually has been shrinking both on an absolute  basis, as can be seen in the middle panel, and on a relative basis compared with  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as depicted in the bottom panel  Despite the growth in  the mortgage-backed market, Ginnie Mae has had trouble competing, given that  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have specifically lowered their standards in an attempt  to build up their assets of lower-income housing, which they’ve been very successful  in doing But that has had a cost in terms of Ginnie Mae’s success in competing, and  that’s something the Committee may want to think about  The point that I made in  my cover memo was that, on the one hand, the Committee may want to approve  going ahead with this if it sees the benefits of transacting in this market to be of  sufficient value  Indeed, there may be some value in the central bank’s being in this  market  On the other hand, it would take about three years to implement this  program, and there is some expense involved     Moreover, the fiscal situation has changed quite a bit since the Committee last   talked about this  At that time the forecast for fiscal year 2004 was a surplus of about  $150 billion  Yesterday the CBO came out with an estimated deficit of $477 billion  for this fiscal year  So, to the extent that this was seen as a hedge against the  possibility that the Treasury market might begin to shrink, that reason has gone away   Again, there is the issue of the shrinkage of the Ginnie Mae market itself  Even in the  most favorable scenarios, it’s hard to see how GNMAs would make up more than 2 to   1 The materials used by Mr Kos are appended to this transcript (appendix 1)   January 27-28, 2004 8 of 238    3 percent of the System Open Market Account  I’d be happy to answer any easy  questions  Bob Elsasser is here to answer any difficult questions      On the first point, our focus in the memo was on what it would take to get the   program going  Clearly, there are some broader policy questions that we didn’t think were for   January 27-28, 2004 9 of 238    the staff to be opining on  But if the Committee feels that it’s important to be in this market for   whatever reason, the Committee can direct us to do so      No, I don’t think they will be surprised  I think this veered off their radar   screen maybe twelve to eighteen months ago  3       Thank you, Mr Chairman  In the interest of getting everybody out  of here quickly, I’ll read even faster than usual today  If the marketplace is designed  to frustrate the majority by moving against conventional wisdom and—more  importantly—the positions of most market participants, the fixed-income market  during this period can be labeled as exhibit A  Although most dealers and investors  waited and were positioned for interest rates to rise, their expectations were  frustrated  Foreign exchange traders, on the other hand, experienced the opposite  sensation  They expected the dollar to depreciate further, and their hopes were  fulfilled  At times it seemed that the frustration of one group and the gratification of  the other were linked by the intervention of foreign central banks and their  subsequent investment of dollar accumulations, but I’ll say more on that later   The top panel on page 1 graphs the three-month cash rate in the solid red line and  the three-month deposit rate three, six, and nine months forward in the dashed red  lines  Forward rates fluctuated in a band pushed up by mostly strong data, positive  corporate earnings, and expectations that GDP growth would moderate to a healthy  4 to 5 percent rate in Q4 and continue into 2004  However, forward rates were  pushed down by two factors  First, two consecutive weak employment reports offset  other positive data  Second, comments by a number of Committee members that  rates would not rise anytime soon led to short-covering rallies and brought forward  rates back down  The same set of factors affected government bond yields  In their  hearts, market participants wanted yields to go up  Forecasts for GDP suggested  growth above 4 percent and maybe even above 5 percent, and the market increasingly  talked about the timing of the first policy tightening  And corporate results in many  cases surprised to the upside, suggesting a turn in the profit cycle  Also, there was the  rise in commodity prices and the fall of the dollar, both of which might have  inflationary implications      3 The materials used by Mr Kos are appended to this transcript (appendix 3)   January 27-28, 2004 89 of 238    So why didn’t yields rise?  Among the reasons offered were the following  First,  the comments by Committee members emphasizing that short rates would stay low   Second, January’s weak employment report, which came as a surprise to many   Third, the already rather steep yield curve; the 3 percent differential between the  funds rate and the yield on the ten-year bond is historically wide, and further  steepening probably would bring in new investors to take advantage of the carry   Fourth, real yields as measured by a simple difference between, say, the nominal ten- year note and current inflation measures are within historical norms and don’t  necessarily suggest that bonds are overvalued  Finally, and this is a subject that has  received substantial airplay recently, Asian central banks are recycling the proceeds  of interventions aimed at keeping their currencies from appreciating and are buying in  large volume in the US markets  While none of these explanations by themselves is  convincing, taken together they may begin to help explain the price action      With Treasury yields trapped in a range and corporate credit quality improving,   spreads continued to narrow across most credit categories  The two bottom panels on  page 1 show the narrowing of investment-grade spreads on the left and of high-yield  and emerging-market spreads on the right  The latter have narrowed despite ongoing  warnings from emerging-market strategists that spreads have overshot to the  downside  I should mention that volatilities for most asset markets are also on the  low side  The VIX equity volatility index is below 15 percent for the first time since  1996     As shown on the top of page 2, the dollar continued to depreciate against most   floating currencies, as concerns about the cost of financing the current account deficit  continued to occupy the market  Early in January, Governor Bernanke’s comments  about both the dollar and the outlook for interest rates emboldened dollar shorts  The  euro hit a lifetime high of $129 early on January 12 before President Trichet of the  ECB—in his press conference after the G-10 governors’ meeting at the BIS— protested against what he called the “brutal” moves of the exchange market The  dollar recovered after those comments, but this morning the euro was rising again to  above $126  One of the reasons given for the dollar’s strength during the late 1990s  was that asset returns in the United States were higher than those available elsewhere   That is no longer the case when taking into account moves of both asset prices and  foreign exchange rates  The middle panel depicts equity market returns—expressed  in local currency terms in the gray bars—for the Nasdaq, the S&P 500, the DJ Euro  Stoxx, and the Nikkei since January 1, 2003  All did well on that basis  However,  the returns of a euro- or yen-based investor were trimmed substantially, when  exchange rate fluctuations are taken into account  So while the S&P has appreciated  about 30 percent in dollar terms over that span, the appreciation for a euro-based  investor is about one-third of that  Similarly a US dollar-based investor would have  done better investing overseas, given the currency kicker  The Nasdaq was  something of an exception in that its returns were high regardless of the currency  base, though that was after three difficult preceding years  The other factor that has  worked against the dollar in most cases—with the exception of Japan—is interest rate  differentials  Short-term differentials shown in the bottom left panel and long-term   January 27-28, 2004 90 of 238    differentials shown on the right both favor other currencies, which have had the  advantage of offering higher yields and appreciating currencies  And those foreign  inflows that have moved into US fixed-income paper are more likely to be hedged  by selling dollars  That may be another factor that helps explain the seeming paradox  between strong asset markets and a depreciating currency     The focus on central bank activity has been most acute with respect to the yen and   renminbi exchange rates, though we have less information about the latter  The top  panel of page 3 graphs the dollar–yen exchange rate since August  As the yen has  appreciated, the pace of Japanese intervention has accelerated, with the notable  exception of the pause in operations at the time of the Dubai G-7 meeting in  September  During the intermeeting period the Japanese purchased another  $80 billion  The middle panel updates a graph I showed a few meetings ago  During  calendar 2003, Japan acquired a bit more than $180 billion—triple its previous high  in 1999  In just the first four weeks of the year they are on pace to far exceed last  year’s Herculean effort  The bottom left panel graphs cumulative purchases of  Treasury notes and bills for 2003 through November (the last available data point)  from the Treasury’s TIC data  In general, this confirms anecdotal commentary that  official capital flows are making up an increasing portion of the financing of our  deficits  The bottom right panel graphs increases in the New York Fed’s custodial  holdings of Treasuries in green on the left scale and of agencies in blue on the right  scale—both of which continue to grow  The scale of these purchases must have some  impact on the yield curve, though the magnitude is difficult to estimate, especially  given other factors that are at play     Although the focus of global markets was mostly on the dollar and US markets,   the European and Japanese markets had their own excitement at times  The top panel  on page 4 depicts the three-month euro deposit rate in the solid green line, and the  three-month deposit rate three, six, and nine months forward in the dashed green  lines  The sine curve pattern observed in the forward rates mirrors to some degree the  pattern of US rates  The downward trend over the past six weeks is also due in part  to the strength of the euro  As the euro appreciated, the market first priced out a  possible tightening in the middle of next year, and now market participants are  increasingly talking about a possible ease to counteract the currency’s strength  As  can be seen in the middle panel, the Japanese yield curve actually has not changed  much since the last meeting  But it is up substantially since last year at this time and  is much higher than it was last June when the ten-year JGB yield bottomed out at  about 42 basis points  While some credit goes to technical factors, most ascribe the  rise in yields to an improving economy and a more activist approach by the  authorities  Equity markets have risen in line with global shares  The bottom panel  graphs the broad Topix index along with the bank and electronics sub-indexes  The  electronics sector is one of the main exporting groups, and the interesting point here  is how close its sub-index tracks the overall index despite the strength of the yen   Whatever the restraining effect of the appreciating yen, it is being offset—in the  market’s eyes at least—by other factors such as increased activity both in Japan and  elsewhere  Japanese banks had a terrible spring, as investors worried about the FSA’s   January 27-28, 2004 91 of 238    approach to the financial sector and prices of bank shares slumped  But with the  bailout of Resona Bank, the improving economic outlook, and the write-offs taken by  most of the major banks since then, bank equity shares have risen sharply  They have  handily outperformed the index, although yesterday they did sell off after it became  known that one major bank was being inspected for possibly dressing up its loan  ratings     Mr Chairman, in the fed funds market the year-end came and went calmly with   no unusual pressures to report  There were no foreign operations  I will need a vote  to approve domestic operations      I don’t know the details, but there was apparently some discrepancy   between the way the loans were classified and the way they were actually performing  But   that’s something I understand the FSA will be looking into  More details to come, I’m sure  "
7269,2004-03-16,"1  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the charts that Carol  Low just circulated  During the intermeeting period, markets fluctuated in response  to somewhat tempered forecasts for economic growth  While some market segments  appeared to be in a risk-reduction mode, others were in a risk-seeking mode  And in  the foreign exchange market, the dollar appreciated after a long period of weakness   Most of the focus was on the dollar–yen rate amid continued very high levels of  intervention by the Japanese authorities  I’ll discuss each of these issues in turn     Forward interest rates in the United States continued to grind lower as   expectations for a pickup in the labor market were dashed yet again  The top panel  graphs the three-month deposit rate and the three-month deposit rate three, six, and  nine months forward going back to November 1, 2003  The green tripwires are dates  of employment reports, and the number next to each tripwire is the difference  between the expected payroll number and the actual number reported that day  In the  November 7 report, the growth of nonfarm payrolls exceeded expectations by 61,000   But in the December 5 report, job growth undershot the consensus expectation by  93,000, and that was the first of four consecutive disappointing reports  I should note  that for this graph we used the number in the initial release—rather than any                                                     1 The materials used by Mr Kos are appended to this transcript (appendix 1)   March 16, 2004 3 of 107    subsequent revisions—since the first report is the number the market responded to  In  any case, the focus on the employment data has been intense  Although a lagging  indicator, market participants are looking to the labor report to confirm other data that  have already turned and thereby confirm that the recovery has durability  Treasury  yields have been edging lower since January and declined sharply on March 5 after  the latest employment report  This morning the ten-year note was yielding about  3¾ percent  Besides reacting to the employment report and other data, the Treasury  market has continued to be preoccupied with the impact on Treasury yields of central  bank buying  The Bluebook has a boxed section on page 2 examining this issue     The middle panel on the first page of my handout graphs the ten-year note yield   on the left scale and the aggregate amount of Treasury securities held in custody by  the New York Fed on the right scale for the period starting in January 2003  From  January 2003 to November 2003, foreign central bank holdings of Treasuries steadily  grew from $700 billion to about $800 billion The ten-year yield traversed a wide  range from about 310 percent during late spring to a high of about 460 percent and  by November 2004 yielded 4¼ percent  Since November Treasury holdings have  gone up another $100 billion or so, and yields on the ten-year note have declined  about 50 basis points  But the direct quantitative links between the two variables are  hard to find  In part the reason may be that we cannot gauge the direct impact of the  purchases because, as with sterilized foreign exchange intervention, we don’t know  the counterfactual  But certain other factors cannot be ignored when assigning  relative weights for why yields are at their current levels  First, as noted earlier, the  data have been disappointing  Second, earlier comments by Committee members that  short-term rates would stay low have affected the shape of the curve  And third, there  is the possibility that some convexity-related purchases among MBS investors have  also kicked in, though anecdotal reports suggest that these hedging programs have  had only a limited impact so far     Although the yield curve has flattened a bit in the past few weeks, it is still very   steep by historical standards The bottom panel graphs the spreads of the ten-year  note less the three-month bill since 1990  Some investors believe that yields should  be much higher at the long end of the curve, but they are battling a countervailing  force that should not be underestimated—namely, the very attractive yield pickup  between the financing rate and the return on longer-term securities That dynamic has  the capacity to keep bringing new investors into the trade for as long as investors  believe financing rates will stay low     Turning to page 2, breakeven rates on TIPS were rising—especially for the five-  year maturity—until very recently when nominal rates moved lower and reduced the  breakeven point  One interesting characteristic of recent price action has been the  convergence of the five- and ten-year breakeven rates  What is unclear is whether  this reflects a change in the inflation outlook for the second five years in that time  span or whether it reflects technical reasons related to recent increases in the CPI that  have had a greater impact on the value of the five-year maturity      March 16, 2004 4 of 107    The middle left panel graphs the investment-grade spread, while the middle right  panel graphs the high-yield and EMBI+ spreads and the Brazilian component of the  EMBI  All of those spreads widened after the last FOMC meeting and the change in  wording in the Committee’s post-meeting statement  In Brazil, local events affected  spreads as well as the fact that Brazilian paper is often used as a proxy hedge for  other less liquid securities  These spreads may suggest the beginnings of a risk- reduction phase in markets  To some extent this widening was long awaited given the  concerns that had been expressed for months about the underpricing of risk in these  segments  Other price movements suggesting the onset of a risk-reducing phase  include the decline of equity prices  Although all of the equity indexes started the  year strong, the weakness in the past few weeks has now put all of the major US  indexes into negative territory for the year to date      The pattern in European markets has largely paralleled events in the United   States, though not always for the same reasons  As shown in the bottom panel,  expected short-term interest rates have been falling in Europe as well  In part the  economic data did not come out as strong as the markets had hoped  But perhaps the  more important factor—until very recently—has been the strength of the euro  With  the euro’s appreciation in December and January, the markets came to believe that the  ECB would ease policy to counteract the currency’s strength  However, with the very  recent depreciation of the euro from $129 to about $12350, some of the pressure was  taken off, and the ECB kept rates steady at its last meeting Nevertheless, the markets  still seem to place fairly high odds that the next move could be an easing one     The exchange value of the dollar has preoccupied both foreign and domestic asset   markets  The dollar had been falling against most currencies into February, but it  then rebounded sharply, as shown in the top panel on page 3  The reasons for the  rebound seem to lie as much in the realm of technical analysis and position  adjustments as in any interpretation of the fundamentals  Data on positions are hard  to come by  But one source that gives us a glimpse is the commitment of traders  report published by the IMM every week for currency futures market activity   Although admittedly imperfect, it does offer one window into the activity of  noncommercial users of futures The bottom panel graphs for the euro and the yen the  number of contracts held at the end of each week since September 2003  The recent  shift from more than 50,000 long yen contracts to about 10,000 short yen contracts  represents the largest weekly shift in the history of this time series  During that week,  there was nothing in the data that could explain such a shift  It may simply have been  a case of the dollar having fallen too far too fast and a consolidation needing to take  place  A variation on this has a link to the risk-reduction story  That is, if risk  positions were being reduced, this would include the closing out of some of the large  short dollar positions that had been built up  In any case, the longer-term forecast  among Street economists is for the dollar to resume its decline, so the dollar’s recent  rebound has not changed the underlying sentiment  In part that reflects concerns  about the current account, and in part, as shown in the two middle panels, it reflects  interest rate differentials—except with the yen—that favor other currencies       March 16, 2004 5 of 107    The yen story, as usual, is a bit more complicated  For once the recent data for  Japan have been decidedly more bullish  Fourth-quarter GDP growth, for example,  was reported to be at a 7 percent rate  Adding in the Japanese current account surplus  and the inflows into Japanese equities from foreign investors, it’s not surprising to see  the yen facing upward pressures  The panel at the top of page 4 shows (in the red  line) the depreciation of the dollar–yen exchange rate through mid-March  The blue  bars graph the daily interventions by the Japanese monetary authorities  As the dollar  moved down, Japan intervened steadily and sometimes in massive size to smooth the  fall of the dollar  Market participants noted a change once the dollar began to rise  It  appeared that the Ministry of Finance (MOF) was actively seeking to push the dollar  higher—in contrast to its previous action of smoothing out the decline as the dollar  was falling  The largest and most controversial intervention occurred on March 5, the  day of the employment report  The middle panel graphs for that day the intraday  evolution of exchange rates indexed from midnight eastern time for the yen, the euro,  the Australian dollar, the Canadian dollar, and the pound sterling  At 830 am, the  weaker-than-expected employment report was released  Yields and the dollar both  fell sharply  The exception was the dollar–yen exchange rate, which disengaged from  other currency rates and actually rose  The MOF bought $11 billion dollars in the  hours after the data release and, in effect, pushed the rate in the opposite direction  than that suggested by that new piece of fundamental information  Market  participants were confused by the price action, which threw some of the cross rates  out of alignment and adversely affected liquidity  We’ve heard anecdotal reports that  speculators have reduced their activity in the dollar–yen currency pair—reports  corroborated by data from the major interdealer brokers indicating that activity in  dollar–yen has been flat or going down in recent quarters  The dollar–yen rate fell  again late yesterday and this morning following Japanese newswire reports that the  Japanese authorities would cease large-scale intervention after the end of the fiscal  year  This morning the dollar was down about 1 yen, at 10935  During the  intermeeting period Japan bought—including overnight purchases—$76 billion,  bringing to $138 billion its purchases in the first two and a half months of the year   For comparison’s sake, during a very busy 2003, Japan bought $180 billion over the  entire twelve-month span     Leaving aside the trials and tribulations of the exchange markets, other Japanese   asset markets appear unfazed by the scale of the intervention  As seen at the bottom  left, equity prices in Japan rose, in contrast to the pullbacks in US and European  equity markets  Bank stocks have continued to rally as they have since the bailout of  Resona in May  The recent IPO of Shinsei was in demand, and with GDP forecasts  generally being raised, the bad debt situation is expected to improve somewhat   Though at one point there was a sharp selloff in the Japanese government bond (JGB)  market, perhaps the most surprising thing about that market is how well it has  performed  Ten-year yields still trade near 13 percent despite the better economic  numbers  Although there has been chatter about the Bank of Japan’s having to plan  for an exit strategy from its very accommodative stance, most JGB investors still  seem to think that is a long way off      March 16, 2004 6 of 107    There were no foreign operations in this period, Mr Chairman  I will need a vote  to approve the domestic operations      Well, there are a lot of moving parts here  The aggregate custody holdings   are for all countries     In terms of the delta, Japan is obviously a key contributor  But there are a lot   of major players and many ins and outs in these figures  Also for Japan, their cash has actually   been rising over the last few months  That is published on their web site  I believe almost a   quarter of their reserves, if I have my numbers right, are now held in cash  So they are not   automatically–     Deposits, right     In banks in dollars  So it’s not that they are automatically buying dollars and   immediately putting them into Treasuries  There has been a lag, and in fact that lag actually has   been growing    Well, it is if they are immediately buying securities  But again, if we look at   their deposit data, we see that their cash has been rising, so they are not immediately putting all   of their intervention dollars to work    At the point of settlement    Exactly  Again, though, one of the missing pieces is how much of their   dollar purchases are staying as deposits rather than going directly into securities    Yes, this is used because I think people tend to be more familiar with this   relationship  I was not trying to be precise, but I wanted to show that there is a sense in which   the people who have been saying that yields ought to be a lot higher are really fighting this in   part  That is, the spread is so high that—     Well, that’s a good point  In the interest of full disclosure, I must say that I   put the euro in there just to point out that there wasn’t a universal response from this group    Now, one of the anecdotal stories that we keep hearing is that there’s a group of market   participants—if not hedge funds then CTAs and model-driven accounts—that are becoming   more and more important in the marketplace  A lot of these funds use the same kinds of models,   and when their moving average triggers get hit, they all tend to move at the same time  So what   we seem to have had is that kind of move—in the yen in particular    It was a dramatic move  Again, it seemed to be very much a position-  adjustment story, and that was the point I was trying to convey  It seemed to be a change driven   not by fundamentals but by technical factors—and those technical factors were most powerful in   the yen    Yes, we’re really seeing some crosscurrents  On the one hand, if we talk to   people who are active in, say, Treasuries, we hear a lot about the carry trade and about an   expansion of risk and leverage     On the other hand, there are pockets where risk-reduction moves do seem to   be occurring—where people have had some losses and then reduced their other positions  It’s   not universal  This may be a very short-term phase that was localized or limited to a couple of   market segments  We may not be talking about this in the next week or next month  So it seems   as if we have some conflicting forces going on here    Well, explaining exchange rates is always a risky business  The rebound in   part seems to have been technically inspired It’s hard to pinpoint, but I think a number of things   were going on that had some effects  I didn’t spend much time talking about economic   March 16, 2004 10 of 107    developments in Europe, but there has not been as much of an improvement in Europe as people   thought there would be three or four months ago  If Europe had performed better over the last   few months, then we might not have had this rebound in the dollar  On the other hand, as I   pointed out, the underlying sentiment among the strategists on the Street really hasn’t changed    When the euro got to 129, a number of people thought that the market was ripe for a correction    One fellow on our foreign exchange committee, which is a private-sector group, said when the   euro was at 128, “We’ll see 120 before we see 130”  So this may be a natural process that   we’re going through of a flushing out of positions, and we may have a revival of the trend we   were seeing  But that’s one guess    "
7293,2004-05-04,"1  Yes  Thank you, Mr Chairman I’ll be referring to the charts that  Carol Low just circulated  In the intermeeting period, stronger economic data and  rapidly shifting expectations brought forward the timing of the anticipated tightening  cycle and affected a range of asset prices  The top panel of page 1 graphs the three- month deposit rate in black and the three-month deposit rate three, six, and nine  months forward in the dashed red lines  The first move up in forward rates followed  the strong employment report on April 2  The second move was coincident with the  higher-than-expected CPI data on April 14, coupled with other indicators suggesting  to market participants that inflationary pressures were building  Also contributing to  the shift were comments by the Chairman and other members of the Committee—and  even a former member of the Committee—that were broadly interpreted as laying the  groundwork for a tightening later this summer  During April, the three-month  forward rate moved about 35 basis points higher, whereas the nine-month forward   May 4, 2004 5 of 112       rate moved up about 100 basis points  Not surprisingly, the Treasury curve sold off,  and yields moved sharply higher as well  The two-year yield, which tends to be the  most sensitive to policy changes, rose about 82 basis points between late March and  this morning  As shown in the middle panel, the spread between the two-year note  and the target fed funds rate widened to 130 basis points, its widest level since the  spring of 2002     Just as a footnote, I would point out that there has been a lot of talk about what   would happen to bond yields if the fed funds target were raised  What perhaps has  been lost in the discussion is just how much yields already have risen in only the last  five weeks with the mere discussion of a possible tightening  The bottom left panel  graphs the two-year to ten-year Treasury spread  If the market were truly worried  about inflationary pressures, one would expect the curve to steepen as the long end  rises faster than the short end  But the spread has not widened and in fact has  narrowed somewhat—especially after the Chairman’s testimony  Similarly,  breakeven rates from TIPS have not widened and have also narrowed slightly in the  past two weeks  The market is certainly discounting higher interest rates; it is not  obvious, however, that higher inflation is also being priced in     The churning of positions and hedging adjustments as new data came in did cause   a bit of congestion in segments of the market  Turning to page 2, the top panel graphs  the overnight repo rate for the on-the-run two-year Treasury note since February  The  Treasury Department auctions two-year notes monthly so this graph picks up each  new issue on settlement  It’s typical for the on-the-run two-year note to trade slightly  “special”—translating into an overnight financing rate a bit below the general  collateral rate, which itself is normally a few basis points below the funds rate  After  the last employment report, the market rushed to sell the curve, especially at the short  end  In that situation, those with short positions then need to borrow the security to  complete settlement  Given the size of the short base, the demand to borrow that  piece of paper quickly pushed the financing rate toward zero  The congestion also  caused a rise in fails for this issue, and to a lesser extent some other on-the-run issues,  though aggregate fails are still significantly below where they were last summer,  when the May ten-year note was in short supply  The increase in the repo rate at the  very end of April is due to the issuance of a new two-year note that is trading more  comfortably nearer to the general collateral rate     The mortgage market provided another element to recent price changes  The   middle left panel graphs the ten-year yield in red and an estimate of the duration of  outstanding thirty-year fixed-rate mortgage-backed securities (MBS) in blue  With  the ten-year yield going from 375 to 45 percent, the MBS duration index nearly  doubled from two years to more than three and a half years  There was certainly  some MBS convexity hedging, but it probably played a lesser role than it did last  summer when duration widened very rapidly from about one-half year to three and a  half years  The thirty-year MBS spread, shown on the middle right panel, has  widened in recent weeks, but it is still a long way from the highs of last summer    May 4, 2004 6 of 112       This may suggest that MBS holders such as banks and hedge funds are still holding  on to their levered MBS positions     Corporate spreads, on the other hand, actually have narrowed since the March   FOMC meeting  The investment-grade spread on the bottom left narrowed to about  90 basis points  The better economy seems to be part of the explanation for the  perception of improved creditworthiness The more pronounced move was in the  high-yield spread, shown in the bottom right panel, which narrowed about 70 basis  points The reasons are complex and not necessarily consistent  The better economic  numbers, perceptions of improved pricing power, and improved balance sheets are  part of the explanation but are not fully convincing—especially given the weakness of  equity markets and the widening of other spread products  The narrowing of the  high-yield index is even more paradoxical, given the wider spreads in emerging- market bonds  The high-yield and EMBI spreads had been tracking each other for  about four years now until April’s sharp divergence  I’ll get back to the emerging- market story a bit later     Turning to page 3, the dollar is broadly higher since mid-February, driven by   many of the same factors that sent interest rates higher  At least in this very recent  period, the improved economic prospects in the United States and higher yields have  outweighed worries about the current account imbalance  And while US data have  improved, European growth has lagged, and that divergence has shown up in interest  rate differentials  The middle panels show the Eurodollar and Euribor futures curves  out to June 2006 as of April 1 on the left and April 30 on the right  On April 1 the  Euribor curve was above the Eurodollar curve except at the longer dates; by April 30  the Eurodollar curve had moved higher and had steepened and was trading above the  Euribor curve except at the shorter dates  The bottom panels graph the differential  between a sampling of two-year major sovereign yields and the two-year Treasury  note  All have narrowed in the past month—in some cases, dramatically        The dollar’s recent moves against the yen are graphed at the top of page 4  Since   the last FOMC meeting the dollar has made a round trip, going from 110 yen to  104 yen by the March 31 fiscal year-end date and then back to 110  One factor that  did not affect the exchange rate during the intermeeting period was foreign exchange  intervention  The Japanese Ministry of Finance last intervened in the market on the  date of your previous meeting  The changed tactics had traders scratching their heads  initially, but they have since taken the view that Japan’s improved economy has made  policymakers more comfortable with the exchange rate     The improved Japanese economy has also shown through to fixed-income and   equity markets  The top right panel graphs the continuing, if irregular, rise in ten- year JGB yields  The middle left panel graphs for the past twelve months the rise in  the overall Topix index and some of the domestic equities not linked to the export  sector, such as real estate, that are doing better  Even more impressive has been the  recovery of the banking sector  The middle right panel graphs the stock prices of the  big four banks, each of which has risen sharply  Mizuho and UFJ, which had fallen   May 4, 2004 7 of 112       in 2002 and early 2003, have risen about sevenfold in the last twelve months  The  latter appears to have been unaffected by the special inspection that was announced  on the day of your last meeting     Finally, equity and debt values in emerging markets have fallen in recent days  In   part that may reflect the implications of an incipient tightening cycle here  But the  other factor that may be at play involves an actual or perceived linkage to China   Some emerging markets were affected first positively and later negatively by this  linkage  A few weeks ago the strength of many commodity prices was attributed to  demand from China  With strong signals in the past few days that Chinese officials  are intent on slowing down credit and investment, these popular trades in some case  had sharp reversals  Non-oil commodity prices are one example; they have fallen in  recent days  As I mentioned earlier, the widening of the EMBI+ spread has been  sharp, although as I’ve said in previous meetings many emerging-market analysts  were wary of the narrow EMBI spreads even several months ago  The bottom panel  graphs a sample of major emerging-market equity indexes, all of which have turned  lower in the past week or two with the changed sentiment         Mr Chairman, we conducted no foreign operations in the intermeeting period  I   will need a vote to approve our domestic operations     Well, I think it’s hard to identify what the vulnerabilities are  On the downside,   it’s the refinancing risk that is being hedged; on the upside, it’s the extension risk  As the duration   is extending because higher interest rates are pushing off the day of possible refinancing, there’s a   certain amount of selling that portfolios will naturally do    Exactly  We had a flavor of that in ’94 when an unexpected change in interest   rates caused a huge amount of extension hedging  So, that’s always the risk  Now, what will   trigger it is difficult to pinpoint ex ante  But certainly there would be some amount that would need   to be hedged as rates increase    Yes  I’m looking at Governor Bies, who may have some direct experience in   this area  But again, my guess is that there would be a certain amount of hedging that would still   need to be done    Well, the only message is that, with the euro having brought together a lot of   currencies into one, the number of currencies out there with floating rates has been reduced  We   basically have the euro and a number of fixed-rate currencies, which are not worth showing, so the   number of alternatives in the population is smaller    It may be too calm      We tend to talk to traders rather than to shippers and factory managers, so I   would not hold myself out as the expert in this area  Certainly among trading and investment types,   I would say that there’s a lot of confusion  The sentiment about China has been pretty volatile in   terms of whether the economy is overheating or not, what the inventory situation is, and what the   policy stance is  Some of the volatility that we’re seeing in markets may be reflective of the fact   May 4, 2004 10 of 112       that people change their minds about those issues from day to day  Now, in terms of inventories, I   don’t know if Karen has a better handle—      They’re down a bit    It’s May, which means it is time to consider the renewal of the swap lines  I did   send a brief memo around which covered the renewal of the swaps, and I’m recommending that the   Committee renew them  There were also a couple of other items that I mentioned briefly regarding   May 4, 2004 12 of 112       some things that we’re doing with the euro reserves  I’d be happy to answer questions about either   item     May I just add a comment?  One difference to note between Asia ’98 and China   now is that a major issue in the earlier situation was an outflow of capital, but China has a closed   capital account  So a capital outflow is something that we’re just not going to see to the same   degree in the current case  That’s one difference that may mitigate the possibility of a sudden   financial crisis similar to what occurred in Asia in the late ’90s      My dictionary aligns perfectly with Vincent’s      Vincent makes a very good point about the initial reaction in January, when   “patience” replaced “considerable period”  And I think he’s right that market participants will look   to see if “patience” is in today’s statement  If it is not, there will be a knee-jerk reaction pushing   yields higher  "
7319,2004-06-29,"  There were at least three components  One, there was an exchange rate   effect  Two, there was the euro  And there was a third factor that had to do with the increased   automation in terms of how the exchange market operated  Electronic brokering, for example,   became very, very important    Exactly  The numbers were down about 20 percent from ’98 to ’01, but all of   the signals that we are getting now suggest that the survey just concluded in ’04 will show   another increase  3  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the charts that Carol  circulated a short time ago  I’ll try to proceed quickly  During the intermeeting period  the market’s focus was on the anticipated start of the tightening cycle  As shown in the  top panel on page 1, three-month deposit rates (the black line) increased nearly 50 basis  points and forward rates three, six, and nine months forward (the dashed red lines) rose  more than 50 basis points  The nine-month forward rate now is above 3 percent   Treasury yields moved higher  The middle panel graphs the two-year yield since  January 2002 along with the target fed funds rate  Two-year yields have nearly doubled  since late March to about 285 percent, and their spread to the funds rate is at its highest  since the spring of 2002  Much of the focus in markets has been on recent inflation  reports, and the short end of the curve has responded  The long end has not risen as  much  The coupon curve, represented by the spread between two-year and ten-year  Treasury yields, has flattened to below 190 basis points, as shown in the bottom panel   One thing that market participants have pointed out is that, if expectations were for  sharply higher inflation, one would expect to see that curve steepen, but it has not   June 29-30, 2004 55 of 203          Another way to look at inflationary expectations is through the TIPS market, though  here the usual health warnings about interpretation of TIPS yields and breakevens apply   As shown in the top panel on page 2, breakeven yields have tended to rise in recent  months as the economic data have improved, oil prices have stayed elevated, and the  CPI index has risen  A noteworthy feature of recent trends is the convergence of  breakeven rates between shorter-dated TIPS and the longer ten-year TIPS  One possible  interpretation is that inflationary expectations in the near term have risen      While that could be a contributing factor, there are technical factors that may be   having a disproportionate effect on these relationships  TIPS are tied to the not- seasonally-adjusted headline CPI rate, which does create some interesting dynamics in  the pricing of the TIPS themselves  The recent rise of oil prices has increased investor  demand for TIPS because of the anticipated additional inflation accrual on TIPS  principal  This may not reflect expectations for broader inflation to take hold  A second  technical reason is related to the calculation of the inflation accretion; shorter-dated  TIPS outperform longer-dated ones during a period when the CPI index is rising  This  will reduce the real yields and, in turn, widen the breakeven  Third, the TIPS market is  beginning to mature  Pension and investment consultants have discovered TIPS and are  increasingly viewing them as a separate investment class  The movement of funds into  TIPS from that source may be exaggerating the price movements and lowering real  yields for the time being  We don’t know how much money has been allocated to this  asset class  But we can look at what is happening with regard to the dealers  In the early  years of the market, the dealers tended to be long TIPS  One has to assume this was  voluntary on their part and that they found the yield attractive  This is depicted in the  middle panel  In recent months inventories have been near zero, or net short TIPS,  presumably as the real return has become less attractive to this group of informed  agents       With such technical factors making interpretation of TIPS difficult, another place to   look at is in one-year forward inflation rates derived from CPI swaps  CPI swaps are an  exchange of fixed for floating payments based on the consumer price index  As shown  in the bottom panel, the forward inflation curve has shifted upward—in a largely parallel  fashion—by about 25 basis points since early April, which is supportive of the notion  that there has not been a disproportionate shift in the level of concern about near-term  inflation performance       Looking at fixed-income markets more broadly, there has been a lot of comment   about the degree to which positions have been adjusted in advance of the expected  tightening  Or put differently, the issue is, How much of the carry trade has been closed  out?  Unfortunately the data to answer this question are not available, and the  information that is available is ambiguous      The top panel on page 3 graphs primary dealer position data since May 2003    Dealers typically are long credit products that are in turn hedged by being short  Treasuries  And typically dealers, as a group, are somewhat net long  In the past few  months, dealers have extended their short Treasury positions (the dark line), and their   June 29-30, 2004 56 of 203          overall positions are close to flat  This is suggestive of one key constituency taking  steps to reduce risks ahead of an anticipated tightening  Another perspective is provided  by position data made available by the CFTC, which are shown in the middle panel   While these data have their own definitional problems, they suggest that noncommercial  users were going short Treasury futures, presumably either to hedge other positions or to  extend speculative short positions  This is also consistent with an unwinding of  leverage  Other bits of evidence are not as definitive  Bankers suggest that hedge funds  are still able to secure very favorable trading terms  And while individual hedge funds  are less leveraged than they were several years ago, there are more of them around and  it’s not at all clear that their strategies are so different—notwithstanding assurances from  some about the heterogeneity of those strategies  In addition, sectors of the fixed- income market where the carry trade was said to be crowded have shown only a modest  widening of spreads  As shown in the bottom left panel, the investment-grade corporate  and MBS spreads are somewhat wider, but the price action does not suggest large-scale  liquidations to date, and anecdotal reports suggest that banks and hedge funds are still  holding on to large positions in mortgage-backed securities      The bottom right panel graphs the EMBI+ and high-yield spreads  Interestingly,   spreads—after widening around the time of the last FOMC meeting and after some  negative news out of Brazil—have narrowed to below 400 basis points for high-yield  instruments and to below 500 basis points for the EMBI  There are certainly some  fundamental explanations for the recent narrowing  improved corporate outlooks, lower  oil prices in recent weeks, and some improved emerging-market news  But none of  these developments in and of themselves suggests that the leveraged trades have  necessarily been liquidated       Price action in foreign exchange markets has had traders scratching their heads  The   top panel on page 4 shows the dollar’s movements since April 1 against a few major  currencies—but this time not including the New Zealand dollar!  [Laughter]  Despite the  sharp movements of interest rates since early April and the shift in expectations, the  dollar has barely moved; and since the last FOMC meeting it has tended to fall  Foreign  exchange traders have taken that as a bearish sign, which suggests to them that the dollar  will fall once the tightening cycle actually begins  Several have noted that the dollar fell  from about 175 to 150 against the DM during the 1994 tightening cycle  Japanese  markets have performed well; equity prices have outperformed as the outlook for Japan  has brightened  The yen has been under modest upward pressure again, and some in the  market are speculating that the Ministry of Finance will return to intervention fairly soon  if the yen continues to face upward pressure  The middle left panel shows the recent rise  in the ten-year JGB yield  The rise in yields has been generalized across the curve  As  can be seen in the middle right panel, which depicts the Japanese yield curve as of  yesterday and as of roughly a year ago, the entire yield curve is sharply higher and  steeper  While the authorities have been talking yields down the past few days, many in  the market are beginning to think about the Bank of Japan’s transition back to a more  normal operating structure  In Europe, the data have tended to be mixed and somewhat  disappointing given growth in other regions  Reflecting this divergence of performance,   June 29-30, 2004 57 of 203          yields there have risen only slightly and not as much as comparable US yields—as  shown in the bottom panel       Turning to page 5, I’d like to spend a few minutes updating the Committee on the   reduced volatility in the fed funds market that we have observed in recent years  The  type of rate volatility I will be describing is very short term  intraday standard  deviations of the funds rate around the daily effective rate and the deviation of the daily  effective rate from the funds target  The top panel on page 5 graphs the annual average  standard deviation of the funds rate around the effective rate in blue and gives the annual  median in red  In general, the standard deviation of the funds rate measured by the  annual average was in a range of between 15 and 25 basis points until 1999, and it was  somewhat less than that using the median  The spikes in the early 1990s were linked to  a variety of factors, such as financial problems in the banking system that created tiering  and the elimination of reserve requirements on nontransaction and Eurodollar deposits   The decline in volatility began in earnest in 1999 and has been maintained in subsequent  years—with some notable exceptions such as September 11, 2001, and the days after   The bottom panel takes the same data and presents them in a different way; it depicts the  medians of rolling ten-day periods of daily standard deviations of the fed funds rate   This graph shows the regular spikes associated with the year-end, which have now all  but disappeared, as well as the somewhat higher volatilities in the fall of 1998      Page 6 takes a different perspective by looking at the absolute deviations, expressed   in basis points, from the fed funds target  This measure suggests that most trading is  increasingly very near the target, with very little deviation  The precise reasons for this  notable decline in volatility are not clear and my colleagues at the New York Fed are  doing some research on this question  No single explanation by itself is compelling, but  some combination of the following probably would get us most of the way there  First,  among technical factors, was the shift to lagged reserve requirements in 1998 that helped  make reserve demand more predictable both for the banks and the Desk  Second, the  Desk expanded the number of banks from which it collects daily reserve position data— also to help it better estimate reserve demand  Third, banks have developed better  internal control and information systems for managing their reserve positions  And  fourth, at the margin, the Desk is probably intervening more often now than it did in the  late ’80s or early ’90s, given the explicit rate targeting regime—though this does not  explain the continued decline in volatility since 2000     But the lurch downward in observed volatility is hard to explain with technical   factors alone  Two other factors that probably played a role are the lower absolute value  of interest rates and the introduction of the primary credit facility  Lower rates directly  limit the absolute amount by which rates could decline; so with the target at 1 percent,  the scope of deviation on the downside is only 100 basis points at present  Indirectly,  low rates have lifted reserve requirements (by boosting growth in transactions deposits)  and have created more room for banks to increase their clearing balance requirements  consistent with their use of priced services  And possibly the experience with much  lower volatility has affected market expectations to the point that the trend has become  self-reinforcing   June 29-30, 2004 58 of 203          The impact of the primary credit facility is hard to assess at present  It has limited  the extent of upward spikes in rates on individual days, as shown on page 7  But since  we saw few occasions when rates reached close to 100 basis points above the target in  the year or so preceding the creation of the new facility, it’s too early to conclude that  the facility’s creation has been a major factor in explaining the reduced level of  volatility  At some point the impact of lower rates, including the impact on reserve  requirements, will be reversed  When this happens there will be some increase in rate  volatility  But many of the other factors mentioned persist, so even if volatility  increases, there are reasons to expect that it will not rise again to the levels we saw in the  1990s  Two wild cards that could affect this picture include the possibility that the  Congress will permit the Fed to pay interest on reserves and, second, the ways in which  the new daylight overdraft rules for GSE payments of principal and interest are  implemented  Either of these has the potential to have a major impact on fed funds  volatility trends in the future      Mr Chairman, there were no foreign operations in this period  I will need a vote to   approve domestic operations      I’m not sure I fully understand your question     What we try to do is to look at the position data to see what the longs and the   shorts are, excluding certain things such as TIPS, bills, and discount notes  That basically gives   us a sense of what securities are there  Now, there will be a big repo book on both sides of the   balance sheet, so those have been subtracted as well  So this is one way of giving a picture of the   position—     Yes, without cluttering it up with a matched book, which would tend to   balloon the balance sheet  That would tell us something about the financing, how this on net is   being financed  But the matched book operation is its own business—     That’s right     No, these would be the actual yields     I don’t   "
7347,2004-08-10,"1  Thank you very much, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the charts that  Carol Low circulated a short time ago  During the intermeeting period, market  participants scaled back their forecasts for US economic growth—in part because of   rising oil prices—and the effects were reflected in expectations of a more gently  rising trajectory for short-term rates, in lower bond yields, and in lower stock prices      The top panel graphs the three-month deposit rate in black and the three-month   deposit rate three, six, and nine months forward in the dashed red lines  The three- month cash deposit rate (the black line) had been rising and continued to rise in the  intermeeting period, as expectations solidified that the Committee would tighten  policy at this meeting  But forward rates (the dashed red lines) traded in a range and  then declined sharply on Friday, as the employment report led market participants to  reassess their expectations for the pace of future tightening beyond today’s meeting   The six- and nine-month forward rates have both declined about 50 basis points since  late July      The yields on two- and ten-year Treasuries, shown in the middle panels, both fell   in recent weeks and especially on Friday  The two-year yield is about 40 basis points  lower than when the Committee last met The ten-year yield is about 60 basis points  lower than it was in early June, and with yields at this level, the market is again  discussing the possibility of a mortgage-induced wave of buying that would send  yields still lower—but I’ll come back to that point shortly  With the outperformance                                                     1 The materials used by Mr Kos are appended to this transcript (appendix 1)   August 10, 2004 3 of 103          of the ten-year note, the yield curve has continued to flatten, as shown in the bottom  panel     Several weeks ago bond traders were worried that the sharp rise in bond yields   might set off a wave of selling by MBS investors facing extension risk  With the  move down in yields those worries have reversed  The top left panel on page 2  graphs the duration of the thirty-year MBS index, which has narrowed sharply since  early June and now stands at just above 3½ years  On Friday alone that index  contracted by about six months  The level of MBS-related buying in recent days is  hard to track, but anecdotally it has not been a prominent feature of recent trading  A  further move in the MBS yield toward 4 percent could trigger hedge-related buying  by accounts positioning for a new wave of refinancing     As shown in the top right panel, the spread between MBS and Treasuries has   narrowed from 55 basis points in early June to about 40 basis points  Part of that  outperformance by MBS is probably due to a reach for yield in an environment where  the market believed it had comfort about the pace of tightening going forward  An  alternative way of looking at MBS spreads is to measure the level of the implied  volatility of the embedded option  With volatilities generally low across a range of  securities and instruments, the value of the short option embedded in MBS is worth  less, and the MBS itself becomes worth more That vols in MBS are low is a bit  puzzling given the shortening of duration, which increases the likelihood that the  options will move into the money  A side effect of this narrowing of spreads is that at  least one housing GSE has already signaled that it will scale back MBS purchases,  given the reduced value it perceives in current spreads      Other credit markets performed well  Spreads on investment-grade corporate debt   were little changed and appeared nonplussed by the June tightening, as shown in the  middle left panel  Swap spreads were also little changed  The high-yield market— shown in the middle right panel—performed well in the aftermath of the tightening  but widened more recently as the equity markets sold off  Interestingly, spreads on  emerging-market bonds—where there had been perhaps the most anxiety about the  tightening cycle—also narrowed slightly  Ironically, the equity markets hit their  recent peaks just about the time of the Committee’s last meeting and have struggled  since, as shown in the bottom panel  The list of reported ailments for equities is  lengthy  oil prices approaching $45, weaker macro data, terror alerts, and earnings  outlooks for the next few quarters that are far less favorable than the generally strong  Q2 results  According to several equity strategists, operating earnings growth  probably peaked in Q2 and is expected to decelerate in coming quarters  Given  higher oil prices and higher short-term interest rates, the recent sluggishness in equity  prices becomes perhaps a bit more understandable      The picture of moderating economic outlooks and range-bound markets is visible   overseas as well  The top panel on page 3 graphs the euro area three-month deposit  rate and the three-month rates three, six, and nine months forward  Forward rates had  generally fluctuated in a well-defined range, and the ECB was thought to be on hold   August 10, 2004 4 of 103          for the rest of the year  But forward rates fell in the last two weeks as the weaker  US data and continued sluggish data in core Europe took a toll  By late last week  even the modest tightening for early next year began to be priced out      The euro has traded mostly in a 120 to 124 range for the past three months,   though it appreciated sharply on Friday after the employment report The dollar–yen  exchange rate has been similarly in a range buffeted by events on both sides of the  Pacific  Through the middle of June the yen (in the middle right panel) and JGB  yields (in the bottom left panel) both had upward pressure coincident with several  months of strong Japanese data, improved business sentiment, a movement by some  price indexes away from deflation, and generally increased optimism from investors  that the long period of economic underperformance in Japan was at an end  Since  mid-June, however, the value of the yen, JGB yields, and Japanese stock prices have  all fallen, as investors have tempered their optimism with the latest batch of macro  numbers  Those numbers have been almost uniformly weaker than investors’  expectations and have caused some reassessment of how strong the Japanese recovery  really is      Let me change gears just a bit  In the past several months, quite a few traders   have bemoaned the low level of volatility across a range of asset markets and the  absence of perceived trading opportunities  Indeed, according to public reports by  consultants who track the performance of hedge funds, the last few months have been  difficult ones  Page 4 graphs the option-implied volatility since 1999 for a sampling  of the major asset markets  The top panel graphs the S&P 500 volatility index; the  major dollar currency pairs are in the middle panel; and two- and ten-year swaptions  are shown in the bottom panel  In general, implied volatility has been toward the low  end of historical averages for these assets, but a quick look at other markets not  shown here suggests that volatility is low in markets as diverse as the Mexican peso  and the Korean stock market       Given the list of potential worries out there, including the upcoming election, high   and rising oil prices, terrorist threats and other geopolitical issues, the onset of a  tightening cycle, and the usual concerns about the durability of the recovery, one  could reasonably make the case that vols are on the low side  Since options are a  form of financial insurance, one explanation could be that investors are shrugging off  the list of possible concerns and that there’s no apparent mispricing of assets that  investors want to protect against  A more intriguing explanation some have offered  centers on the supply side of the volatility market and particularly on the behavior of  the speculative community  This explanation posits that, with the flood of money  moving into hedge funds recently, the best trade ideas have been picked over pretty  well  But the pressure to make absolute returns persists; and the suggestion is that, in  lieu of adding to traditional carry trades, hedge funds have been selling options to  generate premium  That flow of selling is in turn putting downward pressure on  volatilities in a range of markets        August 10, 2004 5 of 103          As long as volatilities stay low, that is a winning strategy  If volatilities should  rise, then those with short vol positions would have to rush to cover their positions   Data limitations do not allow this explanation to be validated, but the possibility of  large short vol positions spread out over many institutions cannot be ruled out   Finally, note that selling volatility is in effect very similar to a traditional carry trade  both need stability of prices or rates or both in order to work  If this strategy is being  used in size, then our traditional measures of the size of the carry trade would be  underestimated      Mr Chairman, there were no foreign operations in this period  I will need a vote   to approve domestic operations      Let me answer that in two ways  First, guessing where convexity-related   hedging might kick in is as much an art as it is science  What some of the dealers are talking about   is that at a rate of about 4 percent we might see some kind of buying or hedging kick in  On the   second aspect—    No  On the second point of where the rate might need to be to trigger a   refinancing wave, the universe is pretty limited, as you say  In the spring, when the ten-year rate got   to about 39 percent, a good deal of refinancing occurred  So, really, the candidates for refinancing   are the mortgages that were originated over the last few months at higher rates; those now might   become attractive candidates for refinancing  As for how many of those there are outstanding, I   don’t have the data here, but I agree with you that it’s probably not a huge number     Yes, exactly  And the number is probably not huge; it’s nowhere near as large   as what we saw, say, in late ’02 and the spring of ’03     Again, might it have some effect?  Yes  Would it have the same kind of effect   that we saw in those earlier periods?  Probably not      Also it’s a difference between historical observed volatility and the implied   volatility   "
7372,2004-09-21,"1  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the charts that Carol  Low circulated a short time ago  In the intermeeting period, markets were generally  calm, and investors perceived events with a generally positive outlook  Despite the  Committee’s tightening of policy on August 10, yields fell across the coupon curve,  spreads narrowed, equities rose, and asset markets continued to exhibit unusually low  volatility       The top panel on the first page graphs the three-month deposit rate in black and   the three-month rate three, six, and nine months forward in the dashed red lines since  mid-June The cash rate rose commensurately with the increases in the target fed  funds rate  But forward rates have been falling gently at the same time, apparently as  the softer data and more-tepid corporate outlooks caused market participants to revise  their expected path of further monetary tightening       The coupon curve has also declined  Two-year Treasury yields, which tend to be   very sensitive to the funds rate, held firm and actually declined a few basis points  since the last meeting, as shown in the middle left panel  But the ten-year yield  continued to fall  This morning the yield was at 407 percent, not far from the mid- March lows before the strong April employment report  At this point the ten-year  yield is again close to hitting levels that may trigger mortgage hedging activity that  could send yields lower     In part the fall in yields seems associated with the softer data—the revised and   lower forecasts—and in part the persistence of high oil prices The market is viewing  higher oil prices as a restraining force far more than as an inflationary one  The net  result is that the yield curve has continued to flatten  A flattening yield curve is not  unusual in a tightening cycle  But the typical pattern is that the short end rises faster  than the long end—which also rises  This cycle has had the anomalous situation in  which the very short end is rising and the rest of the curve is falling       How unusual is this cycle?  The top of page 2 graphs the change in the two-year   yield measured in basis points indexed to the date of the first tightening in recent   September 21, 2004 3 of 100          cycles—for 1994, the mini-cycle of 1997, 1999, and 2004  I did not include earlier  cycles given the different policy and operating environment prior to 1994  As this  graphs shows, the red line depicting 2004 stands out in that yields have fallen  We  see the same pattern for ten-year yields in the middle panel  Finally, the bottom panel  graphs the change in the swap spread also on the same basis  This last item has more  variability, but again this cycle stands out in that spreads have actually narrowed  since the beginning of the tightening cycle  Admittedly this is a limited sample, and  one can argue whether 1997 should even be included, but it is notable in any case that  the market’s reaction has progressively become more benign as the Committee has  become more transparent and the communications policy has evolved     Moving to page 3, breakeven rates on TIPS have narrowed and that fall even   accelerated as the price of oil again headed higher in recent weeks  Whereas earlier  this year the correlation between TIPS breakevens and oil price changes was positive,  it has now turned negative—again suggesting that the economic tax of higher oil  prices is viewed as a more powerful force than its inflationary impact  The middle  panels graph corporate and emerging-market spreads, which continued to narrow   Corporate issuance was on the low side, while investors’ search for yield continued   And after a soggy July, equity prices have risen since your last meeting despite some  downbeat corporate outlooks, the summer slowdown in retail sales, and a buildup of  inventories in parts of the tech sector     Extending this favorable picture is the continuing low volatility in many markets    Page 4 graphs the implied volatility for the S&P 500, the major currency pairs, and  representative swaption contracts  These are similar to graphs I presented at the last  meeting, so I won’t go through them in any detail but only to note that implied  volatilities remain low and in some cases are going still lower  The VIX equity  implied volatility index is at about 14 percent, its lowest level in about a decade  This  combination of low volatility, narrow spreads, stable or rising equity prices, and  lower yields, even in the face of tightening monetary policy, is about as benign an  environment as one can imagine  What is unclear is whether this happy set of  conditions will persist or whether this is the calm before the storm     One market that did see a bit of volatility during the intermeeting period was the   fed funds market  After my June briefing, when I described how the fed funds market  had become less volatile, this is a development I should have anticipated!  [Laughter]  Ironically probably the main reason for the volatility around the time of the last  Committee meeting is the transparency of monetary policy and the confidence this  gives reserve managers at banks to buy reserves to meet requirements before a well- anticipated rate increase  I’d like to spend the rest of my briefing on this topic  But  let me step back a bit to summarize what we at the Desk do on a day-to-day basis       Keeping the funds rate close to its target involves providing enough reserves over   a maintenance period to allow banks to achieve two objectives  First, the injected  reserves should allow the banks to meet all their requirements as well as their   September 21, 2004 4 of 100          precautionary demands for excess reserves  Second, the reserves need to be injected  at a measured pace to avoid undue risks that some banks will end any day overdrawn  or that some banks will accumulate so many reserves early in the maintenance period  that they risk holding unwanted excess levels by the end of the period  But managing  reserves becomes more complicated when there is a great degree of certainty  regarding changes to the target fed funds rate around FOMC meeting dates  When  the expectation of a potential rate hike becomes priced into the interest rate futures  market, these expectations also begin to show through to the funds rate in the days of  the maintenance period immediately prior to an FOMC meeting at which an increase  in the policy rate is anticipated  Reserve managers begin to shift their demand for  balances to meet more of their reserve requirements ahead of the meeting, when rates  are expected to be relatively cheap     This reaction was exhibited during the reserve maintenance period leading up to   the August 10 increase in the fed funds target, as shown in the shaded portion of the  top panel on page 5  That panel depicts the target funds rate in black and the  effective rate in the horizontal red line, along with the highs and lows for each day   With near certainty that the Committee would raise the target funds rate, the incentive  for reserve managers was to accumulate reserves and bid up the funds rate  The Desk  sought to lean against those pressures by adding more reserves than is typical at that  point in the reserve maintenance period  The green line in the bottom panel graphs  the average level of excess balances in that period compared with more-normal  levels, the blue line  Perhaps the funds rate would have been even firmer had we not  added the extra reserves  However, as we witnessed in that reserve maintenance  period, there are tradeoffs in how the Desk reacts to a widely anticipated rate hike   The added reserves may be of limited effectiveness if expectations are very firm   And any buildup of high cumulative excess reserve balances in the banking system  during the first half of the maintenance period will leave banks holding a much higher  than normal level of reserves than they typically want at that stage in a period once  the meeting date has passed  That could possibly set up conditions in which  downward pressure on rates would emerge—whether the funds target was raised at  the meeting or not      This risk materialized after the August meeting because the Desk did not feel that   it had the scope to reduce cumulative excess positions following the meeting date   Given the upcoming high payment flow day of the Treasury’s mid-quarter refunding  settlement on August 16, to do so seemed likely to exacerbate the expected upward  rate pressures anticipated on that day  As we witnessed during this period, the high  cumulative excess positions eventually led to very high levels of volatility  The latter  worked their way into trading as the end of the maintenance period approached, with  trading well below the new target rate as well  At the same time, it’s questionable  what impact the high levels of excess reserves provided early in the period had in  damping rate pressure before the change was announced  Evidence suggests that that  effect was only limited        September 21, 2004 5 of 100          As the Desk will continue to face these challenges in a rising interest rate  environment, it may be prudent to battle firm trading conditions less aggressively  prior to a widely anticipated hike in the funds rate  While providing some level of  reserves in excess of median levels in the midst of firm trading may be warranted, we  are likely to be cautious in our provision, recognizing the risks that arise from high  cumulative balances subsequent to the actual rate movement     Mr Chairman, there were no foreign exchange operations in the period  I should   note that tomorrow will mark four years since the last intervention by the US  monetary authorities  This continues the longest period of non-intervention by the  US monetary authorities in the floating rate period  I will need a vote to approve  domestic operations        Well, that’s an excellent question  The charge that I at least believe I have   from this Committee is to achieve—     Well, okay  But in the regime under which we are now operating, as far as   I’m aware I’m expected to try to achieve the target fed funds rate every day  So despite the fact   that the market is expecting a higher funds rate, until the Committee decides to raise its rate   objective, we’re still working under the old directive     Well, what you’re suggesting would make our task easier  We felt somewhat   uncomfortable with the result in that final reserve maintenance period in August, so I think doing   what you suggest would make our life a lot easier     Yes    Well, I think it would be very awkward to have any kind of pre-  commitment—I’m not sure if that’s the right word—about reserves unless we were to do that in   every period   September 21, 2004 8 of 100           Having a two-week reserve maintenance period and operating on a daily   basis to achieve the funds target daily will result in the market trying to anticipate moves that   may happen within the maintenance period  It’s not a stable equilibrium  We’d have to give it   some thought, but I’m not sure what the obvious solution to that is    Mr Chairman, if I could?  One thing that President Lacker pointed out is   that, if we operated more than once on the first day of the reserve maintenance period, we could   create as much reserves as possible, and we’d probably do a better job of achieving the target   rate on that first day  The cost of that, though, is that in subsequent days we might have a very   low funds rate for the rest of the reserve maintenance period  Therefore, over the period as a   whole we might have a rate that is below the target  So there is a tradeoff here     Could I just make one small point?  In a sense, after ’94 the Desk was taken   out of the business of signaling policy changes, which was a positive development    MR KOHN  Absolutely     I think one thing we should be careful of is not to get back into that practice   by having either a signal or a non-signal be taken from what the Desk does  That would not be   something that I think this Committee would welcome  Certainly we at the Desk wouldn’t   welcome it  "
7398,2004-11-10,"1  1The materials used by Mr Kos are appended to this transcript (appendix 1)     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the charts circulated a  short time ago  During the intermeeting period, asset prices traded largely in the ranges  we have seen for most of the year, though certain trends were maintained, particularly  the continued flattening of the yield curve, the narrowing of spreads, and the  depreciation of the dollar against some of the major currencies  Until Friday’s  surprisingly strong employment data, market participants had focused more on signs of  a slowdown in growth   November 10, 2004 3 of 107      The top panel on the first page graphs the three-month deposit rate in black and the   rates three, six, and nine months forward in red  Forward rates sagged somewhat after  the September employment report that was released on October 8  However, forward  rates began to rise again when oil prices began to fall from recent highs of $55 and then  again after Friday’s October employment report     Two-year note yields, shown in the middle left panel, have risen more than 35 basis   points since the last meeting, with much of the increase coming in the past few days   The longer end of the curve has not responded as much  Ten-year yields, depicted in the  middle right panel, rose about 20 basis points and have remained in the 4 to 4¼ percent  range  As a result, as shown in the bottom panel, the yield curve has continued to  flatten, with the two-year to ten-year spread narrowing further since the September  meeting  Some in the market are interpreting this flattening as reassurance that  inflationary concerns are contained     Interestingly, despite the flattening of the curve, TIPS breakeven rates have widened   since the September meeting  As shown in the top left panel of the next page, ten-year  breakeven rates widened about ¼ percentage point  Part of the recent widening may  have been due to the last CPI report, which rose 04 points  TIPS, as you know, use the  non-seasonally-adjusted consumer price index to determine inflation compensation   That makes the latest widening a bit of a puzzle since the recent decline in oil prices  may reasonably be expected to have a damping effect on upcoming CPI reports  Indeed,  to add to the puzzle, some have linked the recent widening of breakeven spreads to the  recent fall in oil prices on the theory that this is stimulative to growth and later for  inflation     As depicted in the middle panel, spreads have continued to narrow  The   investment-grade spread, in the middle left panel, is currently at its lowest level since  July 1998  High-yield and emerging-market spreads, shown in the middle right panel,  are also at multiyear lows  While some of the narrowing is, no doubt, the result of a  search for yield by some investors, the strong cash positions of the corporate sector, the  repair to balance sheets since the fall of 2002, and improved situations in some major  emerging markets—especially Brazil—suggest that the move can’t be categorized  solely as a liquidity story  Equity prices have risen in recent days but they are only  slightly higher for the year, and implied volatilities are a bit higher but not materially so     Changing gears a bit, right after the Committee’s September meeting, OFHEO   released its report on Fannie Mae’s accounting methodology  At first, Fannie Mae’s  stock price fell about 15 percent and sharply underperformed both Freddie Mac’s stock  and the broader indexes  Fannie’s equity price has since regained about half its losses   The effect in spread markets, as shown in the bottom right panel, was fleeting  The  green line graphs the spread of Fannie’s senior ten-year debt to Treasuries, which  widened about 10 basis points initially but has now retraced that move fully and is back  to its mid-September level The blue line graphs the spread to the ten-year swap rate,  which is probably more meaningful to Fannie’s funding and hedging costs  That spread  also widened slightly but has since retraced      November 10, 2004 4 of 107    Finally, let me say a few words about foreign exchange markets The dollar  continued to fall during the intermeeting period, though the reasons for its fall are less  than clear The top panel on page 3 graphs the dollar’s movements against a selected  group of currencies indexed from September 1  Despite some thought that the Japanese  authorities might begin intervening again, the dollar has fallen below 106 yen   Meanwhile, the euro has risen to nearly $130 and was trading at $12975 earlier this  morning  These are the euro’s highest levels since its launch  The Canadian dollar is at  its strongest level since 1992; the Swiss franc is at its highest level since 1996; and the  British pound a week or two ago hit its highest level since the ERM crisis of 1992     In recent weeks the market has focused its attention quite a bit more on the current   account deficit  Indeed, some market commentators ascribed part of the dollar’s fall to  comments by several Committee members speaking about the size and implications of  the current account deficit  However, the deficit has been with us for a long time, and it  is not clear why it should suddenly capture the market’s imagination  Other  commentators focused more on what they saw as uncertainties about the growth outlook  for the United States in 2005 or the possibility that the election would not have a clear  winner  And still others viewed the prospect of a Kerry victory as dollar negative  In  the event, of course, the election produced a quick winner  Friday’s employment data  were far stronger than expected, and on Monday ECB President Trichet dabbled in a bit  of verbal intervention when he labeled recent euro–dollar moves as “brutal” and  “unwelcome”  That the dollar was either sold off or at best held its ground after each of  these events has added to the bearishness many traders now have toward the dollar in  the near term  Interestingly, some of the same people who previously believed a Kerry  victory would be bearish because of trade concerns now see the Bush victory as bearish  on the assertion that the budget situation will not be addressed     Asian currencies also gathered more attention than usual in recent weeks  The move   by the People’s Bank of China to increase interest rates by 27 basis points and remove  the ceiling on bank lending rates was taken as a symbol of the authorities’ determination  to rein in growth  Several commodity prices, especially metals prices, fell in the days  after the decision, though the price of oil did not begin to ease until a week later   Interestingly, some market participants viewed this interest rate move as a signal that the  authorities might be more willing to revalue the exchange rate The middle panel graphs  the yuan spot rate, which is fixed at 828 to the dollar, and the forward rates implied  from one-, six-, and twelve-month nondeliverable forwards  The forwards widened  somewhat to a level seen earlier this year during another wave of speculation that a  move might be at hand     While China’s exchange rate has stayed solidly fixed at 828, some of the other   Asian countries have permitted some modest appreciation of their currencies against the  dollar  The bottom panel on page 3 graphs the changes in six selected currencies since  early August  Although appreciations of between 2 and 5 percent may not seem like  much, they have been noted by market participants given how little these currencies had  moved previously  The reasons for permitting this appreciation probably differ from  one country to the next, but some have probably hit the point where they need to  balance competitive issues vis-à-vis China against the inflationary impact on their own  economy of continuing to intervene in foreign exchange markets  The balance may   November 10, 2004 5 of 107    have shifted back somewhat overnight in South Korea, which reportedly intervened  aggressively to prevent a further rise of the won  Market participants estimated that the  intervention was between $600 million and $2 billion  Other Asian currencies  depreciated modestly as well     Mr Chairman, there were no foreign operations by the Desk in the period  If you   agree, I suggest that we pause for any questions and approval of the domestic  operations  Then I could say a few words about the memo that Vincent and I circulated  last week about the Desk’s domestic operations      Shall we do that now?    Okay, fine  At the last meeting, the Committee asked Vincent and me to be a   “committee of two” to review how the Desk operates during a period when the market strongly   expects the Committee to change the target fed funds rate  I should say that most of the work was   conducted by Spence Hilton, who is sitting to my left, and by Jim Clouse from the Board’s staff,   who is also here today  I won’t repeat everything that’s in the memo, which I think speaks for   itself, but I’ll summarize our primary conclusions  First, we found that the volatility of the fed   funds rate does not seem to correlate with any major asset class  Therefore, to the extent that there   is volatility in this narrow sector, it has no observable adverse spillover effects  We also believe   that over time the Desk has the tools to deal with such circumstances  Indeed, we think we learned   something from the August experience that helped us manage the funds rate around the September   FOMC meeting  And over time, as both the Desk and bank reserve managers adapt to the new   environment, I would expect this type of volatility to dissipate   If the Committee did wish to change the regime, the choices fall in two categories  First,   FOMC meeting dates could consciously be aligned to coincide with the end of the reserve   maintenance period  A variation would be for policy changes to take effect in the next reserve   period  A second possibility would involve publishing reserve forecasts  Both of these regime-  November 10, 2004 6 of 107    change options have some disadvantages, and the solutions themselves may create new problems    Thus, at the risk of seeming to push for the status quo, our recommendation is to maintain the   current operating framework  Vincent, I don’t know if you have anything to add      I know I haven’t done it  "
7422,2004-12-14,"1  Thank you, Mr Chairman  With the outcome of this meeting firmly  priced into markets, the intermeeting period was characterized by more than usual  attention to exchange rate developments  Dollar sentiment was bearish for most of  the period, and thus the market was caught offside by last week’s sudden  appreciation  The behavior of Asian central banks, from both a policy and a portfolio  perspective, gripped the markets during much of the period and continues to do so     The top panel on page 1 graphs the three-month US and euro-denominated   deposit rates  The solid red and green lines depict Libor fixings  The dashed lines  graph the three-month deposit rates nine months forward for both currencies  With  the tightening cycle advancing in the United States, short-term rates—represented by  the solid red line—are now higher than in the euro area  However, perhaps the more  interesting point is what has happened to forward rates  At the time of your  September meeting, nine-month forward rates for both dollar and euro deposit rates  were about 26 percent  Since then forward dollar rates have risen along with  generally positive data  Meanwhile, euro forward rates have declined and now sit  very close to the cash rate  With economic data in Europe showing sluggishness and  with the strength of the euro adversely affecting export prospects, the ECB’s earlier  expected tightening has been priced out, and many in the market are talking about a  possible easing       Looking at a somewhat longer time frame, the bottom left panel graphs US–  German three-month interest rate differentials since the beginning of the year  Dollar  interest rates have gone from being 120 basis points lower to being almost   December 14, 2004 3 of 118           ¼ percentage point higher  At the long end of the curve, as shown at the bottom  right, the relationship is more volatile  But there, too, dollar interest rates are higher  by about ½ percentage point—with the most recent widening driven almost entirely  by a fall in German yields, as recent data disappointed  I should note that Japanese  yields, although not shown here, also have fallen modestly, as incoming data were  disappointing there as well     The favorable shift in interest rate differentials might have been expected to help   the value of the dollar  However, as shown at the top of page 2, the dollar has been  on a downward trend  In mid-November, comments about the current account by  Secretary Snow and Chairman Greenspan in the days surrounding the G-20 meeting  in Europe were interpreted by some as signaling acquiescence to the dollar’s fall,  though sentiment was so bearish at the time that perhaps any comments might have  had the same response  With the market so one-sided, it did become vulnerable to a  sudden reversal, even in the absence of any fundamental news  The extent of the  positions can be seen in the middle panel, which graphs the IMM’s net  noncommercial positions for three major currencies—the euro, the yen, and  sterling—against the dollar  After a rather uneventful summer, speculators began to  build up short dollar positions in early fall  By mid-November sentiment was  overwhelmingly bearish and positions extended  As some accounts began to reduce  risk, there was position squaring in several so-called crowded trades, including these  short dollar positions, which fed last week’s appreciation  The dollar’s fall is  certainly affecting returns on US assets for foreigners  The bottom panel graphs the  return year to date for a variety of asset classes and for the US dollar index  Returns  for most asset classes cluster around 5 percent, with high-yield bonds being higher   But for foreign investors, returns for most classes are closer to zero, given the nearly  5 percent fall in the dollar     Another focus of market attention has been the behavior of Asian central banks   from both a policy and a portfolio perspective  Page 3 provides updates of two charts  I showed at the last meeting  The top panel graphs the Chinese yuan spot rate—fixed  at 828—and the one-, six-, and twelve-month forward rates derived from  nondeliverable forwards that are traded offshore and settled in dollars  This is a small  market, but it is one of the few indicators of speculative interest regarding the size  and timing of a possible revaluation of the yuan  Since your last meeting, the forward  discounts have widened, as speculation grew of a near-term change in the regime   This is despite Premier Wen’s comments that any move to make the exchange rate  more flexible would not come if there were pressure from foreigners or from the  markets  That does place China’s officials in a box since they have conceded the  principle, and one would expect that markets will intermittently price in a change in  the regime     Meanwhile, other Asian countries have allowed some appreciation against the   dollar—and therefore against the yuan—in recent months, as shown in the middle  panel  However, the pace of reserve accumulation has again begun to rise, suggesting  that the authorities are nearing their limits  Japan, on the other hand, has not   December 14, 2004 4 of 118           intervened, perhaps in part because the rise of the Korean won and other currencies  means that Japan’s effective exchange rate has not risen as much as the yen’s bilateral  rate against the dollar     Investors have watched closely these countries’ willingness to tolerate further   appreciation  But they are watching at least as closely how these countries are  managing the reserves they have accumulated  There are two dimensions to this  question  First, are these central banks diversifying away from the dollar?  Several  weeks ago a Russian central bank official publicly disclosed that the Russian central  bank had shifted some of its dollar reserves into euros  That announcement and— until recently—the steady decline in the dollar fed speculation that Asian central  banks might act similarly  Of course, if there were a shift from dollars to euros, the  immediate effect would be a further appreciation of the euro, which would result in  an additional reduction in the value of the Asian central banks’ remaining dollars   Also, a further appreciation of the euro is something the ECB might resist at some  point  To date, several Asian central banks have said that they have no plans to  change their currency allocations, though market participants are wary     The second dimension of the question is whether central banks are diversifying   their dollar holdings from Treasuries into other asset classes  Hard data on this point  are hard to come by  Anecdotally, those central banks with large reserve holdings  have been growing both their Treasury and non-Treasury holdings for some time,  though it’s fair to say that the growth rates of agency, MBS, and even corporate  holdings have been faster than that for Treasuries  The bottom panel graphs the New  York Fed’s aggregate custody holdings for Treasury and agencies since the start of  the year  I should stress that this is an incomplete data set since central banks also  hold securities with other custodians  Nevertheless, this does suggest that— especially in recent weeks—there has been a spike in agency holdings whereas  Treasury holdings have been flat  We are aware of one major account that sold  outright some of its Treasuries and re-allocated into agencies  Since the buys and  sells for such securities are conducted with different counterparties, it is entirely  possible that those dealers seeing the sale of Treasuries may have extrapolated in  thinking that this account was also selling the underlying dollars—and thus fed some  of the rumors in recent weeks      Turning to domestic markets on the next page, the short intermeeting period   featured a continuation of recent trends  Spreads are low and, if anything, have  narrowed further  Implied volatilities continued at very low levels, and the price of  oil continued to fall while prices of equities rose  The top panel of page 4 graphs the  two-year to ten-year spread  The yield curve has continued to flatten though there  was a sharp, if brief, steepening in late November driven more by technical factors  than any fundamental news  Once the unwinding subsided, the curve resumed its  flattening trend and at 121 basis points is at its flattest level in more than three years   Financial conditions remain favorable  As noted, corporate and emerging-market  spreads are narrow  The middle panel graphs the absolute yield level for the EMBI+  and High-Yield indexes since 1997  The combination of a lower Treasury curve and   December 14, 2004 5 of 118           narrower spreads has lowered absolute yields to levels where financial comedians are  asking if the name of the high-yield index will need to be changed  Finally, mortgage  spreads continue to trade at low levels, as shown in the bottom left panel  The large  holdings of MBS previously accumulated by banks continue to attract attention on the  theory that a sudden spread widening would trigger this group of investors to start  liquidating these positions     Turning to page 5, let me provide a quick update on the growth of outright   Treasury holdings in the System Open Market Account  The top panel graphs the net  expansion of the SOMA from 1994 through 2003  Not surprisingly, there is a  correlation over the long term between the growth of currency in circulation and the  growth of SOMA  During this ten-year period, currency in circulation grew by  $35 billion per year (averaging over the Y2K event)  Through November 2004 it has  increased by $32 billion this year  Although similar in dollar magnitude to prior  years, that represents a slowdown in currency growth from about 7¼ percent in the  1994-2003 period to just under 6 percent this year  The somewhat slower currency  growth that has emerged in recent years appears to reflect weaker overseas demand   The bottom panel graphs the Federal Reserve’s direct net currency shipments going  back to 1990—a somewhat longer period than in the first two panels  I should note  that these data cover only the Fed’s shipments and receipts  We do not know how  much currency left the country—or came back—via migrant workers, tourists, and  other legal or illegal means, though we have no evidence to suggest that those  relationships have changed in recent years     In many years through 1997, foreign growth composed the bulk of overall   currency growth  Starting in 1998, shipments overseas began to moderate, and  averaging out Y2K effects, the overall trend of foreign shipments has been falling and  in the last two years has turned negative  Without the significant shipments to  Argentina and Iraq in recent years, these numbers would have been lower still     Mr Chairman, that concludes my prepared remarks  There were no foreign   operations in the period  I will need approval of domestic operations, and I’d be  happy to take any questions      I believe so  But as I said, we don’t see the currency that leaves the country—or   that can come back in—by other means  There seems to be a correlation between the middle panel   and the bottom panel, but again, there is a lot of slippage because of other ways currency can leave   the country  But I have not seen a firm reconciliation    I can’t say that I can tell you    We actually did some work on this  Bob, do you remember the paper that we   did a few years ago?   December 14, 2004 7 of 118            People do use these data sometimes as a contrary indicator—for the very   reasons that you note    That’s the risk    Yes  The short answer is yes  They have observed—especially over the last   year —any number of things that should have and did create uncertainty  Yet there was this   dichotomy where volatilities were low and spreads were low  So yes, there has been this   December 14, 2004 8 of 118           dichotomy, and people talked about it  There’s a certain amount of frustration about it as well, I   think, because it doesn’t make sense in terms of most people’s mental models of how these things   work  "
7448,2005-02-01," Thank you, Mr Chairman  I have two subjects on which I’ll need a vote from   the Committee  The first one is on the Foreign Currency Directive, the Authorization for Foreign   Currency Operations, and the Procedural Instructions with Respect to Foreign Currency Operations    I recommend that they be approved with no amendments   The second item is the Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations,   which I propose be approved with one amendment as described in the memo dated January 24,   2005 That amendment would eliminate the so-called leeway provisions—the limit on the amount   by which holdings of securities in the System Open Market Account can change between   meetings—given that the Committee has many other ways to oversee the activities of SOMA   [System Open Market Account]  2  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Markets in the intermeeting period can perhaps  best be described by the words “more of the same”  For example, short-term interest  rates continued a slow upward climb, as shown in the top panel of page 1 of your handout   Market participants are pricing in 25 basis point increments of tightening until told  otherwise The release of the minutes on January 4 added a bit of spice but did not change  the contours of the outlook   2 The materials used by Mr Kos are appended to this transcript (appendix 2)                           February 1-2, 2005 64 of 177  Treasury yields also did more of the same The short end of the coupon curve  rose gently along with deposit rates, while the 10-year yield has remained stuck in its  narrow range at just above 410 percent Hence the shape of the curve continued its  flattening trend, as shown in the bottom left panel But that’s not the only part of the  curve that was flattening The bottom right panel graphs the 10- to 30-year spread  since December  (If one wanted to be precise, one would call it the 10- to 26-year  spread, given that this bond matures in 2031)  While the 10-year yield was little  changed, the long bond rallied, pushing the yield down to about 460 percent—its  lowest level since the summer of 2003 And the 10- to 30-year spread is at its  narrowest level since early 2002   The search for yield may be pushing investors out the curve  Demand for  duration from pension funds may also be part of the story—part of a more general  supply/demand imbalance, given that the GSEs [government-sponsored enterprises]  are issuing very little at the long end and, of course, the Treasury stopped issuing the  long bond in 2001 However, before this flattening is attributed to technical factors  alone, one should give the yield curve a bit of respect After all, the signal sent by  the inversion in 2000 after the buyback announcements also was written off as  technically induced Maybe this recent flattening really is technically induced, but  then again it may not be   Turning to page 2, and continuing the “more of the same” theme, spreads  continued to stay tight and volatilities remained low  Swap spreads narrowed  slightly along with the flattening of the curve, and MBS [mortgage-backed  securities] spreads stayed tight, probably helped by the low volatility in fixed income  markets  Spreads on riskier assets—high-yield and emerging-market bonds—did  widen slightly, as shown in the middle right panel, right after the New Year and  contemporaneous with the decline in equity prices and the reversal in the dollar   Nevertheless those spreads still are at levels that are historically on the low side  Finally, implied volatilities continue to stay low across asset markets  The bottom  panel graphs representative swaption volatilities, which are near historically low  levels   Turning to page 3, short-term interest rates in the euro area follow today’s  general theme and have moved very little  Expectations in Europe continue to be  buffeted by subdued economic performance in core Europe but then periodic  glimmers of optimism, as reflected in some recent business confidence surveys  One  factor weighing down sentiment has been the strength of the euro, which appreciated  into year-end and then sold off from $136 to $130, as shown in the middle left  panel The sudden reversal of the exchange rate, contemporaneous with the calendar  and in the absence of any news, has all the hallmarks of a position adjustment after  profit taking   The dollar–yen rate has been more subdued—in the 103 range—perhaps on  concerns that the Japanese authorities would intervene if the dollar broke decisively                       February 1-2, 2005 65 of 177  toward 100 yen The implied forward rate on the Chinese yuan calculated from the  NDF [non-deliverable forward] market, as shown in the bottom left panel, came in  slightly after the start of the New Year and is suggesting slightly less probability of a  revaluation However, the inflows into China continue, as shown in the bottom right  panel, which graphs the accumulation of reserves by China and Japan  While  Japan’s reserves have plateaued for now, China and some other Asian countries have  continued to accumulate reserves rapidly   Changing pace somewhat, if you turn to page 4, I’d like to spend a few  minutes discussing recent developments in Japanese money markets  Let me skip to  the end of the story and draw your attention to the bottom right panel, which graphs  the Japanese government bill curve as of three dates  The green line is the curve as  of March 19, 2001 which was the date the quantitative easing policy (or QEP) was  announced The blue line depicts the curve as of a year ago and the red line as of  yesterday One year ago, yields out to one year were at very low levels, but they  were positive In the last few months, conditions in money markets have  deteriorated, and now essentially all bills out to 12 months are at or very near zero   Now let me go to the beginning of the story  The top left panel graphs the  Bank of Japan’s (BOJ) current account balances and the overnight call money rate   After implementation of QEP in March 2001, the call money rate fell toward the zero  bound As the BOJ kept pumping yen into the market, the banks became flush with  cash At first they were willing to maintain this cash as a precaution against  unexpected funding needs, given existing perceptions about the weakness of major  banks However, with so much money in the system, the need to trade funds  decreased, and, as shown in the top right panel, the amount outstanding in the call  money market collapsed from about ¥25 trillion to about ¥5 trillion   One might think that the demand for money market instruments would  decrease as yields declined In fact, demand has increased  First, the BOJ itself  became a big buyer after QEP  Second, various market participants with investment  mandates for sovereign risk continued to participate  Third, foreign banks doing  dollar–yen swaps needed a risk-free claim to park the yen they swapped in  And  perhaps more simply, the supply of yen swamped the available supply of low-risk  investments  One result is shown in the middle left panel  The red line shows the  trend of bid/cover ratios for three-month bill auctions  Even as the issue size has  increased, the amount bid has been very high for several years except for a short  period in mid-2003  In recent months the bid/cover has been more than 300 to 1   Meanwhile, as the condition of the banking system has improved, banks perceived  less need to hold excess balances, so the BOJ has struggled to keep the current  account balance in its target range   Early in the quantitative easing period, the BOJ used financing operations  But with banks stronger and needing less liquidity, the BOJ has shifted to greater use  of outright operations It’s a bit hard to see, but the blue line in the middle right                          February 1-2, 2005 66 of 177  panel depicts the BOJ’s holdings of treasury bills, which have actually declined in  recent months  Why?  The bottom left panel graphs the bid/cover for the BOJ’s  outright bill operations since April 2004 Bids have been falling for several months,  and some recent operations have been undersubscribed    In short, the Japanese money market has become very difficult for investors  and, in fact, for the BOJ Why do I go on at length about this?  Well, for two  reasons First, Japan offers a genuine case study of monetary operations at the zero  bound, which is interesting in and of itself Second, we are directly affected by this  deterioration of liquidity in the money market since the US monetary authorities are  a very large investor in Japanese government treasury bills  Like others, we have  had difficulty investing all the yen in accordance with the current investment  guidelines Given these circumstances, unless conditions improve very soon, we  essentially will have two choices (1) to expand the range of allowable instruments  for investment beyond sovereign obligations, or (2) to go out the JGB [Japanese  government bond] curve  I plan to return to the Committee in March with a report  on my plans to deal with this situation   Finally, let me say a word on fed funds volatility  The top panel on page 5  graphs the daily intraday standard deviations of the funds rate going back to 1987  The trend has been toward lower standard deviations over time  As I’ve mentioned  at previous meetings, the Desk confronted higher funds rate volatility over the  summer as the market bid up rates ahead of expected increases in the target     The bottom panel graphs intraday fed funds volatility for each two-week  reserve maintenance period over the past year and notes those periods with an  FOMC meeting  You will note the spike in August, which I discussed at the time  In  the past few months we have observed that those dark blue bars—that is, the  volatility in reserve maintenance periods with an FOMC meeting—have declined,  which suggests that the market is adjusting to the Desk’s operations during such  periods   Mr Chairman, there were no foreign operations in this period  I did want to  note, with Inauguration Day now behind us, that this Administration became the first  one in the floating-rate era to go through its full four-year term without intervening in  foreign exchange markets  I will need approval of domestic operations  "
7473,2005-03-22,"1  Thank you, Mr Chairman  At the Committee’s last meeting I  characterized markets in the preceding weeks as “more of the same,” inasmuch as  trends, such as the gradual rise of short-term interest rates, a flattening yield curve,  narrowing credit spreads, and low volatilities, were continuing their well-established  patterns In the past six weeks, some of those trends ceased, though it is too soon to  declare that they have gone into reverse Questions about the pace of tightening and  prospects for inflation in the medium term became a more prominent source of  concern among investors   The top panel on page 1 of your handout graphs eurodollar deposit contracts  maturing in June 2005, December 2005, and June 2006  What had been a steady rise  in futures rates accelerated after the Chairman’s semiannual monetary policy  testimony, especially for contracts beyond the front month  The spreads between the  June ’06 and June ’05 contracts widened to reflect this more aggressive expected path  of tightening And while some traders ran to their dictionaries to look up the meaning  of “conundrum,” perhaps the more important event with regard to the testimony was  the expectation among many market participants that the Chairman would use the  occasion to signal a pause in tightening or to elucidate the factors that could lead to a  pause Receiving no clarification on either point, the market pushed out the length of  the tightening cycle and, at times, even the pace—with both anecdotal comments and  some fed funds futures reflecting a stronger sense that the Committee might at some  point ratchet up the pace of tightening to 50 basis points   Yields moved higher at both the short and long ends of the curve  As shown in  the middle left panel, the two-year Treasury yield, which had been treading water  earlier in the tightening cycle, increased about 40 basis points—thus widening the  spread to the target funds rate As shown in the middle right panel, 10-year yields  rose from roughly 410 percent at the time of the February meeting to more than 4½  percent today Besides revised expectations of policy and increased worries about  inflation, there were also periodic bouts of anxiety about foreign central bank actions  to diversify away from dollars and/or Treasury securities  The 10-year yield is now  back to roughly the level it was last summer when the tightening cycle began   1 The materials used by Mr Kos are appended to this transcript (appendix 1)                                   March 22, 2005 4 of 116  Until the last few weeks, the combination of a gentle rise in short-term rates and  an immovable 10-year yield had substantially flattened the yield curve  The recent  price moves did not reverse that trend but did, as shown in the bottom panel, stabilize  the shape of the curve, which stopped flattening at about 80 basis points The last  few weeks also featured an increased preoccupation among traders and investors with  the prospects for inflation Several inflation reports were higher than expected, and  commodity prices continued to rise  For example, the top panel of page 2 shows the  CRB [Commodity Research Bureau] index since January 2004  Unlike other popular  commodity indexes, the CRB does not have a large energy component and was more  contained during 2004 The recent breakout had contributions from nearly every  segment of the index   Focusing on energy, the middle panel depicts the oil futures curve out to two  years for West Texas intermediate [WTI] as of two dates  The green line shows the  curve as of October 26, 2004, the day oil prices hit their highs last fall and when the  front-month contract topped $55 per barrel  The curve sloped downward by more  than $10, and, for contracts at the end of that two-year horizon, oil was trading below  $45 The blue line graphs the WTI curve as of this past Friday  The front-month  contract was trading at about $57, but the curve has only a small downward slope;  and the contract 24 months out is trading near $53, suggesting that market  participants do not expect much softening in oil prices   The bottom panel graphs in blue the five-year TIPS [Treasury inflation-protected  securities] breakeven inflation rate, which has been rising the past few weeks and is  up substantially from a year ago  This rise in the breakeven rate has been  contemporaneous with the most recent increase in oil prices  During last fall’s oil  price rise, the breakeven was falling Higher oil prices were seen more as a restraint  on activity than as a catalyst for inflation The situation has now reversed, though  there are lots of caveats one needs to consider when interpreting breakeven rates  Other market-based measures of inflationary expectations are tame  For example, the  five-year breakeven five years ahead has remained in a narrow range, as shown by the  red line, and, in fact, is very little changed from a year ago   One question that has occupied market participants is whether risk is being  mispriced  The narrowing of spreads over the past two years and the fall of volatility  suggest that investors have been in risk-seeking mode  In the intermeeting period,  that trend did not reverse, though it did moderate somewhat   The top left panel on page 3 shows the investment-grade corporate spread since  mid-year 2004; in the top right is the high-yield spread  Both have narrowed  substantially in the last year or two At its lowest level in the period, the high-yield  spread was at 266 basis points on March 6 The all-time low for the high-yield  spread was 213 basis points in October of 1997 In recent weeks, both indexes  widened suddenly, contemporaneous with the rise in Treasury yields and some                                      March 22, 2005 5 of 116  specific corporate events Though sudden, the recent widening was modest compared  to other widening episodes during the last two years and relative to the previous  narrowing episodes   Of course, the widening did not affect all issuers equally  The bottom left panel  graphs the spreads of investment-grade issuers by credit rating  The AA, A, and BBB  sectors are all narrower than they were a year ago, but in the past few weeks the BBB  sector underperformed, as investors got nervous about the auto sector in general and  General Motors in particular after that company reported disappointing earnings  The  bottom right panel graphs the auto sector in green and representative 10-year GM and  GMAC bond spreads GM credit default swaps widened as well The pessimist will  take this price action as suggesting that risks are mispriced and that market  participants have not been adequately anticipating deteriorating outlooks The  optimist will conclude from the GM news that markets are discriminating among  issuers as new information becomes available and are repricing accordingly    Turning to page 4, the top panel depicts the EMBI+ [Emerging Markets Bond  Index Plus] spread, which also widened in recent weeks but only to levels observed in  January The conclusion of the Argentine debt package, with its large haircuts, did  not appear to have a contagion effect on the spreads of other large issuers   Parts of the outer rim of the risk spectrum did feel a chill, as shown in the middle  and bottom panels  The middle panel graphs movements of a select group of  emerging-market currencies against the dollar in the period between October and  March 7 Several of these currencies had rallied by more than 10 percent  The green  bars show the depreciations of the past two weeks   The bottom panel shows the same set of relationships for the broad equity market  indexes of the same group of countries  Yes, there has been some unwinding of these  positions in both currencies and equities But, to date, the retracing has been mild  and represents only a fraction of the appreciation observed in previous months  In  short, if this is the beginning of a more general unwinding, there is far more to go     I should also note that the dollar has been firmer against the euro and other major  currencies the past few days, which may suggest a bit of risk aversion, as the  possibility of a more aggressive tightening cycle is causing a reassessment among the  large contingent of dollar shorts   Finally, turning to page 5, I have graphed the implied volatilities of the S&P 500,  representative swaptions contracts, and the major currency pairs  I won’t go through  them in any detail but would only point out the following (1) they are still at very  low levels; and (2) there are signs for both equity and swaption vols that the  downward trend is confronting a bit more headwind at these very low levels,  especially if the inflation and monetary policy outlook changes meaningfully in  coming weeks                             Mr Chairman, there were no foreign operations in the intermeeting period  I will  need a vote to approve domestic operations  Bob and I will be happy to take any  questions about markets or about the memo I circulated last week regarding some  changes we are planning to make to the yen reserves portfolio   Yes Oil is a little less than a quarter of that index   Yes, it’s about 23 percent, but that compares to about two-thirds or three-  quarters weighting that energy has in the Goldman Sachs and the Dow Jones–AIG indexes, for   example  The other components are—         “Softs,” as they are called—things like agricultural commodities and metals                  I don’t know if iron ore is in there but copper is; copper scrap is in there, I   think   I don’t think steel is in the CRB   The biggest contributor to its movement has been oil, but all of the other   components also had increases  So they all contributed to it, whereas, in the earlier period, when   oil was rising some of the other components actually were declining  So it’s a mixture of effects   Mr Chairman, if I could just add a point on the market effect  As some of   you know, Greece issued a 30-year bond recently at 26 basis points above the rate on Bunds, or   about ½ point below the US 10-year rate and about 100 basis points below the 30-year rate   It’s interesting, since they are at about double the 3 percent limit  So the   markets are not punishing anybody for not complying  "
7498,2005-05-03,"1  Thank you, Mr Chairman  The intermeeting period began with   worries about building inflationary pressures but ended with a growth scare, as   incoming data were weaker than expected and Street economists fell over   themselves to cut their GDP forecasts for the first half of 2005  Meanwhile, the   inflation concerns remained, leaving traders and investors with a sense that the risks   were higher    The top panel on page 1 graphs the June and December 2005 Eurodollar deposit   futures contracts since mid-February  The December contract peaked around the   time of the March FOMC meeting, as the markets interpreted the Committee’s   statement as opening the way for a more aggressive pace of tightening  But that   view was short-lived as weaker retail sales, manufacturing survey data, and a   deteriorating trade situation all tempered what had been a more bullish growth   outlook In short, the markets tinkered with the possibility of a more aggressive   tightening path but quickly fell back to the baseline scenario of 25 basis points per   meeting    That can also be seen in the middle panel on page 1, which shows the spread   between the 2-year Treasury note and the target fed funds rate That spread    1 The materials used by Mr Kos are appended to this transcript (appendix 1)                                                   May 3, 2005 4 of 116  contracted sharply at the start of the tightening cycle but then settled into a  comfortable range of 80 to 85 basis points  In February and early March the spread  widened to about 120 basis points as the probability of more aggressive tightening  seemed to increase  But as the growth outlook began to be questioned in recent  weeks, the spread reverted to about 80 basis points   The bottom panel depicts the yield change in basis points of the 10-year Treasury  note reset from the start of the tightening cycles of 1994, 1999, and the current one    Following the Chairman’s February testimony, 10-year Treasury yields rose to  levels where they—arguably—were less of a conundrum  Alas, that also proved  temporary as the fall in yields leaves them stuck in a corridor between 4 and 4½  percent At 419 percent this morning, the 10-year yield is only a few basis points  higher than in mid-February at the time of the Chairman’s testimony   The next page takes a look at the yield curve and credit spreads In the past year  the search for yield, improved corporate and sovereign fundamentals, and the  assurance the Fed was providing regarding the tightening path were common reasons  cited for the flattening of the yield curve As investors moved out the maturity  curve, credit spreads narrowed and implied volatilities fell as market participants  became more certain that monetary policy would not bring surprises  The past few  weeks has seen a reversal, or at least a pause, in some of these trends   One exception to this has been the behavior of the shape of the yield curve The  top panel graphs the 2- to 10-year spread, which flattened further in recent weeks  However, unlike the earlier flattening, this cannot be viewed as a period when  investors were reaching for yield or when they were very complacent about the  policy outlook Nor is there evidence that central banks were unusually active An  alternative, though more unpleasant explanation, is that this sector of the bond  market is signaling a further slowdown in activity   Investment-grade corporate and emerging-market spreads both widened in recent  weeks, as investors became somewhat more risk averse and reacted to some  unexpected credit events The recent widening of spreads in these two sectors can  be seen on the right side of the page However, this widening of spreads barely  registers in the longer-term charts on the left side of the page  The optimist will look  at this situation and be reassured that the markets are not overreacting to events and  are still pricing in a fairly benign outlook The pessimist will argue that the power  of the cycle will continue to assert itself and that the period of spreads widening is  just beginning, especially as the effects of previous tightening begin to be felt and  corporate fundamentals shift from being in a period of improvement to a period of  deterioration   Speaking of deterioration, the top panel on the page 3 graphs the price of 5-year  credit default swaps for GM, GMAC, and Ford since January 2004 The price of                                                   May 3, 2005 5 of 116  credit protection has more than tripled, mostly after GM’s earnings warning on  March 16   Meanwhile, spreads have widened, as shown in the middle panel  Although GM  has more than $20 billion in cash on its balance sheet and the company is still  investment-grade according to the rating agencies, it is a high-yield bond according  to the markets  The blue line graphs the spread of a representative longer-term GM  note GM spreads are now wider than the BB and B indexes and closing in on the  CCC index Ford spreads are also trading like high-yield credits, though not as high  as those of GM   The news from GM appears to have had some chilling effects on issuance in the  high-yield sector more generally, though the evidence is inconclusive  The bottom  left panel shows the drop-off in high-yield issuance since the GM news  Of course,  other events were going on at the same time, such as the changed tenor of the macro  data and the fall in equity prices  Still, a plausible contributory explanation is that  high-yield managers were unreceptive to taking on new paper with the prospect of a  large migration of auto-related debt coming into their sector  One important  question mark for portfolio managers is whether the troubles in the auto industry are  sector-specific or whether the general period of improving corporate balance sheets  is ending, to be followed by a period of higher financing costs, margin compression,  and generalized credit deterioration   The bottom right panel graphs the largest components of one high-yield bond  index on a pro forma basis if GM were to be downgraded  Apparently GM would  account for about 6 percent of this index With GM spreads having already blown  out, a downgrade may not have that much of an effect—on the theory that markets  have already discounted the news Of course, GM and GMAC are large issuers in  the investment-grade sector, which is much larger than the high-yield sector   Therefore, we should not be surprised if there were some indigestion and a period of  volatility, as a very large amount of paper is transferred from one set of holders with  one set of time horizons and risk tolerances to another group with a different set of  preferences   As I mentioned earlier, implied volatilities were higher, although not in all asset  classes But they were higher for equities  The top panel of page 4 graphs the VIX  index since January 2004 After reaching a low near 11 percent, the index shot up to  about 19 percent during the recent period of equity price weakness It has since  settled back but in a choppy way In fact, the volatility of the VIX—the second  derivative—is as high as it has been during periods of more generalized market  stress   Fixed income and currency volatilities have been less exciting—in the middle  and bottom part of the page—reflecting less anxiety relative to other indicators  I  should note that dollar-yen volatilities rose on Friday when a brief flurry of                                                May 3, 2005 6 of 116  excitement about a possible revaluation of the renminbi spilled over into dollar-yen  and there was a temporary spike in implied volatility   Finally, I want to return to a subject that was mentioned briefly at the last   meeting, namely, the appetite for longer-dated paper in Europe  As you will recall,   early in 2005 there was a mini frenzy about the need for pension fund managers to   “extend duration” European issuers have been quite happy to step in and fill that   demand at pretty attractive levels  This is despite the watering down of the Stability   and Growth Pact and evidence that some countries showed creativity in managing   their financials to get into EMU [European Monetary Union] in the first place    The top panel simply graphs the German and US 30-year yields; German yields   have been consistently below those of the United States in 2005 Parenthetically I   do need to note that the last US long bond was issued in 2001 so the US 30-year   bond actually has a residual maturity of 26 years  While a 30-year Bund yield of just   under 4 percent could prompt one to ask what the German word for “conundrum” is   [laughter], there is no doubt that the environment has been favorable to issuers—and   not just for the most highly rated  As shown in the middle panel, spreads among   European sovereign issuers have converged over the last several years, just as   promised by the proponents of the Monetary Union  Among the higher-rated   issuers, France recently was able to issue a 50-year bond At the other end, Greece   issued an attractively priced 30-year security    The bottom panel graphs long-dated issuance—that is, beyond 10 years—for   euro area sovereigns since 2000 In 2000, all long dated issuance was by three   countries Germany, Italy, and France  Through only the first four months of 2005,   such issuance has already exceeded that for the full year in every recent year except   2000 And most of the issuance is by countries other than the three I mentioned   earlier    Mr Chairman, there were no foreign operations in the intermeeting period  I   will need a vote to approve domestic operations  And I also need to talk about   swaps    Well, they will be affected in the short run, as investment managers reprice the   GM and Ford paper   Oh, I see I’m sure that there would be an effect, but I haven’t looked at this  As   that paper was taken out, I guess it would tend to reduce the posted spreads We did see that in the   emerging-market indexes, as some countries defaulted and were taken out of the indexes    Exactly So, I would think that one would see the same kind of effect on the   index itself, but I haven’t looked at the specific question to check it out   It’s May, which means that it’s the time of year that I come to this Committee   and ask for a vote on the renewal of the swap facilities for Mexico and Canada  They get renewed in   December, but six months’ notice would need to be given if the Committee chose not to renew them    That’s why we vote on it at this meeting  "
7523,2005-06-29," About 10 minutes  6  Thank you, Mr Chairman   Most major asset markets were little changed in the intermeeting period  The  exceptions were the price of oil, which rose; the euro, which fell; and corporate  credit markets, which faced some turbulence after the downgrade of GM debt    The top panel graphs the 3-month cash deposit rate in black and the 3-month  deposit rate 3 and 9 months forward in red  The 9-month forward rate has been in a  tight corridor for several months, thereby compressing the spread both to the 3-month  forward rate and the cash rate This compression reflects the widespread expectation  that the end of the tightening cycle is approaching   Market participants briefly flirted with the notion that the tightening cycle would  end as early as this meeting, after President Fisher’s comments on June 1 and the  weak employment report two days later  But subsequent remarks by the Chairman in  his testimony and by other Committee members quickly reversed sentiment     The 10-year yield fell 23 basis points in the intermeeting period  That, coupled  with the rise at the short end, led to a further flattening of the curve  This caused a  flurry of commentary about what signal the flattening was sending, and more  ominously, the implications of a possible inversion of the yield curve  The middle  panel graphs the 2- to 10-year Treasury spread since 1980  The light dashed green  line is the average spread over that 25-year period  At its current level of 35 basis  points, the curve is slightly flatter than the historical average     The flattening in this cycle has been dramatic but is not without precedent  Note  that the flattening in the early 1990s was of similar magnitude and was followed by a  period of pretty robust growth  Second, the level of the curve, at 35 basis points, is  not out of line with other periods As shown in the shaded rectangular area, the 2- to  10-year spread is now at levels that were traversed in the second half of the 1990s   Moreover, the spread was only slightly steeper during the 1980s expansion—a time  when both rates and risk premiums were no doubt higher  The conclusions that I at  least draw from looking at the history are  that the current flattening has earlier  precedent; that the current shape of the curve is well within historical norms; that  inversions are rare; and that while an inversion caused by further tightening cannot be  ruled out, the scenario that is at least as likely is for long-term yields to rise in  response to higher short-term rates   The bottom panel shows the 5- and 10-year TIPS [Treasury inflation-protected  securities] breakeven rates for the first six months of 2005  Those breakeven rates   6 The materials used by Mr Kos are appended to this transcript (appendix 2)                           June 29-30, 2005 75 of 234  have declined recently after rising early in the year; they began to fall as inflationary  expectations receded and the price of oil backed off from its earlier highs  In recent  weeks oil and breakevens have diverged, with breakeven rates continuing to decline  while oil rose to new highs above $60 One explanation for this paradox is the  revival of the notion that higher oil prices will act as a restraining factor on activity  and thereby depress inflationary tendencies  TIPS traders, however, have been  pushing an alternative explanation that technical reasons related to the seasonality of  price increases creates this pattern where breakevens widen early in the year and then  fall back In either case, the TIPS market is not sending out warning flares from the  most recent burst in oil prices   While the Treasury market has been relatively well behaved, the credit markets  experienced some volatility related to the news surrounding General Motors and  Ford Two days after the Committee’s May meeting, the debt ratings of GM and  Ford were downgraded to non-investment-grade by Standard and Poor’s  As shown  in the top panel of page 2, GM and Ford spreads widened dramatically ahead of the  decision and were both trading at spreads far above the high-yield index (the green  line) Those spreads came in a bit but then widened again and are now near levels  observed when the two companies were first downgraded  I should note that Ford  was not downgraded by the other two rating agencies and thus was reinstated into the  investment-grade index  Nevertheless, it trades at spreads that are well into high- yield territory   As I mentioned at the last meeting, the transition of billions of dollars in debt  from the large investment-grade market to the far smaller non-investment-grade  market is likely to take months  Those investors needing to sell are likely to seek to  avoid selling at fire sale prices  But the slow pace of divestment creates an overhang  that is apparent to everyone and probably helps explain the wideness of spreads  relative to the index  And yet the performance of the broader high-yield and  investment-grade indexes was rather tame, as investors apparently did not extrapolate  the problems of these companies more broadly    The problems at GM and Ford, and for that matter some smaller auto parts  companies such as Collins and Aikman, did show through into the credit derivatives  market, which exhibited some signs of strain as pricing models and liquidity  assumptions were modestly tested by this episode  As shown in the middle panel, the  CDX index of credit default swaps widened—as did the high-yield index, which is  not shown—as hedge funds and others used this index to hedge so-called “correlation  trades” that began to behave unexpectedly  Although the index has retreated  somewhat, dealers report that liquidity has not reverted to normal and that some  hedge funds are still looking to exit bad positions   The bottom panel depicts the year-to-date hedge fund performance according to  one service that tracks hedge fund results In aggregate, the funds reporting to this  service have had losses of about 2 percent since January  That number is fairly  modest relative to some of the more sensational headlines, and it suggests that most                                   June 29-30, 2005 76 of 234  funds have successfully managed their risks  Funds specializing in convertible  arbitrage strategies fell more than 8 percent and were among the worst performing  groups Of course, these averages obscure a wide variance in performance, including  some that did far worse and in some cases announced plans to close  The good  news—from my standpoint at least—is that these funds decided to close rather than  swing for fences in an attempt to recoup their losses  The remaining unknowns are  just how many redemptions are still in the pipeline and whether there are losses still  to be recognized by funds that are not adequately marking to market   Turning to page three, Europe was squarely on the radar screen this past spring   With the French and Dutch referendums highlighting problematic politics and weak  data highlighting flagging growth, sentiment toward euro-area markets was somber   The top panel on page three graphs the 3-month cash deposit rate and the same  rate 3 and 9 months forward since March 1  Earlier this spring the markets expected  monetary policy to be steady, as it has been for two years running  But as the data  deteriorated, the 9-month forward rate fell and is now trading below the cash rate as  markets shifted to price in an easing of policy in the second half of the year  The  recent easing by the Swedish Riksbank and the expected easing in the UK has fueled  expectations that the ECB [European Central Bank] will shift gears relatively soon   Interest rates further out the curve also fell  Meanwhile, with US interest rates  rising, a widening interest rate differential opened up favoring the dollar, as shown by  US and German 2-year yields in the middle right panel  With sentiment poor even  before the French referendum, with interest rates favoring the dollar, and with random  comments by fringe politicians suggesting that some countries might exit the single- currency regime, it’s no surprise that the euro depreciated toward $120    The shift in sentiment toward the euro can be seen in the bottom panels  The  bottom left panel graphs the 1-year risk reversal for the euro–dollar exchange rate,  which recently favored euro puts for the first time in four years  The bottom right  panel shows the more recent shift in positions among noncommercial traders on the  IMM [International Monetary Market], as they moved from being long euro to being  short the currency  Whether this trend will continue is now an issue that is occupying  market participants  At this point there is a lot of bad news priced into asset markets,  and sentiment is so bad toward the euro that this trade may be close to running out of  steam  Meanwhile the depreciation of the euro has offered a bit of relief to European  exporters   The top panel on the next page depicts 10-year bond yields for Australia, the  UK, Canada, Germany, and the United States  Yields are on a gradually declining  trend everywhere—countries in the midst of a tightening cycle, such as the United  States, and those like the United Kingdom and Germany whose central banks are  expected to ease soon                   June 29-30, 2005 77 of 234  Japan reported better GDP data recently, but many market participants expect   Japanese growth to revert to its previous pattern  Hence, 10-year Japanese   government bond (JGB) yields have also fallen back to about 120 percent  The   middle panel graphs the JGB curve as of yesterday and as of one year ago  The   weight of liquidity from the Bank of Japan’s quantitative easing policy has pulled   more of the yield curve toward zero    Finally, let me say just a quick word on global equities  The bottom panel graphs   the performance of selected equity indexes in local currency terms (the blue bars) and   in dollar terms (the red bars)  The stock markets of the U K, France, Germany, Italy   and Japan—toward the right side of the panel—all looked better than the S&P 500 in   local currency terms  However, with the appreciation of the dollar, their performance   turned negative Interestingly, Brazil and Mexico exhibited the opposite effect far   better performance in dollar terms because their currencies rose against the dollar  If   there are strains from the imbalances that are being talked about, it was difficult to   find evidence of that in the past seven weeks    Mr Chairman, there were no foreign operations in this period  I will need a vote   to approve domestic operations    I think that’s one  of the reasons some of the traders are looking for other   explanations, such as technical explanations related to the seasonal pattern                         June 29-30, 2005 78 of 234  I haven’t done the analysis  The way the story is told is that because the TIPS   works off of the non-seasonally adjusted index, you do get these patterns because of pricing—   Exactly  So, you would expect people to take advantage of that, which—  "
7552,2005-08-09,"1  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the charts in front of you    During the intermeeting period, market participants confronted the surprise  Chinese revaluation, strong domestic data, and high oil prices  On net, the  result in the market was higher yields and equity prices     The top panel of the first page graphs the December 2005 and December  2006 eurodollar deposit futures contracts  Earlier this spring, the implied rates  on these contracts had been coming down and the spread between the ’05 and  ’06 contracts was narrowing, as most market participants thought the end of the  tightening cycle was approaching But during the intermeeting period, rates  rose sharply and the calendar spread widened  The strong data and some   reassessment about inflationary pressures suggested to many in the market that  the Committee will continue to tighten beyond the so-called neutral rate—  whatever that is      Longer-term yields rose steadily in nearly a straight line since the last  meeting, as shown in the bottom panel  Since June 30, yields on 2- and 10- year  Treasuries rose about 45 basis points Essentially, the curve had a parallel shift  higher and the shape remained unchanged  That dimmed slightly, but did not  silence, the chatter about inverted yield curves observed in the last period    Despite the rise in yields, risk appetites in credit markets remained strong   and the search for yield remained intact  The top of page 2 graphs the option- adjusted spread for 30-year mortgage-backed securities (MBS) That spread is  slightly wider than earlier this year but remains low by historical standards  As  yields move in either direction, this is one market that investors—and for that  matter we at the Desk—tend to watch closely, given the accelerating effects that  convexity hedging can have However, even if yields continue higher, there are  reasons to expect that, at least under current conditions, MBS-related hedging  will play a lesser role    First, mortgage convexity is concentrated in traditional 30-year fixed-rate  mortgages and MBS Right now 70 percent or more of the 30-year fixed MBS  universe have coupons below current rates and thus are already “out of the  money” to be refinanced (The top right chart shows the distribution of  outstanding 30-year MBS)  As a result, further increases in long-term rates will  likely have only a small impact on hedging needs going forward   1 The materials used by Mr Kos are appended to this transcript (appendix 1)                                          August 9, 2005 4 of 110  Second, the shift in issuance to hybrid and other adjustable products has  reduced the overall need to hedge convexity for new MBS products    And third, those who do hedge mortgage convexity are more likely to hedge  up front with interest rate options and less likely to hedge dynamically with  swaps or Treasuries The low level of implied volatility has made it cheap to  buy interest rate options for hedging, and several mortgage hedgers have  increased their use of option hedges after their dynamic hedging strategies  produced poor results in the summer of 2003   Finally, there has been some shift at the margin among the holders of MBS  from those who hedge actively to those who probably do not  As shown in the  bottom left panel, the two major housing GSEs [government-sponsored  enterprises]—which do hedge actively—have seen their portfolios level off or  shrink outright   Meanwhile, one group that has been accumulating MBS is foreign official  accounts The bottom right panel graphs aggregate holdings of GSE securities  held by foreign accounts at the New York Fed since January 2002  Despite the  accounting and management problems at both major GSEs, central banks kept  buying GSE securities over the past few years; their overall holdings more than  doubled to over $360 billion Most of those holdings are direct obligations  But  MBS, which were essentially zero only two years ago, now make up about $66  billion, or almost 20 percent of agency holdings  Moreover, this number  probably understates total central bank holdings of MBS since some central  banks have outsourced management of their MBS portfolios to external  managers who use other custodians   Moving to page three, the corporate market recovered very quickly after its  springtime jitters  The top right panel shows the high-yield spread, which has  narrowed by more than 100 basis points since early May  Taking a longer-term  time frame, as shown in the top left panel, even at recent peaks spreads are at  very low levels   While spreads are narrow, quality has shown some signs of deterioration  The middle panel graphs for 1987 through 2005-to-date the percent of high- yield issuance comprised of securities rated at B- or lower at the time of  issuance In the past year, roughly 40 percent have been in this category,  exceeding the levels seen in early 1998 and also in the late 1980s during the  junk bond boom  The use of those proceeds is shown in the bottom panel   After several years of focusing on balance sheet repair, mainly through  refinancing, issuers are getting a bit more aggressive  Let me draw your  attention to the red bar at the bottom of the stack  So far in 2005, about 20  percent of issuance has been used to finance leveraged buyouts—the highest  that number has been since 1989                                         August 9, 2005 5 of 110  Moving overseas, the picture was mixed  In the euro area, economic data  were, at the margin, somewhat better than had been expected  Those improved  data and statements by ECB [European Central Bank] officials that they were  not contemplating an easing of policy shifted sentiment in euro area money  markets  As shown in the top left panel on page 4, the 9-month forward rate  agreement on 3-month euro deposits—the solid green line—rose sharply and  unwound the ease that had been priced into markets around the time of the last  FOMC meeting  The ECB has now maintained its key policy rate at 2 percent  for 26 consecutive months   In contrast, the Bank of England eased policy by 25 basis points last week,  as expected And as shown in the top right panel, another easing is expected     In Asia, the Chinese revaluation was the most noteworthy news event, even  though, overall, the price action in regional markets was tame  Ex ante, the  currency that was expected to appreciate the most if China were to move was  the Japanese yen And on the day of the Chinese announcement, the yen rose  sharply But that was quickly unwound and—as shown in the middle left  panel—the yen remains broadly weaker compared to its level at the beginning  of the year Japanese exporters, who reportedly are using a reference rate of  ¥105, are feeling very comfortable with the yen at these levels    With data such as this morning’s strong machinery orders suggesting that  the Japanese recovery is intact, equities and JGB [Japanese government bond]  yields have both been rising The 10-year JGB yield has risen to about 14  percent  The failure of the Diet to approve the postal reform bill and the  upcoming elections will add some uncertainty in coming weeks, though most  market participants are no longer questioning the recovery even if deflationary  pressures on prices persist   The bottom panel shows the Chinese yuan spot rate since May 9 in black  and the 1-, 6-, and 12-month NDF [non-deliverable forward] rates over the same  period The July 21 revaluation announcement caught the market by surprise   However, the small 21 percent revaluation, the vague nature of the new regime,  the virtually fixed rate versus the dollar since July 21, and finally the July 26  announcement by the People’s Bank of China that this was not the “first step”  of a broader revaluation took the wind out of the sails of those expecting more  forceful measures  Indeed, the longer-term NDF tenors are virtually unchanged  from levels prevailing before July 21  Other regional currencies also  appreciated briefly but, with the exception of the Malaysian ringgit, those  moves have been largely unwound   Turning to domestic operations, I wanted to briefly update the Committee  on the growth of SOMA [System Open Market Account] in the first half of  2005 The top chart depicts the growth of SOMA’s outright holdings in half-                                               August 9, 2005 6 of 110  yearly increments since 2000  So far in 2005, SOMA has expanded by only   about $7 billion, the slowest growth since the first half of 2000, a period that   was distorted by Y2K effects And, given the rising base, in percentage terms   the slow growth of SOMA is even more pronounced    The bottom panel graphs the autonomous factor changes over those same  six-month intervals  The relationship between net factor movements and  SOMA growth is not one-for-one but over longer periods the two track each  other The notable features of the first six months in 2005 are the slow growth  of currency (in green) and the reduction of required operating balances (in blue)     Finally, let me say a word about our foreign reserves  Earlier this year I   reported on my plans to shift investment of the System’s and the ESF’s   [Exchange Stabilization Fund] yen reserves from Treasury bills to a portfolio of   JGB investments and deposits at the Bank of Japan  You will recall that the   Japanese t-bill market had become illiquid and, in my view, no longer suitable   for a reserve portfolio After making the necessary system and procedural   changes, we recently started the process of rolling off maturing t-bills and   investing the proceeds into JGBs and BOJ deposits    Mr Chairman, once again there were no foreign operations in the period  I   will need a vote to approve the domestic operations    Well, I actually had a different institution in mind—a very large player in this   market who did have some issues in ’03  And they have now changed their hedging strategies   Yes   Well, a fact is something that can be observed and verified, and I’m talking—                                                  August 9, 2005 7 of 110  Well, let’s put it this way Some institutions do it better than others, and there   were some institutions that didn’t do it very well in ’03  Patricia, do you want to add something?   Right   Yes, because all of these securities are on Fedwire  We as custodians are not   holding any physicals or other white labels that are not on Fedwire  So these would all be   Freddie, Fannie, or Ginnie, but in fact, they are mostly Fannie and Freddie   I think in part there’s a diversification effect going on because some of these   central banks have such large reserves that they have expanded out the risk curve  So they’ve   expanded their holdings from Treasuries to agency securities to MBS to corporate bonds, and   some even to equities and ABS [asset-backed securities]  Actually, some of the central banks                                        August 9, 2005 9 of 110  with very large reserves have expanded their asset classes quite a bit  So it’s hard to disentangle   how much of that is a substitution for Treasuries and how much reflects just an effort to get a   more diversified portfolio   It’s the optionality  It’s the unpredictability of when you get your cash back    I would not see it that way   Well, the market thought that the July 21 move was a first installment, and   they were encouraged to believe that by some of the initial statements  And then in the July 26   statement they did an about-face   Well, I think the July 26 statement basically sent a signal that there wasn’t   going to be as much flexibility as the market thought   Right, and very little movement or shift has occurred  So I think the markets   are saying that this is either a basket of one [laughter] or it’s a basket where the dollar is 95   percent of the basket and that’s really what they’re targeting   Trish?   Well, if you package something with a lot of yield, there are buyers out there   waiting for that   Yes, there have been a couple of articles in the last two days about that   situation In my view, that particular article in the New York Times was somewhat exaggerated   and had some facts wrong That said, the cheapest-to-deliver into the contract in June was very   tight But to conclude that there was a squeeze as a result is probably going too far, based on the   evidence The issue here is that the futures are very, very large  The cheapest-to-deliver contract   is a finite-sized Treasury As you know, this sort of Treasury issuance has not increased over the   last few years, while the number of people trading and the volume of trading have increased  So   there is this imbalance that we saw a few months ago in another futures case, and we may see   more of it because of the way the contracts are structured  Brian has done some work on this as   well I don’t know if you have anything to add, Brian   It’s a few basis points It can be five to ten basis points, which at one level is   a lot At another level, it’s merely the market forces at work                   Well, at core, I think it’s a supply issue  By the same token, that doesn’t   mean you won’t have people trying to take advantage of that   But there’s no evidence that I’m aware of that there was anything of the kind   of situation that Salomon presented a few years ago  "
7576,2005-09-20,"1  Good morning, Mr Chairman  Thank you I’ll be referring to the  charts that are in front of you     During this intermeeting period, market participants were principally occupied  with the economic impact of Hurricane Katrina and alternating their judgment as to  whether the growth or inflation effects would dominate     The top panel of page 1 graphs the 3-month deposit rate in black and the same   rate 3 months and 9 months forward in red  In the two weeks after your last meeting,  the 9-month forward rate edged down a bit, as market participants began to speculate  that the tightening cycle was pushing the fed funds rate into territory that was within  hailing distance of the so-called neutral rate  Forward rates then fell sharply in the  days after August 29  Suggested reasons for the fall include the possibility that the  Committee might pause at this meeting or that the negative growth impact of the  hurricane would dampen output and abbreviate the cumulative amount of tightening,  even if the Committee were to move today  However, forward rates began to rise as  market participants shrugged off initial worries about lower growth and began to  worry somewhat more about potential inflationary effects  Those concerns were  reinforced by higher prices-paid data in some of the manufacturing surveys and also  by Friday’s inflation expectations component of the Michigan consumer survey   Longer-term yields (in the middle panel) told a similar story, with the 10-year  Treasury yield heading toward 40 percent in the aftermath of the hurricane but rising  to 4¼ percent subsequently The yield curve, which had flattened on expectations  that the impact on growth would dominate, steepened as concerns about growth were  balanced by equal concerns about inflationary effects  Adding to the uncertainty for  the Treasury market was the wide range of estimates for rebuilding the Gulf region  and hence for additional federal borrowing in fiscal 2006     The bottom panel graphs the breakeven inflation curve as of three dates the day  of the last FOMC meeting, the Friday before Katrina hit, and this past Friday  The  horizontal axis represents the maturity of each outstanding inflation-indexed Treasury  security Note that the short end of the curve began to rise before Katrina inasmuch  as oil and gasoline prices had already begun their ascent  The breakeven curve rose   1 The materials used by Mr Kos are appended to this transcript (appendix 1)                                 September 20, 2005 4 of 117  further in the next three weeks across the curve, though the rise was especially  pronounced at the short end   With nominal rates, on balance, little changed in the period and the breakeven  curve higher, the effect has been to lower and steepen the real yield curve, as shown  on the top panel of page 2 Given the arithmetic relationships between nominal and  breakeven yields, this graph merely takes the information of the last two charts and  shows it another way Nevertheless, the reduction of real yields is pronounced and  may suggest—at least for the next few years—that investors have an eagerness for  protection from rising inflation  In other asset markets, spreads and volatilities were  mixed on balance and did not exhibit any uniform anxiety about a changed outlook    The middle panel graphs the performance from July 1 of selected equity indexes   In general, equities have risen globally in that period, apparently unfazed by higher  energy prices The middle right panel graphs the performance of the S&P 500 and its  major components since the hurricane  Not surprisingly energy stocks have  performed best  Meanwhile, consumer-related equities have performed worst  And  some retailers, especially those catering to lower-income households, have been  particularly hard hit, as higher gasoline prices took their toll on those consumers even  before Katrina   Municipal bonds issued by governments in the Gulf region held in fairly well  despite the physical destruction  As an illustration, the bottom panel graphs the  spread to the 10-year Treasury of the New Orleans bond of 2029  The spread  narrowed versus Treasuries and outperformed the broader index  Apparently, the  prospect of a multibillion-dollar infusion of federal funds quickly eased any anxieties  investors might have had   Turning to page 3, there was no uniform response in the spread and options  markets to the hurricane  The top left panel shows the implied volatility of a 1-month  option on the front-month gasoline contract for the year to date  With the refinery  outages, it’s no surprise that volatilities for gasoline have jumped sharply, though the  extent of the spike is noteworthy However, as noted earlier, the picture for other  assets is mixed  The top right panel graphs the implied 1-month volatility of 1- and  10-year swaptions Volatilities on longer-dated swaptions barely budged, though for  shorter-dated swaptions—which are more sensitive to changing expectations about  monetary policy—volatility rose sharply   With equity markets rising modestly, the VIX [S&P 100 volatility index] traded  toward the lower end of its range and actually declined after the hurricane, as shown  in the middle left panel  Meanwhile, volatilities on currencies, shown in the middle  right panel, stayed low in the high single digits                                   September 20, 2005 5 of 117  Finally, credit spreads showed no clear pattern  The investment-grade spread at  the bottom left and the high-yield spread in yellow at the bottom right both rose  slightly In contrast, the EMBI+ [Emerging Markets Bond Index Plus] has continued  to narrow to an all-time low spread despite higher energy prices, a political scandal in  Brazil, and uncertain elections in 2006 in several large issuer countries, including  Mexico and Brazil   Turning to page 4, I wanted to return to a topic that President Minehan asked  about at the last meeting, namely, the dynamics related to settlement of the Treasury  futures contract   To provide some background and context, the top panel depicts in the light blue  bars the peak open interest in the 10-year Treasury futures contract  The dark blue  bars represent the issue size of the cheapest-to-deliver Treasury security, also called  the CTD Starting in 2002, the volumes and open interest in the futures contracts  began to rise sharply But with issue size remaining in the $20 billion range, the ratio  of open interest to size of the CTD increased sharply   The growth of peak open interest did not raise eyebrows initially since most  futures contracts are used for speculative, hedging, or arbitrage purposes  Most  contracts are closed out or rolled over into the next contract before maturity, and the  volume of securities actually delivered was de minimis   For example, the middle left panel graphs for the March 2002 contract the open  interest in blue With 15 days of trading left, open interest was about $40 billion  equivalent on the 10-year futures contract Over the next few days there was a slow  decay of open interest, as traders closed out positions or rolled them into the next  contract Only a tiny amount was actually settled  And those with short positions had  no trouble borrowing the August 2010 security, which was the CTD into this contract   This was the normal state of affairs   However, as the markets have grown, some large market participants have begun  to view taking delivery of securities as a viable option compared to the alternative of  slowly building a position in the cash market  Other traders—perhaps more  opportunistically—have noted the disparity between the peak open interest and the  relatively small issue size and may have concluded that there was an increased  possibility that the shorts might have to deliver securities other than the CTD    The center middle panel graphs the situation in June  Open interest decayed very  slowly as those with long positions in the futures market did not find it profitable to  roll their positions Instead they took delivery  As the shorts realized they would be  forced to deliver, there was a scramble to find the February 2012 security  In the  event, the shorts were able to find enough of the CTD—about $14 billion—to fully                                 September 20, 2005 6 of 117  satisfy delivery obligations, but the experience fostered conspiracy theories and the  press articles that followed about a possible squeeze   The September contract, which has two days of trading left, is proving equally  challenging As shown in the middle right panel, the open interest with 15 days of  trading left was an elevated $70 billion or so; and the decay has been slow, suggesting  that the longs would trigger a multi-issue delivery  In the past few days, the open  interest has decreased, but the possibility for a multi-issue delivery remains   The CTD in this settlement cycle is the August of 2012 security  As one would   expect, this issue is hard to find and trading very special in the repo market  The   bottom left panel shows in blue the overnight repo rate for that security, which has   decreased from about 3 percent to zero as it became apparent that there would be a   sizable delivery into the contract  As the security was “boxed,” it has all but stopped   trading in the repo market, and fails in the issue jumped to more than $90 billion and   yesterday they were more than $110 billion From previous experience, those fails   should clear up very quickly after the contract settles    So, has this flurry of activity affected the cash market or the shape of the yield  curve?  All indications are that the answer is no  The bottom right panel graphs notes  in the 5- to 10-year sector as of late last week  The red dot is the August of 2012  security It is trading slightly rich to the curve but not disproportionately so, and it  doesn’t seem to be affecting neighboring securities   The Chicago Board of Trade has instituted position limits for individual  participants during the last 10 days of trading, beginning with the December contract   Whether that will alleviate the problem or will shift the pressure elsewhere remains to  be seen   Mr Chairman, once again there were no foreign operations in the period  In that   regard, I want to note that this coming Thursday will mark five years since our last   intervention  I will need a vote to approve domestic operations    Well, I’ll let Bob Elsasser fill in some texture here  Certainly, larger   investors are more active in the futures market and are using those contracts in more ways than   they had, say, 10 or 15 years ago So the prospect of a—   Yes, but I’m not specifically referring to them  So, as these larger entities   have become more active in the futures, for them the prospect of buying a multibillion dollar   position through the futures market is not daunting  It’s something that they’re easily capable of   doing, whereas probably 15 or 20 years ago taking on a very large position and financing it   might have been a task  So I think that’s part of the story   Second, going into the cash market and building a multibillion dollar position might take   a very long time You might move the price against you, whereas in the futures market there’s a   lot of liquidity and in some ways it could be done more easily  Now, that’s something about the   trading dynamics  But as you point out, if people think something is happening—if one trader   thinks that somebody else is going to be taking delivery—then they might get on the bandwagon    They might add to their own positions in the hope of getting some of those cheaper securities     Yes Now, there were some other dynamics this summer that I don’t want to   get into having to do with position limits that the Board of Trade instituted, which affected the   situation at one point But on the whole, yes, if you had intended to close out a position, you   might be more inclined to take delivery if you observe the large open interest                            September 20, 2005 8 of 117  Well, the Treasury did issue a large-position report request last week for this   particular security  So, those with large positions will have to report that by a particular date—   it’s sometime this week                   September 20, 2005 9 of 117  I know that they’re concerned about the situation, and there was certainly a   signaling effect perceived by the market when the Treasury issued that request for large-position   reports We saw some decay accelerating right after that request, so perhaps some of the longs   took that as a signal that they should reduce their positions   "
7598,2005-11-01,"1  Thank you, Mr Chairman  The now lengthy period of tight spreads  and low volatilities continued in the intermeeting period  That was despite some  unexpected credit events, another hurricane, and increased talk about upside  inflation risks   The top panel on page 1 graphs the 3-month deposit rate in black and the same  rate three and nine months forward in red  The 3- and 9-month forward rates rose  47 and 53 basis points, respectively, as market participants absorbed incoming  data and, even more, comments by Committee members expressing heightened  levels of concern about upside inflation risks      Many market participants now assume that the Committee will tighten during  each of the next four meetings, including the first meeting to be presided over by  the new Chairman  The tone of market expectations—at least among traders as  opposed to Street economists—has changed a bit  Earlier this summer the betting  was about where the co-called “neutral” rate resides  The assumption was that the  Committee would stop in that neighborhood Now, with increased concern about  inflation, the question of where neutrality resides is slowly being superseded by a  new question How far beyond “neutral” will policy need to go to dampen  inflationary pressures?   The yield curve rose across maturities, as shown in the middle panel  The  2-year Treasury yield rose 40 basis points while the 10-year yield rose 30,  apparently affected in part by MBS-related hedging flows  The 2-year yield is at  its highest level since May 2001  The shape of the curve narrowed by 10 basis  points and sits at a relatively narrow 17 basis points       While the conversation in markets was about inflation, interestingly, break- even inflation rates from TIPS [Treasury inflation-protected securities] were little                                         November 1, 2005 4 of 114  changed, as seen in the bottom panel  The 2-year break-even inflation [BEI] rate  had risen over the summer as energy prices rallied; but it plateaued and came off a  bit as the price of oil headed back down  The 10-year BEI was little changed  This suggests that the rise in nominal yields was an increase in real rates and  suggestive of tightened financial conditions  The sluggishness in equity markets  until this past Friday was consistent with this view   The behavior of break-even rates also calls into question some of the instant  analysis surrounding Ben Bernanke’s nomination last Monday  While some  analysts were quick to attribute the rise in nominal yields last week to the  nomination—on the basis of some perceived squishiness on inflation—the rise in  real yields, which had already been in train, and the flatness of BEIs do not bear  this out   If there is some suggestion that financial conditions are tightening, the  evidence elsewhere was mixed  Certainly, yields in other major economies have  been moving higher since the end of the summer, as shown in the top panel of  page 2 Long-term sovereign yields in the UK, Canada, and Germany—the  latter as a proxy for the euro area—have been rising recently  The rise of nearly  40 basis points in German yields has been particularly noteworthy and may reflect  upgraded forecasts for European growth in general and improved sentiment  toward Germany, notwithstanding a messy election outcome that leaves prospects  for reform uncertain   Even Japanese yields have been rising recently  Investors are increasingly  contemplating that maybe, just maybe, after so many false starts, this time the  recovery is for real  The better economic tempo and heightened probabilities that  sometime in the next 12 months the CPI will no longer be preceded by a negative  sign are leading more investors to take a defensive posture toward Japanese  bonds   Expectations about near-term policy in those same countries are broadly  consistent with the movement in longer-dated yields  The middle panel graphs  March 2006 futures prices for short-dated interest rates for the US, UK, Canada  and the euro area Short sterling futures are flat—in itself noteworthy, given that  the Bank of England most recently eased policy  The others are all moving  upward to varying degrees  The middle right panel graphs the December 2006  euro-yen deposit futures contract, which has also risen as the market tries to  anticipate the end of the Bank of Japan’s [BOJ] quantitative easing policy, now  expected by the market—and the BOJ, as reported in the monthly report  yesterday—to be sometime in the fiscal year beginning on April 1   If the developed world provides evidence that financial conditions are  tightening, the same cannot be said for the emerging markets  The EMBI  [Emerging Market Bond Index] spread was little changed and is at historically  tight levels Despite higher dollar rates, the central banks of Brazil and Mexico                                          November 1, 2005 5 of 114  have both been able to ease monetary policy—albeit from high levels—in recent  days and weeks, as reflected in the bottom panels  Brazil and Colombia have  managed to issue local-currency-denominated debt in the international market at  attractive rates, as have some private borrowers in Asia  This decoupling from  policy rates in the major economies stands in sharp contrast to previous cycles   And to emerging market bulls, it reflects a better policy mix, higher reserves, and  a strong global economy   As with emerging markets, the byword in domestic credit markets seemed to  be “what, me worry?”  Despite some high-profile bankruptcies in airlines, auto  parts, and the surprise collapse of Refco, credit markets were not flustered and  took the news in stride As shown in the top panels on page 3, both investment- grade and high-yield spreads moved only slightly and remained at historically  tight levels   The bankruptcies of Delta and Northwest were dismissed, having been long  expected The Delphi bankruptcy was also broadly expected  And yet when it  happened, protection for General Motors in the CDS [credit default swap] market  temporarily shot higher, as shown in the middle panel  The prospect that GM  might have to absorb billions of dollars of additional pension costs got traders’  attention Ford Motor CDS rates were also affected  But the broader Dow Jones  CDX high-yield index—comprised of 100 single names—was little changed    One collapse that was not expected was that of Refco, whose fraud was made  public the morning of October 10 and which filed for bankruptcy on October 17   Refco is a small corporate bond issuer but it does have linkages to firms across  Wall Street  All in all, the stress emanating from Refco was limited  The rather  busy graph at the bottom of page 3 depicts credit default swap rates for eight

began to go bad  In contrast, the Refco news did  not even register a blip in CDS rates   Overall, markets are posing something of a puzzle  The rise in real yields and  the fall in equity prices for most of September and October suggest a tightening of  financial conditions There were both expected and unexpected bankruptcy  filings Yet both emerging markets and domestic credit markets were unfazed,  and money continues to seek higher-yielding assets  Maybe it really is different  this time  Then again, maybe the reaction will come with a lag that is longer than  usual   Mr Chairman,

think this question came up about a year ago, and Vincent was summarizing the   work that had been done   You know, I haven’t looked at the rolling correlation coefficients recently   Certainly, there have been episodes, going back at least a decade, when these rates moved very,   very closely; 1994 was a period—    Right  Then the correlation sort of breaks down and then it starts up again  I   don’t know if Karen knows more about a date, but over the past couple of years they have been   moving pretty tightly   Denominated in local currencies?   The Brazilian issue was denominated in reals, but actually the payments will be in   dollars  It’s indexed back to reals, so the exchange rate risk is wholly with the investor   Well, they are able to get a much more attractive rate  The spread that they’re   able to get—    The principal is repaid in dollars    No  The payment is in dollars                           November 1, 2005 9 of 114  But it’s indexed to the exchange rate   In other words, the flow of payments you receive is in dollars  When you get your   money back, you will be paid dollars    That’s right   For reasons that I can’t fully explain, the spread that Brazil was able to get by   doing it this way has been much tighter    I’m not as familiar with the Colombian one  I don’t remember the details of that   No, no This is if you want to buy protection on, say, Lehman Brothers or Bear   Stearns  This is the price of protection on these firms                                               November 1, 2005 11 of 114   Yes, all eight of them   This comes from a private-sector firm, so there’s no inside information here    The probability, based on fed funds futures, I think is pretty low right now  My   point was more about the way that people in the markets are slowly coming to view the situation  In   this cycle, they’ve been looking two to three meetings ahead  But the next few meetings are a bit   different, obviously  I believe traders are thinking that the policy moves over the next couple of   meetings are more or less baked in the cake  The new Chairman won’t want to be in the position   where he has to “stop” and confirm the dovish suspicions of some of the folks out there  So that   gets you to the next four meetings, basically  But that fourth one I don’t think is in the fed funds   futures                                November 1, 2005 12 of 114  It’s Citigroup and Bank of America     I do need a vote   I think that’s right  I believe it would be viewed as very hawkish because you’ve   taken out the accommodative language and you’re talking about firming  So I think Vincent is right   that it would be taken as a very hawkish statement  "
7620,2005-12-13,"1  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be referring to the handout that is in  front of you With the year-end approaching, I thought I’d look back at 2005 a bit   One of the more surprising market developments has been the steady—if low-key—  appreciation of the US dollar  That strength is all the more surprising after the dollar’s  depreciation in 2004 when it appeared that the current account imbalance had hit a  threshold that was impacting exchange markets  But, as shown on the top of page 1 of  your handout, the trade-weighted dollar has appreciated by 8 percent since the start of  2005 The dollar’s strength was broad-based against all major currencies  As shown in  the middle left panel, the dollar rallied from below 105 yen to 120 yen  That last 10  yen—from 110 to 120—came in a nearly straight line and was coincident with Prime  Minister Koizumi’s victory in the September elections and the ongoing improved  sentiment about the Japanese economy  Risk appetite among Japanese investors seems  to have risen and capital outflows have accelerated, as investors look to pick up yield in  fixed income markets not only in the United States but also in markets such as the UK,  Australia, and New Zealand   As shown in the middle right panel, the dollar has also risen against the euro  At  the start of 2005 the euro was trading at about $135  Today it is below $120  Sentiment toward the euro has been poor, given lackluster growth and the widening  interest rate differentials with the dollar—but I’ll comment more on that later  Among  the few currencies that the dollar depreciated against were the Mexican peso and the  Brazilian real Both countries have substantially higher nominal and real interest rates,  and both central banks in recent months have been easing policy   At this point, you might be asking yourself Whatever happened to the issue of the  current account deficit?  Weren’t the imbalances supposed to lead to a weaker dollar?    Certainly, that explanation appeared to work last year when the dollar was falling  The  bottom panel of the first page graphs the trade-weighted dollar—the red line—and the  current account balance for the United States as a percent of GDP since 1980—the blue  bars Ideally, this should show that when the deficit is high, a weak dollar follows   While there have been a couple of periods when growing current account imbalances  were followed by a subsequent bout of dollar weakness (for example, in the period after  1985), there are examples of just the opposite as well  The dollar strengthened in the  early 1980s and also the late 1990s in the face of high and rising current account  deficits When looked at quantitatively, the correlation between the current account  and the next year’s exchange rate is weak      1 The materials used by Mr Kos are appended to this transcript (appendix 1)                                             December 13, 2005 4 of 100  What, then, explains the dollar’s strength?  The most compelling explanation—  and this is tentative, I should say—appears to center around the economy’s strength  relative to other major economies  That difference in performance is, in turn, reflected  in interest rate differentials, as shown on page 2  This page graphs the sovereign G-7  yield curve in green, the US Treasury curve in blue, and the G-7 curve excluding the  United States in red The composite yield curves are based on GDP weights for each  country At the beginning of 2004, US short-term rates were lower than those of other  major countries and the US curve was steeper  By the beginning of 2005, and with the  tightening cycle here already well along, the entire US yield curve had shifted above  the others, as shown in the middle panel  That interest rate differential continued to  widen during 2005, with the prospect for further widening if futures markets in the G-7  are to be believed   Of course, all that tells us nothing about the future course of exchange rates   Perhaps growth and interest rate differentials will continue to drive exchange markets   Or perhaps the current account will finally hit some threshold where a sharp  depreciation is triggered  Unfortunately, reviewing past relationships does not help  answer that key question   Turning to page 3 for a closer look at recent monetary policy expectations in the  G-3, the top panel graphs the 3-month cash rate for the dollar and euro—in the solid  blue and red lines, respectively—and 3-, 6-, and 9-month forward rates in the dashed  lines This graph depicts the widening of differentials between dollar and euro interest  rates during the year But it also shows the recent uptrend in rates in the euro area, as  the ECB finally tightened by 25 basis points earlier this month—although that uptrend  was contained by the ECB’s deliberate attempts to signal that this was not the first of a  string of moves along the lines of the US cycle    Short-term rates from forward-rate agreements for Japan, shown in the middle  panel, suggest some backing off from earlier expectations about how quickly the Bank  of Japan [BOJ] would enter a new tightening cycle, with 9-month forward rates falling  about 10 basis points over the intermeeting period  Although the BOJ has signaled an  intention to exit its quantitative easing policy in the second quarter of 2006, there has  been substantial push-back from politicians  Furthermore, the BOJ itself has said  explicitly that even after the exit from quantitative targeting, short-term rates would  stay at or close to zero for some time afterward   Despite actual or expected further tightening of monetary policies in many  countries, risk appetite remains robust  As shown at the bottom of page 3, stock  markets have rallied in most regions  In fact, in local currency terms, the S&P has been  the laggard However, when converted into dollars, the returns on foreign markets are  reduced, given the strength of the dollar; and after that adjustment, the S&P’s  performance looks a lot more like stock market performance elsewhere in the  industrialized world Emerging-market equity markets have been booming in local                                            December 13, 2005 5 of 100  currency terms  And for specific markets such as Brazil and Mexico—whose  currencies have appreciated— returns expressed in dollars have been turbocharged      Turning to page 4 and continuing on the theme of healthy risk appetites, the top  panel graphs the high yield and EMBI+ [Emerging Market Bond Index Plus] spreads  for the year to date High yield spreads have stabilized at around 380 basis points—  higher than levels observed last spring but still low by historical standards  In contrast,  since the last FOMC meeting, emerging-market debt spreads—the green line—have  continued to tighten to all-time lows      Investment grade spreads—in the middle left panel—show a similar pattern   Excluding the troubled auto and airline industries, corporate financial health remains  strong Earnings and cash levels are both high, and leverage is relatively low  That  said, a bit of re-leveraging is in the pipeline, judging by the increasing flows in LBO  deals and announced stock buybacks   The big credit story in November, of course, was the worsened outlook for GM   CDS [credit default swap] spreads for GM, shown in the middle right panel, are now  trading about 1200 basis points over Libor, compared to just over 300 basis points for  the high yield CDX index  Near-term prospects for GM have deteriorated significantly,  so much so that the credit yield curve for GM has inverted  In other words, it is more  expensive to buy credit protection against a GM default in the next 12 months, than it is  to buy credit protection against a GM default over the next 5 years  In addition, sellers  of CDS protection on GM have started to demand up-front payment from buyers of  protection They are “front loading” their coupon payments of the swap because of  fears that GM will default before they have received any payments from protection  buyers The worries about GM were likely reinforced by yesterday’s announcement  from Standard and Poor’s that it had downgraded GM to single B   Recent declines in volatility in both equity and debt markets reinforce this low  risk concept and are consistent with the strong risk appetite in markets  While the VIX  has shown some periodic spikes this year, the movements this year are very small  compared to historical changes  Fixed income volatility is also low, as shown in the  bottom right panel      Turning to page 5, let me say a few words about the System Open Market  Account [SOMA] The top panel graphs the growth of SOMA in dollar terms for each  year since 1995 So far, SOMA has expanded by a bit more than $25 billion in 2005—  somewhat less than the growth in recent years  The main driver of SOMA’s growth is  growth of currency in circulation  As shown in the middle panel, currency growth—  again, measured in dollars—has been trailing off in recent years and is likely to have its  weakest year of growth since the late 1990s  We don’t know the cause of that falling  growth rate, although greater use of credit cards, debit cards, and other forms of  electronic payment may at least partly explain this development                            December 13, 2005 6 of 100  Looking at shorter periods, the bottom left panel graphs for 2005 the year-on­ year growth rate for currency Currency growth has decelerated from a 55 percent   growth rate at the beginning of the year to about 35 percent  The noisy panel on the   bottom right shows the growth of currency in the year-end period for each of the past   four years as well as this year through last week, with projections for the remainder of   this year in the burgundy dots During the 2001 year-end—the blue line at the top—   currency grew about 4 percent from November to the peak in late December before the   reflows began The following year the year-end seasonal bulge was less pronounced,   and that pattern has continued in each year since  Again, it’s not clear what is driving   this process, but greater use of alternative forms of payment sounds reasonable  In any   case, the smaller hump in seasonal demand will, if it persists, make the management of   reserves more straightforward in the future    Mr Chairman, there were no foreign operations by the Desk  I will need a vote to  approve domestic operations    I didn’t look at it that  closely  I suspect that if one looks at the relationship over a   long enough period, probably not a whole lot  That’s a suspicion   That was my point  I’m sorry, I was not clear  My point was that the S&P looks   as if it underperformed the others, but when you look at it in common terms against the dollar, the   S&P doesn’t quite look like the laggard that it does in local currency terms   Yes, that’s a good point, and we’ve had that discussion here in the past  In fact,   the estimates are that two-thirds of the currency is overseas   We have good data on shipments The shipments data say that the currency is   coming back  What we don’t know is how much is going out by other means, whether legal or illegal,   through things like remittances, for example  If one looks at the other indicator that is used, which is   the number of $100 bills issued, and makes some assumptions about how many of those go overseas,   then that reflow from overseas is tamed  It’s damped a bit   So I think there’s some truth to what you say, but it’s hard to quantify  And in any case, the   interesting thing about this bottom right chart, at least, is that it’s probably driven mostly by domestic   factors because there is evidence of the domestic holiday fluctuation   In terms of the seasonal, yes  "
7641,2006-01-31,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  There are two votes  On the domestic authorization,   I’m recommending that the Committee approve it  There are no amendments that are being   suggested    Okay  Thank you  Then, the next vote is on the foreign currency authorization,   the foreign currency directive, and the procedural instructions  In the memo that I circulated, there   was one small amendment that I am suggesting to the authorization, having to do with some   housekeeping language related to reverse repos, to bring it into alignment with domestic operations    It’s a purely housekeeping item  1       Thank you, Mr Chairman  With the start of the new year, domestic  markets were preoccupied with the same set of questions that occupied market  participants in 2005  How much longer would the tightening cycle continue?  What  is the shape of the yield curve telling us?  Are there signs of a slowdown?  And are  inflation pressures increasing, or are they likely to ebb?   The top panel on the first page graphs the three-month deposit rate in black and  the three-month rate three and nine months forward in red since June 2005  As the  market began to anticipate an end to the tightening cycle, the cash and forward rates  began to converge in recent weeks  With three- and nine-month forwards essentially  trading on top of each other, and allowing for term premiums, taken at face value  forward rates suggest some more modest tightening but also some probability of an  ease later this year  Those market participants that are bearish on interest rates and  the economy point to data hinting at softness, such as signs of a slowdown in housing   The bleak view was given a lift on Friday by the weaker-than-forecast fourth-quarter  GDP report  These market participants see either a quick end to the tightening cycle  or a swift reversal toward policy easing later this year  The counter view is that  inflationary pressures will forestall an early end to the tightening, much less usher in  a new easing cycle  Ironically those with that view took comfort from the price data  in Friday’s GDP report       The compression we see in cash and forward rates at the short end of the curve is   also visible for longer maturities  The middle panel graphs the target fed funds rate in  green along with yields on two- and ten-year Treasury notes  Yields have slowly  been grinding upward the past few days toward 4½ percent as the market, on balance,  has come to discount further tightening beyond today’s meeting  In the past week,  the yield on the two-year note has risen from about 435 percent to 45 percent   Given the mixed data, it’s difficult to make the case that the upward move was driven  by data alone  Indeed, for the first time in a while, traders were talking about  looming supply given fiscal needs Yesterday the Treasury announced a somewhat  higher-than-expected borrowing need for the first quarter  And at last week’s two- year auction, the low level of participation by indirect bidders was taken as a signal   1 The materials used by Mr Kos are appended to this transcript (appendix 1)   January 31, 2006 7 of 106    that foreign demand was waning  Perhaps market participants are finally coming to  the view that yields are too low given the likely prospect that the cost of financing  positions will continue to rise at least a while longer       With the convergence of yields along the curve, last summer’s chatter about yield   curve inversions flared up anew  The bottom panel graphs two views of the yield  curve going back to 1977  The red line graphs the spread between the ten-year note  and the three-month bill  The blue line graphs the yield spread between the ten-year  and the two-year notes  These are monthly averages, and the last data point is from  January 2006 through last Friday  The gray areas denote recessions      Looking at this chart and similar charts, it’s easy to see why the curve flattening   has received so much attention  In recent decades, recessions have tended to be  preceded by curve inversions  Of course, markets are now so much more developed  and sophisticated that maybe it’s different this time  Changes in markets, such as the  role of pension funds or central bank reserve accumulation, may be distorting the  curve  And maybe that argument is right  But a cautionary point is in order  After  all, the inversion in 2000 was dismissed by most analysts as technically inspired  given the shrinking stock of federal debt and the Treasury’s buyback program at the  long end of the curve  On the other hand, the pessimists may be overplaying their  hand too early in the game  We haven’t had much of an inversion as yet  You need a  magnifying glass to see the inversion, which is very small and so far very brief  The  curve has merely gone flat  As I noted last summer, the curve can be flat for years— as was the case in the late 1990s—without adverse effects on the broader economy   The Chairman has talked about the conundrum, which most private-sector  commentators have used as a jumping off point to talk about low nominal yields at  the long end of the curve  Until recently, less attention was focused on trends in real  rates both here and abroad      The top of page 2 graphs the yield of ten-year inflation-linked securities for the   United States, the United Kingdom, and France for the past seven months  The ten- year TIPS yield in the United States (the green line) has traded at about 2 percent   That’s up from about 1 percent briefly observed in 2004 but well below the 4 percent  earlier in this decade, when the market was still maturing  UK and French real rates  have also fallen since the beginning of the decade  The United Kingdom probably  has the most developed inflation-linked market, with maturities going as far out as  fifty years  The middle panel graphs the real rate on ten-, thirty-, and fifty-year  inflation-linked bonds since September 2005  Note that thirty- and fifty-year yields  have gone down faster than the yields at the ten-year maturity  The fifty-year real  yield traded below ½ percent, and the fifty-year security issued just last week traded  under 40 basis points     What accounts for such low rates?  Well maybe institutions are worried about the   United Kingdom’s long-term inflation prospects  But that does not seem to be borne  out by anecdotal or other indicators  Two intertwined trends in the United Kingdom  related to the insurance and pension fund businesses are frequently cited  First, after   January 31, 2006 8 of 106    the decline in equity prices earlier in the decade, UK and other European insurers  lowered allocations to equity and shifted toward fixed income  Second, in the United  Kingdom, pension rules now require fund managers to match the duration of  liabilities with similar-duration assets  But the shortage of supply relative to demand  has pushed bond prices up and yields down  As a result, the very long end of the  UK real yield curve has been inverted  The long end of the nominal curve, as shown  in the bottom left panel, has also inverted  To fill out the picture, the bottom right  panel graphs ten-, thirty-, and fifty-year break-even rates; but given the distortions,  it’s not clear how much should be read into these numbers  Such movements in UK  real yields have caught the attention of US portfolio managers With continued talk  about the prospect for changes to pension fund rules here, there are those who believe  that the United States will gravitate toward the UK approach of requiring the  matching of duration for assets and liabilities  If so, then the prospect of a steady bid  for long-dated assets may both damp yield volatility at the long end and lower yields  from what they might have been  That would truly make the curve very suspect as an  indicator of future economic performance      If the shape of the US yield curve is bearish for the economy, there is no   shortage of indicators pointing the other way  I will note that in 2000, when the curve  last inverted, the stock market soon slumped, credit spreads began a sudden widening,  and the dollar was appreciating  In this cycle, these other indicators are not flashing  warning lights just yet  The dollar tripped up many forecasters in 2005 by  appreciating  But as shown in the top panel on page 3, more recently the dollar has  depreciated against most currencies, including a few Asian currencies whose  exchange rates against the dollar had been somewhat sticky in the past  Equities have  been rallying globally, especially in countries leveraged to the global economy, such  as Korea in technology and Brazil in commodities  Even the Nikkei has recovered  from its Livedoor-inspired swoon and the curtailment of trading on the Tokyo Stock  Exchange due to problems in processing large volumes  Credit markets continue to  be favorable  As shown in the bottom left chart, the volatility on the S&P 100 rose  from very low levels recently but has already come back  And Treasury volatility— shown on the bottom right—is low and recently has drifted still lower      Moving to page 4, the top panel graphs the high-yield and emerging market debt   spreads  These two spreads essentially moved together for several years and were  viewed as being of similar riskiness  As shown in the top panel, there was a  divergence in mid-2004 when emerging-market yields blew out about 150 basis  points  In mid-2005, the divergence cut the other way, with emerging markets  outperforming and spreads narrowing to new record lows  While some commentators  ascribed the narrowing of emerging-market debt to the search for yield, rising risk  appetite, and “excess liquidity,” others pointed to improving fundamentals driven by  higher commodity prices, better fiscal performance, lower inflation, and higher  reserve levels that insulated these countries from external shocks  The pie charts  below attempt to explain, if not justify, the benign explanation  The two middle pie  charts show the ratings distribution of the high-yield index as of October 2002 and  again as of year-end 2005  The rating distribution of the high-yield index is nearly   January 31, 2006 9 of 106    identical  The two pie charts at the bottom of the page show the rating composition  of the emerging-market index as of the same two dates  Note that the share of higher- rated BBB or investment-grade assets in blue grew from 29 to 38 percent   Meanwhile, the share of low-rated B and CCC paper, which accounted for 33 percent  of the index in October 2002, shrunk to only 11 percent at year-end       In short, the ratings composition is higher for the emerging-market index relative   to the high-yield index in absolute terms, and the trend has been toward relative  ratings improvement  Of course, ratings are not the only factor  In a default  situation, bondholders of a corporation can often assert their rights and recover  meaningful amounts in a bankruptcy process overseen by the courts  In contrast,  while countries have the power to tax, the ability of the creditors in a default to  recover in negotiations—as we saw with Argentina—may not be as favorable      Finally, a few words about domestic reserves management  On page 5, the top   panel graphs the fed funds target in blue, the highs and lows for each day in gray, and  the daily effective rate in red  You’ll note that, although the effective rate was  generally close to the target in the maintenance period that covered the year-end,  there was a bit more variability of rates, usually late in the day, with some tendency  for rates to soften  Part of this was related to normal year-end noise  Note also the  drift higher in the effective rate ahead of the December FOMC meeting  This  reflected the market’s anticipation of the new target rate and the tendency to move the  funds rate from the old to the new target rate days before the meeting     The middle panel looks at this phenomenon more closely  It graphs the difference   between the market (effective) rate and the target fed funds rates in the days before an  FOMC meeting  To make a cleaner comparison, the sample includes only those  periods in which the FOMC meeting fell on the first Tuesday of the two-week reserve  maintenance period and periods in which there were no high-payment days through  the meeting date that might have influenced market conditions  It should be noted  that, in all these maintenance periods, the market had come to fully expect a 25 basis  point tightening move by the start of the period  The blue line shows, for the 2004  sample dates, the drift higher in the funds rate as the FOMC meeting date gets closer   On average, the funds rate was about 7 basis points firm on the Thursday preceding  the meeting and rose to be 21 basis points firm to the old target on the Tuesday  meeting date itself  In our 2005 sample, the anticipation effect was even more  pronounced in the days ahead of the meeting, with the funds rate 15 basis points firm  on the Thursday and the expected move almost fully priced in on the day before the  meeting      The bottom panel underscores the difficulty that the Desk faces when it tries to   lean against expectations that are so widely held  This graph shows, for the same  sample of periods, the amount of average excess reserves in the days leading up to the  FOMC meeting  It also shows what more-typical levels of excess reserves look like  over the first four days of a maintenance period, based on reserve levels from periods  in 2004 and 2005 in which there was no policy change and in which there were no   January 31, 2006 10 of 106    high-payment dates in the first four days  In 2004, the Desk was already providing  much higher levels of excess reserves than normal in the days leading up to the  FOMC meeting during these periods, in order to mitigate the anticipation effects   And these anticipation effects became even more pronounced in 2005, despite our  having increased the levels of excess reserves even further  We tend to believe that  the higher anticipation effects seen in 2005 reflected a learning process on the part of  market participants since the start of the tightening cycle in mid-2004, as buyers and  sellers tested their ability to arbitrage their reserve holdings over more days in the  maintenance period around the expected policy change  It’s not clear what the natural  limit is to this process       Mr Chairman, I am happy to report once again that there were no foreign   operations in the period  I will need a vote to approve domestic operations  Debby  and I are happy to take any questions      It’s the RPIX    Well, my reason for including this detail at the meeting really is because that’s   the anecdotal feedback that I’ve been getting over the past few weeks and months  And, in a sense,   the UK experience caught a lot of portfolio managers here by surprise, and it has made them   rethink their assumptions about the effect that a change in pension rules would have on our long   end  And that, I think, is exactly the point that you’re making    I think what we’ve learned from the UK case is that it can be  In a sense, the   thirty-year gilt in the United Kingdom became disengaged from the rest of the curve some years   ago  And we had an upward-sloping curve to about ten, and then it became inverted because of   January 31, 2006 12 of 106    these pension effects—or that seems to be the prevailing consensus  So some participants in our   markets are trying to think ahead over the next five, ten, fifteen years about what changes in pension   rules would do to the shape of the curve  What will be the demographics that will drive it?  And it’s   making them rethink their assumptions about demand driven by demographics, as you say, versus   other kinds of demands that might increase supply because of fiscal factors  So you might get an   ironic effect in which you’ll get more supply but the demand is even higher because of what’s   happening    I think it can be looked at  I think the other point that you hinted at, which is   very important, is that it’s not just US managers looking at US TIPS but European managers   looking at US inflation-linked securities  It’s a very good point  I think it’s worth studying    I have heard a few anecdotes regarding CEOs who have been very surprised and   become angry when they saw that their unfunded pension fund cost them earnings over the past few   years  They basically directed the CFO and, in turn, the pension managers not to let this happen   again  Thus, regardless of legislation, there has been a shift at the margin from equities into debt   with matching duration  "
7664,2006-03-27,"1       Thank you, Mr Chairman  Financial markets were characterized by a  continuation of the fairly benign trends that we have observed over the past few  months, with narrow spreads, low volatilities, strong equity markets, and flat yield  curves—all set against a favorable macroeconomic backdrop     The top two panels graph the three-month deposit rate for the dollar, the euro, and  the yen and the respective three-, six-, and nine-month forward rates  The  compression of the dashed red lines toward the cash rate reflects the view of market  participants that the Committee is nearing the end of the tightening cycle  In contrast,  forward rates for euro-area deposits are rising, and the spread with the cash rate has  widened substantially since last fall as market participants began to revise up their  forecasts of European growth and the likely path of monetary policy  Indeed, the  European Central Bank (ECB) has increased its policy rate twice, by 25 basis points  per move, to 2½ percent since December, and expectations are in place for two or  three additional 25 basis point tightening steps between now and year-end  Japanese  forward rates also rose in anticipation and then with the reality of the Bank of Japan’s  announcement that it would terminate the quantitative easing policy and go back to  targeting interest rates  I’ll have more to say about that later                                                       1 The materials used by Mr Kos are appended to this transcript (appendix 1)   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 3 of 167         With the increase in US short-term rates and the stubbornness of the long end,   the yield curve has stayed flat  The bottom panel graphs the two- to ten-year spread  since June 2004, or roughly when the tightening cycle began  The Chairman’s recent  speech on the subject notwithstanding, market participants remain divided about the  implications of the flat, or slightly inverted, yield curve      Turning to page 2, the economic news coming from Japan has been interpreted as   pointing to an improved outlook  Maybe it’s not a new era for Japan, but at a  minimum it looks like a new chapter for the world’s second largest economy  The  top left panel graphs the Bank of Japan’s current account balances since January  2001  Just about five years ago, the target current account balance (CAB) became the  BOJ’s chief operating instrument  Although required reserves have been in the range  of 5 trillion to 6 trillion yen, the BOJ successively raised its target for CABs to as  much as 35 trillion yen  Two weeks ago, the BOJ announced that it would end the  quantitative easing policy and go back to targeting the overnight call rate  Most  likely it will take about three months for the BOJ to drain the excess reserves in the  system  The call rate itself is expected to continue to trade near 0 percent well into  autumn  Among the factors that allowed the BOJ to take this step were signs that  deflation was ebbing and that bank lending was no longer contracting (as shown in  the top right and middle left panels)  Meanwhile, the health of the financial system  has improved, particularly that of the largest banks, as shown by the middle right  panel, which graphs equity indexes for the broad Topix and bank sub-index  Along  with forward rates, yields at longer maturities have also begun to reflect this  improved picture  The bottom panel graphs two- and five-year yields since 2001   The 2-year Japanese government bond yields about 60 basis points—up from a low of  about 3 or 4 basis points in 2002 and 2003  Five-year rates have risen from about  20 basis points at the low to 125 percent      The view is brighter in Europe as well, even if performance lags other regions    European equities have risen broadly over the past fifteen months, as shown in the top  panel of page 3  Sovereign yields have risen, though there is still a gap with  comparable US yields  The ten-year German bund yields about 365 percent,  compared with just above 3 percent six months ago  Meanwhile, there are signs of  life in Germany—Europe’s largest economy—particularly in the export sector  The  improved business sentiment is reflected in the steadily rising Ifo business survey in  the middle right panel       With G3 and other major economies such as Canada, China, and India all doing   well, it’s not surprising that the overall market environment looks favorable  In fact,  one has to go far out in the periphery to find any signs of stress  The bottom panel  graphs the performance of selected currencies against the dollar through Friday’s  close  Besides the euro and yen for reference, the other currencies are those that have  been mentioned as popular with the investors engaged in so-called carry trades  In  the past few weeks, some of these positions have been scaled back, and these  currencies have weakened substantially in some cases  Now let me confess that I   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 4 of 167       hesitated to include this chart  The previous Chairman chided me once for showing a  similar chart that included the New Zealand dollar—the currency of a country with a  mere 4 million residents  Well, I am probably skating on very thin ice with the new  Chairman, now that the kiwi has returned along with that powerhouse the Icelandic  krona, the currency of a country with about 250,000 residents or roughly one-tenth  the size of Brooklyn  The point is not to suggest that Iceland is on the verge of  joining the G7 but rather that the search for yield went to some pretty distant and  unlikely places—as we are now discovering  It does raise questions about other  sectors that leveraged money went into and about which we don’t yet know  The  optimistic viewpoint is that carry trades in some of these peripheral markets have  been scaled back without broader ripple effects—and that these markets have been  repriced to levels that seem more appropriate      On page 4, the top panel graphs the familiar emerging-market and high-yield   spreads since the bull market began in October 2002  The EMBI+ spread continues  to narrow to new record lows  Reflecting that benign environment, Mexico and  Brazil continued their easing campaigns, and Indian and Chinese equities continued  to rally  At the January meeting, I spoke about the bullish factors pushing emerging- market spreads lower  Meanwhile the high-yield index has remained in a range and  really hasn’t tightened further since early 2004         The middle panel shows the rating composition of high-yield issuance since 1988    Issuance shot higher in 2003 and 2004—mostly to refinance, to extend maturities, and  in general to repair balance sheets  Very little of that was for investment  Issuance  fell sharply in 2005 and is running at that pace if one annualizes issuance for the first  three months of 2006  That issuance continues to be largely for refinancing debt and  increasingly for financing leveraged buyouts, acquisitions, payments of special  dividends, and other forms of financial engineering  Some of these are likely to show  up as defaults in the future      Meanwhile, actual defaults—as shown in the bottom panel—are low and show no   signs of increasing  Note that defaults typically start increasing a couple of years  before the onset of recession, which is not surprising since the weakest corporations  are less able to absorb a change in business climate  So if a flat or inverted yield  curve suggests possible weakness ahead, the low default rate for this sector is one  indicator pointing the other way       Turning to page 5, I have some words about recent challenges regarding reserve   management  Besides the usual anticipation effects that we have seen in past  maintenance periods when the market expected a rate hike at an FOMC meeting, the  funds rate and our management of reserves in the current maintenance period—which  ends on Wednesday—was heavily influenced by reserve management at one large  money center bank  the Bank of New York      In the top panel, the effects of the market’s expectation of a policy rate hike at this   meeting are reflected in the smooth upward progression in the morning federal funds   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 5 of 167       rate—shown by the blue circles  At the start of this maintenance period, the funds  rate in the morning was right at the current 4½ percent target  Morning rates have  risen steadily over the period, and this morning they stood right around the expected  new target of 4¾ percent  This pattern reflects the kind of gradual approach to the  expected new target that we have seen in most maintenance periods since the start of  the tightening cycle in June 2004      Typically in these maintenance periods, the Desk has tried to lean modestly   against the anticipation effects by providing relatively more reserves in the days  before the FOMC meeting  But in the current maintenance period, these efforts were  overwhelmed by reserve management at the Bank of New York (BONY), which had  an unusually high level of requirements  BONY’s high requirements—around  $4 billion on a period-average basis both last period and in the current period— resulted from as-of adjustments applied in these two maintenance periods to  compensate for its past underreporting of reservable deposits  Its normal  requirements are only around $100 million  In anticipation of higher rates in the  latter part of this maintenance period, BONY met virtually all its elevated  requirements over the first four business days of the period and then held near zero  balances over the remainder of the period  BONY had indicated to us its intention of  managing its reserve balances in this way  But for the first couple of days we only  partly accommodated their increased demand, in large measure because the amounts  seemed implausibly high and also because our experience has shown that banks’  stated intentions and actual behaviors don’t always line up      Frankly, we were quite surprised at how inelastic BONY’s demand proved to be    Its holdings in the first couple of days effectively created a reserve shortage at all  other banks in the system  The funds rate soared late in the day on each of these days,  even well above the expected new target level, and there was considerable borrowing  at the primary credit facility  Nonetheless, BONY sold very few reserves back into  the market  For the next couple of days, then, the Desk elevated its provision of  reserves to fully accommodate BONY’s stated objectives for reserve holdings  As a  result, the funds rate was much less volatile and remained so for the rest of the period,  even as morning rates tended to reflect more of the anticipation effects of the  expected rate hike      This episode illustrates the potential effect that just one bank with a large level of   requirements can have on the entire funds market when it dramatically adjusts its  reserve holdings in a very inelastic fashion  If the Desk is aware of these plans and  can have confidence that the bank’s actions will conform to its stated plans, then it  can compensate in its provision of reserve supply  But it may not always be possible  to meet these conditions      Mr Chairman, there were no foreign operations in the period  I will need a vote   to approve domestic operations     March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 6 of 167        They have a series of operations into the future; they own, for example,   Treasury bills that may have certain maturities  They may have repurchase operations, which   initially they started with short-term repos, and then they extended the maturity of those repos even   as far as nine months, I think, at the far end  So they could take draining actions, but a more passive   way would be just to let those operations mature, and then you have a natural drain that happens   without taking active steps as it were  So three months is a reasonable estimate for their ability to let   a lot of those reserves drain passively without taking overt draining steps, although they may have   to do some of that as well if they want to do in about three months  They could accelerate the   process, but my sense is that they would rather not    I think people are taking the Bank of Japan at its word—that is, the members   were polled, and each individual’s understanding of price stability was within that range  They’ve   said it repeatedly, and I think people are accepting that it’s not an inflation target per se—although   whether it’s more like an inflation goal, who knows?  I think that’s one of those subjects that will   provide a lot of grist for discussion    They do, and I’m trying to remember what they did  They did widen out   somewhat, but very little  But if memory serves me right, I believe that their breakevens were in the   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 7 of 167       area of 50 to 60 basis points in the ten- to twenty-year period  So there isn’t a huge premium built   in, at least into the breakevens    There were some trades  I think what we’ve observed at the Desk in talking to   bank reserve managers is that some banks are taking us at our word and are not afraid to step up and   borrow—and are not afraid to arbitrage against those who still feel the stigma  But, clearly, some   banks still think that coming to the window carries a stigma, and so you do have, to some degree,   those that are willing to take us at our word and take advantage and those that are not  And a lot of   that bias seems to reflect the feelings of senior management  The trader sometimes doesn’t want to   go to the senior manager and say, “I want to go to the window”      I thought that the Committee’s patience might be limited  Yes, there was a   downgrade by one of the rating agencies of Iceland  There were some concerns about some of the   Icelandic banks, and so that seemed to be part of the story  You did have some weak data in New   Zealand, and I guess the central bank there is now expected to be easing over the course of the next   year  So some other things were going on  Yet another factor affecting New Zealand—which,   again, may be more detail than you want—is that Japanese retail investors have been big buyers of   these Uridashis, which I know you know about  And some of that money is now flowing back    Thus, a number of factors are affecting it  Again, at the next meeting I will give you a full report    [Laughter]    Well, I guess I would look at it slightly differently  They held the reserves early   in the period at a lower rate because they were anticipating that—    Oh, I see what you mean  Yes    Yes  I can only speculate, but my sense is that they had a plan for how they   wanted to manage reserves in the period  They didn’t, then, want to game the system as it were,   given that they themselves were responsible for some of the issues during this period  So for them   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 9 of 167       then to take advantage of something that they had created in the first place—that probably isn’t   something that they wanted to do    Right now, there are no signs of that  Again, the hard data that we have are   limited  So some of this information is anecdotal, and some of it we are reading from price   relationships and correlations that we see  Right now, I can’t tell you that there is any evidence to   suggest that the Latin currencies might be next  The situation seems to have been fairly isolated so   far  My point in raising this issue is that, basically, the world looks pretty good right now  Markets   look pretty good  Again, you’re going to have to go to Iceland to find some signs of strain  So,   overall, the picture is positive  But it’s useful to remind ourselves that some leveraged money out   there has gone off into some fairly obscure places    No  It has been a phenomenon in this sense in this cycle  Governor Kohn will   remember better than I do, perhaps  You might have gotten anticipation effects in the day or two   before meetings, when there were keen expectations, but you didn’t see them on the first day of the   reserve maintenance period, which is what we see now    I think it is almost impossible to be absolutely neutral  The choice that you have   to make is almost binary    You can take out row 4, and then the market says, “Okay  They are done”  Or   if you repeat the present language, then it sort of confirms, with a certainty or near certainty, that   there will be another move in May and some possibility of another move after that  I think it is very   hard to be purely neutral  "
7688,2006-05-10,"1       Thank you, Mr Chairman  We all know that asset prices can be volatile,  sometimes too volatile  Well, the last few months have not had that quality  Volatility in all  asset classes, with the exception of commodities, continues to be low  And yet, despite that  low volatility, over the past six months investors, traders, and strategists have already been  through three very different phases  Late last year, market participants were confident that  monetary policy in the United States was at or near neutrality and that once neutrality was  achieved—at 4 or 4¼ percent—the Committee would stop tightening  Then the market  temporarily got worked up that monetary policy was getting too tight and that the inevitable  slowdown would cause the Committee to be easing later this year  Now we are in a new  phase, in which worries about nascent inflation have supplanted the earlier fears of a  slowdown and the discussion about neutrality has all but evaporated  Markets haven’t been  volatile, but sentiment has   On page 1, the top two panels graph the three-month deposit rate for dollar, euro, and yen  deposits and three-, six-, and nine-month forward rates for each  US dollar forward rates  are trading on top of each other, anticipating either the end of the tightening cycle or a  lengthy pause starting sometime soon  The minutes of the Committee’s March meeting made  public in mid-April and the Chairman’s JEC testimony were both taken as signals that a  pause was on the horizon, despite the qualified language in both and despite other data that  were generally strong and that contributed to the rise in long-term yields, which I’ll talk  about later     In the euro area, forward rates continued their steady upward climb as growth forecasts   increased, business confidence improved, and the European Central Bank signaled that more  tightening was likely  Markets anticipate roughly 25 basis points of tightening per quarter  through year-end  The list of central banks that have tightened recently includes Canada,   1 The materials used by Mr Kos are appended to this transcript (appendix 1)   May 10, 2006 3 of 120    Switzerland, Australia, Norway, Thailand, and Malaysia  The People’s Bank of China raised  the minimum lending rate that financial institutions can charge 27 basis points, to 585  percent, though I’m not sure that qualifies as a tightening for an economy with real growth in  double digits     The Bank of Japan is working to slowly bring down the current account balances  From   about ¥30 trillion, balances have now been reduced to about half that level  The BOJ will  continue to bring them down over the next month and then will likely maintain a buffer  above required reserves for a period to give banks more time to adjust to the interest rate  targeting framework that will follow  As the middle panel shows, yen forward rates have  continued to rise, and markets now presume that the BOJ will bring the overnight call rate to  25 basis points sometime this autumn—but rumors circulated overnight that the first increase  could come as early as July  Those rumors fueled a rise of 9 basis points in two-year  Japanese government bond yields and Euroyen futures     The bottom panel graphs the two- and ten-year Treasury yields and the target fed funds   rate  Since the last meeting, the ten-year yield has risen 34 basis points, and the curve has  steepened  This is consistent with the ebbing of worries about a policy-induced slowdown   The curve steepening was given a push by news, particularly the release of the minutes, of a  possible pause in the cycle     Page 2 breaks down the increase in ten-year yields  The top left panel graphs the real ten-  year yield  Real yields have risen about 40 basis points since early March and 14 basis points  since the last FOMC meeting  The top right panel graphs the ten-year breakeven rate (the  blue line) and five-year breakeven rate five years forward (the green line)  Both have risen  since early April with the five-year forward rate rising somewhat more  On a technical note,  these are straight breakeven rates without adjustments for carry  The picture of rising real  and rising breakeven rates is also visible internationally—at least for those countries with  inflation-linked bonds  The middle left panel graphs the change in the real yield this year for  France, the United Kingdom, and Japan  Real yields have risen in all three by varying  degrees  The middle right panel graphs the change in their breakeven rates  All three have  moved about 20 basis points so far this year—somewhat less than the 36 basis point increase  for the United States     Fueling the sentiment about inflation expectations has been the rise in commodity prices    The bottom left panel graphs selected metal prices indexed from January 1  Some of these  are at record highs or, in the case of gold, multidecade highs  The right panel graphs the  movement of energy prices so far this year  The one outlier is natural gas, which rose  sharply after Katrina but fell back when consumption did not meet forecasts because of an  unseasonably warm winter      Let us turn to page 3 and the other element that has garnered substantial attention  the   recent weakness of the dollar  After being stuck in a narrow $118 to $122 range, the euro  appreciated out of that range in mid-April as sentiment turned against the dollar, as shown in  the top left panel  This morning it was trading just below $128  Meanwhile, the yen  appreciated from ¥118 to the dollar in early April to about ¥11060 this morning  It’s   May 10, 2006 4 of 120    tempting to conclude that the current account deficit is finally exerting itself on the exchange  rate  Call me skeptical, but I find it hard to believe that markets awoke to the scale of the  imbalances only when reading the now-famous annex in the G7 communiqué  And yet that  there was a shift in sentiment can be felt if not visibly observed  One place this shift in  sentiment can be felt is in options markets  The middle left panel graphs one-month risk  reversals, where dollar puts are bid relative to dollar calls, especially against the yen, and  suggests that market participants are more concerned about further downside for the dollar   Another view into this phenomenon is through interest rate differentials  The middle right  panel graphs the euro–dollar exchange rate and the differential between December 2006  Eurodollar and Euribor futures  The two tracked pretty closely in 2005 and most of this year  but started to diverge in mid-April, suggesting that the effect of interest rate differentials on  the exchange rate had lessened and, hence, that something else was exerting greater force       So what are some possible explanations for the shift in sentiment?  At the macro level,   most forecasts have the United States slowing down in the second half while Japan and  Europe do not slow, even if in level terms the United States is still growing faster  Second,  the strong growth of the global economy is being interpreted by some in the leveraged  community as increasing the odds that emerging Asian countries in particular will allow a  rise in their currencies—and hence less dollar accumulation—in the period ahead  Some  countries are apparently struggling with sterilization of accumulated reserves  A third  explanation is the continued nagging fear that central banks will diversify their dollar  holdings  During much of April there were rumors that a large central bank—presumed to be  from the Middle East—was selling dollars  Whether that’s true or not, I don’t know   However, it is true that a central bank from Europe—the Swedish Riksbank—was in the  midst of lowering its dollar holdings, eliminating its yen holdings, and increasing holdings of  European and other currencies  The Swedes made their changes public on April 21   Whether other central banks will follow is an open question; but analysts have noted the  prisoner’s dilemma that the large holders of dollars face on this question of diversification,  and it is one the markets focus on intensely and are acutely sensitive to  Finally, the markets  noted the Treasury’s report on foreign holdings of US securities for the year through June  2005 and the unfavorable revisions it contained  This report corrects the estimations in the  monthly TIC data  Whereas the TIC data reported that private investors were the large  buyers in that twelve-month span, it now turns out that private demand was minimal and that  most of the buying was by official accounts       The bottom panel charts the appreciation against the dollar by a range of currencies in the   intermeeting period  Several of these are commodity based, but many are not  And even  some of the currencies I talked about last time that had been caught in the liquidation of carry  trades made strong comebacks  Yes, even the Icelandic krona, which fell another 10 percent  after your last meeting, has reversed course and, on balance, has risen slightly since March  28  I should note that the Canadian dollar is at its strongest level against the US dollar since  1977  Besides the positive terms-of-trade shock, the Canadians have both strong growth and  low inflation and something we don’t have  a current account surplus and an ongoing budget  surplus that is being used to pay down debt      May 10, 2006 5 of 120    Changing pace a bit, if you turn to page 4, the top panel graphs the evolution of required  operating balances since 2001 and the target fed funds rate  Required operating balances  (ROBs) have fallen sharply as the opportunity cost of holding demand deposits has risen   From a peak of about $23 billion, required balances have fallen to about $15 billion   Significant changes in the level of ROBs have been associated with changes in fed funds rate  volatility because lower levels of such balances give banks less scope for absorbing daily  shocks to their reserve holdings at the Fed  Meanwhile, a lower level of ROBs provides the  Desk with less scope to manage the funds rate by adjusting the daily reserves supplied  without forcing banks either to borrow at the discount window or to accumulate unwanted  excess reserves  So far the effect of the decline in required operating balances has been  muted, and we do have some experience in operating in such an environment from the last  time that required balances were at such levels in the late 1990s and the early part of this  decade     Finally, I want to inform the Committee that the Desk has just finished implementing a   new electronic trading system that we call FedTrade and through which we conduct open  market operations with the primary dealers  This system replaces a legacy mainframe system  that was inflexible and no longer suited our needs  The bottom panel lists some of  FedTrade’s main features     Mr Chairman, there were no foreign operations  I will need approval of domestic   operations      Well, as somebody said in another setting just the other day, risk premiums are   something we don’t know a lot about, and they are difficult to disentangle  I haven’t done the exercise,   but with energy prices rising, I don’t know that the carry effects have been huge    We would welcome that  It would make our life a bit easier    I don’t think so  Spence?    But those are transitional, operational hurdles    I can speak only for myself  I have worked on the presumption that we would set it,   as you started out, below the funds rate, so we would in effect be creating something of a corridor with   the primary credit rate on top and a deposit facility at the bottom  Now, whether that would be 1 percent   May 10, 2006 8 of 120    below, ½ percent, or some other number would be up to others to decide  But I think that’s the way that   I viewed it rather than paying it at the target    I’ve spoken about that in the past actually  There has been some seasonality  It has   happened before—that some seasonal moves upward have occurred in the first part of the year    Yes, usually in this part of the year  That relationship has not been stable, but one   has noticed that there has been that tendency    We looked at it a couple of years ago, and we noted it, but I think it was just too   unstable    We could look into it     Yes  The volume expansions are something we can probably get data on  I’m not   sure that doing so will answer the question that you would like answered, which is how much of the   price movement is linked to certain classes of participants    Very briefly, I circulated a memo that comes around at this time every year asking   you to vote to approve renewal of the swap lines to Canada and Mexico    It would raise it    Again, the three words that the market would be looking for are “further policy   firming”  Those are the three that they will be looking for and that will be taken as the signal of likely   May 10, 2006 105 of 120    action in June  Now, what follows actually creates a bit more uncertainty because it is not as direct as some   previous statements have been  So I think the probability goes up, but maybe not to 100 percent or to 80 or   90 percent  So I think Vince is in the right ballpark in his judgment  "
7713,2006-06-28,"1       Thank you, Mr Chairman  For the last several meetings I have  begun my comments by saying that this long period of low volatility and tight spreads  continued  Today I have to modify that  During this intermeeting period, some  markets were very volatile  But others were either calm or characterized by moderate  levels of volatility  Spreads remain tight and default rates low   In the first exhibit, the top panel graphs the MSCI equity indexes since May  2004—just before the US tightening cycle began  Equity markets in all regions  appreciated sharply, with emerging markets doing best  The US index (the black  line at bottom) underperformed  Not surprisingly, the high beta markets that  appreciated the most also fell the most  I’ll have more to say about some of the  specific markets later      The middle panel graphs the realized volatility since January 1 for the United   States, Europe, Japan, and emerging market sub-indexes  Volatility rose sharply,  especially outside the United States right after the May FOMC meeting  The reason  for the sudden shift in sentiment is not clear  Both institutional and retail investors  had reportedly allocated significant funds to emerging market equities in the past six  months and so may not have had much of a cushion to absorb May’s losses  These  investors were more likely to sell when the tide turned  Similarly, hedge funds that  mark to market and that report results to investors monthly also have less capacity to  sit on sinking positions  Whether leveraged or not, investors have been more worried   1 The materials used by Mr Kos are appended to this transcript (appendix 1)   June 28-29, 2006 3 of 177    about so-called crowded trades, which is code for widespread participation in  relatively illiquid markets where the exit door is pretty small  Emerging market  equities and commodities were probably the best examples of this phenomenon  A  variant explanation centers not so much on technical factors and positioning but  rather on the lagged effect of the withdrawal of so-called excess liquidity as central  banks worldwide tighten monetary policy  I’ll come back to that as well       As the top two graphs show, the US equity market has been less interesting than   some of its global counterparts, many of which have fallen by double digits over the  past six weeks  The S&P 500 in contrast has fallen about 6 percent since May 9  The  busy table at the bottom of the page lists those periods in which the S&P 500 has  fallen 10 percent or more since 1942  There have been twenty-nine such periods, or  roughly once every two or three years  Viewed historically, the recent price moves  are not unusual     To drill down a bit into emerging market equities, please turn to page 2  The top   panel graphs the performance of equity markets in Brazil, India, Mexico, Russia,  South Africa, Korea, and Turkey  The blue bars graph performance for the period  from January 2, 2006, to May 10  The red bars graph performance from May 11  through yesterday  The middle panel graphs, for the same countries, performance of  their currencies for the same periods  The charts seem to support this notion of strong  appetite for riskier assets earlier this year and then a sudden shift to reduce positions  in riskier markets  Of course, when volatility begins to rise, intermediaries such as  investment banks show an increase in value at risk that they wish to reduce  The  process of reducing that risk only reinforces the trend in the short run, and assets that  were thought to be uncorrelated suddenly start to move in unison     The bottom panel graphs metal prices from January  Like emerging market   equities, metal prices rose on perceived strong fundamentals  The momentum players  jumped on board and gave prices a boost  Prices peaked around mid-May, and as the  risk-reduction phase kicked in, prices came down, though they are still up for the  year  However, the risk-reduction story goes only so far  It is evident in specific and  fairly narrow segments  It is not evident, or is only modestly evident, in other  segments  The top right panel on page 3 graphs the MOVE index of implied  volatility on Treasury yields since January 2005  Implied volatility has remained at  very low levels despite the excitement elsewhere  In fact, as shown in the top left  panel, although the VIX spiked to about 23 percent in mid-May, it quickly came off  and is below its long-term average     Similarly, although credit spreads are mildly wider, as shown in the bottom three   panels, absolute levels remain generous and far below the levels observed last spring,  when General Motors’ announcement caused a sudden widening of spreads  The  bullish interpretation of the recent bout of volatility is that it has been limited to  narrow sets of asset classes and could be compared with last spring’s events, which  did not have spillover effects outside the areas of credit derivatives and convertible  arbitrage  This view suggests that those assets that appreciated “too far too fast”   June 28-29, 2006 4 of 177    needed to revert to some notion of fair value and that there is no reason for broader  effects  The bearish case argues that too many investors have more risk on their  books than they would like and will seek opportunities to sell into any rallies   According to this view, the movements in Iceland and New Zealand in March were  the precursor to May’s volatility in a broader set of markets, which may be a  precursor to subsequent price declines in more developed markets     The top panel of page 4 graphs the three-month deposit rates for the dollar (in red)   and for the euro (in blue), along with three-, six-, and nine-month forward rates since  April 1  With dollar forward rates essentially on top of each other, the markets are  probing to locate the point at which the Committee will pause from the meeting-by- meeting pattern of tightening  In contrast, the ECB is viewed as having further to go,  as seen by the wider spread between cash and forward rates  Indeed, in the past few  days ECB officials noted that the pace of tightening could be accelerated     The middle panel graphs the evolution of current account balances at the Bank of   Japan in blue and the overnight call rate in green  CABs came down from about  ¥30 trillion to the low teens over a two-month span  However, in recent weeks the  call rate has had sudden spikes toward the BOJ’s Lombard-style lending facility,  which is set at 10 basis points  In response, the BOJ added reserves  From a low of  about ¥10 trillion in early June, CABs have risen to about ¥15 trillion, compared with  required reserves of about ¥5 trillion to ¥6 trillion, and yet the call rate remains  stubbornly firm     The bottom panel graphs the Japanese government bond yield curve from three   months out to ten years as of yesterday and a year earlier  As shown by the green  line, a year ago the money market curve was essentially at zero, and all rates out to  two years were extremely low  Arguably the weight of all those reserves in the  system worked to push down more of the yield curve toward zero  Now, as those  reserves are being withdrawn, money market rates are no longer being held down  So  while the target call rate for the BOJ remains near zero, in reality conditions have  tightened up     Outside the G3, the story is similar  Worries about inflation are leading to modest   increases in rates  Among the countries whose central banks tightened policy during  the intermeeting period were Canada, Switzerland, Sweden, Turkey, South Africa,  Korea, Thailand, and India  Some, like Turkey, had fundamental and policy  challenges they were addressing  The linkage between monetary policy and asset  markets is difficult to define and measure  But those investors that take a more  bearish perspective cite the tightening of policy globally and the withdrawal of  liquidity as risk factors going forward     On page 5, the top panel graphs the two- and ten-year Treasury yields along with   the target fed funds rate (in green)  Yields had been hovering near the current funds  target but moved toward 525 percent as the expectation of a ¼ point move at this  meeting increased       June 28-29, 2006 5 of 177      The middle left panel graphs the ten-year breakeven inflation rate from TIPS and   the five-year rate five years forward  After rising in April, the breakeven rate came  off somewhat after the Chairman’s comments to the International Monetary  Conference and subsequent comments by Committee members  The middle right  panel graphs those same two rates over a longer time frame  Despite the attention  that markets have given the rise in breakevens earlier this year, broadly speaking  breakevens are very close to levels observed at the beginning of the tightening cycle  two years ago     The bottom panels graph the dollar’s exchange rate against the euro and yen     The dollar has appreciated against both  Although the broad fundamentals have not  changed, the dollar may have benefited from safe haven effects and an unwinding of  short dollar positions as hedge funds and others reduced risks in recent weeks     Finally, I want to say a few words about our recent experiences with check float,   especially given processing changes related to Check 21 (Check Clearing for the 21st  Century Act)  For the Desk, float tends to be a focus on Tuesdays largely because  these are peak processing days  Pronounced but episodic spikes in float began to  appear last October  The top panel on page 6 graphs the actual float (the gray bars)  and our forecast for float (the red dot)  As we have been told, the major contributing  factor to these behavior changes in float is a combination of hardware and software  problems that have appeared in the processing of Check 21 files  The challenge for  the Desk is to forecast float and adjust reserve provisions appropriately  At times in  recent months we have been surprised by high levels of float that we did not forecast   At other times we had the opposite surprise  We were told to expect float that did not  materialize  For reference, the middle panel graphs the same set of months in the  year-earlier period showing lower levels of float, lower volatility of float, and  important for us, less variation between the forecast and the actual     But the important question is whether we can trace float to higher levels of funds   volatility given the numerous other factors that can affect the supply of reserves  The  bottom panel tries to inform, if not fully answer, that question  The dots represent the  difference between the forecast and the actual float levels  The y axis graphs the  standard deviation of the funds rate on that date  We have arbitrarily drawn a line at  20 basis points to demarcate a high-volatility day  The blue dots represent  observation in the year-earlier period  They tend to show small forecast errors, and  those dates were not associated with high levels of volatility  The red dots cover the  more recent period, and they show six observations with very large forecast errors, of  which four were associated with high levels of fed funds volatility  Thus, one  shouldn’t exaggerate the effect of Check 21 on Desk operations, but at the same time  the effect should not minimized either     Mr Chairman, there were no foreign operations in the period  I will need a vote   to approve domestic operations     June 28-29, 2006 6 of 177     Yes, I think one of the interesting points about this period is that very   question  Some of the high-risk assets that had been bid up are where we have the   most-pronounced price moves, and that does perhaps suggest that positioning is a bigger part of   the story because bond markets were relatively tame not just in the United States but also in   other, overseas bond markets  So something of a risk adjustment seems to have happened  I   think the interesting question is why, but it’s very, very hard to discern that  I, at least, tended to   minimize the effect that uncertainty about monetary policy itself has had in causing the volatility   in emerging market equities  Certainly if one takes the opposite view, then one has some   explaining to do in terms of the previous couple of years when a tightening cycle was occurring    At different times there was uncertainty about the pace and extent of the tightening, and yet those   markets continued to rally despite that uncertainty     It’s reasonable that all of those factors would have had some influence  I   suppose another factor would be the extent to which some market participants may have seen not   only positioning but also future weakness from the global tightening that is occurring, especially   in the industrial countries but also in China—that such tightening will at some point affect the   demand for commodities and for resources  Some of those positions and adjustments may have   been fundamentally based  If one had to explain the scale of the price moves, that would   probably be a secondary factor   June 28-29, 2006 7 of 177      From a market perspective, that is the most interesting question  I recall an   exchange that President Fisher and I had a couple of meetings ago, when we were talking about   the zloty and the Icelandic krona and whether that was sort of a precursor, perhaps the beginning   of a longer phase of a downscaling of risk  There might be something to be said for that  We   were in a lengthy period when investors were reaching for yield, and I’m not sure that two   months is going to cleanse the system     I don’t want to speculate  I don’t think my guess would be any better than   anybody else’s  Another view is that the markets that had been priced furthest from fair value   are the ones that are adjusting, and a case can be made that, once they equilibrate, we shouldn’t   have spillover effects  Now it’s hard to know which way the scales will tip, but good cases can   be made on both sides   "
7739,2006-08-08,"1  Thank you, Mr Chairman  At your last meeting I focused on the  higher level of volatility that was concentrated in specific and fairly narrow asset  classes, particularly emerging market currencies and equities  In the intermeeting  period, volatility declined in those asset classes while staying low in a broader set of  asset markets such as fixed income and the major currency pairs  Meanwhile, the  market’s focus turned even more acutely to the prospect that the Committee would  take a pass in raising rates at this meeting, even as many other central banks were  tightening policy further   On the first page of the handout, the top panel graphs the historical volatility of  the MSCI equity indexes for the United States, Europe, Japan, and emerging markets   These volatilities rose after your May meeting and peaked around the time of your  June meeting but have fallen back in recent weeks  Emerging market equity  volatilities (the blue line) declined sharply from more than 35 percent to below  20 percent On balance, the value of emerging market equities and currencies  rebounded somewhat after the selloff in May and June  The middle left panel graphs  the VIX index Although a tad higher than the very low levels observed earlier this  year, the VIX is well off its highs and below its long-term historical average   Similarly, the middle right panel graphs an index of volatility in Treasury yields   This index has been very tame for several quarters despite the widely reported  uncertainty about the future direction of monetary policy  Rounding out this benign  picture is the currency market, as reflected in the bottom panels, where volatility  briefly ticked up in the spring but since then has quickly fallen to earlier levels   Even though volatilities on balance trended lower since the last meeting, trading  volumes—as measured by the primary electronic brokering services in fixed-income  and currency markets—declined more than can be explained by the summer  doldrums  Some market participants suggest that speculators reduced risk in May and  early June and are now sitting on their hands In that scenario, risk appetite is still  ebbing even if that is not showing up in wider spreads or higher volatilities   If investors and speculators are being more cautious, one reason for the caution  might be related to the tightening of monetary conditions globally  The table on  page 2 summarizes for a sample of central banks the net changes in their main policy   1 The materials used by Mr Kos are appended to this transcript (appendix 1)   August 8, 2006 3 of 158                        rates so far in 2006 Last Thursday the Bank of England surprised the market by  increasing rates 25 basis points, while the European Central Bank ratified  expectations by also tightening 25 basis points  Of particular note among central  banks that have recently raised interest rates is the Bank of Japan, which on July 14  moved the target overnight call rate from 0 to 25 basis points, as shown in the bottom  panel The move had been well telegraphed  Nevertheless, the aggregate current  account balance at the BOJ is still higher than required reserves of 5 trillion to  6 trillion yen The main reason seems to be that Japan Post continues to hold high  and variable balances, thus bumping up the aggregate      While the backdrop globally is toward tighter monetary conditions, investors in  the United States have been looking forward to a plateauing of short-term interest  rates or even a decline over the medium term as housing and other indicators have  weakened The prospect of a pause in the tightening cycle reportedly helped support  equity prices, shown in the top panel on page 3, which inched higher as this meeting  approached Corporate profits on the S&P 500 for Q2 have risen 19 percent, higher  than analysts’ forecasts In fact, profits have risen by double digits seventeen quarters  in a row With the prospect of a pause and strong profits, one might wonder why the  price action in equities has been on the sloppy side  The most common answer is that  the outlook that companies are providing is cautious, perhaps suggesting that the  economy is softening more quickly than previously forecast  Continuing on that  theme, the middle panel graphs the two-year and ten-year Treasury yields and the  target fed funds rate Two-year and ten-year Treasury yields are down about 30 basis  points, to about 49 percent, and roughly 35 basis points below the funds rate  Such  an inversion is common during an easing cycle but very rare during a tightening  cycle As shown in the bottom panel, breakeven rates have barely budged since the  last FOMC meeting  The entire decline in nominal yields represents a fall in real  rates Taken at face value, this suggests that investors may see lower real returns  ahead, perhaps reflecting a bearish view of the economy  However, that bearishness  on the economy is not spilling over to an expectation that inflation will necessarily  fall back   The top panel on page 4 graphs the Libor fixing rate for three-month deposits (the  thick red line) and three-, six-, and nine-month forward rate agreements  In recent  days the nine-month forward traded through the cash rate, suggesting—if one takes  this literally—that the markets are beginning to contemplate an easing of policy in  early 2007 This pattern is similar but not identical to what we observed in 2000, as  shown in the middle panel  After the Committee raised the funds rate in May 2000—  in what turned out to be the last move in the cycle—forward rates began to decline  even though the Committee continued with an asymmetric bias to tighten  By  September the forward rates had pierced cash rates  Another similarity is seen with  Eurodollar futures calendar spreads  The bottom left panel graphs the difference  between the December 2007 and the December 2006 Eurodollar contracts  Late last  year that spread turned negative, implying that market participants expected interest  rates to be lower at the end of 2007 than at the end of 2006  After reversing  somewhat, the spread turned sharply downward in recent months  The bottom right   August 8, 2006 4 of 158                           panel graphs the spread between the December 2001 and the December 2000   contracts from late 1999 through September 2000  The spread turned negative only   with anecdotal reports of a sharp drop in orders around September, which was   roughly three months after the last tightening       Shifting gears, I want to mention briefly the transition on July 20 to the new PSR   (payment system risk) policy  The first major P&I (principal and interest) date under   the new rules was July 25 Fannie Mae had to fund $40 billion in MBS P&I   payments (net of payments to itself), and the transition went very smoothly  One of   the tools that GSEs developed to help fund their accounts on a timely basis on large   P&I dates are term and overnight early returns of fed funds sales  Under these   contracts, fed funds must be returned to them earlier than the end-of-day deadline   associated with standard fed funds sales, usually between 930 am and 11 am    Rates on overnight early-return fed funds have traded roughly 1 to 3 basis points   below standard fed funds Based on incomplete sampling, about 15 percent of the   volume of brokered fed funds reported to the Desk and used to calculate the daily   effective rate has been early returns  The Desk is collecting and monitoring early-  return fed funds data from the major brokers to assess how this market develops and   how early-return fed funds may affect the overall fed funds market    There were no foreign operations in the period, and I will need a vote to approve   domestic operations   "
7762,2006-09-20,"1  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Among market participants, September  has a reputation for being difficult on portfolios, for sudden bursts of volatility that  lead to risk aversion and wider spreads, and for sometimes spectacular blowups in the  speculative community The ERM crisis in 1992, Long-Term Capital Management in  1998, and the aftermath of the terrorist attacks in 2001 are three of the more notable  examples   Until Monday, this year looked different  Spreads were and they continue to be  narrow Volatility has generally been low, with the notable exception of energy   Yields are benign, and equity prices, if anything, have been rising in recent weeks      1 The materials used by Mr Kos are appended to this transcript (appendix 1)   September 20, 2006 3 of 132                  The massive loss disclosed on Monday by a large hedge fund has had remarkably,  almost suspiciously, little spillover effects thus far  But with political crises suddenly  popping up in Hungary and Thailand, it may suggest that risks in some of these  smaller, less-liquid market sectors such as emerging markets and commodities have  risen Overnight the Thai baht was slightly weaker, Thai banks and markets were  closed, and currencies and equity markets of neighboring countries were, on balance,  only marginally weaker  Meanwhile in the G3, markets have generally been calm,  though recent moves suggest a more sober outlook for growth than had been priced in  earlier this summer      On page 1 of your handout, the top panel graphs the three-month Eurodollar  deposit rate in black and the same rate three, six, and nine months forward in red  since the beginning of the year  In recent weeks, forward rates traded through the  cash rate as assorted reports—especially housing and inflation data—convinced  market participants that (1) the Committee would continue to hold the target funds  rate steady for sometime longer and (2) the probability of an ease early next year was  far more likely than a resumption of the tightening cycle  That view was seemingly  shared by investors in the Treasury market  As shown in the middle panel, two-year  and ten-year yields have been gently declining since the June meeting  The ten-year  yield currently trades about 50 basis points below the target funds rate—the widest  negative spread since March 2001 Meanwhile, various measures of the yield curve  have now been mildly inverted for several weeks—perhaps also reflecting the  market’s view that a slowdown is in the offing  The bottom panel graphs the straight  ten-year breakeven rate and the five-year rate five years forward  Both declined  modestly since the last meeting, helped by inflation readings that did not repeat this  spring’s elevated numbers and also by the moderation of commodity prices in general  and energy prices in particular   The view that growth may be less robust was reflected in overseas markets as  well On page 2, the top panel graphs the calendar spread for interest rate futures  between the December 2007 and the December 2006 contracts for the G5 economies  since January 1 In recent weeks that spread has, on balance, been declining slightly  as markets have taken out tightenings that had been priced in for coming quarters   Even in Europe, where the ECB has been talking tough, market participants are  reassessing what effect a US slowdown would have on the ECB’s trajectory  The  middle panel graphs ten-year sovereign yields for the United States, Canada, the  United Kingdom, and, as a proxy for the euro area, France  Those yields rose during  the first six months of the year and have retreated more recently  While there is a  story for each economy, the most recent sets of data have been slightly less favorable,  and forecasts for the next few quarters have been trimmed back  Meanwhile, as  shown by the middle right panel, US and Canadian breakevens have declined  slightly In contrast, breakeven rates in the United Kingdom and France have risen  somewhat  Indeed, the ECB has repeatedly voiced concerns about rising headline  inflation and the persistence of that trend   September 20, 2006 4 of 132                           Japan is a somewhat special case  Through midyear, forecasts for Japanese  growth had been rising Deflation was ebbing, loan growth was rising, and the BoJ  opportunistically exited its quantitative easing policy in March and then exited the  zero interest rate policy in mid-July  However, as shown in the bottom left panel,  yields could not get past 2 percent and then began to decline as data such as  machinery orders disappointed investors and led them to question how fast the BoJ  would raise interest rates Then on August 24, Japan released revisions to the CPI,  which showed that inflation had been lower than previously reported  Markets  quickly pushed back the timing of future call rate increases despite the BoJ’s  assertions that the revisions did not change its basic outlook  Japan does have a  nascent inflation-linked Japanese government bond market  The bottom right panel  graphs the breakeven, which has fallen from about 1 percent to about 60 basis points   As shown in the top panel of page 3, the entire JGB curve has shifted down since the  last FOMC meeting  One factor that has continued to work in favor of Japan’s export  sector has been the exchange rate  The yen’s nominal value has been falling against  most currencies in recent weeks and hit its lowest level against the euro since the  single currency’s launch The middle panel takes a much longer perspective on the  yen; it graphs the real effective exchange rate since the beginning of the floating rate  era The real effective rate has been falling steadily since 2000 and is at its lowest  level in more than 20 years despite the chronic trade and current account surpluses  that Japan has generated in the interim   The bottom two panels on page 3 reflect the recent volatility in commodity prices,  with metal prices on the bottom left and energy prices on the bottom right  Metal  prices continue to fluctuate but show some signs of having topped out for the time  being Energy prices, however, have made a round trip from where they were at the  beginning of the year  The retracing of prices has fed discussions about whether the  so-called speculative premium in energy prices has now been taken out  Certainly  there are signs that speculators have been exiting some of these positions  Those  signs are most visible for natural gas, which is something of an outlier in the bottom  right Last week’s sharp decline in prices may have been related to the liquidation of  positions by the large hedge fund that was closing out positions  If the speculative  money is being chased out, for natural gas but also for other products, then perhaps  energy prices now better reflect underlying fundamentals   Finally, I want to come back briefly to a topic I mentioned at the last meeting  related to the nascent development of an early-return fed funds market  As  background, fed funds contracts do not generally dictate the timing of the return leg   So, not surprisingly, most fed funds are returned to the lender late in the day  The  GSEs have been interested in developing an early-return facility to meet the principal  and interest payment timetable given the new PSR (payment system risk) rules  The  data are sparse, and our conclusions are tentative, but I wanted to give you a brief  update On page 4, the blue bar in the top panel graphs daily volumes of regular  overnight fed funds contracts The smaller green bar represents overnight early- return volumes  The black line shows the percentage of overall volumes represented  by early returns The time series starts on August 8, which is when data first became   September 20, 2006 5 of 132                                                available to us This series does not include term trades with early-return provisions    In general, early returns make up about 10 percent of overall volumes  The middle   panel graphs the effective rate for those trades with early-return provisions in red    The blue line is the 900 am rate  Early-return trades are transacted in midmorning   and thus show a strong correlation with the 900 am rate, generally trading about 2   basis points below regular funds  Finally, as shown in the bottom panel, early-return   trades have far less volatility The reason for the lower volatility is primarily that   these trades are executed in midmorning rather than during the late afternoon rush,   when the funds rate often can move with large swings  Getting back to the GSEs,   they in fact have not been active users of overnight early-return fed funds  They   have, however, used term fed funds of up to a month maturity with early-return   provisions timed to mature on the date of their large P&I dates  For term rates, unlike   for overnight trades, there is no rate concession    Mr Chairman, there were no foreign exchange operations for the period  I will  need a vote to approve domestic operations   Yes, it does   Yes, it does affect it Now, the effect that it has is fairly small—I think it’s   less than 1 basis point overall   That’s correct—it could  Again, despite forecasts by some traders and   brokers in the market, so far that has not happened  In part, it’s because the GSEs have been   using term fed funds more than overnight funds for cost reasons   I haven’t made that precise comparison, but in general I would say that where   you started out was perhaps the most interesting part, which is that the Committee cares about   the 24-hour rate Now, that’s something that I’m not aware has actually ever been articulated   before What has been articulated to the Desk has been the overnight rate, whether that period is   24 hours, 16 hours, or some other time  We have thought about the question of whether the early   return should be excluded, and so far we have been analyzing it by tracking the data and trying to   understand what effect it has But if the Committee feels that it should be the 24-hour rate rather   than something else, then that consideration will have to be taken up separately   Just to be clear, right now there isn’t an intraday rate  This is an overnight   rate, and the way that it works out, it really is roughly a 24-hour rate because most of this trading   takes place in early morning to midmorning   Yes, most of the trading occurs between 800 and 930 in the morning  It’s   an early morning market for trading, and it’s an early morning market for returns  So it actually   does end up being roughly a 24-hour market  It’s just that the trading takes place at a different   part of the day   September 20, 2006 7 of 132                                                 No, I don’t think it’s a risk premium  It just reflects the 1 or 2 basis point   differential for the bank It just changes their procedures, so it adds to their costs in terms of   returning funds earlier and not having additional funds to use for making other payments    Therefore, the bank may hit against its cap earlier in the day  So there is an economic cost, but it   doesn’t seem to be a huge one   The bank that’s returning the funds   At the short end, it’s going to be affected by energy, right?      Yes Energy prices will tend to have a bigger effect during the first two or   three years of a TIPS curve   I would not be so bold as to go that far   I was willing to go that far  [Laughter]   That’s a great question It’s not clear  It seems to be a wide range of   institutions I don’t know that we’ve seen a distinct pattern yet  Again, the sizes are pretty small   as a percentage of the overall market  I’m not quite sure why it’s being used or whether the   banks are using it There must be some cash-management aspect for which some banks are   September 20, 2006 10 of 132                               using it; and perhaps some customers, for whatever reason, are interested in getting funds back   early But I think this is one thing that we need to understand better and one thing that we’ll be   looking at in the coming months  It’s a good question  I wish I had a good answer for you   Well, the early return has to be returned early in the morning  Also, we know   anecdotally, and the data seem to support it, that most of that trading takes place roughly 24   hours before delivery Now that’s a characterization of a very small segment of the market  To   have a true 24-hour market, you would have to presume that 1000 am trades are returned by   1000 am the next day and 1100 am trades by 1100 am the next day  That’s a level of   exactness that I’m not sure can be replicated—or monitored, for that matter   There’s probably some short-term effect  I think there may be something to   what you suggest, but my own assertion is that it would probably have a short-term effect on   prices Whether that’s a matter of days or weeks or maybe longer, it’s hard to put a time   dimension on it  I was trying to make the point in my remarks, especially about natural gas, that   most people just assume that last week’s price movements in natural gas—I believe a very sharp   drop occurred on Thursday—were related to the closeout of some of these positions from the one   hedge fund, and the presumption is that other hedge funds that made money in energy earlier this   year were also getting out of some of these trades  So that would support what you were saying    Now, whether that element has an effect on prices for a week or two weeks is very hard to know,   but it probably does have some effect  I think Karen is probably right in the sense that over the   long term there are inventory effects, and at some point, those speculative effects get washed out  "
7787,2006-10-24,"1                                                    1 The materials used by Mr Kos are appended to this transcript (appendix 1)     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I will be referring to the charts that were  distributed, and I will divide my comments into two parts  First, a slimmed-down  report on market developments in the intermeeting period, and then I’ll touch on the   October 24-25, 2006 3 of 203    highlights of the memo I circulated last week regarding management of  the System  Open Market Account     The short intermeeting period was relatively calm  Hence, volatility remains low   and credit spreads tight, while some equity indexes rose to multiyear highs   Occasional rumors that a large hedge fund lost significant amounts of money betting  that yields would rise did not dent the underlying sense of confidence or relative  tranquility  On the first page of the handout, the top panel graphs the three-month  deposit rate and the same rate three, nine, and fifteen months forward  The  longer-dated forwards—as reflected by the solid red line—have declined more than  75 basis points from early summer to early October as market participants priced in  an easing of policy for early 2007  Those expectations were heightened as GDP  forecasts for the third quarter were consistently trimmed downward  But having  pushed forward rates too far, market participants were poorly positioned for the  reversal in past few weeks after a surprising Philadelphia Fed survey and comments  by Governor Kohn and other Committee members were interpreted as suggesting that  policy would not likely be eased on the trajectory that markets had built in  Longer-dated forward rates still anticipate an ease late next year, but the magnitude of  that easing has been scaled back  Longer-term Treasury yields show a similar  pattern, as indicated in the middle panel  The yield curve remains inverted, though  less than it was a month ago  With credit spreads remaining tight and credit quality  favorable, there has been less agitation in markets that the inverted curve is sending a  recessionary signal  Meanwhile, breakeven inflation rates from TIPS paint a  favorable picture, especially at short maturities given the fall in energy prices  As  shown in the bottom panel, the five-year breakeven continued to narrow, to about  210 percent, and has now contracted more than 50 basis points in less than three  months  Longer-term maturities, which are less affected by short-run energy price  moves, had less of a decline, as shown by the ten-year maturity  Meanwhile the  five-year rate five years forward—the red line—is little changed from the last FOMC  meeting      The prospect that policy rates may have peaked plus falling oil prices supported   equity prices and trumped adverse factors such as evidence that economic growth had  slowed  As shown in the top left panel on page 2, the Dow Jones Industrial Average  finally pierced the 12,000 level to a new record high  Other major indexes, such as  the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq—as shown in the top right panel—also rose, though  they remain some distance from their record highs  One feature of the equity markets  since the tightening cycle began has been the outperformance of so-called value  stocks, as shown in the middle left panel When economic growth is strong, value  stocks—represented by the larger cyclical companies—tend to do better because their  earnings are stimulated by the strong economy  But since early August, coincident  with the pause in policy tightening, the growth stocks have begun to outperform  One  interpretation is that, with economic growth slowing, the effect is biggest on cyclical  companies, whose margins compress, whereas growth stocks are better able to  maintain margins  Another interpretation is that the equity markets are also pricing in   October 24-25, 2006 4 of 203    a peak in the tightening cycle on the theory that the Committee will not tighten into a  slowing economy     Finally, this generally benign picture is also reflected in the foreign exchange   market  The bottom panel graphs the dollar against a range of currencies since the  last FOMC meeting  None of these currencies moved more than 2 percent in either  direction, and most are clustered within a band of 1 percent  For what it’s worth, the  currencies that appreciated tended to be higher-yielding currencies  This pattern  tends to support anecdotal reports that, in the absence of directional opportunities,  carry trades continue to attract speculative flows     Switching gears somewhat, I want to summarize the main points of the memo that   I sent to the Committee last week about the domestic portfolio guidelines  The last  time that we systematically looked at the portfolio was in 1996  We looked at it again  in 2000 and 2001 in the context of considering alternative assets given that the  Treasury market was shrinking and the Committee was faced with the prospect of  acquiring private-sector assets  The table on the right side of page 3 provides a recent  snapshot of the System Open Market Account  Given the amount of time that has  elapsed and the changed environment, we thought it would be timely to refresh our  analysis and assess whether the principles we had been using to manage the SOMA  portfolio still made sense  Indeed, we concluded that the four principles identified  previously—safety, liquidity, market neutrality, and return—remain appropriate given  the objectives for SOMA       Safety is the bedrock of a central bank balance sheet, and its importance is   uncontroversial  The Committee has achieved the goals embedded in this principle  by maintaining a portfolio of Treasury securities with no credit risk  For years  SOMA also held smaller amounts of agency and GSE (government-sponsored  enterprise) securities, but these were allowed to roll off  The last GSE security in  SOMA matured in 2003     Somewhat more complicated is liquidity  The Committee has discussed liquidity   at various times in the past two decades  In practical terms, the issue is how fast the  Desk can offset a reserve-adding event, such as a large discount window loan or a  large foreign exchange intervention  Our view is that the critical period for such  operations is the short run  Longer-term sterilizations will likely be slow and can be  managed in the normal course of reserve management operations  As the memo  describes—so I will not go into detail—our conclusion is that it is prudent to add a  second limit or guideline of $80 billion of liquid assets over a three-month period  while keeping the current $208 billion limit over a twelve-month period  In practice,  as shown in the bottom chart on page 3, SOMA maintains liquidity from maturing  bills, coupons, and repos far beyond these minimums—a feature we will continue   Additionally, the Desk has other tools if needed in extremis, as shown on the left side   These include the ability to conduct reverse repos and, as a last resort, outright sales      October 24-25, 2006 5 of 203    The third principle is market neutrality, if you would turn to the next page  This  is also somewhat complicated  This issue is, in many ways, simpler now than it was  six years ago, when the stock of Treasuries was declining  At that time, we adopted a  per issue limit structure, which is summarized in the top right panel of page 4  In  short, per issue limits of 35 percent were adopted for bills, which gradually declined  to 15 percent for bonds  The blue bars represent SOMA’s holdings for each specific  security  This response was reasonable given the environment in 2000  However, the  limit structure has, in recent years, created situations in which we have had forced  redemptions to stay within these limits, which in turn forces us to make additional  outright purchases to offset those maturing assets  We are therefore proposing to  revert to an informal flat limit structure of 35 percent for all maturities  I should note  that this change would, in reality, have a very limited effect on the portfolio given  other restrictions that we have, and which I’ll get to later  At the margin it might  allow us to reduce our huge reliance on holdings at the short end of the curve  We are  somewhat underrepresented in the middle of the curve     An associated issue I wanted to raise is SOMA’s auction participation  Our   participation can be highly variable  There are two factors that we cannot control   First, the Treasury’s auction calendar is itself variable and dependent on fiscal needs   Second, the Desk cannot participate in auctions unless it has securities maturing that  very day  The middle right panel shows this variability  The yellow box highlights  SOMA’s anticipated participation for the three-year note in the next three refundings   We anticipate taking down $61 billion in November, $15 billion in February, and  then $60 billion in May  Why is this important given that we are an add-on in the  auctions?  The Fed’s holdings are part of the floating supply, which can influence the  way an issue trades in the repo market  This can, I hope, be seen in the bottom panel   Our participation in the five-year note went from quarterly participation to monthly  when the Treasury shifted from a mid-month settlement to a month-end settlement   SOMA’s participation is the green bar  The change allowed us to smooth out our  participation because we had large amounts of two-year notes maturing at month end   The black line represents the specialness spread in the repo market for each issue   Note that this spread has been much smaller in recent months, when SOMA’s  holdings have been both steady and available to be lent  Our preference for steady  and consistent auction participation is, however, constrained by restrictions on how  we invest maturing proceeds and, of course, by changes the Treasury makes to the  auction calendar  In short, we are likely to continue to wrestle with this principle for  some time     The last principle very briefly is return  In our view, this principle should not   drive the way SOMA is managed, given that our profits are derived from interest on  our Treasury holdings and in turn flow back to the Treasury       Mr Chairman, there were no foreign operations during this period, and I will need   a vote to approve domestic operations  Helen and I would be happy to answer any  questions      October 24-25, 2006 6 of 203   "
7810,2006-12-12,"  I’m not retiring, though  [Laughter]    Thank you    1                                                    1 Material used by Mr Kos is appended to this transcript (appendix 1)     Thank you very much, Mr Chairman  Thank you for those words   The most striking aspect of the intermeeting period was the conviction that markets  developed about a benign 2007 outlook both for the economy and for monetary  policy  Until Friday’s employment report, most of the incoming data were viewed as   December 12, 2006 3 of 134         being weaker than expected  This encouraged market participants to price in lower  policy rates for the first half of 2007     If you would turn to the handout, the top panel on page 1 graphs the Eurodollar   futures strip out to 2010 as of the last FOMC meeting, in blue, and as of last Friday,  in red  Near-term contracts declined less than 20 basis points, whereas longer-term  contracts fell more than 30 basis points  Until Friday’s employment report, future  short-term rates were even lower, as the markets had come to expect that the weaker  housing, auto, and manufacturing data would persist and lead to a first-quarter easing  of policy by the Committee  Interestingly, the markets shrugged off the Chairman’s  speech on November 28 and other comments by Committee members that focused  more on inflation risks  Indeed, in this period the markets were focused more on  data—especially data that seemed to validate a view that the economy was slowing— than on speeches      Longer-term yields also declined  The middle panel graphs the target fed funds   rate, the green line, and two-year and ten-year Treasury yields since January 2006   Both two-year and ten-year Treasury yields tracked the upward path of the target fed  funds rate but began to fall almost to the day that the target peaked  Ten-year yields  have fallen another ¼ percent since the last meeting and are now about 75 basis  points below the target fed funds rate  This is the largest inversion of this spread  since February 2001, when that easing cycle began  As shown in the bottom panel,  breakeven inflation rates are little changed and, if anything, have tended to rise at  shorter tenures  Most of the decline in nominal rates was mirrored by a fall in real  rates as market participants factored in lower activity in the period ahead       Despite reminders in Committee members’ speeches about upside inflation risks,   market participants increasingly focused on the probability that policy would be eased  in the months ahead  This can be seen in the top panel on page 2, which graphs the  calendar spread between the March 2008 and the March 2007 Eurodollar futures  contracts  Back in May these two contracts were on top of each other, but then they  gradually inverted, implying that rates were expected to be lower in March 2008 than  in March 2007  Market participants anecdotally refer to past episodes when the  Committee has eased policy several months after its last tightening as weakness in  output began to show through  Two episodes are frequently cited  late 2000 and  early 1995  The middle panel graphs the calendar spread between the March 2002  and March 2001 contracts  That relationship began to invert about five months after  the last tightening, in May 2000  The negative inversion peaked at about 50 basis  points in late 2000, and the Committee eased policy in early 2001—the first of a long  series of cuts  The mid-1990s episode is somewhat different in that the yield curve  and Eurodollar calendar spreads flattened but never convincingly inverted, as shown  in the bottom panel  Five months after the last tightening in February 1995 came an  ease in July  In short, at least as measured by futures spreads, the expectation for an  upcoming ease appears to be even stronger than in the previous two episodes        December 12, 2006 4 of 134         Equity markets have been undaunted by the signs of weakness that the bond  market is responding to  As shown in the two top panels on page 3, the major equity  indexes have had strong rallies since midyear  The prospect of lower interest rates  has trumped the possible slowdown in earnings growth that might emanate from a  weaker economy  Indeed even a weaker dollar has not dented confidence of either  equity or fixed-income investors  If anything, a gradually falling dollar is seen as a  positive for large internationally oriented stocks such as those in the Dow or S&P  indexes       After being confined to a narrow range, the dollar depreciated rapidly against   most major currencies in late November and early December  As shown in the  middle left panel, the euro rose above $132 while sterling looked poised to threaten  the $2 level before consolidating near $196  Sterling is at its highest value versus the  dollar in more than fourteen years  The dollar’s movements against the yen have  been more range-bound as capital flows out of Japan have limited the yen’s  appreciation  The recent lurch in the dollar reflects improved sentiment toward  European economies  It also followed some comments by a Chinese official around  Thanksgiving that were interpreted as conveying worries about continued  accumulation of dollars among Asian central banks  Reports of diversification by  other central banks have fed this rumor mill  Yesterday a prominent former member  of this Committee weighed in by suggesting that the dollar had further to go on the  downside and that central banks should not concentrate their reserves in one currency   Surveys of investors and speculative traders suggest that short dollar positions are at  something of an extreme by historical standards  Such negative sentiment is also  borne out by risk reversals, as shown in the bottom right, which show that dollar puts  are consistently bid relative to dollar calls and have become more so recently  Of  course, once sentiment gets extreme, the market becomes susceptible to sharp  setbacks  Indeed, exactly two years ago, the euro appreciated dramatically into year- end peaking at $136, only to have all those gains fully reversed in the early months  of 2005       As shown on page 4, volatilities continue to trade at very low levels  The top   panel graphs the one-month implied volatility for the two major dollar currency pairs   Since April/May, volatilities have fallen to new lows  Similarly, in the middle panel,  the VIX (Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index) has fallen back to levels  last seen a decade ago  In the Treasury markets, implied volatility is at or below  levels seen in the summer of 1998  With volatilities low and expectations of a benign  environment persisting, dealers continue to report interest in carry trades and sales of  structured products with embedded options       One symptom of the benign financial environment that analysts point to is the   higher level of mergers and acquisitions activity in general and leveraged buyouts in  particular  The top panel on page 5 graphs the rise of LBOs since their nadir in 1992   The middle panel deconstructs the high-yield bond market according to how the  proceeds were used  The red bar—representing proceeds being used to finance M&A  and LBOs—has been rising in the past three years  Also rising has been the value of   December 12, 2006 5 of 134         bonds rated CCC or less at the time of issuance  In short, the market has been more  than willing to finance lower-rated paper for purposes other than traditional  investment in plant and equipment  It is fair to say that risks are rising     But the development graphed in the bottom panel is in some ways more   interesting  This is the rise of the so-called leveraged-loan market, which exceeds  amounts raised in the high-yield bond market, represented by the yellow line  As  shown by the blue bars, the portion of such loans originated by or syndicated to  nonbank investors such as pension funds or hedge funds has risen and now exceeds  the amount taken down by the banks  Private equity sponsors are increasingly turning  to this source of funding to finance acquisitions     Meanwhile private equity deals are also evolving  The size has obviously grown,   but two other aspects are worth noting  First, many deals no longer involve  acquisitions of underperforming companies  In many cases the acquired companies  are performing reasonably well but are viewed as being able to operate with higher  levels of debt  It’s not clear what value added the private equity buyer is providing in  such cases  Second, LBOs are no longer being done solely in industries with  predictable cash flows  Several deals were recently announced in volatile businesses  such as semiconductors  The poster child for such deals is Freescale Semiconductor   The company was just acquired for $176 billion  Cash flow barely covers interest  payments, and the margin for error is very small for a company in a notoriously  volatile industry  Cynics argue that tomorrow’s nonperforming loans are being  originated as we speak     Mr Chairman, I am happy to say, once again, that there were no foreign   operations in the period  I will need a vote to approve domestic operations     Yes, I think that’s correct     If I could answer that question, I’d be rich by now  [Laughter]  It’s hard to   know  I don’t pretend that I can give you a precise answer  Certainly, the markets have been in   this benign situation for some time, and we’ve been struggling with this question for several   December 12, 2006 6 of 134         years—why the term premium has been so low, why spreads have been so low, and why   volatilities have been so low for this extended period  I just think that the longer the situation   persists, the longer the risks rise—or at least that’s what the worry is  But you all know that     That’s a great question  It has been asserted, without proof, that some of the   major central banks moved into euros very aggressively in December 2004  I don’t know   whether that’s true, but there is some evidence to suggest that it might have been the case and   that in somewhat thinner markets it had a pronounced effect in December, which then got   reversed in the following January or February  It is hard to know exactly why that would have   happened  If dealers see those flows, you will tend to get speculators who will follow it or try to   front run it  I can’t say whether that’s happening now, though     The cynic in me would say that a lot of money has been allocated into the   credit space  A lot of money has gone into things like credit-default and credit-derivative   products  Investors want exposure to credit to enhance yield  They are getting that exposure   more and more through derivatives  You need supply to feed those structures, and so, as it were,   December 12, 2006 7 of 134         demand to some degree is creating the supply  That’s one version of events  A second version is   that the covenants are easier to negotiate and somewhat easier in general or less stringent than   what you might get in the bond market  Third, it might just be cheaper to go out and structure   these types of borrowings with a small group of lenders as opposed to going out and actually   marketing a bond issue     I think that’s probably another factor, which would not be mutually exclusive   with the other explanations  It would just be yet another one     I think that’s right  I think the median view would be that they’re looking for   some acknowledgement of the soft data that were mentioned earlier   "
