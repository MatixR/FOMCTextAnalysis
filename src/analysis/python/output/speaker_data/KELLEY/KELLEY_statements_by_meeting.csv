35,1987-08-18," Thank you, Mr Chairman I'd like to spend just a second on a little different perspective There has been a very good staff forecast and a lot of very good comment on it But it might be worthwhile to put our attention just a little on whether or not there may be some very fundamental long-range changes running underneath the surface of the world economy and our economy If there's an analogy there, it may be what happens in the sea you have the Gulf stream running up the East Coast from south to north; the storms come and go and calms come and go; and the tide shifts back and forth with the Gulf stream still running north up the coast It kind of dominates everything in the long run I wonder if there's any of that effect going on in the world economy I see several things out there that could be fundamentally deflationary in the long term That's not to quarrel with the kind of forecast that we're seeing here over the forecast period But it seems to me that if we can avoid falling into the protectionist sinkhole--and maybe we won't--that there is a super abundance of pretty capable labor across the world that's waiting to produce, and it's currently grossly underemployed And there's capital that's mobile enough to get there to set up factories and economic capabilities, and do whatever is necessary to employ that still quite low-cost labor And we're going to be competing with that labor In a great many commodity areas there is a worldwide abundance of capacity Absent political events, there's plenty of energy for the next few years at least The world is coming into a surplus of farm commodity production on an aggregate basis; there are lots of metals, and so forth The third factor may be that it probably was inflationary to increase the enormous levels of international debt that we now are struggling with, but it probably is going to be deflationary to try and service that debt, now that we have it There's a lot of pressure on a lot of economies to produce in order to earn foreign exchange to try to service their debt So there are some things out there which seem to me to possibly be exerting a [unintelligible] deflationary effect And, while I see the pressures that we have over the forecast period, and I would not quarrel with those, I think that maybe these long-run deflationary effects under the surface might damp that, as they play through in the inflation numbers   I wouldn't be surprised "
36,1987-08-18," Thank you, Mr Chairman I would prefer staying with ""B"", largely for the reasons I outlined a few minutes ago I think that the underlying trends are going to tend to damp both the inflation that is showing up and also, perhaps, the robustness of the expansion that we're in However, I do recognize the short-term tendencies toward some inflationary movement here So, I would also like to see the language be asymmetric in the direction of tightening   I would stay with ""B"", the $500 million   The tilt is worth $25 to $50 million dollars "
89,1987-09-22," Thank you, Mr Chairman It seems to me, as I've listened to the comments made around the table this morning, that there's a very, very strong centralizing character to the projections that have been made by everyone--the Greenbook and the District forecasts I think that they constitute, in their aggregate wisdom, a very responsible and good forecast; and I accept it I would like to make this comment the projections arise, as they must, from conventional economic analysis and historical experience; and I would like to suggest that maybe we should be a little open and alert to the possibility that there are some unconventional and untraditional things going on Standing back from the trees and looking at the forest, I observe that we are about to end the fifth year of what has been called a recovery I'm not sure how long you call something a recovery, but this one is going to be five years old in another couple of months; and I note that at the end of the fifth year the economy is, in fact, accelerating and inflation is declining by most measures Inflation is projected to increase for some very good reasons, but right now you've got an economy that is accelerating and inflation that is decreasing--which is pretty unconventional Industrial production is going up at an accelerating rate; unemployment has been dropping very strongly and is probably now somewhere near its natural rate And yet, at the same time, we are seeing very, very small increases in the unit costs of production and a very flat producer price index In fact, last month, the PPI was zero That seems to be a little unconventional and untraditional On the trade balance and the J curve, we are not getting the effects that would have been expected They are stretching out; we still think they are going to be there, but that has been behaving unconventionally Governor Johnson noted a few moments ago the fact that we have taken $60 billion of fiscal stimulus out of the economy, and yet none out of the trade deficit And I think a lot of people would have been surprised ahead of time that those two things could have coexisted Incidentally, as the economy is accelerating its growth rate, that is occurring while $60 billion of fiscal stimulus is, in fact, coming out of the economy  I would suggest the possibility that inflation may behave in an untraditional way also Maybe that also will stretch out and not accelerate I ask myself What possibility is there that could occur? I see several possibilities They are all soft, and I would hate to    9/22/87  have to try to defend any of them But, for one thing, I suspect that we may be undermeasuring our productivity increase We may be doing better than we know I've talked to Mike Prell and some others about this some I think we have a much higher level of mobility in this economy that is helping us deal with imbalances as they show up, rather than just suffer from them For instance, instead of just accepting higher wage costs in Boston, we are moving plants to the rural regions of New England where wage costs are lower That's mobility A lot of bankers who are out of business in Texas are going to places where the banking system is stronger That's mobility There's a lot of that going on and that didn't used to be there I think we may be in an era of very intense competition from several different respects For one, the US is back I think that our industry is waking up and beginning to compete Governor Angell spoke about that a few minutes ago and I agree with him Also, there are many more serious competitors in the world economy than just a few years ago They are serious and they are fierce, and I think that is one thing that is going to tend to impede the advance of inflation I spoke at the last meeting of this group about what seem to me to be basic long-running, underlying deflationary tendencies in the world economy I won't go back over that ground but I do think they are still there All this is to say that I would not quarrel with the projection that we have over the next five quarters, but I'd like to pique a little interest maybe--on the part of some of the research directors around here, and some others, who are far better at this sort of analysis than I am--to see whether or not there are some discontinuities going on that could be favorable discontinuities And, I think we should be open to those sorts of possibilities and alert to them Meanwhile, I think we definitely have to be ready to deal with these inflationary expectations and not let that genie out of the bottle unnecessarily Thank you, sir "
90,1987-09-22," Mr Chairman, I think that in the short run the risks that we have here in the inflation area are more expectations  -37-    9/22/87  than anything else, and we should maintain a posture against that, and move against that I think the economy can handle the slight tightening that going on to $600 million in borrowing would imply So I favor ""B"" with $600 million, and would like to see symmetrical language   Both ""somewhat"" and both ""would""   Sure "
146,1987-11-03," Very briefly, Mr Chairman, I think most things have been said, but just to get on the record here While I agree with Bob Boykin and others that the situation is fragile, particularly in the Eleventh District, which I am still pretty close to, I share Bob Heller's view that there is a lot of room for being optimistic about a light at the end of the tunnel The risks here, I think, are two primarily Number one, as Ed Boehne and others have said, no more shocks is the key If we can avoid that, I think things will be enormously optimistic I also agree with Governor Seger that it is very important that we--and I mean we in the corporate sense--do whatever we can to avoid a recession, which is in nobody's interest at a time like this So, those are the two things that I would like to keep a weather eye to have no more shocks and avoid a recession to  -26-    11/3/87  the extent that we can do that I would like to comment briefly on Jerry Corrigan's concern about the high level of debt, which has been one of my favorite themes also I think that ties together with Frank Morris' comment about the pressure for market share that people feel The creation of all of this debt has put people in a situation where there is enormous pressure to produce; that's not only true for foreign economies and their pressure to maintain market share here but it is also true domestically People who are in debt need to keep their jobs So perhaps if there is a good side to all of this debt creation, it lies in the fact that it puts tremendous pressure on everybody to be productive and, thus, it should have a long-term downward drag on the inflationary concerns that we all have "
147,1987-11-03," Mr Chairman, I'm very much a mainstreamer here And I have nothing to add in the way of new reasons from what has been said around the table I would go with Variant I because I think we need to be seen as being on the accommodating and concerned side here, with asymmetric language in the direction of ease I favor alternative ""B"", and I would cut the announced funds rate range back to 4 to 8 percent, again to indicate tilting in the direction of ease   I like the Corrigan language   No, that's an important difference "
199,1988-03-29," Mr Chairman, as the one at the table who has the least background in this, I've been enormously instructed by this whole exercise   I don't want to get too explicit about what the instruction was, but I have appreciated it I came to this discussion without any firm convictions one way or the other, so it has been very interesting for me to listen to the arguments on both sides Where I'm coming down is to stay where we are, largely on the arguments that surround the flexibility that this procedure gives us Also, I like the way that market forces have at least an opportunity to show through on this procedure more clearly than they would if we went to the other route So, I'm comfortable with staying where we are "
200,1988-03-29," You are, but go ahead [Laughter]   Mr Chairman, there seems to be heavy sentiment around the table that the risks are increasing on the upside and I share that But I feel constrained to make a couple of points in the other direction I think we should keep in mind, going back to what Frank said earlier this morning, that GNP forecasts are subject to a plus or minus 1-1/2 percentage point error He was concerned about the plus 1-1/2, but let's not completely forget the fact that the minus 1-1/2 is a potential also And there are a number of things out there that could point toward weakness some of the rates of increase are slowing down; industrial production and retail sales are not exciting; you have potentially serious financial conditions in the Southwest I'm not 100 percent convinced that we are out of the woods with regard to the lagged effects of the slow growth of the monetary aggregates in 1987 Capital expenditures look like they are going to be up, but new orders are down right now So, there is some cause to keep our eyes open, looking in the rear view mirror if you will, looking at the downside  In the area of inflation, if I may quote you from this morning, Mr Chairman, let's stay with the numbers Bob Heller was looking at how inflation has been flowing in the last few months If you look at the PPI particularly, but also the CPI, on a month-to- month basis against the same month a year ago, both of the indexes have fallen every month for the last six months--and that includes February, the latest figures So, while inflation certainly has the potential to rise--I see that the same as everybody else here--it absolutely is not here yet And I don't think it is unreasonable to expect, particularly with a 48 percent fourth-quarter GNP, that if inflation were going to show up, it would have begun to do so by now So that makes me wonder if we aren't looking at some things that could be fundamentally different in that area than we're used to I don't know that I believe that, or that it is true, but one begins to wonder In short, Mr Chairman, I think there is concern about the possible downside risks and perhaps some time to take continuing readings on the inflation side; so, I would be somewhat slow to jump on the assumption that things are going to get away from us on the upside "
233,1988-05-17," Mr Chairman, when Bob Forrestal spoke a few minutes ago I wish that I had been the next one on the list and I could have simply said ""me too"" I think that it's a time to wait, given the evidence to date and the two recent moves, which I agree were not insignificant I would be in favor of ""B"" and keeping the same borrowing for now, with asymmetrical language But, as Bob    5/17/88  suggested, I'd be comfortable with going an additional $100 million now with symmetrical language   Six; and six are voters   Just say the intermeeting period   It means you recognize what you saw   Tom, let me ask you to comment on something a bit more mundane and workaday I think how we employ a device such as this has a lot to do with whether or not it's useful in the first place And I wonder how we could reliably use it without so diluting it that it becomes punchless As I look back four quarters, and also include the current quarter, I notice that the first month in four out of the five quarters grossly exceeds the parameters on the upside Then are those--   Well, I have a chart here that the Board's staff puts out on annualized growth rates on a month-by-month basis; it  -30-    5/17/88  doesn't go back very far but it does go back a year; and it includes April, so I'm taking the liberty of including this quarter For some reason--and maybe there is a reason--[monetary growth in] the first month of each quarter, four out of the five times, is way over the parameter On both sides of the first months, there are much lower figures And I ask myself what we would do if we [were operating under] your proposal It says that no quarter would be permitted either to exceed the upper limit or fall below the lower limit Well, in four of the last five quarters--taking the liberty of including this one--you have a huge number in the first month, which kind of comes out of the blue, because it follows two much lower months, and then in turn, is followed by two much lower months And I ask myself what would we be liable to do if we sat down at this table when we just got a brand new figure that was way over [the upper limit] in the light of the pattern we have seen here in the last year or so How could we protect ourselves against that phenomenon?   Yes   If you look at the first month, it's like the kind of thing that Peter deals with every day, with regard to the maintenance period For instance, let's take October the October number was 11 percent on an annualized basis It was followed by November at 69 percent and December at 31 percent; it averages out fine But if we had sat down here and looked at that 11 percent in October we might have been moved to do something precipitous   April was 123 percent   That wasn't meant as a criticism, just as a problem you have to work through if it's going to be useful "
324,1988-09-20, Second 
325,1988-09-20," Mike, if you would for just a second speculate on the other side of the suggested policy recommendation for taking federal funds up to 9-1/2 and 10 percent--the possibility that that might induce a recession somewhere along the line What would be the implications of a recession let's say in late 1989 or early 1990 if you began to see the federal deficit burgeoning and so forth? What would be the broad brush of a scenario of a recession, given the larger picture of where we are on the deficit and the new president in place trying to get new policies established and so forth?   I wanted to very briefly express something very similar to what Governor Heller just expressed, and I won't repeat it I'll simply say I'm coming from the same place that he is I had expressed before my concern about what could happen in the 1989-90 time scenario If the black box kind of thing begins to happen and we  -22-    9/20/88  slide over into a recession before we have a chance to adjust further the fiscal/monetary mix and the trade/consumption mix and so forth, I'll continue to have those concerns I have a very low level of enthusiasm for running a high risk of inducing a recession in the near future Hopefully, we do have some slowing going on and to quote Ed Boehne from a few minutes ago, I think that this is not a time to rush to judgment So I would prefer to watch and wait a little bit and see how things go "
326,1988-09-20, Include me in   That's where we can get a free lunch 
384,1988-11-01, So move 
385,1988-11-01," Well, I don't have anything to add either, but I will! I hear a lot of consensus around the table as to where we are now, and a lot of well-taken warnings as to what could occur in the future And those warnings seem to be cutting in a variety of different ways What that tells me is that we simply must do what we'll do anyway, and that is be very watchful But it's a little bit too early at this point to reach any strong convictions as to what should be done, or which way things are going Now, like Peter Sternlight earlier in the morning when he was giving his report, I thought it was a good theme for the day and that is ""steady as she goes"" "
386,1988-11-01," Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation, but I am sympathetic with those who expressed some interest in going to symmetric language both on the basis of what might be happening in the economy and also watching very carefully what happens to the aggregates in the upcoming period But for now, I fully support your recommendation "
445,1989-03-28, Second   Second   Second   Second 
446,1989-03-28," Thank you, Mr Chairman I'm sensing that the theme of this conversation is that it's time for a pause, and I certainly share that Consequently, I can comfortably support your suggestion But I would like to repeat what Governor Johnson said a little earlier when we were touching on the matter of lags, and that is Have we put into place already enough [restraint] that will get us what we want? It's in that sense that at this moment I'm in no hurry to tighten While I would agree that we certainly don't want to be perceived as backing off in any way--that caveat having been given--I really personally would prefer symmetric language "
509,1989-05-16," Governor Johnson just covered exactly the points I wanted to raise, Mr Chairman, so I pass Thank you   May I come back again?   Don, could you explain that? From where we are right now on M2, given the prospect of perhaps a 3/4 of a percentage point higher funds rate, it's a little unclear to me how we'll wind up at a substantially higher M2 for the year than we're running now   Am I hearing you say that part of that depends on this 3/4 of a percentage point increase coming late in the year?   If it comes late in the year it clearly won't   Okay, thank you   Mr Chairman, I agree with the thrust of most of what I'm hearing said around here But at the risk of becoming a bit of a Cassandra of the FOMC, which I certainly don't want to do, I think that we're probably getting to the point where it should be on the table for us to keep a weather eye out to the possibility of a substantially worse result than anyone has heretofore addressed Governor Angell and others have talked about the aggregates and their slowness; that has been going on now for two years with a little hiatus in the winter a year ago when we had the stock market problem It has probably been more severe most recently than it has at any other time over that period With that as a background, we now see an economy that is slowing to an extent that I think surprises all of us a little, compared to where we were at the last meeting or even compared to the Greenbook that was written hardly a week ago How far and how fast can this go? I'm not sure that we can be very confident that we're not beginning to see the first of some downside momentum here I'm not predicting that; that's not where I am, but I do think that we've reached the point where we need to keep a weather eye out for that Governor Heller points out that the prospects for exports are getting a little less rosy It's hard to see housing and construction coming back I don't think there will be any fiscal stimulus; we may actually get some reduction in the deficit but I certainly wouldn't anticipate any further stimulus from that I hope that fixed investment will hold up; I will keep my fingers crossed on that one That puts it all back on the head of the consumer and we all know the consumer can be very fickle Again, I would emphasize that that's not my forecast and it's certainly not my hope But I do think that it's worthwhile for us to begin to keep that on the table as a part of the consideration "
510,1989-05-16," Mr Chairman, I strongly support your suggestion In the light of the surprisingly weakening economy that we see now, I think that is eminently called for On the borrowings, Governor Johnson noted that we've been running pretty much at $565 million for some time now, so I could support either $500 million with leeway up $65 million or $600 million with leeway down $35 million "
565,1989-08-22, So move  MRJOHNSON Second 
566,1989-08-22," Thank you, Mr Chairman I think we have had our usual excellent comments around the table this morning I have very little to add to those But it might be useful to take just a minute or two to look at the larger scene, if I may My sense is that there are a number of very important and very major issues that are at or reaching the stage where there could be some major breakthroughs or major breakdowns, whichever that may turn out to be The condition of the United States economy is a very, very important factor in every one of them and something that this Committee might well consider when  -35-    8/22/89  it looks at policy I will just run through a few of them in no special order On the domestic side, we now have a bill in the thrift area and we're moving into the resolution stage We all know it's going to cost an awful lot of money at the best But it seems to me that the cost could just go completely out of sight if we get into a recession scenario, particularly given some of the other real estate conditions that have been alluded to here this morning I think we all would probably agree that the fiscal budget deficit requires resolution, and it seems to me that somehow or another we are managing to approach a breakthrough there I hope it's going to happen; there has been some progress, and it's in the balance right now But one thing is certain, it seems to me, and that is that if we fall into a recession any resolution in the near term on the fiscal budget just goes into a cocked hat completely I'm not sure that much has been mentioned here before on this war on drugs But I think it has now gotten to the point where it has become a national economic issue Indeed, I think it's tearing into the whole social [fabric] of the country We're groping for a way to deal with that, but it's going to take money And that's going to be all new money; it has to come from somewhere Perhaps even more importantly, it needs to have the focus of our population and of our political leadership If we get into a recession scenario, that will probably pre-empt almost everything else and the war on drugs might well go onto the back burner--and in the process get worse for however long it takes to get it back on the front burner again And I think that would be devastating  Internationally, we have the great agony of the situation of the LDC debt We have managed, hopefully, to get a solution in Mexico--and very quickly I should extend my congratulations to all concerned But on the situation in the Philippines there's a long way to go If we fall into a recession scenario I wonder if the banks aren't going to turn out to be even more difficult to deal with than they already have been in those further negotiations On an even broader conceptual basis, it seems to me that it's fairly clear around the world now that everyone agrees that communism has failed and capitalism is the way to go We are past the stage where that had to played out but we're entering a new stage that may be even trickier And that is How do those communist countries get from where they've been to where they want to go? This country is a model for that and I think that we're going to be called upon to be of some help in various ways Poland is probably in the lead right now, but there are any number of others trying to get on that track And I think that it's important that we be able to demonstrate a steadfast strength in our economy as that begins to play out A bit more specifically, it seems to me that there's an opportunity now at long last to have a really serious disarmament situation develop We have made some progress on that; conditions seem to be right But I think that we ought to realize that the USSR is still the same type of country it was before; and if they perceive weakness on the part of the United States, economically or otherwise, or some divergence of our attention, they would be as [unintelligible] as they ever have been And we might well find ourselves in a situation where excessive defense spending has to keep on rolling So, for all these reasons I think that we have to be very careful as we assess this economy and try to calibrate it, to the extent that we can do that We have to be very careful that we don't push our luck too hard because there is a great deal at stake in this era that we're entering into right now Thank you  -36-    8/22/89 "
567,1989-08-22," Mr Chairman, I favor ""B"" with asymmetric language I think we're much more likely in the intermeeting period to desire to ease than to tighten and I think the directive should reflect that Furthermore, even if one assesses the risks as symmetric or close to symmetric, I think the consequences of an error on the down side are far more [severe] than on the up side So, for both of those reasons I would prefer asymmetric language; but I could support symmetric   The way we're going--   I would appreciate having Norm run through the rest of that sentence, if he would "
628,1989-10-03, Second 
629,1989-10-03," Approximately the same magnitude   Mr Chairman, I have adopted a self-imposed task of delivering jeremiads from time-to-time about things that are going on that are somewhat outside the economy and present a backdrop against which we need to apply policy I'm not going to repeat that this morning, but I would just like to get on the table the fact that there are a host of very important challenges and problems in the economy that are very urgent and on which, in many cases, we seem to have an opportunity to make some substantial progress They are not economic in many cases; but in virtually every case they are substantially impacted by economic events and economic conditions As I look at the economy, I'm close to where I think Governor Johnson and President Black and others are in that it's hard for me to see where meaningful strength can come from and relatively easy to see where weakness can come from And that gives me some pause I would suggest that we ought to be rather sensitive to emerging weakness and be quite careful that we don't induce something through policy that would turn out to be counterproductive to society in a larger sense "
630,1989-10-03," Mr Chairman, I support alternative B with asymmetric language toward ease That's where we are now and I see no reason to change it I concur with Governor LaWare that the risks on the dollar are certainly there; you articulated them beautifully But I also believe that that's going to have to be played out on a day-by- day basis It's a little hard to know how that's going to go I think that you and the Committee can and will adequately take that into account as events unfold Meanwhile, I think the potential for weakness in the economy and the consequences of it--if we get it and it gets away from us--are severe I may be a cockeyed optimist but I think there's a possibility that we will continue to get better inflation results than expected As a consequence, it seems to me that your proposal is appropriate   You'd get a pretty darn good argument if you did! "
686,1989-11-14," Did you say national disaster?  -19-    11/14/89   Mr Chairman, I think one of the times when you have to be careful is when you get what you want, which is pretty much what has happened here It's a time to be careful because you have to develop a pretty careful view of what it is that you want to do next We have the slowing that we looked for and that does leave us with the questions that Governor Johnson raised a little while ago How slow is it going to get? How slow do we want it to get? And a more practical question is What are the best ways to influence the process properly? To me, this quest for price stability that we're all on and believe in is playing itself out against the background of some pretty powerful and large forces The inflationary forces we pretty well understand We have an overemployed and overconsuming economy and all that that represents But I'm haunted by what seem to be some underlying disinflationary forces that I wish I understood better than I do They seem to me to be having a powerful influence, perhaps, on the favorable results we've been getting over the last year on inflation Given the very full economy that we've got, inflation did not take on a life of its own to the extent that we might have expected it to a year ago It seemed to stop what upward momentum it had before there was really much of an apparent slowdown in the economy I wonder what underlies that? The major force that I can see is that there seems to be a tremendous amount of very low cost capacity in a wide variety of industries and commodities around the world And capital is doing a very efficient job of seeking that out and exploiting it and holding costs down I think the downsizing of GNP that you've spoken of very eloquently, Mr Chairman, is a factor It seems to me that we may be entering an era where we're servicing debt more than creating debt, which is deflationary I don't know what all those forces are, if I can use that word, but they seem to be manifested in this profit squeeze that we have going on now--with costs being pushed up and the inability to pass that on through prices That would be inflationary But it can't go on forever; something has got to give I certainly hope it's on the cost side But maybe a key conceptual approach from a policy standpoint is that we really don't want either side to win too terribly conclusively If inflation becomes dominant, we know what that scenario would be and that's unacceptable In the slowdown scenario that we have here, it may be time to begin to think a bit  -23-    11/14/89  about the power of those underlying deflationary forces--I guess I should say disinflationary at this point; they could become deflationary and lead us into some really serious problems that might be avoidable I don't know that that's something that we have to deal with right now but I think it's something that we should keep in the back of our minds and strive to understand or get a better grasp on-- at least better than I have Thank you   Along with mine "
687,1989-11-14," Mr Chairman, I support your suggestion of ""B"" asymmetric I think that weakness is far more apparent than strength and I think we need to be very careful with it here ""B"" is where we  -32-    11/14/89  are now and I would certainly hate to appear, however implicitly and indirectly, to be taking a stronger stance than we presently have I think it's extremely likely that any change that we would make in the intermeeting period would be to the accommodative side and that we should reflect that in the directive I also do not think that that precludes -he possibility that we can continue to make some small progress on inflation, as we have done in recent months and quarters "
746,1990-03-27, Second   Moved   Second 
747,1990-03-27," I would never, particularly coming from somebody who [was a banker] for 35 years! Mr Chairman, we always are looking for one more piece of data; that goes on forever But I am struck this time more than usual by the tentativeness of the data that we're looking at and the tentativeness of the forecast that we're able to make I hear it from the staff and I hear it going around the table here this morning in both the area of the real economy and in inflation expectations What's going on in the economy now is to some degree--and we don't know to what degree--the snapback from strikes and from storms and from the whipsawing in the auto industry Some of the industries that are showing some strength, like housing, have big seasonals at this time of the year And it's just really hard to tell how much of what is going on is sustainable and is real underlying strength I also share John's and others' concerns about what we may be in for in terms of the extent of the credit crunch and what the results of that could be  On the inflation front, the forecast is that what we have seen in the last several months is going to unwind to some degree I've been very disappointed, as I think everybody else has, in the numbers we've seen the last several months The expectation is that that's going to unwind to some degree, but by how much? We're going to have to see about that Meanwhile, as Governor Johnson pointed out, the PPI really is not validating that bad result that we've seen in the CPI and in the deflators So, I go back to what Bob Parry said a little earlier in the morning that what we need to do is to maintain moderate growth I agree with that I'm not sure what it's going to take to do that, on balance, with the other objectives that we have And like Gary Stern, I'm a little concerned that we not overreact to two or three months' worth of numbers and wind up whipsawing the economy I certainly share the disappointment that I hear everyone expressing; I agree 100 percent about the last few months and I share the impatience that goes along with that But given all that we cannot be sure of at this moment, I'm pretty cautious about what policy ought to do "
748,1990-03-27," Mr Chairman, I certainly support your recommendation I think that it would be premature, based on the tentativeness of the data, for us to move as yet The decision is obviously between moving a bit in the direction of tightness or staying where we are And I would suggest that we're getting a little tightening through whatever degree of credit crunch is going on out there, and I think there's at least some Also, unless the G-7 does something to turn it around, my personal bet would be that for awhile at least we're going to see a rising dollar We certainly have it in the yen and I would bet that on balance we're going to get it in the trade-weighted calculation generally So, I would enthusiastically support your recommendation "
805,1990-05-15, Second 
806,1990-05-15," Well, Mr Chairman, when Mike finished his presentation a little while ago he made the remark that there are a lot of jokers still in the deck to be turned over I certainly agree with that But when you're playing a hand of cards there are those things that you know and those things that remain to be seen If we look at the things that we know, they don't look that bad Obviously, as the cards turn over, things could change a lot But we know, looking at interest rates, that we lowered the federal funds rate in December and interest rates have been up ever since then We have had some tightening done for us by the market Along with that, the aggregates have now slowed down a lot I don't want to prejudge or put words in Don's mouth--he hasn't made his presentation yet--but I suspect he thinks they're likely to speed back up But if they keep doing what they're doing now, then we're going to have a pretty slow rate of growth in the aggregates in 1990 Looking at the gross national product, the best guess is that its growth is now running around 2 percent and the two preceding quarters before that were 11 percent and 21 percent That's clearly slow; it could reaccelerate There has been talk around this table that at a 2 percent growth rate we could make slow progress, but nevertheless progress, on inflation If you look at inflation as measured by the CPI, we had an appalling first quarter but the two quarters before that were both under 4 percent; and I think the increase is probably slowing down substantially from that bad first quarter now  John talked about the credit crunch I think everybody would agree that there's something going on out there and we don't know what effect it's liable to have Nevertheless, there is some constraint and it could be substantial So, the things that we know, taken all- in-all, suggest that the state of the world is not terribly unsatisfactory I think our policy pretty much has done what we desired it to do; it's too early to say that it has been ineffective in making some progress on the core rate of inflation Core inflation could certainly change on the up side and, if it does, we undoubtedly will have to react But I think that's far from sure As a consequence, for now ""steady-as-you-go"" makes sense to me "
807,1990-05-15," ""B"" symmetric, please sir "
849,1990-08-21, Second 
850,1990-08-21," Mr Chairman, I'll be brief because my observations are very much in the mainstream of much of what has been said this morning In the area of inflation, pre-Iraq I think the news was already disappointing in that we really had made very little progress And now post-Iraq, we have an oil shock that is a virtual cinch to pick inflation up substantially So, I believe we do have a higher inflation outlook There is some concern that it might be substantially higher; that's a very clear and unequivocal threat In the area of real economic activity, I think pre-Iraq we have been getting pretty much what we had asked for--maybe a little on the soft side of that, but no real nose dive that was in any way perceptible And today, we have even more softness in prospect as a result of the oil shock So, the recent events are certainly not a plus and they certainly add to the risk and to the uncertainty But at least there is not yet much evidence that the economy is headed for the tank So, we do have an exacerbated inflationary situation and I think there is a clear need that that be minimized in a way that is most sensible to the rest of the economy and its progress Economic activity per the Greenbook may still be okay; I hope we get the Greenbook outlook and I think that probably would be okay  One question that I ask myself is If we did try to help the economy through easing, would it work? Would the medicine turn out to be as bad as the disease is in the first place? I'm not sure; perhaps some percentage thereof I'm not sure what would happen to long rates in that event I'm not sure what would happen to the dollar or the inflation rate And I'm not even very sure whether we would get the response we would be looking for from the consumer and on the investment side if we did that "
851,1990-08-21," Mr Chairman, I fully support your recommendation for ""B"" asymmetric toward ease, but I'm not as sure in my own mind that we really are locked into an eventual ease I think we may be surprised with the strength of the economy I also think that if we do contemplate ease, we're going to have to assess that very carefully to make sure that it is efficacious if we do ease "
908,1990-10-02," Mr Chairman, let me focus for just a moment on the budget deal that was struck this past weekend It seems to me that the basic dilemma we have been struggling with for months now has been intensifying recently; even before the oil shock, the economy was having some problems We have a perception that we are going to weaken substantially, largely driven by the oil situation But even before that I was disappointed in the level of economic activity--in the second quarter, for instance In the case of the financial system, we know there is a lot of pressure there and a great deal of credit stringency in the banking system that is playing back into the real economy Taken by themselves, these kinds of factors would push one in the direction of easing On the other hand, the inflation situation seems to look worse, again driven by the oil situation But even before that occurred there was precious little progress being made; maybe there was some deterioration So, there's a concern that [higher prices] are becoming embedded, which would lead one in the direction of firming  So, what we needed was a way to break out of the impasse And we now have a fiscal deal I imagine everybody would define the ideal fiscal deal differently, but this one I'm sure is not it I would hope that it's a new genre in the shabby history of budget deals; I would hope that this one is going to turn out to be firmer and to have less smoke and mirrors in it than those we've had in the past We don't know that much about it yet, but it looks that way I've been trying to find more reports on the teeth that may be in the enforcement part of this and I haven't found very much yet But there is some evidence that there are teeth in it and that's encouraging It is a multiyear commitment, which I think we all felt was very important And I think it has a good configuration to it it's about the right size early on and then grows as it goes down the line Could it be another snow job? Oh, sure it could! We could turn out to be as disappointed as we've been in the past But if it works, I don't think it needs to be all that it is cracked up to be in order for it to do a lot for us It could go far toward restoring our fiscal health; it could help the saving rate a lot It would by definition, I guess, help the saving rate a lot It should help investment a lot, which I think is the absolute key to the future of this country's economy In the area of reducing inflation, it would seem to me that there is the possibility of more progress available here than in anything that we could do at this point through monetary policy by cooling excess demand and providing relative strength to the dollar In general, we've all been talking about the malaise in attitude that we have around the country and I think it could go a long way to [reversing] that Again, I don't think it has to be as good as it's touted to be in order to be highly beneficial If it's not passed, we're quite likely to be due for a very painful trip through the wringer If that should occur, I think the Fed is probably just going to have to look to the long-term best interests of the country and kind of let the short term fall out as it may But if  -33-    10/2/90  it's passed, it can only help--and perhaps can help a great deal The question is How much? Keeping in mind the fact that we're still going to have very large deficits to be dealt with for the next couple of years at the minimum, I think that if it's passed, we should be looking for appropriate ways to support it "
909,1990-10-02," I support your suggestion, Mr Chairman "
971,1990-11-13," I'm glad you amended your question to say 1/4   Mr Chairman, I agree that the two options that have been mentioned most here are the two best ones either to do nothing or to delete the sentence It is an anachronism now; it has been an anachronism for a long time I don't see any compulsion to do anything about it right now, given the fragilities that we're all intensely aware of and have been discussing and given the fact that the Fed is in many ways at the center of the scrutiny and the concern about the fragilities I've heard no hue and cry on the part of anybody to do anything about this issue I would suggest that in this environment we leave it alone, although I could support deleting it if we were going to do anything at all   That's why you leave it alone "
972,1990-11-13," Clearly a regional view   That's where they learned how to do it  SPEAKER(?) Texas railroad commission!   It's a zip code   Well, Mr Chairman, by late in the day when it's your turn to speak, you always run the risk that by then somebody already has expressed your view And David just expressed mine As a consequence, I'll try not to be redundant I've been increasingly concerned in recent weeks about the specific composition of what's going on here We have been going through a series of rolling recessions in this economy for a decade I guess, and I would argue that on balance it's been a very positive experience Industries and indeed all regions have had an opportunity to go through a planned decline, to restructure, and to come out of it stronger And they've been doing it against a background of overall strength so that it has been able to be done rather quickly Although it's never any fun while you're in it, at least it's about as good a process as you could expect and it's rather healthy But we have two sectors going now that seem to me to be rather unique, and they are very interrelated and very interactive And, of course, those two are the real estate sector, where we are grossly overbuilt, and the financial institutions David just gave us a good [overview] on that and I won't repeat it But it seems to me that these two in decline together have the prospect of having a materially different effect on the economy than maybe almost any other two sectors that one can think of because of all the leverage they exercise on the rest of the economy First of all, they are felt everywhere and are not just in a specific constrained region or constrained industry; it's a drag across the board Secondly, there is the wealth effect on confidence  -36-    11/13/90  and on people that has to have some effect on buying decisions And perhaps it will come to have an effect on debt servicing But it's obviously essential to the growth of every industry; and there's enormous leverage when credit gets tight, as we all know Also, these two situations feed on each other It's going to be interesting to see how that process exhausts itself The asset quality of banks is being dragged down by real estate; on the other hand, you can't work through the real estate recession because the lack of credit is pulling down the ability of real estate to be moved and cleared out I don't know where else that could occur where we have that kind of interaction We've seen automobiles and agriculture going into the tank and they were not terribly interactive Energy and textiles were going into the tank and they were not terribly interactive But these two are And taken in tandem I worry that there's the potential for very serious mischief I would hope that we're going to watch that very closely and perhaps take out a little insurance against the possibility that these are the two that could get away from us on the down side "
973,1990-11-13," I support it, Mr Chairman   We ought to call all the Fed watchers right there "
1034,1990-12-18," Well, Mr Chairman, I guess I'm the last leaf on the bush and there's certainly very little left to be said about current conditions, as Governor LaWare just remarked But I would like to try to resurrect a perspective that I first offered, probably a little prematurely, a year or so ago as to the underlying longer- term thrust of what's going on here It seems to me that what we may be seeing is the first downturn in what may be a rather powerful and long-lived deflationary era--a sea change, if you will I think there's considerable evidence underlying that On a worldwide basis almost all commodities are abundant food, materials, heaven knows in this country built space, and labor Capital can seek out low cost labor and is mobile enough to get there and put production in place on a low-cost basis It seems that monetary policy has been under tight control for some time; there's not too much of a problem in sight there Hopefully, fiscal policy is turning around Maybe the most important thing on an economy-wide basis in this country is that I think we've gone from an era of creating debt, which was inflationary, to servicing debt, which is deflationary And if there's anything to all of this thesis, I think it can explain a lot of the financial problems and a lot of the real estate problems that we see And it may be manifesting itself in this long decline that we're going through in corporate profits, where firms are being squeezed between the last of the upward thrust of cost pressures and the inability to pass that through in the form of prices I don't think this is a done deal There are a lot of things--monetary, economic, political, sociological--that could change this and abort it But if this is true, it has implications for how we view everything If this is true, we may have a stickier short-term situation--a little slower in the near term to come out of the recession, but a far more positive longer-term outlook as time goes along and we do come out The converse of that would be if we're in another episode of what we've seen before in the postwar era If that turns out to be true, we could wind up with a quick, weak recovery and then fall back rather soon and be very disappointed But if it becomes clear that this is a new era and a disinflationary one, I think the long-term perspective is really quite positive But that does leave us with a near-term challenge to facilitate the weaning of the economy off of the inflation kick that it has been on for so long and to avoid the potential for deflation and serious contraction that that could lead to Thank you "
1035,1990-12-18," I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman "
1089,1991-03-26, So move  SPEAKER(?) Second 
1090,1991-03-26," Well, Mr Chairman, once again I'm the last leaf on the bush and the day is getting long, so let me be brief As I contemplate this recovery, I'm mentally migrating West; I'm going to be from Missouri for a while! We do clearly see very positive sentiment, but there are just no data as yet to support it And I think Gary's point earlier is worth repeating We have to be careful about this confidence business because at some point if it doesn't begin to get fulfilled, it will reverse on us That could happen rather quickly and I'm concerned about that  A couple of the pillars of the recovery we're hoping for strike me as being a little suspect Autos are a big ticket discretionary item and as such they're fickle The numbers aren't there yet and we're going to have to see them, I think, before we can be sure of them Also, in the case of exports, the G-7 countries are largely in a slowing mode and we're in a stronger dollar period, so I have to worry a little about the extent and timing of how that is  -39-    3/26/91  going to run As for inflation, I am very chagrined and disappointed that the core rate is so sticky so far And as far as the Greenbook's projection goes, the staff doesn't show it improving meaningfully until the second half of 1992, and that's a long time away I hope that David's inescapable logic is correct and that Gary Stern's is correct; I think there's good reason to hope that it may be But we should have been seeing it by now and we haven't as yet  So, where do the risks lie? In which direction are they liable to fall? It seems to me that Dick Syron and Ed Boehne were probably right that they are approximately symmetric right now But I would like to close with this point While the risks may be symmetric in both directions, I don't think the consequences are It seems to me that the potential consequences of an error on the down side are substantially more severe if we don't get--or if there is a significant delay in getting--the recovery The banking system, as John LaWare reminds us frequently and correctly, is shaky We hope to get reform, which I think might well go away if the economy doesn't improve The budget deficit could really spiral up, with all sorts of consequences So, while the risks might be symmetric, we should be very conscious and especially alert to the concern about the asymmetry of the consequences "
1091,1991-03-26," Mr Chairman, I'm happy to support ""B"" symmetric but I would personally have a slight preference for asymmetric toward ease because of the asymmetry I see in the consequences of a shortfall "
1140,1991-05-14, Second 
1141,1991-05-14, Are you talking about 2600 to 2550 on the Dow? 
1188,1991-08-20," That's right   Thank you, Mr Chairman When you say that a study has been done on this subject, that's giving it much too much credit We haven't done a study but--   Yes, some thought As I indicated to you in my memo of May 20, it seems to me that the Committee might well review the language that we employ in the operational paragraph wherein we indicate the areas of concern--theoretically, in rank order That order has not changed now for 38 months, and certainly [the economic] conditions and the nature of the discussions that have taken place around this table have changed over the course of that period To refresh the Committee's memory We established that language on June 30, 1988--or at least we established that rank order of considerations; the rhetoric has changed some Since that time there have been 5 tightening moves, 1 discount rate move in an upward direction when we went to 7 percent in February of '89, and the directives have had 6 tilts toward tightness We reversed direction in June of 1989 and since then there have been 17 easing moves, 3 discount rates changes in the direction of ease, and 9 directives that tilted toward ease And sprinkled throughout that whole period in both the upward and downward direction, there have been 9 symmetric directives So, a lot of water has passed under the bridge while nothing has changed here And it appears to me that we may want to take a look at that  In my view, either alternative 1 or alternative 3 in my memo would be preferable to what seems to be our current practice, which is simply not actively managing it I think [the current practice] is probably viable because it has become pretty much meaningless, but it's not very desirable for exactly the same reason If we don't feel that we want to manage that language actively--or more positively, if we decide that it's simply not very useful any more--then I think we should consider dropping it, or changing the rhetoric perhaps, or employing Don Kohn's additional thought that appears as number 4 in his memo, which I appreciate having The latter would change the recitation of the factors; it would keep them in there but blur their order of presentation  For what it's worth, I think that active management of that language is useful I know in my own case it's a useful pre-meeting discipline to think through that It seems to me that for the  -10-    8/20/91  historical record of the activity of this Committee it has real value So, I personally would like to see us keep it and come up with a system where we review it in a way that will keep it fresh and current but still not be an undue burden on the Committee I would appreciate very much having some other members' thoughts I'd like to ask Don Kohn first of all if he'd like to add anything   No, absolutely   Well, one rationale by which it could have been actively kept that way is for this Committee to have decided that it permanently wants to keep absolutely preeminent under any conditions this focus on price level stability And if that's what we want to do, then to me there is a better way to express it rather than to continue to imply that there's a rank order and that somehow or other price stability inevitably comes first We can do it in a different way and still make due allowance for that price level stability preeminence to be expressed   Yes, and then deal with the others   Right It's one paragraph up from the one I'm talking about   I totally agree with Jerry's concern It may indeed be insurmountable and, thus, we may want to look in other directions I would have no problem going in your direction, and I think that Don's [proposed] change could be a way to get at that And if we have another event of the magnitude of October '87, we can change the language on that occasion   That's it   I'd be happy to do that, Mr Chairman My sense is that there is a large common core of thought here among Committee members as to whether to do this, although there probably are nuances from every seat around the table We'll come back with some proposed alternatives   Sure   Thank you "
1189,1991-08-20," Well, Mr Chairman, it has all been said and the hour is getting late I would just add one quick thought I certainly share all of the downside concerns that have been expressed around this table this morning and all of the nervousness not only because I get it from this group but from contacts outside as well But I do think it's a little early to make any judgments While we're getting an awful lot of anecdotal evidence that is of great concern-- and that needs to be given a lot of attention--I would also try to keep in mind that we have a good many economic series that are beginning to come along fairly well Some pretty slow but pretty firm trends are beginning to fall in place in industrial production, housing, retail sales, the purchasing managers survey, and others And certainly all of economic history and the thrust of analysis will tell us that a double-dip is unlikely Obviously, it could occur, but it appears unlikely As I try to formulate my own thinking, I keep in mind Tom Melzer's caution of a few minutes ago that we not get whipsawed by the data We also have to be careful that we don't get whipsawed too quickly by the anecdotal information So, I think it's perhaps a time to be a little cautious and see what emerges, along the lines that David just summarized "
1190,1991-08-20," Mr Chairman, I certainly concur with your ""B"" asymmetric toward ease recommendation, but I would prefer the language in version I I don't want to quarrel about it; I'm not going to vote ""no"" over it But in the light of our long inertia, as we discussed earlier this morning, and the factors that we've discussed around this table that surround M2, the situation just doesn't seem to me of a nature that it would call for a departure [from wording] that we have been using for a long, long time So, I would prefer staying with version I but can accept version II "
1240,1991-10-01, So move 
1241,1991-10-01," Mr Chairman, it seems to me that what we've all been talking about this morning and what is at the front of all our minds is a very straightforward question with a very ambiguous answer Is this economy faltering or is it going to falter? If we knew the answer to that question, we'd have a pretty good idea of what to do about policy The staff forecast is that it's not faltering and is not going to But I think the staff and everyone else would agree that the question is very much outstanding I would certainly concur with those who say--and I've said here before--that the consequences of a falter are very severe And we have to keep that very much in mind and be very concerned about it But it seems to me as we ponder policy right now that we have to keep in mind the fact that we have a good deal more stimulus coming from what has already been done Staff studies have indicated that the stimulus that we're going to get from easing actions to date is going to peak in late '91 and the first half of '92 The major part of it is still ahead of us We all know how much rates have come down Wayne Angell mentioned 450 plus basis points in the last 28 months The aggregates may be beginning to move; it is very tentative yet But I think one can make the case perhaps for this sticker shock and that the portfolio shifts are beginning to abate and may be in the course of beginning to move a little, which will help the aggregates We just had a drop in the prime rate Mortgages just went under 9 percent for the first time in a long time Yields on long-term Treasury securities just went under 8 percent There's some help still on the way It seems to me that policy help right now, to the extent that it can be provided and is needed for the economy, may be to reinforce the downward trend in long rates We have an incipient view now that inflation is going to improve, and we need to encourage that It seems to me that the best way to do that would be to try to see if we can't hold short rates for the moment "
1242,1991-10-01," ""B"" asymmetric "
1292,1991-11-05," Mr Chairman, I'm very strongly in the camp with Governor Angell We have made a decision here and it becomes at that point a simple question of integrity With this auction going on, we now know what has been done and what will be done and it is only a matter of straightforward integrity that we have to go on and do it and release that information If we did not make this effective right away, in time, as the minutes come out, the fact that it was decided upon and then delayed would be known to the market and I think we would quite correctly suffer an integrity question and a credibility gap that we would deserve to suffer And that would be there for a long time   Just make an announcement--not let it happen through the market?   Not 1100 am? "
1293,1991-11-05," Mike, you substantially lowered your forecast for this quarter and the next couple of quarters and you have expressed in the last few minutes a concern that that still may be a bit too strong If for balance you wanted to sketch out a possible case on the up side--that the situation could develop a little more strongly than you have in the Greenbook now--what would be the elements of that positive case?   Let me ask, Ted, with the dollar having fallen recently Could that be reflected in time in further recovery of net exports?   Some think you haven't got a job!   Mr Chairman, I guess there's one thing that's clear and that is that things are not ebullient   We can stipulate that The anecdotal evidence we've had at the table here this morning could hardly be more negative We came out of the third quarter with a poor September and went into the fourth quarter with what looks like a poor October And the confidence data that we're seeing certainly don't give us any confidence Still, as I look at the data available to us, the third quarter, while not as strong as we had thought it might be, was not bad The Greenbook outlook, which is probably about the best estimate that we can make, is certainly not all bad And we have to keep in mind, as has been mentioned by several people, that we have a great deal of easing still in the pipeline, and I think that's very important So, I ask myself How can policy best help this situation? The first thing one has to say--and this has been said, too--is that a lot of what is going on here is structural and is not going to be susceptible to being helped by monetary policy It's just going to take time to work through But if we do feel that we want a little insurance for the middle part of 1992, cautious and modest easing would probably provide that And if we do feel that things are going to hell in a handbasket in a hurry, then maybe it's time--or would be at some point--to get very aggressive and ring the gong very loudly  One thing that I think is in everybody's mind is How do we improve confidence? I'd like to say a word about confidence; I think it may be a little more complex than meets the eye If we make  -19-    11/5/91  another small move, it probably will have a small impact We've made 10 small moves in the last 12 months And we can each make our own assessment of what the effect on confidence has been from all of that If we make a major policy move in an effort to improve confidence, it's not easy [to conclude] that it will have the result we want On the affirmative side, of course, rates would probably drop, the prime rate particularly Spending and borrowing would probably be helped at the margin But there are potential negatives to it as well For one thing, the Fed could come off looking panicked, which could possibly have very adverse consequences since we're seeing the data as being not that bad but people would wonder what the Fed knows that they don't know or what the Fed thinks that they don't think And particularly right here with the drumbeat of the White House in our ears, I think the Fed could come off looking politically dominated Both of those things feed into what I think would be very a poor situation if the Fed began to lose its credibility In my view, we're just getting that solidly in place now after a long time of feeling that we deserved it and weren't getting it And I would surely hate to see something happen that would knock that back If something were to happen just as we were beginning to be accepted as fully credible and we were called into question again, it might be a very long time indeed before we could get that credibility back once more  I think inflation expectations are beginning to wane in the economy and that's beginning to have a favorable effect And I certainly would hate it if we were to do something that would call that into question again and cause that confidence that inflation is receding to waver If it appeared that inflation were returning, once again we would be a long time weeding it out a second time That could have the effect of holding interest rates, particularly long- term rates, higher than they would otherwise need to be Also, there are the self-fulfilling elements of having inflation expectations [revive], which could make our job very difficult all over again  There are a couple of other risks that we need to keep in mind as we think about the desirability of a very strong move, to the extent that that is attractive For one thing, the stronger the move, the more likely it is that we would get a perverse effect in long rates I don't know how likely that would be or at what point that would [happen], but we have to think about the possibility that that could occur at some point The inflation battle isn't won yet I've always been optimistic that we can and will win it and I still am; but I'm not quite as comfortable--to use the word that Jerry used just a few minutes ago--as I was And frankly, the Greenbook forecast, which I'm sure is a very responsible and good one, isn't all that impressive to me in terms of the amount of inflation progress we're going to make over the forecast period through 1993 The dollar could weaken meaningfully if we got very aggressive [in easing] Of course, that would help net exports That would be good news for the short run but in the long run we'd have to deal with the inflationary consequences that could come out of that Another thing that has not been mentioned yet today is that we're going into the political season, and there's going to be an enormous temptation in this environment for fiscal stimulus of one sort or another I can envision the possibility, if we got a huge amount of stimulus moving through the pipeline, that we could be presented with some pretty tough choices We could either accommodate that fiscal stimulus, in which case we'd have monetary and fiscal policy both easing at the same time we have  -20-    11/5/91  this enormous deficit Alternatively, we could offset it by an earlier tightening than we might otherwise desire That could be very awkward to do from a number of different standpoints  So, in sum, if things are going very wrong either now or in the future, we might just have to bite the bullet and ring the gong and run the risk of getting lead poisoning from the bullet On the other hand, it's not impossible that things might turn out to be somewhat better or at least as good as they appear, in which case I don't think any immediate action would be required And to the extent that is what we see, we'd have a little time to watch and wait If we're unsure but would like to get some mid-1992 insurance--and we may well want to do that at some point--I don't think there's any rush to do it There is some time still available to affect the middle part of 1992, and a delay will give us an opportunity to evaluate just what risks we have and to pick a time and a method to do that carefully and methodically Mr Chairman, that's where I am at the moment "
1294,1991-11-05," Mr Chairman, how would you propose to structure this technically? If there were to be a decision at this table to go down 25 basis points to be effective Friday, we have a couple of days to get through here that could be susceptible to some sort of leak to the market that could be of critical importance   Mr Chairman, I don't believe the state of the economy is quite to the point here that others seem to feel We may get there, though I hope we don't; I don't think we're there now I think there's still a lot of stimulus in train that is going to support us as time goes forward And I don't view a discount rate cut here as quite as riskless as we would like As a consequence, I would prefer alternative B but I do believe that asymmetric language is warranted under these circumstances I'm aware of the fact that you have said you would use it if you got it If that turned out to be the case, so be it "
1347,1991-12-17," Second   Second   So move  SPEAKER(?) Second   Thank you, Mr Chairman The Committee will recall that after our inconclusive discussion of this matter on August 20th, the Chairman asked me, with the good help of Norm and Don, to poll the Committee and see if a preference could be developed We appreciate the response of Committee members Everyone participated but I have to say that it still was not at all definitive We had presented three options The poll came out 7 for option 1, 7 for option 2, and 2 for option 3, which left us in a bit of a quandary As a result of that, we felt that we should at least come back today and put on the table again the two recommendations that were at either end of the spectrum [of alternatives] If you'll turn to pages 17 and 18 of your Bluebook, alternatives II and III there represent the two ends of the spectrum of possibilities that we discussed earlier Alternative II would represent the continuation of the current approach And if the Committee comes out of this discussion wishing to go that route, we'll have to look further at whether or not we want to change the order of what we have Alternative III on page 18 is the other end of the spectrum, which is to delete the entire matter and start over I would like to recommend, if I may, alternative I on page 17 This is the response to the initial alternative number II from the memo back last fall, which is to try to use elements of what we have had but restructured somewhat You've read that language and I won't repeat it This is an attempt to focus on long-term goals, which is the essence of the old alternative number II It also makes reference to the factors that the Committee considers in its directive That is in reference to the old alternative I, which called for continuing that Also, by watering this down and making it much more generic, it is an attempt to give, at least on an implied basis, some emphasis to the desire possibly to get away from this    12/17/91  system altogether So, Mr Chairman, my recommendation would be that we adopt this language in alternative number I on page 17 of the Bluebook with the understanding, of course, that this could be brought up and reviewed at any time and probably should at any rate be looked at by the Committee at least once a year   That's why it has not been a big deal   That was especially for you, Bob!   Sure "
1348,1991-12-17," Mr Chairman, it's helpful to me as I look at the economy to think in terms of two separate sets of factors working together to retard economic growth One is a cyclical set and the other is a secular or structural set And they march to entirely different drummers, I believe The cyclical factors are the usual suspects that we find over and over again down through the years inventories, and so forth I think they probably would have been overcome by now--or maybe would never even have emerged--in the absence of the structural problems that we have The latter are much more important and they are much stickier And I think they are going to have to be allowed to play themselves through to correction in the interest of long-term growth and stability I would mention the debt overhang and several things that interplay one with another the real estate depression, the credit crunch in all of its different manifestations, and the very large fiscal deficit, which has several different kinds of perverse effects not the least of which right now is the inhibition it provides to any counter-cyclical fiscal activity And then, of course, there is the restructuring and perhaps downsizing in the services sector Those are pretty powerful and pretty important structural and secular trends that are going on The policy dilemma, as I would identify it right now, would be to allow these structural problems to go ahead and correct I think it would be a mistake for us to try to abort them to the extent that we could Obviously, we want to cushion them, but I don't think we ought to try to abort them We should allow them to run their course and, obviously, we all want to be careful that we don't lay a foundation for future inflation On the other hand, to the extent possible, we certainly want to try to ensure against having economic activity fall into a black hole, which I think haunts the back of our minds at this point And we also want to do what we can to [encourage] an acceptably strong recovery as soon as possible  Three sets of things go together with those conflicting desires in the way of activity One would be, obviously, the recent  -25-    12/17/91  weaknesses we've had in the economy; we've been over that and I don't need to mention that any further I do think it's important to stress maybe a bit more than we have this morning the stimulus that is in the pipeline from earlier monetary policy moves The staff informed me that as of yesterday we have approximately 3 percentage points at an annual rate of stimulus in place right now for 1992 spread out over the year almost equally from the first quarter through the fourth quarter; it recedes a little by the fourth quarter   Is it GNP or GDP, Mike?   Right At any rate, there is a lot [in the pipeline] that is going to come along That could turn out to be either a salvation or, possibly even before it's all over, a problem If we ease further, that obviously ups the stakes on both sides of that Net, it seems to me that monetary policy has already done a great deal We have eased every month this year from January through December with the exception of May, June, and July when there seemed to be a recovery underway and we stopped We started again in August, in what I think was a very early recognition that things were not continuing to go well There's a great deal that the economy has to do for itself in the area of these structural adjustments--things that I don't see as being very susceptible to a useful assist from monetary policy It may be that we've done enough or very nearly enough in terms of monetary policy now I think that policy stability is an important virtue in and of itself and that quick starts and stops in policy are undesirable And we could be getting close to setting ourselves up for one of those cycles So, my preference would be to wait and see here Obviously, if it appears that the economy is continuing to slide, we'd have to take appropriate action at that time I do have to grant, of course, that there is a good case for going ahead and easing The economy has reached lower levels [of growth] than I think many of us would have anticipated--certainly lower than I anticipated It's relatively low risk to proceed to ease a bit more and it might help some at the margin So, I would not demur from an easing, though I would prefer to keep our powder dry for a time at least "
1349,1991-12-17," That's right   Yes   Shouldn't, not can't   Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation but I do stand spiritually with Messrs Melzer and Black "
1400,1992-03-31, He was carrying out the vital function of educating his fellow member here on a particular point 
1401,1992-03-31," Mr Chairman, in my still fairly brief time on the Committee I don't recall seeing as much change in sentiment from one meeting to the next as has happened between February and now In the last meeting, most people shared a fairly strong consensus that the first quarter was going to be flat or maybe slightly up and that there was still a substantial balance of risks on the down side There were some reasons to hope that we might get an upside surprise and improvement somewhat sooner than expected, but that was a bit weaker case Now we seem to be having that upside surprise As we hear this morning--and it began to show up on the telephone call several weeks ago--most areas are showing distinct improvement And many sectors of the economy are showing a great deal of improvement Now the question before us is whether or not this improvement is going to sustain itself or whether it's going to fizzle again Certainly, there are forces that cut both ways; Governor Mullins and many others have run that liturgy and I won't repeat it There are lots of concerns and I have lots of concerns But [I'd make] two points First, as Jerry Jordan mentioned a while ago, there's an historical bias in favor of growth in this economy I don't think that has gone away; I think it's still there And secondly, more times than not-- maybe most of the time--momentum creates momentum and trends tend to sustain themselves I think we're beginning to have a favorable trend here and the more probable outlook is that it will sustain itself That would be my best guess, for whatever it's worth But it certainly does seem to be too early to be sure of that At the next meeting, or maybe the July meeting, we'll have a firmer feeling about it, I would hope, one way or the other For now it seems to me that this is the time to watch and wait "
1457,1992-05-19, I concur with Mr Syron 
1458,1992-05-19," What is the time frame you're talking about, Jerry?   Mr Chairman, we are now five months into the year At the very first of the year, there was an extremely strong consensus that [economic activity] was going to start out very slow and then begin to gain a bit of momentum in the second quarter and be much stronger thereafter A contrariness instinct at that time was to ask the question ""Where is the surprise going to come from?"" because the consensus was too strong There was some indication that the surprise might be on the up side, and by the time we met in March it  -29-    5/19/92  was fairly clear that we were getting an upside surprise News over the last six weeks has been that it looks as if the first quarter was even better than [expected] So, it seems now that the question has shifted just a little to ""Is what we've seen so far something of a false dawn or are we going to continue to be favorably surprised on the up side?"" There is the usual array of factors and we've certainly been through them this morning On the concern side are the aggregates and the fact that housing has again slowed a bit Several sea anchors are still [restraining growth] commercial real estate, the defense slowdown, net exports, and the disappointment we all feel in the year so far with regard to the CPI ex food and energy As I look at that array it seems to me that people might say in the market that most of that has been there for a while And while it's still there it has had its impact  On the other hand, I think one can say that there may be, and hopefully are, a couple of emerging trends on the favorable side that haven't really had a chance to catch on yet One may be employment growth I've been taught since I've been here that the payroll survey on employment is more reliable than the household survey, and I accept that But it may be that early in a recovery here we are getting some leadership from the household survey I wouldn't suggest that employment has grown 350,000 a month, but it may be that the household survey is telling us that [employment growth] is somewhat stronger than we thought If the household survey is telling us good things, they are coming from the places that traditionally have helped a lot and that is small-business entrepreneurial activity and so forth, [and the statistics] may lag a little [before] the payroll survey picks that up The other [favorable trend] that may just be beginning to set in is in the area that we've called in short hand ""the credit crunch"" An array of factors is there As John discussed a while ago, banks clearly are stronger Their profitability is up; their liquidity is high; their balance sheets have come back; the loan officers survey indicates that they are getting a little more ready to lend money, and there are indications that that should continue On the demand side, there's a lot of anecdotal information that small and medium-size business credit demand is beginning to come back We know that balance sheets have been restructuring generally across the board, and consumers have been very reluctant to borrow; they might come back So, it seems to me that we could well be seeing an incipient trend toward a better climate for credit extensions There are some other things, too The dollar has been on the weak side We may get a little better [performance of] net exports as a result of that Consumer confidence is not high but it has been rising steadily, and it seems to me that it's very responsive to employment And if we do get the good news on employment that I hope is going to come, then maybe that will give a further boost to consumer confidence  So, I think it's possible to build a rather plausible, rosy scenario here around employment growth and a thaw in credit conditions more than anything else I'm not buying into that wholeheartedly; there are too many negatives still out there to do that But I think the odds are improving that real activity is going to continue to improve And there's a fair to good chance that we can hold policy where it is I certainly hope so because, if that's the case, I think that improves the chances [for continued expansion] for a while without our tightening too much as the economy strengthens And the  -30-    5/19/92  longer we can do that responsibly the better news there will be over the long haul "
1459,1992-05-19, How about Art Buchwald?   I support alternative B with a symmetric directive 
1511,1992-08-18, So moved 
1512,1992-08-18," Mr Chairman, the last meeting turned out to be a little traumatic for me After holding forth at some length, I reversed myself less than 24 hours later on a discount rate vote So today I'll just try to throw in a quick speculative thought It seems to me that we're clearly in the same pattern that we've been in for some time now a slow, struggling recovery that has been severely inhibited by the financial restructuring in both the financial and the nonfinancial sectors To me so far--I would emphasize ""so far""--this recovery has been going along at a pace that may be a bit disappointing; nevertheless, it's still acceptable because it seems to me that the long-term health of the economy demands that we get this restructuring successfully accomplished In my view this financial  -26-    8/18/92 -27-  restructuring was going to happen and it could have been a great deal more traumatic than it is given the way things have evolved so far I think we may be able to see in retrospect that monetary policy has been very effective indeed over the course of this era that we're in rather than ineffective as some have alleged  Two things seem to be evolving and I'm hearing both of them around the table this morning One is that the timing of this breakout to a higher level of growth seems to be getting stretched out The second quarter was weaker than a lot of us had hoped it would be; the third quarter now looks as if it will be weaker than we had hoped, too I think most of us are reducing our forecast for the fourth quarter We haven't started lowering the first-quarter forecast yet, but we'll see about that! The second point is that we may be making more progress on inflation than many of us had ever dared to hope Year-over-year [measures of] the CPI began to break around year-end 1990 and the first quarter of 1991 when we went through that recession period The core CPI in the year 1990 according to the Greenbook was 53 percent; and the Greenbook projects 1994 at 25 percent even considering two back-to-back 3 percent growth years So far, the history has been that in the first quarter of 1991 year-over-year the core CPI was at about 5-3/4 percent; now it's at 3-3/4 percent That's a 200 basis points decline in the core rate of inflation over 18 months, and I think that's pretty impressive Clearly, the very slow growth period and the increase in unemployment and the concern in the country that we've been experiencing has had an awful lot to do with that Trying to put those together looking forward, it seems to me that if this sluggishness does continue to stretch out for a very long period of time, we may need to ask ourselves if we are beginning to be in danger of our disinflation trend overshooting and actually becoming a deflation, which could conceivably have pretty serious downside implications I continue to believe that it's very important that this financial restructuring be completed A great deal of progress is being made and I'm comfortable that our policy so far has been about right We've been doing pretty respectably at balancing the needs for a lot of this restructuring to work through and still have as healthy an economy as possible But having said that, I think this period does have to come to a conclusion at some appropriate point lest it start to feed on itself with some serious downside potential That could turn out to be the issue that we're going to be grappling with a little later in the year, though probably not just yet "
1513,1992-08-18," ""B"" asymmetric is fine "
1559,1992-10-06, Second 
1560,1992-10-06," I'm sure it's more than they have   It's a good idea!   Mike, returning for just a moment to the discussion a few minutes ago about how we measure things There have been some comments around here recently about the possibility that our inflation measurements may in fact be lagging the reality Could you comment on that?   If we may be meaningfully overstating the inflation rate, how does that play through to nominal GDP and real GDP?   If all these things are happening, where it must be getting absorbed is in even higher productivity growth rates   Mr Chairman, as I reflect on the period since the last meeting, it seems that a lot has happened but very little has changed That may be the one thing that makes this meeting so difficult for me certainly, and maybe for most of us We've been over all this; we're still struggling with a recovery I guess technically we're about to have to call it an expansion We should have crossed over into new high ground during the third quarter by almost any expected growth rate, for whatever that's worth We're certainly stretching out--forever it seems--the expected time to break out On the good news side, the inflation news seems to keep improving I believe the restructurings that have been going on, financial and otherwise, have been the big story of this situation and have been the cause of this stretch-out we're going through They need to be allowed to go through to completion I think it's very important for the long run that this be allowed to work through We've made a lot  -31-    10/6/92  of progress and I think policy has been about right in balancing the need to get inflation down, the need to allow these restructurings to continue and be completed, and the need to maintain something close to a decent economy in the process I still believe all those things But, as I said last time we were together, at some point this has to be completed At some appropriate point we need to see some solid progress Otherwise, as has been indicated this morning, we run an increasing risk of having this sluggishness begin to feed on itself And if indeed inflation is meaningfully lower than we're measuring it, we may slip into deflation without realizing it and that might turn out to be as hard to stop as inflation was  I'll breathe easier--I guess we'll all breathe easier--when we can generate some sense that there's an inertia of motion that is beginning to take over from the inertia of risk I don't get that sense yet Certainly, in the key area of employment, there's no sense of any dependable improvement Another issue that's beginning to gnaw on me is What is going to mark a completion of this restructuring process? Dick Syron touched on this a few minutes ago Where is the new equilibrium going to be? I've looked recently at debt service ratios both for households and corporations--debt service relative to income and in the case of corporations relative to cash flow--and both of those ratios are falling rapidly But if you look at their history back to, say, 1960 or so, it's hard to identify any natural support levels There is no easily identifiable equilibrium that one could say ""When we get to this place we're going to have it made and it will balance out"" There was no equilibrium at all in the '80s; it was just a steady increase in these burdens In the '70s there was something that might be called an equilibrium level, but it was at a considerably lower level than where we are right now In the '60s, when there was some equilibrium for a period of time, it was a good deal lower on both of those measures than where we are right now I can envision, I'm afraid, that we could easily fall back to that '60s level given the psychology that seems to be abroad in the land right now If that's the case, it might imply that we have a long way to go indeed I have to say in candor that I've been relatively comfortable so far, but I'm beginning to experience the first faint cringes of impatience As time goes on, I'm a bit more ready to see some signs that we are getting through this and I don't see them yet That's beginning to make me more nervous than I have been heretofore   Yes, it worked   Mr Chairman, as time goes on here, economic events are making the case for ease stronger and stronger But I do strongly support your recommendation for today because I do not think  -47-    10/6/92  this is a propitious time to ease I worry that we could set off a run on the dollar The traders are feeling their oats these days and they might just like to take us on, and we don't need that It's very important that the FOMC regain control of monetary policy, which I think we have largely lost to the market and the media I do not share the view that today is a day when we could look reflective rather than reactive Real rates are very low, as we've seen on the handout distibuted here this morning So, I don't think there is any strong urgency, on that merit, to [move] today I think it's desirable to get a reading on events as time goes along and desirable to have our powder dry in case some of these potential emergencies show up So, I strongly support your prescription   Mr Chairman, I may be the only one at the table who supports you on the merits of your case! [Laughter] "
1614,1992-11-17," Second   That's the key   Mr Chairman, the day is getting on here and it's just about all been said, I'm sure, but let me try to make one thing explicit that I think has been implicit in much of what has run through [the discussion] What is in the public interest? That's what we're talking about I think there are two components of that We have two public interest objectives here, but they're not of equal weight One public interest objective is the best possible public policy That's essential and that can't be compromised The other public policy interest is that there be timely disclosure; that's one of the basics of the political process of the country That's desirable The one is essential; the other is desirable when it does not compromise that which is essential The essential part--the best public policy part--I think is most closely associated with the issue of the deliberative process In my view, that's what we have to protect at virtually any cost The desirable public interest part is more closely associated with the timeliness issue So, it seems to me that we might be able to take a look and do some careful thinking about meeting that desirable public policy objective of disclosure a little more fully than we have today But I would not want to do anything that would impinge upon the essential part of this, which is the creation of public policy in a deliberative manner So, what we might do, Mr Chairman, on another occasion with a little more time and maybe a staff paper to go into it, is to take a look at the alternatives that would speak to timeliness but be prepared to take a very hard line on anything that impinged upon deliberativeness "
1615,1992-11-17," Everybody's leaving!   Mr Chairman, when David Mullins was speaking just a minute ago he was referring to several noted economists who think that maybe a little inflation wouldn't be such a bad idea after all It occurred to me when he said that that maybe a definition of a noted economist is one who abhors [monetarism] I have been thinking a bit like Jerry Jordan, reflecting on the flow of events of the last couple years Someone wrote that history is a river; it flows out of the past and into the present and on to the future  Last meeting and before then I guess, Mr Chairman, you said that you saw us as being poised between one of two models of the economy Either it is in a process of refreshing and rebuilding or else it is going to seize up I have to say I am becoming more optimistic all the time It seems to me that if the economy were going to seize up, it certainly has had every chance to do it The most amazing thing is that it has not seized up, given what is happening; I think it indicates an underlying strength in the economy that is just remarkable If you'll forgive me for running this litany that you're all familiar with, just consider the things that have happened in the last several years and are still happening None of these things has gone away; all of the drags [on economic activity] are still in place and are still playing through the de-leveraging phenomenon [goes] all the way through the different layers of the economy; the restructuring [continues], with the attendant heavy job losses and the heavy burden that has been on confidence [unintelligible]; and absolute depression [persists] in the construction and real estate business--a very big industry--with all the implications there One of the throw-offs has been consumer  -19-    11/17/92  confidence, a decline in confidence through the wealth effect on home values We have been through a banking trauma which in an earlier era would have caused what would have been described as a ""crash,"" I'm sure, and we'd still be deep into it just on that alone We're going through a defense slowdown, another big industry; that industry is absolutely in decline but even more than that its composition is shifting with various displacements going on which I think in the short term are every bit as much of a drag as the actual decrease in volume A newer factor, of course, is this world economic slowdown that is going on, weakening our exports which had been helping us in earlier years Now, that's a lot of stress on an economy And every one of those factors is still there; they are still dragging on the economy and they've all been at work for a long time except that last one, which may be just coming into its own  So, where are we? What has in fact been happening? Well, in the last nine quarters the first three of them were negative on GDP and the last six have been positive Two of the last three quarters were +29 percent and we have what now may be 3 percent or more GDP growth in the most recent quarter We're probably going to have 23 percent or more growth in GDP for the year, and that's not too shabby We are now on new high ground; we're not in a recovery anymore, we're nearing an expansion as of the numbers of the third quarter Our financial structure as a nation is strengthening in both the financial and the nonfinancial sectors as a result of the hesitancy in the banking industry and the de-leveraging I think one would have to say that our competitiveness and our productivity are going up largely through this restructuring process The banking system has certainly been battered but it's in place and hopefully wiser; it's certainly more fully regulated, heaven knows! And it is earning record profits right now Inflation is coming down and it's into the range where we're beginning to talk about having achieved price level stability On balance most of us here around the table this morning consider the latest news to be upbeat I'm sure the economy could still seize up; I don't want to suggest that there's no reason for concern But the longer we have the kind of results we're seeing, the less likely that is and the more it seems that we are indeed in a refreshing [stage of] rebuilding that I think displays an amazing underlying strength in this economy and one we can depend on as we look into the future "
1616,1992-11-17," Mr Chairman, as far as the short-term policy goes, it seems to me that the outlook is stronger both in terms of the data that we're receiving and also the tone, particularly [as reported] here this morning We probably would all agree that it's very likely that we're going to get some type of [fiscal policy] program from the new President; he almost has to do that Taking these two factors together leads me to a strong preference for ""B"" symmetrical  As far as the ranges go, I would certainly concur that they need to come down I'm open as to exactly where I suppose that puts me in the alternative II case As far as the timing goes, if we were to ease today, then I would agree with Governor Lindsey that we should lower the ranges today in order to get those signals straight I hope that we are not going to do that And if we're not, then I would prefer to see us wait for a couple of reasons First of all, it's  -37-    11/17/92  clearly a technical matter and [unintelligible] And, obviously, if we did it today, it would be very out of sequence with the usual pattern that people expect from the Federal Reserve We're in this interregnum period right now and we're in somewhat of a news vacuum where the media is just [looking] for anything they can talk about There will be an awful lot of punditry if we move now and go public with it They are almost certain to get it wrong; they'll make too much of it and they'll make the wrong [inferences] It's very likely that they would opine that we've gone back to reemphasizing M2 well beyond the true posture of this Committee If they see that we do that based on this study, which is superb, they will think that we are saying ""Eureka! We've found it This is the answer and we're going to settle down right here on the basis of this new information"" That could cause some out-of-focus speculation in the marketplace and some out-of-focus perceptions of what [is important to] the FOMC So, I would prefer to stay in sequence and treat [the decision] as business as usual, as a calm and normal considered judgment when the February timeframe arrives   You might take a poll   I'm going with you "
1675,1992-12-22," Does it have to get out of your vault at all in order to be considered an import and an export?   That has been going on for a long time   That's the first sour note of the morning, really The main thrust of what we've been hearing this morning from the Districts is highly encouraging, though certainly not totally ebullient and appropriately so I would suggest that perhaps the character of the progress the economy is making here is not really changing that much; we may be seeing basically more of the stop/start kind of pattern that we have seen in the past, hopefully at a somewhat higher level but of the same general character That would imply that there will be downside news along with the upside news It would certainly appear that we're building upside momentum here, and that's great But it continues to struggle against these drags that we've had for a long time and that certainly haven't gone away the downsizing in defense, the real estate situation, the deleveraging, and the restructuring We know that litany It seems to me that we may be seeing the upside momentum struggling against these drags and slowly gaining the upper hand, but perhaps that episode isn't over yet Where does all of this net out? Well, one senses that the risks appear to be tilting in the upside direction, but it's probably too soon to be very sure of that; maybe they should be characterized as symmetric I took very much to mind Tom Melzer's remarks earlier of where we were two meetings ago and what happened immediately thereafter I think we'd all agree that gives us all plenty of reason to be humble when it comes to making projections I'm struck by the fact that so many people this morning have said that the tone of things is leading the statistics That's probably to be expected; on the other hand, it's not to be trusted either So, we undoubtedly have challenging times ahead and difficult choices out there Maybe they will come sooner than we think They're probably going to be on the up side, but it's too soon to be totally confident of that "

1729,1993-03-23," In defense of the summary notion, we're in a sound-bite situation here People don't have long attention spans They get impressions very quickly and those impressions are very hard to shake once they get them I think the summary would provide for a much wider audience than the professional, careful reader, and that's an important audience It would provide a quick, easy, access to [the essence of] 20 pages of the policy record that people are not going to read in many cases A few will; fine, they should But this will give access to the lazy, the overworked, the distracted, or the ignorant   That I think is valuable And it can be done in a way that presents the FOMC's story in a light that we approve of as opposed to relying on some reporter who may not understand what he's    3/23/93  reading and who plows through the policy record and picks out a phrase here and there that suits his purpose and presents the Committee in an erroneous light   He may be, but if on the front of the release there is an executive summary, I think that will tend to be what gets picked up by a very large percentage of those who give it any attention at all That's important and I think it's a positive "
1730,1993-03-23," Thank you, Mr Chairman First of all I'd like to thank David Mullins for his good balanced commentary on the inflationary outlook a few minutes ago and I certainly share [his views] I must say that if we are looking at the re-emergence of some inflationary pressures, what scares me most about that is that we could wind up looking at it in a stagflation-type context How did we get there? Well, I'm very encouraged by the comments that I hear from around the country that the uptrend continues and seems to be gathering strength That's certainly good news and I share the feeling that I hear around the table that we're in less and less danger of having this economy swoon out on us On the other hand, I don't see the economy as being very likely to run away on the up side to say the least If the Clinton program goes through, we're going to be looking at some level of fiscal drag beginning to set in during '94 and [continuing] thereafter The old constraints that we've been living with for a long time have not been excised yet The 50 mile per hour head wind may have slowed down some to 25 or 30, but we certainly haven't gone into a calm We have a lot more defense restructuring to go through At least on the consumer side, if not on the corporate side, we have more debt restructuring to do in my opinion The outlook for net exports certainly doesn't begin to improve over the forecast period and may be deteriorating further The economy was carried by the consumer in '92 and I worry that the consumer doesn't really have that much reserve buying power building up yet Consumer debt is off a little in terms of the service-to- income ratio, but that's mostly due to lower interest rates not to lower absolute levels of debt As we know, the latter were at an all- time high recently and I guess they're still [close to] an all-time high even though they're off their peaks But none of that leads me to believe that we can have much confidence that consumer spending is going to continue to carry us the way it has so far, particularly if, for whatever reason--inflation fears or whatever--interest rates begin to rise again That could have an effect on the consumer and just about everything else, and we could possibly be a part of causing that to occur Then, of course, there is [the question of] what the broader monetary aggregates may mean, and I certainly don't know what  -31-    3/23/93  that may be Nevertheless, they have been extremely weak and continue to be so; and as we speak they seem to be weaker than ever Taken all-in-all, I think the Greenbook's path is the best one; I hope we get it; it's the most likely one But if we are looking at the possibility of a re-emergence of inflation here, and we could be, then I really fear that stagflation may be the context within which it could occur And that, it seems to me, would [cause us to face] some very, very special and very painful kinds of considerations   It surely is "
1731,1993-03-23," ""B"" symmetric, alternative language, Mr Chairman, for all the reasons that have been mentioned "
1783,1993-05-18, Second 
1784,1993-05-18," Mr Chairman, with the emergence of the most recent data, it seems to me that we now have before us about the widest spectrum of fundamentally conflicting possibilities that I can remember I have attempted to make a bit of an inventory of what those possibilities are and what some of their implications might be, just to help my own thinking along If we were to make a straight- line projection [based on] the most recent data, we'd wind up with stagflation, which obviously would be a very serious situation But there are a number of other possibilities and each carries a different set of implications In the area of real economic activity, I think there may be two basically credible paths we could find ourselves on The first is that the first-quarter data are signalling an emerging decline--that things are indeed beginning to go back downhill and that we might even be looking at the possibility of a new recession down the way That's possible but it seems to me highly unlikely We have a good bit of momentum going; jobs are being formed net of all the restructuring that's going on; new claims are flat; the credit crunch is easing; the consumer is returning; our competitiveness is improving through productivity, which is the good way, and through a somewhat softer dollar in some cases, which may not be so good a way Nevertheless, competitiveness is [improving] So, I would doubt that what we're looking at is a fundamentally weaker economy that is going downhill But if that is what emerges, then we're going to have to reverse a lot of the thinking we've been doing  What seems to me much more likely is that we've been looking at some type of a blip in the rather moderate upturn that we've had for eight quarters now I noticed that of the eight quarters we've had in succession that have been basically positive, four have been lower than the previous quarter, which is rather interesting So, it seems likely that we're looking at a blip And the question is what's going to happen after that blip  -28-    5/18/93  The first question, obviously, is When is the blip going to be over? It may last a little longer; it may still be going on But is the Greenbook basically correct? Are we looking at an extended period of slow or sluggish growth? Is it going to be somewhat stronger than that, maybe a good deal stronger than that? Each of these [scenarios], it seems to me, takes us in a different direction But regardless of which one begins to emerge, there doesn't seem to be any compelling impetus in real economic activity that we can see [as cause] for concern right this minute I think there will be time to have this very murky situation begin to [clarify]  In the area of inflation there may be three possible scenarios working here The first one--which I think all of us hope is the case and which has a fair probability in my mind--would be that the things we've been seeing the last several months are indeed aberrations and that the disinflationary process that we've had is still more or less in place I hope that's the case It seems unlikely to me that we're in an incipient rising new [inflation] trend, that the game is over and [inflation is] on the way back up Now, we've been talking about that all morning And a number of possible explanations that would lead one in that direction are out there That may turn out to be what is happening, but it's very difficult for me to see how that can be, given the fundamentals of the slack in the economy In my mind the highest probability would be that we're looking at some rough bottoming out process in here, and that may be the toughest of all to deal with If we are looking at a rough bottoming out process with the kind of economy that we have now, it would really be disappointing to still have 3-1/2 percent or so on the CPI And what should be done about it? When we think about what should be done about that, if that's the case, we have to have a context or a view of what is happening in the real economy If we're going to have an economy that will start to accelerate soon and strongly, then it's fairly clear what we'll need to do as soon as that becomes apparent If the first quarter is the start of a new decline, then we have some very fundamental economic problems that I'm not sure I understand, and maybe nobody understands What in the world would be going on that would lead us to this kind of configuration? If we have the Greenbook's economy, continuing sluggish growth, that gives us a nice philosophical policy question to answer Do we try to restrain this kind of economy in order to push inflation lower? If we did, would it work? Or as you suggest, Mr Chairman, are we perhaps looking at some other kinds of problems that appropriately would require some other answers It seems to me that this is the type of question that we're going to need to address in the next part of the meeting "
1785,1993-05-18," Mr Chairman, we've been around this bush a number of times now I would support no change with an asymmetric directive The reason I like the asymmetric directive is that I think it reflects the fact that this Committee is on top of the situation and is concerned That is the case and I think we should have an asymmetric directive for that reason That does not mean that I necessarily think we're going to use it If we move to tighten now, it seems to me the reason would be because we have the perception that inflation has indeed already set in on us and has to be countered now, or maybe it should have been countered sooner The way to counter it is to tighten money; and the reason we tighten money is to restrain something Well, if we had a strongly accelerating economy, it would be clear that it needs to be restrained We have something less than that--the Greenbook economy or worse What is it we want to restrain? There are not any excesses that I can clearly find It seems to me that if we want to tighten, we've got to be very clear why To simply say ""to counter inflation"" really isn't enough If there's something we want to restrain, let's decide we want to restrain it If it is a matter of restraining expectations, let's be very express about that and be very careful that we take a good look at whatever secondary effects--in the way of hard effects--we might set off in an attempt to counter a psychological or soft effect in the area of expectations Now, that's not to say that we might not need to tighten at some point; but I think we ought to be quite careful about tightening in the face of a perception of an expectation-driven inflation without some other harder evidence to go along with it "
1832,1993-08-17," I'll move it, Mr Chairman   Second "
1833,1993-08-17," Well, Mr Chairman, it seems to me that I'm in the consensus that I'm hearing around the table this morning We've been for a long time taking two steps forward and one step back and that seems to continue Some of the head winds we've been sailing into are diminishing Real estate is beginning to stabilize; banks are strong again and seem to want to lend; deleveraging is slowing down Some of the head winds continue The foreign economies continue weak; defense spending continues to go down There are favorable and unfavorable new factors We've had a lowering of long- term interest rates for some time, but one could call it a new factor that it has gone into this very dynamic phase in the last several months I think an important favorable factor is that the budget fight is simply over Never mind how it came out; it's settled I think that's going to help a lot On the negative side, of course, is the fact that that budget deal contains some very serious taxes, as  -24-    8/17/93  we've heard here in the last few minutes We've had some very good news and some disappointing news The very good news is that more and more it seems that last winter's inflation surge was temporary I've now learned that the new danger I didn't know about before is called ""speed"" effect And there has been some disappointing news in the sense that, at least in my case, I expected real economic activity to improve more quickly and strongly than it has So, the realities don't seem to me to have changed much However slowly and torturously, the economy does continue to improve Inflation now seems to be trendless, albeit at much too high a level So, for the moment at least, I guess I would summarize by saying Have a nice vacation We're going to have work to do very soon, I'm sure "
1834,1993-08-17," I very happily support a symmetric directive I would like to underscore what has been implicit in many of the comments--Tom Hoenig just now was quite explicit about it--that what we're doing here is making a directive It is a directive to the Open Market Desk and its purpose first and foremost is to instruct the Desk about what we expect over the intermeeting period There is a secondary effect and a secondary purpose in the area of signalling There is a large inevitability about that and it has to be considered; it probably occasionally has to be dominant, but I would say only very occasionally The order of importance of these two is distinctly in the area of first and foremost to provide direction to the Desk And that direction to the Desk at this time certainly is that there's unlikely to be a change over the next five weeks "
1885,1993-09-21," You bet   I'm pretty close to where Governor Angell was at the end [of his comments] It seems to me that on the economy we have a rather tight consensus with a couple of important exceptions today There was consensus around the Greenbook type of view, and that certainly includes me Very frankly that worries me a lot! I mistrust it; my contrarian antennae are twitching I was interested yesterday in the Wall Street Journal that Keynes reminded us that the inevitable never happens   Good point I don't mean to be facetious when I say that the thing that concerns me the most right now is that I don't know what I should be most concerned about Where's the balance of risks? If you look at the things that we're able to analyze and make some responsible comments on, the risks seem to be quite balanced And it seems to me that the things we can see are unlikely to take us very far away from our consensus view It seems to me that if the consensus were to break, it could most likely be because of some unanticipated or unexpected event And it seems to me that the world may have more than the usual potential for that right now; it always has potential for it But there are some things out there that I think could change things radically It's easier to see the bad things than the good ones The failure of NAFTA, which could impact on GATT, could cause a rather severe dislocation of international trade at least for a while Many friends of mine in the Southwest are terrified that oil may collapse below $10 a barrel, which could have some pretty severe impacts There are a couple of major economies that we all know are in a very shaky state The former Soviet Union has various civil wars going on; optimism in the Near East runs very high and it better be brought to pass or [the repercussions] could be  -28-    9/23/93  more severe on the down side than ever, and so forth I think there are up side [possibilities] too It would not be out of the bounds of the imagination to see job growth start to pick up; the potential for that has been alluded to a couple of times this morning If that were to happen, it could have a dramatic impact in terms of a resurgence of confidence I think Americans like to be confident, and we haven't been for a long time We could see a pretty strong bounceback in confidence, which could cause a real surge in the economy All in all, Mr Chairman, in August I said that I thought we should all enjoy our vacations because we'd have work to do soon enough But it doesn't seem to me that the time is here yet And I honestly don't seem to be able to generate any very clear notion about what it may be when it comes, either as to timing or circumstances or extent or even direction Thank you "

1939,1993-11-16," May I make sure I understand the answer? Virgil, did you just say that if there is a subpoena that requires us to turn this information over and we do so, then there is nothing to protect that information from release by the [Congressional] Committee?   But that would be at his discretion?   He certainly has   Virgil, I wonder how much more comfort we might have if it were possible to get something in the way of a firm official position from the Justice Department relative to FOIA and the Archivist relative to the [Federal] Records Act You have very interesting but very preliminary expressions of opinion from them To what degree do you think we can be comfortable that that's where they would come out if they were to opine formally Would they formally opine at all?   Right   And you feel that's as much as we can get prospectively?   Yes   Mr Chairman, proceeding along as we have, I certainly concur with what I've been hearing from virtually everyone that it's time to be pro-active I think the regime that we are under now and have been under has been the best way to make public policy But I'm afraid that I have come to the conclusion that that's not viable any more, given the evolution of FOIA and the understandings as to what FOIA means So looking at what might be done, first of all for the past meetings I concur with your proposal and I don't think there's anything further that I can add to what has already been said about that  As for going forward, I prefer alternative number 4, which provides for the lightly edited transcript Substantively I don't see a great deal of difference between a lightly edited transcript and a Memorandum of Discussion I see some moderate advantages and disadvantages to each but nothing compelling either way But in my judgment I am afraid that a Memorandum of Discussion type document is just not as acceptable as it was in the past It should be perfectly acceptable but I'm not sure that it is We live in a somewhat different age than we did in the '70s I regret it We live in an era of suspicion of government Appearance has become enormously important even to the detriment of substance in many cases, which I think is enormously regrettable and not warranted but nevertheless is the case And I am afraid that today's reader will wonder in the case of the Memorandum of Discussion if he's not getting a little spin and he will be uncertain that he is receiving [an account of] the proceedings with full accuracy Now, I'm perfectly comfortable myself that they would be [accurate] I don't have the slightest doubt about that But if we are going to be forthcoming, and I think we must be, we would be more satisfactorily forthcoming to go the route of the lightly edited transcripts Consequently I would prefer that for that  -32-    11/16/93  reason I would have a strong preference for a lag of five years over three for reasons that President Hoenig and others have expressed But if we have to go to three, I don't think that would necessarily be a deal-breaker   Going back?   My first choice is lightly edited transcripts; my second choice would be [releasing] both raw and lightly edited transcripts   This is a very knotty question   But the errors get preserved  -44-    11/16/93   Yes, definitely   Five and three   Lightly edited transcript first; MOD second   I think they're bundled That's Larry's word and I think he's correct I think if we go one route, turning the tape recorder off is a much more sensible way to go If we go with either alternative number 3 or number 4, then I think we leave the tapes on and get permission to erase them from the Archivist   I would agree   Somewhat to back up Bill McDonough, if we do decide to delay, it wouldn't surprise me a bit if we all got a letter by the day after tomorrow asking for our independent--and undiscussed with anyone else--opinion of what we would like to see done going forward   And do what with them?   So would I   Second "
1940,1993-11-16," Well, Mr Chairman, I'm about where I've been for some months now I see very little evidence of an important change My definition of that in my lexicon would be a moderate growth expectation, fits and starts, a surge perhaps here in the fourth quarter but not sustainable, with a slow acceleration--in fits and starts--over time I think there are enough positives in the forecast to sustain that growth, not the least of which would be a continued reduction in your famous head winds In all probability all of the positives will sustain that moderate growth path I think we have to recognize that there exist considerable restraints in that forecast that should prevent an upside breakout, [including] fiscal restraint, the further impact of new taxes, and a saving rate that is already at the bottom of its historical range Also, restructuring continues and defense [outlays] will continue to decrease; net exports will not be helpful and may decrease or get worse as well; and intermediate and long rates have shown some spontaneous rises I emphasize that I come out on the positive side of this, but I do think we have to recognize that there are some pretty powerful restraints out there  I'll relate one anecdote that I would share with those who weren't there The Federal Advisory Committee was in here a week or so ago and they were asked what their forecast for the economy was They had a very, very strong consensus at between 2-1/2 and 3 percent centering on about 28 percent Just to see what it might elicit, we said Okay if that's the consensus, think contrarian a little bit and tell us where you would see the risks to that forecast Interestingly enough, the way I heard it--others who were there may have heard it differently--they were almost unanimous in seeing the risks on the down side, not the up side, for whatever that's worth  On inflation, I just don't see any pickup visible Inflation is still falling on a year-over-year basis by almost every measure We still have slack in the economy, although capacity utilization may have to come off of that list with this latest report But certainly [we have slack] in labor markets and world activity generally and sentiment continues to be weak So, I see no reason to look to a short-term move in that regard In short Steady as she goes "

2005,1993-12-21," Second   Mr Chairman, in the first part of your statement, did I understand you to say that Chairman Gonzalez has indicated that the approach you're taking would be acceptable?   He's requesting to have people come here and listen to the tape?   His people   So, the only difference in your suggestion from what he said would be acceptable is that we'd have some other [Congressional staff present] as well?   Well, in that case, Mr Chairman, I fully and happily endorse your approach I think we definitely should be forthcoming I had played with the idea of suggesting that we go ahead and fully release it, but if this would be agreeable to Chairman Gonzalez and he would make the suggestion himself that we do this--   I didn't know that   Available for review   We ought to do it "
2006,1993-12-21," Thank you, Mr Chairman First let me say that I think your remarks early in the meeting concerning Governor Angell's departure were very well taken He may leave us physically but his influence is certainly going to remain His statement of a minute or two ago was a beautiful cameo that he's leaving [with] us for that point of view And I want to tell you that I appreciate it  I think most of us feel that appropriate policy is largely in the hands of how strongly one feels about growth The main question, of course, is the pace that [the expansion is] liable to sustain through next year Are we looking in this strong fourth quarter at a sustainable, very strong rate or will it ease back somewhat from there? I have a long list of factors and I'm sure everybody else does, and Mike expressed it very eloquently earlier so I won't go back through all of that But to me there is somewhat harder evidence for the ""ease back"" hypothesis than for sustained, very strong growth I was a little surprised just a moment ago to find myself with the same factors that Bill had, only with a reverse interpretation I suspect the consumer will ease back, largely because consumer saving is at an all-time low and very strong consumer expenditures will drive that lower They could [remain strong] but consumer debt is right at a record in terms of its relationship to disposable personal income And that very, very high ratio will have to be sustained in order for strong consumer expenditures to continue It seems to me that housing is very likely to ease I can't imagine that something like this 143 [million rate of housing starts] that we just saw will hold The tax increase will kick in; what its effect will be remains to be seen I understand it will only hit higher incomes, of course, but it will nevertheless be there Defense cuts will occur I hope it's true that the deficit number will continue to get lower, providing a drag Foreign economies may well start to look better than we have been  -22-    12/21/93  thinking recently, but that's not going to happen overnight And [their sluggishness] may well continue to stretch out as has seemed likely for some months now  The sustained strength case is very strong; Al started the meeting with a very strong and credible statement about that And it just makes this [policy decision] a terribly close call; I guess, as Ed Boehne said, we just don't know I think the first quarter is liable to start strong, just as an echo if nothing else But is that sustainable? I remember this time last year--obviously we don't have exactly the same situation as last year but we had that huge fourth quarter last year--that it took the subsequent three quarters to get any meaningful momentum going again Not even the third quarter, just past, was all that impressive Are we going to get some of that? We might well, even though probably not as severely So, on a very close call it seems to me that the factors calling for some pull back from what we apparently have in the fourth quarter is the strongest case If the Greenbook forecast or something close to it is correct, then the possibility or the likelihood of running into inflationary problems is some quarters out yet; it's hard to tell how far It will depend on exactly how that goes and how fast the gap in the GDP gets closed If [the economy] is somewhat stronger than the Greenbook, that's the toughest call of all for me, and I don't know what to say about that If we believe that it's considerably stronger and that [the strength] is sustainable, then we should move immediately But I'm not quite there I'm cautious about January, particularly, because of the likely echo And only if things continued to accelerate right on through January, would I start to get impressed by that because I think January is probably going to have some strength to it any way one looks at it So all in all, that puts me into the wait-and-see camp "
2007,1993-12-21," Mr Chairman, this choice gets tougher and tougher First of all, I subscribe to your prescription Factors on all sides of this have been exceptionally well articulated this morning And every one of them has a high level of validity, but we have to make a choice I certainly support your prescription Timing seems to be the issue now in all of our minds The pace of the economy, I guess, is largely going to determine that I am agnostic on the timing issue at this point I could easily see it being a while, as Governor LaWare suggests; and it may need to be sooner than later We'll just have to see And I appreciate your desire that we all do this together And that we will do "
2072,1994-03-22," Mr Chairman, I think we should announce it on the merits of the case The time is here to do that As far as today is concerned, I would be uncomfortable holding this decision overnight and letting it be announced in the traditional way of Desk action tomorrow I think that would be a mistake I am in favor of letting it be your announcement rather than the Committee's for the reasons that Governor Lindsey and President McDonough discussed   The chairman departed the scene!

2073,1994-03-22," Thank you, Mr Chairman As was said early on, our job here, of course, is to assess risks And I think most of what we have heard today has been centered around the risks that we see in the upside direction I certainly can't disagree that that is probably the most likely scenario, but I would like to inject a couple more notes of caution into that if I may I don't disagree that these risks are probably the most compelling argument But I do think there are good reasons not to assume overly confidently that that's the only scenario I think there is a probability that's considerably above zero that we may be a good deal further away from this full utilization flash point than we think we are  First of all, the Greenbook forecast points to a considerable slowing in the real economy It describes the consumer as neutral going forward from here I'm not sure what that means, but I agree with it [Laughter] I have spoken before about the very heavy debt load that consumers have; as of now it's all still there And as Bill McDonough mentioned a few minutes ago, we may have some nasty shocks in the wealth effect area that people are about to find out about Indeed, going forward from here, I think almost all of the major sectors are projected to slow After this quarter, unemployment ceases to go down in the Greenbook projection and capacity utilization stops going up I find it hard to ascribe very much of that in 1994 to the effects of a slowly rising federal funds rate, though there may be some effect at the margin Now, more slowing is projected for 1995, and I can associate that a bit more with a rising funds rate In short, that projection just doesn't look anything like a runaway boom to me  The foreign economies, particularly the G-7 countries, have a very slow recovery under way, if indeed it is under way And the projection is that their under-utilization gap never does close at all over the forecast period, and their inflation stays low and indeed gets lower as time goes on This tells me that our net exports are going to be a continued heavy drag; there is going to be continued heavy pressure for other economies to export to the United States at  -33-    3/22/94  very attractive prices, and I think that implies a rather strong pricing discipline on our own domestic producers I'm not sure the International Finance staff here would agree with that; I think they believe that effect is more limited, and historically I'm sure that they are correct But in the foreseeable future, I think foreign competition will continue to have a strong disciplinary effect on prices in the United States  In the area of productivity and unit labor costs, we have recently been seeing a rate of growth in unit labor costs that has been substantially below the inflation rate In 1993 it was 9 percent The Greenbook projects that to jump a lot next year to 29 percent, which would be very adverse if it happened But even if it does happen to that extent, I still don't see 29 percent as being an inflationary flash point But is it going to happen? The reason given for that very adverse development is that productivity has been running much better than trend, and it's got to get weaker in order to come back to trend That just might be a tad academic It may be that the folks out there in the real world who are fighting to make a living may not realize that they've been performing way above trend; they may feel they have to keep it up in order to survive [Laughter] My impression is that they are doing that So it's possible that we will continue to see a substantial improvement in productivity that may be more secular than cyclical, as the case may be  Interest rates cut both ways On the one hand, I would certainly agree that real rates are low and stimulative, and that's a very important point But on the other hand, this 70 to 100, maybe 120 basis point increase in long rates that we have seen, however you want to measure it, is a powerful restraint We can talk all day about whether they are real increases or not real increases and to what extent one way or the other But the fact of the matter is that it's a large increase and it points to very substantial restraint right now The Greenbook projects that long rates are going to come back down in association with a rise in the short rates; that's happened before and conditions may exist today where it will happen again But it's hardly a cinch bet That could be an important constraint  Finally, there is the matter of inflation trends themselves; they are still improving Three years into an expansion, the 12-month change in the core CPI last month, the latest figure, was the best we have had in a long time I realize, of course, that when we talk about trends we're looking backward and we need to look forward One reason that these trends have been looking so good in the face of an expansion has been the fact that we have had a weak recovery, but then one reason the recovery has been weak is because there was a weak recession before it; we started out at pretty good levels Trends change slowly most of the time The first thing they've got to do is to stop moving in the direction they are already moving, and in this case they haven't yet Then later they may reverse Certainly, there is evidence that that's going to begin to happen The last time we met I used the phrase ""there is dust on the horizon"" Certainly, some prices are rising; there is no doubt about it Maybe this trend will reverse faster than trends usually do, but I don't think it is completely insignificant that so far that is just not happening The trends are still in the direction of slowly declining inflation Over the previous 12 months, the PPI change was almost flat The core CPI  -34-    3/22/94  last month, as I mentioned, was the lowest it has been in a long time, at 28 percent and on a downward trend so far  Is there danger that we are going to get behind the curve or alternatively, if we do move now, that we could conceivably choke off the expansion? I seriously doubt both of those But I do think it's possible that we have a situation here where the economy, at least for a while, is behaving in some new ways It could be that if we are not being pushed hard right now to move--if we are not in danger of getting behind the curve--that it might be worth keeping our powder dry for a little while to see how some of this plays out Thank you "
2074,1994-03-22," Mr Chairman, I too believe that rates are too stimulative and I think we ought to seek a neutral policy stance, wherever that turns out to be I also believe that the robust expansion hypothesis is probably the most likely, however robust may be defined And certainly both of those points suggest that the funds rate should be moved up On the subject of timing, I do not believe that the real economy requires a tightening move at this point but I think the markets probably do; so I can go with 25 basis points I do find the 25 basis points argument compelling and I'd have real trouble with a move of 50 basis points As far as asymmetry goes, I don't think for the traditional reasons that that is the best idea on its merits, but I also agree with Larry Lindsey's suggestion that it would be confusing However, I will not dissent over that   I would prefer symmetry "
2129,1994-05-17," Mr Chairman, I support the recommendation and I would particularly like to associate myself with Governor LaWare's comments about the elegance and appropriateness of the statement that you proposed "
2179,1994-08-16, Second 
2180,1994-08-16," It disappears in the rounding   Thank you, Mr Chairman I think this has been a good session in getting most of the factors out on the table, and I'll try to be brief First of all, I still have some question in my mind as to just how much danger we are in here as to inflation being in sort of a scary take-off zone I think there are still some important factors that are holding it in check I would particularly note that the forecast for unit labor costs is still very low Even out through 1995 it never gets much above 2 percent, which should be a big deterrent In that regard, even though my bullish forecast on productivity has got a little egg on its face from the most recent numbers, I'm still optimistic that productivity is going to continue to increase at a significant secular rate Certainly, I think it's fair to say that we haven't seen much in the way of an increased thrust in compensation, construction probably being an exception to that Secondly, foreign inflation and its influences continue to be  -25-    8/16/94  low Inflation is low in the countries that basically have high costs because they still have big production gaps that are apparently going to stay in place for the indefinite future Those countries that have higher inflation tend to have very low cost structures in the first place, so they ought to be able to keep the pressure off prices So I'm not sure how much imminent danger we really are in, that there is more than just a troughing or perhaps an upcreep in prospect But for all of that having been said, it is clear that we are either at or very, very near capacity, however that is defined, and there is a lot of momentum present that shows every prospect of carrying us past that As a consequence, it seems to me that the risks are clearly on the up side both for activity and inflation I'm put to mind of an old saying of my mother's who used to like to say to her children, ""a stitch in time saves nine"" "
2181,1994-08-16," I support your proposal, Mr Chairman, for all of the reasons that have been expressed "
2233,1994-09-27," That shows you how much demand there is for more hair! [Laughter]   Thank you, Mr Chairman First, very briefly a quick summary of where I am The inflation news since the last FOMC meeting certainly has not been very helpful, but I don't think there is much evidence that inflation is going to take off on us We may have some inflation creep on our hands as the Greenbook suggests, and I'll speak a little more to that in a second In real activity, as Mike Prell and many others have observed, there is an impressive and, certainly to me and perhaps others, a surprising amount of momentum still out there and that may be slowing When we gathered last time, we tightened 50 more basis points and that, of course, is only just now going to start to have an impact The impact of earlier tightenings is, of course, still in the process of unfolding So in short, I think we have an interlude here to see what develops The slowing may spread and stretch out a little On the other hand, it may turn out to be very brief and we may continue to get very strong data that may call for another move rather soon  If I can take one more minute, Mr Chairman, let me share with you a concern that I have If inflation creeps up at all, and it certainly appears that that is likely, many here could regard that as insignificant or temporary and not be terribly concerned about it But I think we probably need to be prepared for a rather major and stronger bout of inflation jitters in the economy, and we may want to think about how we might be able to handle that There is a perception that the economy is in a very mature, perhaps even a late, stage in the cyclical expansion Everyone perceives that we are operating more or less at capacity now For a long time in this country, people would expect in a period like this to see inflation take hold and be at its most virulent I think that until we actually go through a full cycle without a substantial inflationary surge, there is going to be a concern that history will repeat itself, and I can understand that And if inflation starts to show some upward creep, there almost inevitably will be some concern that, okay, the game is on, here we go again  There are at least two risks in that First of all, it could have a certain self-fulfilling prophecy element to it through the expectations channel and it may make itself stronger than it needs to be or might inherently be Second, I can see it forcing long rates considerably higher than we are comfortable with or think that they ought to be through an enlarged inflation premium That could be an overly and unnecessarily negative event So, I have a concern regarding what we may be looking at in the marketplace in the near future, Mr Chairman Even if we are not terribly concerned based on the specific evidence that we see at hand, I think there could be some market concerns that would work their way through the economy in a negative way "
2234,1994-09-27," I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman "
2292,1994-11-15," Mr Chairman, I think that if we were to withdraw in that way, it would create a wound that could very easily be opened at almost any time It would indicate a continuing disarray in US financial management to any serious observer, official or private I think it could have very deleterious consequences in an ongoing way and in ways that would be impossible to foresee There would always be a question about where US policy was and where the Federal Reserve was relative to the Treasury Furthermore, I think that frankly it would be a display of unseemly arrogance if the central bank were to walk away from its Treasury in that manner, essentially being seen as thumbing its nose at the government or maybe holding its nose I just don't think that that would sit well with other governments; I don't think it would sit well with the Congress We see ourselves as wanting to be independent in managing monetary policy for very good reasons, and I don't want to poison the well for the wrong reasons I am afraid that would do it   Second "
2293,1994-11-15," Mr Chairman, it seems to me the situation is unequivocal At this point in the morning, I have very little to add that's useful Virtually every bit of information that we have gotten and certainly the reports around the table this morning have indicated that we have an extremely strong expansion It may be accelerating I don't expect this, but if somehow nothing were done, I think we probably could get rather quickly into a runaway boom situation The inflation teakettle isn't whistling yet, but I think the temperature inside of it is rising rather markedly There is no need to go back over any data; we are all familiar with them As far as I'm concerned, the only question before the house is in the next part of the meeting That is, what is the best way to deal with this situation? "
2294,1994-11-15," Mr Chairman, I have had in mind an intermediate target, if not a final target, of about 100 basis points The question was when and how to get there I have been holding out hope that perhaps we would not have to go too much further than that My preference would have been to do this in stately 50 basis point steps I think that's the more elegant way to proceed But I am afraid that that has been taken off the table Your analysis for the 75 is persuasive, and I would no longer be that comfortable with 50 I also would favor symmetry   Elegant "
2348,1994-12-20," Mr Chairman, in the spirit of ""contain yourself to what you see,"" what I see is what I've heard all morning--a very strong economy where the risks are rather heavily skewed to the up side Let me take just a minute to mention two other matters The first, which has been alluded to a couple of times this morning, is that there may be more substance than many of us think to this whole notion that we have some kind of a new economy with a lower propensity  -24-    12/20/94  toward inflation I am referring to this whole mix of arguments that we may have a lower NAIRU, a new level of competition, world markets with lots of capacity, much higher productivity, and probably less significant wage pressures than one might expect with this level of employment I have had a lot of sympathy with that argument for a long time and spoke to it several times at our meetings during the spring I don't much doubt that that has been present and is present in the mix of the economy right now I think it probably is a significant reason why we have done as well as we have so far relative to the amount of growth and the amount of inflation that we have experienced But I rather doubt that we can depend on that mix of considerations to carry us very much higher in the level of capacity utilization than we already are experiencing without having that mix of considerations exhaust themselves with higher inflationary pressures showing up  The other thing I'd like to mention is that I am worried about and puzzled by the formation of consumer debt I think there has to be a serious downside risk there, either short term or long term Consumer debt is off the charts on the up side in relation to consumer income or net worth, and its growth should slow There are precious few signs that it is slowing so far, but there is a short- term possibility that what we are seeing now is that the consumer is indeed shopping until he or she drops and that maybe the wallet will close after Christmas Inventories could start to build up quickly That is something to watch immediately after Christmas If we don't get some slowing in the near future, then I would worry that that is going to imply some other types of problems further on down the line that could perhaps be even more serious Thank you "
2349,1994-12-20," Mr Chairman, in appreciation for Governor Blinder not giving his thermostat speech I'll forego giving my inflationary teakettle speech! [Laughter] But I do think that given the momentum that we observe that it is overwhelmingly likely that we are going to need to go up at least some more; and it does seem to me that once one becomes convinced of that, then it is desirable to do it quite soon in the expectation that that is the best way to head off having to do too much That said, I think it certainly would be a good idea to hold off until after the year-end pressures At that point, we ought to take another very hard look at it For today, I certainly support your ""B"" asymmetric approach "
2401,1995-03-28, Move it 
2402,1995-03-28," Thank you, Mr Chairman I would like to lean into the wind a little here as several have done, particularly the Vice Chairman when he spoke just a moment ago I don't think there is  -32-    3/28/95  much question that the expansion seems to be slowing right now, and I certainly respect the strong logic in the Greenbook about the expectation for upcoming quarters But I have to say that as of right now, from what I can see today, I am agnostic about the course of the upcoming quarters and the balance of the forecast period While I am not prepared to bet very heavily on it, I surely would not overly discount the possibility that we are going to see a reacceleration here or at least a considerably lesser degree of softening I had a list of factors here; almost all of them have been mentioned One that I would like to repeat was mentioned by the Vice Chairman a minute ago I have never known whether the old saying that history never repeats itself is correct, or the one that says that those who ignore history are doomed to repeat it But we should keep in mind that for the last two years in a row we have had a configuration of a fourth quarter going into a first quarter that looks very much like the one we have right now Certainly, some things are a lot different right at this point, most obviously interest rates, but we have had this kind of configuration for two years--   Three years? I'm sorry I didn't go back far enough in my research The economy is still forming new jobs at a rapid clip--500,000 or so in the first two months The related earnings will be kicking into the spending stream I am not sure what may happen on inventories, but certainly we still have a very low historic inventory-to-sales ratio, which leaves a lot of room to build inventories Factory orders are still strong; backlogs are still rising Nominal rates all along the yield curve are well off their highs, and real rates are certainly down from where they were I don't think we can call the real rates high by any reasonable standard that I can see That may reflect the slowing that we have right now, but it also could set the stage for some reacceleration later I have been anticipating that the consumer would run out of gas before now, and that has clearly been wrong Now it seems that the consumer is still quite solvent With the stronger stock market and bond market that we have had recently, I would expect that confidence will continue to stay high It is still high, maybe a little off its peak, but nevertheless still quite strong It will be interesting to see how the lower dollar plays out As Ted said a few minutes ago, the band of uncertainty is very large But a great many observers feel that the dollar could easily go lower over time from where it is right now, even if the decline may be somewhat overdone on a short-term basis in the last couple of months It seems to me that that could give us an upside surprise on the export side All in all, if you use the baseline forecast in the Greenbook and ask yourself where the risks are around that, at the moment it would seem to me that they are still on the up side, with a meaningfully larger chance that we will see a stronger economy versus the baseline forecast than a weaker economy "
2403,1995-03-28," Mr Chairman, I certainly think there is every reason to ""wait and see"" today I strongly support ""B"" I did speak earlier about my feeling that as of now the risks could be seen as skewed to the up side My understanding of the use of an asymmetric or symmetric directive is exactly the same as you just articulated, Mr Chairman On that basis, it would seem to me that the likelihood of needing to go up further is strong enough that I would prefer an asymmetric directive However, let me say that I think that the emergence of that upside potential, if it does develop, may well be a meeting or two out in front of us So we may really want to wait and see today in the sense of adopting not only ""B"" but also a symmetric directive I could support that, although I would prefer asymmetric "
2455,1995-05-23," As a follow up, would that review also include the absolute size of passes and their impact on the composition of the permanent portfolio?   Right "
2456,1995-05-23," Mr Chairman, it seems to me that we are in a classic wait-and-see period here The expansion is obviously slowing and there are a lot of factors, which have been well aired here this morning, that could take the economy in the direction of either greater near-term or longer-term weakness or strength It is just too early right now to be making firm judgments about what the economy is going to look like over the forecast period In the near term, it would seem to me that the inventory cycle and how that plays out is the dominant factor If final sales hold up, it is hard for me to see how inventories are going to be a terribly big problem Inventory- sales ratios overall are still modest I think there are good reasons to believe that final sales will hold up and maybe rebound some We have the wealth effects from the stock and bond markets Confidence is still high Long rates are down and that should help housing and maybe cars to rebound Those tax refunds that were delayed should kick in here at a very opportune time And particularly if that plays out well, it seems to me that the out-period risks continue to be largely on the high side That has been stated in a number of contexts by several people who have spoken already, and I am still very much in that camp So, I think we are some distance away--I am not sure how far, of course--from a decision point But in my view we are at least one meeting, maybe a number of meetings away Thank you "
2457,1995-05-23," Mr Chairman, I support ""B"" symmetric "
2508,1995-08-22, Second   Second    8/22/95 
2509,1995-08-22," Thank you, Mr Chairman There is no doubt that the Greenbook is not exactly correct It never is; it can't be and it's not expected to be But that said, I think the staff did an exceptionally good job this time around in assessing what I see as a very tricky period I find the economy that they project to be highly credible I also think that it's a very acceptable one at this time but not permanently By not permanently I mean that over the longer term we still have to keep the inflation rate on a secular downward path We are not at price level stability yet, and we are still determined to get there  What do I mean by acceptable at this time? Well, I think there are many very big questions out there whose answers are going to have to unfold over the coming months Virtually every one on my list has been discussed this morning, and it's rather awesome After all the rhetoric runs its course, what is really going to be the deficit reduction that we are going to have to deal with? Second, has the NAIRU changed and if so by how much? Third, have productivity trends really improved as many think? If we are on a higher trend, how much higher and is it a sustainable one? Fourth, a lot of the good results that we are getting now, I don't know how much, has to do with the so- called traumatized worker How long is the American workforce going to remain quiescent without the compensation increases that it thinks it should get? When employment is as strong as it is right now, I don't think we can depend on having permanently favorable results in that area This has been a rather big key to the present happy macro situation where we have a high capacity utilization rate and a relatively low inflation rate We all feel rather good about that Fifth, will households continue to take on more debt? That obviously is the key to consumer spending Consumer debt is rising again toward its all-time high of several years ago We all know that in many past years we had a much lower level of consumer debt than we are carrying now One has to wonder if people are going to want to return, at least partially, to those standards of prior years Then, of course, there is the matter of whether or not we are overstating inflation and if so by how much That was a very interesting but not particularly critical question when we were at higher levels of inflation, but as we begin to move into the zone that could be considered price level stability, that question starts to become very important indeed  -25    8/22/95  The answers to all these questions, and more I am sure, are going to have everything to do with shaping monetary policy as we go along into the future How is it going to shape up? I certainly don't know, but the point is that for now it seems to me that we have a good balance in the economy and we are moving toward an appropriate degree of momentum That puts us in good shape to await the unfolding answers to some of these critical questions and in a pretty good position, I would hope, to be able to react appropriately as those answers start to become available "
2510,1995-08-22," As do I, Mr Chairman "
2565,1995-09-26," Mr Chairman, I am pretty much where Gary Stern was but maybe in terms that are a little different I certainly support the thrust of this bill unequivocally in that it gives primacy to price stability as a means toward a larger end But I am not totally comfortable with virtually any hard-wired legislation that I can think of, even with legislation that is as flexible as this bill appears to be The good news is that it is consistent with what we have been doing, what we foresee we would like to do, and it eliminates the onerous provisions of Humphrey-Hawkins I am a little concerned that over time, in ways that we can't foresee, we might very well have some combination of economic and possibly political circumstances that could inhibit us in the pursuit of an appropriate monetary policy if this legislation were in place The alternative would be to get us back into a situation where we might have a law that we would have to ignore as we have ignored certain aspects of the Humphrey-Hawkins law for very good reasons I think ignoring a law that remains on the books over a long period of time is completely unacceptable, and I would hate to remain in that situation in the context of new legislation   If flexibility is the objective, then ultimate flexibility would be not to have any legislation at all  SPEAKER(?) That will never happen! "
2566,1995-09-26," I am not going to try to pick up on that analogy!   Let me make a brief intervention because like so many others and the way Mike Prell started this morning, I see very little change from where we were in August Relative to the Greenbook, I continue to believe that the risks, if that is the proper word, are on the up side and I am in the camp that would be closer to the more bullish of the three scenarios that Mike Prell presented this morning, for all the reasons that he discussed  I would like to offer a thought or two about the fiscal deficit situation First of all, 1996 is an election year, and we are talking about deficit reductions that would be put in place by legislation that is not yet passed, although the new fiscal year is upon us Assuming they do get passed, it will take some time to get them largely in place So, I would be surprised if it turned out that there was a great deal of additional fiscal drag in the year 1996 It also is worth noting that in the last three fiscal years the deficit has come down from a level in excess of $280 billion to probably less than $160 billion in fiscal 1995 That is a lot of deficit reduction in a 3-year time period And yet we had 3 percent plus real GDP growth in 1993 and 4 percent plus growth in 1994, and 1994 was the year when the biggest part of that deficit reduction took place Deficit reduction has a lot of positive impacts, and in the aggregate whatever deficit reduction does take place--and I hope a program will be enacted--I think there is every expectation that its negative effects can easily be overcome by all the positive impacts that get thrown off from it In August I remarked on what seemed to be an exceptional number of rather basic questions that, taken together, are largely going to dictate the nature of monetary policy in the years to come They include issues concerning the trend in fiscal policy, the level of the NAIRU, the need for improved measurement of the inflation rate, the trend of productivity, the longevity of this absence of wage pressures that we see today, and the persistence of household debt formation It is going to take a while for a lot of these things to play out, but I do think we are in a good position right now to wait and see how all this evolves Thank you "
2567,1995-09-26," I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman, for many of the reasons that were mentioned by Presidents Melzer, Parry, and Hoenig "
2626,1995-11-15, Second 
2627,1995-11-15," Thank you, Mr Chairman I must say that I welcome the more optimistic projection in the Greenbook this time For what it is worth, my judgment would be right with the staff  -36-    11/15/95  Despite the long-in-the-tooth expansion that we have had, I have believed and continue to believe that there is more potential for upside surprise than downside I am sure it is not an immutable law of economics, but it seems to me that the US economy has a natural tendency to rise unless something pushes it down On balance, I don't see anything right now that looks to be sufficiently strong to produce that result If you look down the list of the different elements of GDP, and Al Broaddus ran through that list to some extent a while ago, on balance it looks moderately positive with some components being stronger than others, as one would expect That is what the Greenbook says; that is where they are  That said on the optimistic side, I must say that I do want to identify with Governor Lindsey on his remarks about consumer debt He has done a lot more serious work on it than I But I have been, and I think Larry has been, crying ""wolf"" on this subject for some months now Obviously, we have been premature so far, but I think some day we are going to have a reckoning on this I don't know when that might be or how it might play out when it comes Perhaps because I feel a little bit bruised about having been Chicken Little so far, my best guess is that it is probably going to be out beyond our present forecast period If we are going to get a shock, I think that could be where it will come from It does seem to me that it is going to take a shock to push this economy into unacceptable economic sluggishness We live in a dangerous world, of course, and the potential shocks are out there Consumer debt is one of them We can easily identify others One is what is going on politically right now, and what impact that might have One can envision a shock from fiscal drag, although I certainly cannot see that happening in 1996 at this point Net exports could be disappointing; I hope not At any rate, if we get a shock, it is difficult to anticipate where or when it might come If we get a shock, we will just have to deal with that Other than that I have to say I am pretty optimistic  On the inflation side, with the very high utilization rates of our human and physical resources, I think we have been getting remarkably good results It is a little difficult for me to see how the inflation picture is going to improve, although I guess in recent months it has had a slight tendency to improve Maybe today's news will be a straw in the wind in the other direction But so far, it is very difficult to see much by way of upside push there I do think that given our high utilization level, an upside risk potential could become apparent as time goes on, and we will have to be very careful about that going forward "
2628,1995-11-15," It looks the way it should!   Mr Chairman, I can see the argument that the real fed funds rate may be a tad on the high side, but I have to say that so far it's hard to see where it has put much of damper on credit extensions or the stock market or the housing market I can easily envision the possibility that events may unfold, conceivably fairly quickly, that will make a policy change desirable, but I certainly favor ""no change"" for now There are two broad reasons in my mind for having an asymmetric directive, the second building on the first The first is to send a signal about some imminent perceived risk The second is to facilitate an imminent policy move I just don't see either of those as germane right now, and consequently I would strongly prefer a symmetric directive   We are now averaging down!

2680,1995-12-19," Mr Chairman, it does seem that fourth-quarter growth is somewhat slower than the torrid pace of the third quarter, and that slowing may be in response to that torrid pace But I continue to be quite optimistic that this slowing is not very likely to be indicative of an undue weakness beginning to set in I certainly concur with the thrust of Mike Prell's briefing earlier I  -22-    12/19/95  think there are some important trends that are going to have an impact in the near term and a little further out in the future stemming from the remarkable decline that we have had in long-term interest rates over the last year We still seem to be able to create jobs in this country at a rate of roughly 100,000 per month, and the unemployment rate has stayed steady at 5-1/2 percent Credit availability still seems to be quite ample Debt formation is going forward a bit more slowly than the very rapid pace of a few quarters ago, but that is welcome Retail sales are certainly unexciting; the anecdotal evidence about Christmas sales is not strong, but the most recent monthly data that we have, for November, were really rather good So, that sector of the economy may be all right, and I think with the lower interest rates, housing is going to be all right and probably autos as well Consumer sentiment continues to be strong, a bit off its highs perhaps but still strong So, these developments and others leave me pretty comfortable with the Greenbook forecast, which essentially showed no change from November I liked it then and I like it now Basically, it calls for growth near potential as the highest probability  We have to ponder what might change this outlook As far as an upside breakout goes, it is difficult for me to see where that is liable to come from in the foreseeable future I would think that an upside breakout would have a fairly low probability There is always the possibility of shocks, and if we get one of those, we will have to deal with it But it would seem to me that if one wants to focus on a concern, we might see in the further reaches of the forecast period a general exhaustion at the margin of growth-creating demand, maybe a weakening of investment I don't see that as a very high probability in the next several quarters But further out in the forecast period, I think that concern grows because we do have a very mature expansion on our hands  On the inflation front, I think everyone has remarked, and everyone realizes, that inflation continues to be remarkably well contained I am particularly impressed with the way that unit labor costs continue to behave Productivity is still growing very nicely, and the ECI is flat In the inflation area, the foreign outlook certainly appears benign, and commodities generally have behaved well recently In sum, I just don't see strong pressures on policy at this time, one way or the other This leaves us with the rather rare luxury of having a bit of rather low-risk discretionary room to maneuver I think the question for the next half of the meeting is going to be how we intend to use that "
2681,1995-12-19," Mr Chairman, I certainly support your recommendation As I said earlier, I see no strong pressures for a change in monetary policy at this moment one way or the other, and under those conditions my normal instinct would be to not move I think the risks are symmetric and relatively small at this point But of course we know policy does work with a lag and as this expansion continues to mature, I think the risks are more likely to turn to the down side as time goes along As a consequence, I can support 25 basis points as a useful and modest move I certainly concur with the spirit of your proposed statement "
2727,1996-03-26," Thank you, Mr Chairman It seems to me that economic activity is tracking along the Greenbook path about as we had expected and hoped I want to associate myself particularly with Ed Boehne's comment that the remarkable resilience of this economy has been the most interesting development recently This certainly is not surprising, but it is highly gratifying Perhaps the only surprise is the very early and rather strong reemergence of strength in the economy, and along with that a more credible upside risk and its mirror image, a little alleviation of the downside risk going forward This seems to leave us with a high likelihood of a quite satisfactory economic performance in the period ahead I agree with Vice Chairman McDonough that the risks appear to be symmetric, perhaps not terribly strong at this point, but it seems to me that they are moving in the upside direction My main concern at the moment is that all of this looks just a little too neat and too pat I can't quite trust it We know that challenges are going to emerge, and I suspect they probably will arise somewhat sooner rather than later We will just have to be alert to what those challenges turn out to be and when they are going to appear  -16-    3/26/96   We must be in great shape if we are having a break at 930 am! "
2728,1996-03-26," I concur with your recommendation, Mr Chairman "
2773,1996-05-21," Mr Chairman, I would like to associate myself with Governor Lindsey and Governor Yellen as an opportunist I think there are a couple of other problems with this exercise When we are looking ahead in terms of an expected result, that is a forecast We come out with a point estimate forecast for that period in time I think setting a goal is a different exercise For one thing, people set goals differently One of the pleasures of my job is that I get to discuss goals with all 12 Reserve Banks They all have a different definition of how to set goals, and I don't know why that should not be true here Some people believe in setting a goal that involves a lot of stretch, making it literally unachievable, so the issue is how close they can come to it Others like to set goals that can be achieved with just a reasonable degree of effort Both of those approaches are valid as long as people know which one is which, which one to follow If we tried to establish a goal as a Committee of 19 people, I am not sure how we would do it  Secondly, my working vision of how this opportunistic approach works is to get ourselves, as we have, into a downward sloping channel We expect to have a little fluctuation inside that channel with regard to the performance of various indicators, but inflation would be pointed downward toward price level stability How we articulate exactly what inflation will be as a point estimate at a future point in time using an opportunistic strategy is a little difficult for me to conceive So, exactly how one sets a goal in a quantitative sense if one is basically of an opportunistic inclination is a little difficult for me to see "
2774,1996-05-21," Thank you, Mr Chairman I believe we may just now be entering a very tricky and important period The Greenbook shows a very near-term deceleration in GDP growth to a 2 percent annual rate Despite that, the staff foresees, as do many others here, an inflationary creep even without a minimum wage bill If we get that bill, I think the rise in inflation might come sooner and become stronger In my view, we have been riding the crest of a really remarkable period Growth has been satisfactory We have had an unemployment rate of around 5-1/2 percent, which of course is seen as being at or below the NAIRU, for well over six quarters now GDP is at or near potential In spite of that, inflation has remained quiescent We certainly do not have the price level stability that we want to achieve, but inflation nevertheless has been flat and relatively low So far, no significant trend is visible in the statistics The Greenbook and other forecasters project some change in this starting very soon--in the third quarter--and going forward through the forecast period and beyond We are all very jealous of the progress that we have made; we certainly want more; and we probably would see a persistent rise in inflation, even if it were a slow rise, as very dangerous The question is whether it will happen and if so, when  If we look at GDP growth in recent quarters and the Greenbook forecast for the upcoming quarters and include the 35 percent growth rate projected by the staff for the current quarter, we find that the average for this quarter and the previous three quarters is a growth rate of 25 percent However, GDP growth has been accelerating over the last three quarters If one looks at this quarter and the next three as projected in the Greenbook, they average a little more than 24 percent but display a slowing trend That is the projection The big downshift in GDP growth is expected to come in the period immediately ahead, in the third quarter, after which such growth is projected to flatten and stay around 2 percent It seems to me that this outlook is quite credible, quite likely It seems to be centered on sectors like housing, capital investment, net exports, and government expenditures We have seen long rates rise; we have seen the dollar rise; we have seen the deficit go down, so this outlook is quite plausible If we get that pattern, it seems to me that it is also plausible that inflation might continue being dormant We may even find that the economy's potential is a bit higher, closer to the 24 percent or 25 percent growth that we have been experiencing and expect to experience on average With such growth rates, inflation might remain benign, and that would be an extremely positive development On the other hand, if the economy continues to be stronger than expected, as we have seen recently, and if it stays this strong much longer, we certainly could face a highly increasing likelihood of greater and perhaps somewhat more virulent inflation than is projected in the Greenbook  -21-    5/21/96  I will close where I began I think that we are possibly at a very important watershed There are some very important months immediately ahead "
2775,1996-05-21," Mr Chairman, as I said a little earlier, I think we are approaching but are not quite yet at a watershed, and as a consequence I don't have a view at this point concerning what way the water is going to flow when it flows Clearly, there has been a shifting of the risks to the up side On the other hand, it is a clearly plausible prospect that we will get a distinct slowing in the expansion rather soon If we do get that slowing, it seems to me that the history of the past two or three years has to give us some pause about just how ""baked in the cake"" an inflationary rise may be It could well turn out that if we get a distinct slowing, we will continue to see a pattern of stable inflation At any rate, it doesn't seem to me that time is of the essence at this point I think ""watchful waiting"" makes good sense I prefer symmetry for precisely the reasons that Ed Boehne just stated, and I won't repeat them But I must say that, for all of this, I am sitting very lightly in the chair about this business, and I would not object to asymmetry "
2827,1996-08-20," Thank you, Mr Chairman In the fourth quarter of 1994 the unemployment rate dropped rather precipitously from 6 percent and above, where it had been for some time previously, down into the 5-1/2 percent range where it has been ever since It also was right around that time that capacity utilization in manufacturing began to drop from its peak of around 843 down into the low 82s For the past eight quarters, including this one, we have been pretty close to living in an economic nirvana GDP growth has been right on trend 4 quarters over 2 percent, 1 quarter at 2 percent, 3 quarters under 1  -27-    8/20/96  percent The economy has been operating either at or very close to capacity with very little, if any, gap between potential and actual output Unemployment has been steady at around 55 percent, capacity utilization as I noted has been declining slowly, inflation is flat to down, core CPI has averaged 285 percent If it turns out that the core CPI has been overstated by a percentage point or so, that means that we have been even closer to an economic nirvana Other measures such as the deflator and the chain indexes have been lower in absolute levels but the trend has looked the same The expectation going forward in the Greenbook is for more of almost the same through 1997 capacity utilization steady at 82 percent, unemployment steady at 54 percent, and GDP growth right on trend at 21 percent At least that is close enough to trend for government work Government work, you know, is defined as measuring with a micrometer, marking with chalk, and then cutting with an axe [Laughter] But there is one big difference in the forecast that we have been discussing That is that inflation will start to rise, and that is projected to start to happen right about now The Greenbook shows the core CPI moving up to 3 percent this quarter and to 32 percent next year That would represent a half percentage point jump in a year's time, and I presume that if the forecast were extended, the trend would continue to be up from there, ceteris paribus Now, that certainly would not be acceptable to me or probably to anyone else in this room And I am afraid that the 3 percent increase that we got in the CPI in July could be a harbinger of things to come  If we are going to get this rise in inflation, how would it happen? We have been discussing all morning that it would be through rising compensation costs that would get passed upstream into prices If that is going to happen, several things in some combination have to occur First, the rising wages obviously have to drive unit production costs up materially We do see that beginning to happen, possibly through the ECI and certainly the new minimum wage law But the increase in production costs will have to be high enough to overcome productivity growth, which I continue to believe is under measured, and the flatter benefit costs that the Vice Chairman spoke about a few minutes ago That certainly could occur There is no doubt about that But the other question is whether some pricing power will begin to re-emerge in the economy We still have a world with a lot of slack in almost every economic sector There still seems to be fierce competition everywhere in the domestic economy I have not heard of any easing in the consumer's fierce resistance to price increases Also for this to happen, it would have to imply that business would be able to refuse to compromise their very strong profit margins Historically, of course, they have compromised them when they needed to I suppose that it would also imply the likelihood or need for a lower dollar These conditions for pricing power to re-emerge are not in view insofar as I can see  Nevertheless, could all of this come together and perhaps result in an inflationary surge? Yes, indeed; I do not think there is any doubt about that But can we be confident that is what will happen, especially very soon or starting now? On the basis of the long-term historical record, I think we probably would be persuaded that that is in fact extremely likely But on the basis of developments over the past two years, it is a little more difficult to be convinced It is quite possible that we could roll on along like we are for some time I do not know how long, certainly What  -28-    8/20/96  happens then is virtually anyone's guess in such a period Admittedly, that is a very sanguine outlook, and frankly I am not a bit comfortable with it It is dependent almost entirely on an early and substantial slowdown in the expansion, and I have a special concern in that regard given the possibility of a new inventory surge But the slowdown has to happen if that happy outlook is to ensue It seems to me that the risks are distinctly on the up side, but for the moment I would say let us continue to give it a chance "
2828,1996-08-20," I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman "
2879,1996-09-24," Why don't you hire some decent help? [Laughter]   Thank you, Mr Chairman I think I am well aware and I am certainly deeply respectful of the arguments that would say that inflation is likely to rise and that policy should move now or perhaps sooner than now to prevent it Of course, this view is based, as we have been discussing, on two central facts--that the economy is very fully utilized and that compensation is increasing as a consequence These conditions clearly exist  I want no part of an inflationary rise I am sure no one here does But I also see a number of factors that have forced me to question whether such an event is inevitable, at least anytime soon or to a meaningful degree We have been talking about all of the reasons in prior meetings and again this morning in some detail I will not run through my laundry list; it is much the same as we have been discussing I would say that on balance I just do not see the evidence that moves me away from the judgment that I have been making for some time There continues to be, as has been discussed, no visible sign of rising price inflation yet If anything, it is continuing to go down, as Governor Meyer pointed out I think there are many tell-tale indicators, precursors, that would show that there are very few signs of inflation actually in the pipeline Unit labor costs are down from 1995 and they are forecasted to go down further Foreign inflation is benign Inflationary expectations are flat We see very little delivery tightness Commodity prices are flat to down Real interest rates are flat in a neutral zone And it does appear that we are getting the slowing in GDP growth that I think we felt was essential to maintain a steady policy We will see how that develops  With all of this said, I think nonetheless that the risks are clearly on the high side, and I continue to sit very lightly in my chair I did not arrive at this judgment easily, but I would say that I believe we should continue to give this thing a chance "
2880,1996-09-24," I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman "
2934,1996-11-13," I move it, Mr Chairman "
2935,1996-11-13," Thank you, Mr Chairman I would like to say first of all that comments around the table at these meetings are always insightful and very interesting, but I have found that to be particularly true this morning and I greatly appreciate it It also would appear that the discussion is moving along rather smartly today; we may get coffee at a more reasonable hour than we sometimes do! By my calculation, I am the clean-up hitter and I have very little to add to what has been said  Let me just summarize very briefly I share the strong general concern around the table that the tight labor markets and the attendant rise in wages could very well lead to price increases That still could very well happen, but we see very little evidence of such a development so far, and we will just have to watch that very closely The one big thing that is new this time, as we had hoped and expected, is that we now have confirmation that the expansion has slowed Looking ahead, our attention obviously must shift to whether the expansion is in line for a reacceleration with the dangers that  -27-    11/13/96  would be attendant to that, whether it will rock along near trend, plus or minus a bit, or whether indeed the economy may be in the early stages of a somewhat more serious slowdown The point has been made, and I share it, that as time goes on and events unfold, the risks are becoming more symmetric We cannot tell yet, and I am not prepared to adopt a symmetric point of view at this juncture, but it may be that we will be thinking quite soon of returning to a symmetric directive For now, it would certainly appear that the remarkable economic performance that we have seen for some time is continuing We should watch it closely and continue to let it run Thank you "
2936,1996-11-13," I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman, and I also support the sentiments regarding symmetry expressed by Governor Rivlin and President McTeer "
2987,1996-12-17," Mr Chairman, I have very little to add this morning, and I will be very brief As we know, this was a very short intermeeting interval, and it seems to me that the incoming data have had very little significance for policy in the short run So, I believe that on balance the economic situation very much calls for the status quo The Greenbook always makes for fascinating reading, but I have to say that the current edition is as bland as any I have seen since I have been here, which I do not mean as a complaint or a criticism That is the way things are We continue to be in a period of watchful waiting; that is what seems to be appropriate in my view This period is not going to go on forever, but it does seem to continue at least for now I would like to add that I think that the risks continue to become a little more symmetric, but I am in no rush to change the direction of the intermeeting bias Thank you "
2988,1996-12-17," I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman "
3039,1997-03-25, Second 
3040,1997-03-25," Thank you, Mr Chairman For a number of meetings now, the  economy has seemed to be deja vu For some time, we have felt that we were looking at a  fully utilized economy, one with tight and tightening labor markets that seemed likely to    3/25/97  begin to show escalating labor costs and from there escalating inflation--in short, an  overheating economy But that has not happened so far In fact, inflation is flat to down  according to many statistical series Our expectation has been that the expansion would slow  to growth at about trend and that this might allow us to experience a quiescent inflation rate  for some period of time or indefinitely This is a very rosy scenario It certainly has seemed  quite plausible, and it has been working for a long time Our policy has been to stay alert,  stay asymmetric, but basically to wait and see While I have never been very comfortable  with it, I certainly have been solidly in that camp  But now I think the very strong first quarter that we seem to be experiencing calls  into question the continued viability of that scenario Growth for the past four quarters  including this one is going to be somewhere in excess of 3-1/2 percent That is certainly well  beyond anybody's estimate of potential in an economy whose resources already seem to be  fully utilized And it now seems that there is very little that is likely to slow that growth  materially We talked about all the factors this morning job formation and the purchasing  power that it creates, surprisingly strong construction, both residential and nonresidential,  sky-high consumer confidence with jobs plentiful, and supportive wealth effects If  consumer spending should slow in the near future, I think we probably would get an  inventory pop that would keep things going Certainly, there is a potential for slower growth  if we were to get a stronger dollar or a bear stock market There are other potential shocks I  am sure, but they seem to have a considerably lower probability  The very strong and persistent job formation that we have seen is very likely in my  view to start to take its toll on costs The unemployment rate has been held up as high as it  is by the fact that the labor force has been growing at an unexpectedly high rate The labor    3/25/97  force participation rate is now at a record high, I believe, or very close to it If the rapid  growth of the labor force were to slow, the unemployment rate would probably go down  substantially and costs would probably and perhaps inevitably rise But if that labor force  growth somehow continues, we will have to wonder about the quality of the new labor and  what is going to happen to productivity and costs as a result Certainly, there is some other  combination of potential developments in the labor market Some employers who are not  chasing their firm's stock price will simply restrain production, slow growth down rather  than allow their costs to rise I am sure that many will be able to keep their productivity  growing There are employers who are causing jobs to migrate to lower cost areas, though it  looks as if Utah is off the list [Laughter] Many are going offshore That is happening, but  we have to wonder whether there is likely to be enough of that to affect aggregate indicators  of economic performance There certainly are a lot of things or combinations of things that  could stretch out the benign era that we are in But given what we see happening in the  economy right now, what we know about the utilization rate of economic resources, and what  seem to me to be the highest probabilities in coming quarters, it may soon be time for us to  consider pulling up stakes and moving the camp to higher ground [Laughter]   I started to say something like that, Mr Chairman, but I thought  that was just taking it too far   I would not want to see us get under water [Laughter] "
3041,1997-03-25," Mr Chairman, I support the 25 basis points and I support the  symmetrical directive on its merits   Mr Chairman, one suggestion for your consideration   About two sentences from the bottom, you list inflation first and  growth second I would suggest reversing the order in which you say those two things   We have to do that for sure "
3083,1997-05-20," Thank you, Mr Chairman Earlier when President McTeer was  about to begin the ""tour de table,"" reference was made to the recent episode of the so-called  ""Republic of Texas"" If I understood President McTeer correctly, his reply was that the  Republic of Texas and the Eleventh District are about the same thing As Chairman of the  Bank Affairs Committee, I can verify that that is correct [Laughter]  The outlook for the balance of this year and next appears to be heavily weighted in  the direction of offering a very attractive period of continued growth, a high level of  utilization of the economy's resources, and an inflation rate that may begin to growl but  almost certainly not to roar Given that likelihood, I think it is appropriate to focus, as the  Greenbook does at the end of its first section, on the forces that might be influencing the  trend of events going into 1999 and out from there Addressing the latter point, how should  we think about policy for 1999 and forward?    5/20/97  Let me outline briefly two strands of thought in the context of our national  economic goal of maximum sustainable growth, which we at the Fed believe requires price  level stability as a prerequisite for success First of all, we reversed policy at the last  meeting After holding our fire for many quarters in the face of rising labor market  pressures, seeing a very strong surge of activity in the first quarter, which was counter to  expectations, the FOMC raised the federal funds rate by 25 basis points In absolute terms,  this is a modest move, but such impact as it will have has not yet fully been felt I believe it  carried two meaningful psychological messages First, there is a new policy paradigm in the  sense that the basic thrust of monetary policy is now toward tightening And second, the Fed  continues to have no intention of permitting inflation to get a grip on the economy I am  entirely comfortable with that decision In my opinion, it clearly was the right thing to do  With that decision behind us, where do we stand today? The pace of economic  activity, while still moving forward, appears to be slowing The employment cost index  moved up modestly in the first quarter Most commodity prices are flat to down Unit labor  costs do not appear to be accelerating Profit margins continue to be strong and deterioration  there should provide us with an early warning of inflationary change There appears to be no  fear of inflation embedded in the yield curve As I peruse the Beigebook, I have to go back  to check the date because it continues to read precisely the same as it has for well over a year  My best judgment from all of this is that growth will continue, and we are seeing likely but  not definitive signs of incipient inflationary creep But in terms of our stated national  economic goal, that does not seem to pose a clear and present danger  Moving to line-of-thought number two In the absence of a settled notion of the  definition of price level stability, I think a responsible judgment can be made that we are now    5/20/97  either in that zone or very close to it If the CPI measurement is about a percentage point too  high, the real CPI is now increasing at a rate between 1 and 2 percent Almost all the other  price indexes indicate a steady rate of inflation in the 1 to 2 percent range, although some  measures, including the core CPI, suggest that inflation may be beginning to edge up The  Chairman's qualitative definition of price stability, namely that we are there when inflation  concerns are removed from economic decisionmaking, appears largely to be in place If we  are in or very close to the price stability zone, again in terms of national economic goals, the  relevant question becomes how we hold the economy there and keep it robust  First of all, if higher-than-trend growth continues or resumes soon--and it well  may; I think the growth risks are on the upside--that clearly would seem to require additional  tightening, perhaps a good deal of it But if the economy returns to a trend rate of growth or  slower than trend, there may be a significant probability, given the economy's performance  characteristics over the past two years as a guide, that we will not need to adjust policy for  some time and indeed there is no absolute certainty as to which direction we may ultimately  move Further, we do not satisfactorily understand why the economy is working so well  right now If we were to cut its momentum back too much too soon, we might forego a  precious opportunity to learn more about what could be some critically important new  realities In my view, the risk/return ratio of alternative policies evaluated against national  economic goals provides ample reason for waiting to see what happens as events unfold  Thank you "
3084,1997-05-20," Mr Chairman, I had intended to say something much like what  President Boehne just said Let me simply associate myself with his remarks and concur  with your recommendation "
3127,1997-08-19," Thank you, Mr Chairman In the seven weeks since we last met, I have  been doing my best to search the data and read and listen as carefully as I could to see if I can come  up with any convincing information that indicates things are beginning to change Other than    8/19/97  various straws in the wind, I just cannot find any There certainly are some straws in the wind Al  Broaddus mentioned some important ones that would indicate some strengthening in economic  activity, and others have as well But it should be mentioned that there also are some straws in the  wind blowing in the other direction that would indicate a possible slowing or at least not very much  acceleration in economic activity, and possibly some easing in inflationary pressures The dollar  has continued to strengthen on balance; long-term interest rates have eased on balance; the yield  curve is flatter and lower; the PPI has fallen for seven straight months; inventory growth has been  too strong; consumer sentiment is still quite high but is off its peak; gold prices--for anyone who is  interested--are lower; capacity utilization is down a little; and non-oil import prices are expected to  continue soft There are straws in the wind that are swirling, I would guess, in all directions  I have no intention whatsoever of climbing into any of Peter Fisher's boxes, [Laughter]  but I must say that we should be careful about making too much fun of the so-called new paradigm  pessimists because I don't think that deflation is completely impossible All in all, the message to  me is that the risks are probably still moderately to the upside, and we should, and will certainly,  stay very alert But basically, it is steady as she goes "
3128,1997-08-19," Leave it alone   Well, Mr Chairman, I would say that you are in error in one respect It  is not everybody's second choice It is my first choice   I accept, Mr Chairman "
3177,1997-09-30," Thank you, Mr Chairman As we head for coffee in the next couple of  minutes, it seems to me that my notes may be a bit of a composite of what has been said around the  table As I began to focus on this meeting, I asked myself first and foremost ""what is new?"" The  answer that came back is ""so far, not much"" The data story today seems to me to be very much as  it has been for some period of time now strong growth, tighter labor markets, and very little  evidence of pressure on unit costs or prices As I look at the inflationary pipeline to try to get some  clue of what may be coming our way, it is very hard to find very much in the way of new pressure  There is some, but not very much  With regard to indicators of economic activity, we are all very conscious of what is  happening in the labor market We have been discussing that at length On the other hand, we see  no pressure on unit labor costs In my view, I don't see much pressure emerging in capacity  utilization, except perhaps New York hotel rooms, Bill (McDonough)!   With respect to financial indicators, one can find very little pressure in  the yield curve or in interest rate levels On the other hand, household wealth continues to rise and  there is abundant liquidity in the economy From the foreign side, there seems to be very little in    9/30/97  the way of new pressure, and from the side of commodities or what one might call goods inputs,  none at all  So, on its face, the appropriate policy once again looks like steady as she goes,  asymmetric, high alert In short, little visibly has changed And yet, one has to feel, or at least I do,  a certain heightening tension driven mainly by the fact that the slowdown we had been expecting  did not happen It is not happening now, and there seems to be very little likelihood that it is going  to unless it gets a boost or a jolt from here or elsewhere During the past four quarters, growth has  averaged 38 percent, which is very strong Unemployment has come down over that period from  53 to 48 percent And no matter how guilty one may feel about harboring heretical notions about  lower NAIRUs or higher productivity or shifting paradigms or whatever, one thing for sure, as  many people have observed, is that there are limits somewhere What is going to keep the  economy from pushing right through them, wherever they are? There is plenty of liquidity  available at reasonable rates We are beginning to worry about M2 Household wealth continues to  rise; consumers are very confident; jobs are abundant Our foreign trade prospects seem to be  favorable for more domestic growth There is no meaningful fiscal drag The Greenbook calls for  two more strong quarters before any slowing occurs, and when it does occur, it is at least in part  being pushed by the possibility of a stock market break and rising interest rates  Mr Chairman, at the last meeting you commented that there are signs that we may be  running out the string, and it seems to me that those signs are multiplying "
3178,1997-09-30," I concur, Mr Chairman "
3222,1997-11-12," Thank you, Mr Chairman Most of the incoming evidence we have  been talking about suggests that the economy is continuing to grow very robustly, quite likely  well beyond what even an optimist like me would like to think of as sustainable growth  Certainly, it is true that there are widespread and credible expectations of a more or less  spontaneous slowdown Inflation indexes continue to come in remarkably subdued, and I must  say that it is hard to see how monetary policy could be falling behind the curve, at least so far    11/12/97 83  Nonetheless, absent extraordinary circumstances, I for one would be wrestling strenuously this  morning with a question of whether or not the time had arrived for preemptory action  However, as we know and have been discussing, extraordinary circumstances do exist  in the form of turbulence in Asia and excessive volatility in many financial markets We will not  be able to judge for some time what the fallout of all these events may be, but it is certainly  highly likely that they will act to some degree to damp the pace of the expansion I can readily  envision the possibility that the impact, once all of these dominoes have fallen, would be at or  perhaps beyond the severe end of the range that we presently envision If those events were  coupled with a policy tightening, this instability could easily ignite a very undesirable and  excessive chain reaction This concern, together with the comforting belief that our policy is not  falling behind the curve at this time--although I must say I am not nearly so sanguine as I was  earlier about that--presents anew the line of reasoning that leads me to the same old conclusion,  ""steady as she goes"" "
3223,1997-11-12," Wrestle   I am sensitive to that!   I concur with your recommendation, Mr Chairman "
3277,1997-12-16," Thank you, Mr Chairman At our November meeting, at least some  of us were thinking hard about tightening policy in the face of very strong economic growth, but  we were deterred from doing so by the problems of Asia The Asian turbulence, the severity of  which was and still is difficult to judge, introduced major uncertainties, and we felt it unwise to  stir that bubbling pot further with a shift in policy Basically, I believe that constraint still holds  The domestic economy still looks quite strong, with what has come to be a rather standard array  of driving factors Those factors still seem to shift about but not to weaken on balance  Inflation, of course, remains dormant at this time However, we do face some important  changes The Asian concerns have intensified substantially, and their likely impact on our GDP  appears to be growing I, for one, would bet that the news is likely to get worse before the crisis  is over For the domestic economy, the Greenbook and many analysts see a slowing in prospect  that goes well beyond the Asia impact It is driven by reductions in rates of growth in    12/16/97 55  investments by businesses and households and a slowing in inventory accumulation To make  this bet, I would ask for somewhat better odds, but there is a good probability of such an  outcome  So, I find myself once again favoring a ""steady as she goes policy"" but with these  added thoughts Number one, upside risks seem to me to have moderated a bit while, number  two, significant downside concerns have now emerged Taken together, while quite substantial  in both directions, those risks seem roughly in balance This is indeed a remarkable time Thank  you "
3278,1997-12-16," Mr Chairman, as I said earlier, I think this is a remarkable time in the  sense that we face very substantial risks, both up and down This leads me to support strongly  your proposal for a ""B"" symmetric directive But there is another interesting reason for  symmetry this time It relates to some asymmetries that I see in terms of the time frames within  which these different sets of risks might present themselves The downside risks primarily  revolve around the Asian situation, and if that situation blows up and forces some kind of policy  easing move, that is liable to happen reasonably soon and probably fairly dramatically On the  other hand, the upside risks that have been with us for a long time are liable to emerge over the  longer term and more slowly As a consequence, we would have a better opportunity to respond  if that is the way to go So, the short-term risks seem to me to be more on the downside, and we  presently have an asymmetric directive toward tightening I would prefer not to face the  prospect, should it emerge, of going all the way from an asymmetric directive toward tightening  to an easing move in an intermeeting period If we were to adopt a symmetric directive now, I    12/16/97 83  believe we would then be very well positioned to respond to whatever might emerge as time goes  on, whenever it might emerge Thank you "
3329,1998-03-31," Thank you, Mr Chairman We are reaching the time of the day when  all has been said Between the briefings and the excellent comments that we have heard around  the table this morning, I think we have a good understanding of where the economy is and what  the issues are, and I'm not going to repeat all of that Let me just add that I see very little, if any,  evidence that this expansion is slowing now or likely to slow very much It seems to have a  tremendous amount of momentum Consumer confidence is sky high Employment conditions  are superb Personal income and the wealth effect are very strong The cost and availability of  credit are attractive Inflation fears seem to be diminishing It seems likely to me that it would  take a very substantial shock to slow this economic expansion down very much, let alone bring  to an end this era of very strong and attractive economic growth  We have focused on two potential shocks to the economy that are an important key to  the outlook--Asia and the stock market In the case of Asia, I have no doubt that we will get a    3/31/98  We have focused on two potential shocks to the economy that are an important key to  the outlook--Asia and the stock market In the case of Asia, I have no doubt that we will get a  trade shock As Vice Chairman McDonough just said, it now appears that we will avoid the  worst of the impacts that we saw as possibilities just a few months ago I had been thinking until  quite recently that our forecasts that the Asian impact was going to be ""just right"" were probably  reasonably accurate, but I am beginning to lean to the view that the Asian impact may turn out to  be somewhat less than ""just right"" 1 appreciated Bill Poole's comments to that effect a little  earlier, if I understood him correctly  In the case of the stock market, I have no doubt that sentiment is going to change  some day I remember that after a brilliant period for investors in the 1960s, we experienced  what amounted to a 14-year bear market starting in 1968 and lasting until 1982 I am not  predicting that outcome, but some day the euphoria we are witnessing now will change The  change may occur today, next month, next year--who knows However, left to its own devices,  there is a great deal of momentum in the stock market also Serious weakness that could have a  material impact on macroeconomic performance could be a long time off  In short, I agree with others who have said over the course of the morning that the  risks now clearly appear to be to the upside In my view a move to tighten is becoming  increasingly advisable, although I do not think the case for such a move is compelling today I  would agree with the comments of President Minehan a little earlier that our job now may be to  consider carefully the timing of a policy move that we increasingly are seeing as necessary  Thank you "
3330,1998-03-31," Mr Chairman, I strongly support your recommendation  Relative to the discussion about a possible announcement, I would have a very strong  preference for not making one today That preference is based on a longer-term reason and an  immediate reason The longer-term reason would be the one that has been expressed around the  table, namely, that this would have a precedential impact and one that we should consider  carefully, not just rush into I will say parenthetically--we are not going to debate that issue  today--that I have very great reservations about the whole idea  More immediately, I believe that if we were to make a new type of announcement  today that the market has not seen before and does not expect, it would come as quite a shock  and be very confusing Why are they doing this? Why did they make this announcement and  not change policy? I can see the potential for a reaction of fairly major proportions that would  not be at all what we are setting out to do So, I would be very hesitant about that    3/31/98 "
3381,1998-05-19," Thank you, Mr Chairman This Committee is always confronted  with complexities and conundrums Over time they tend to be largely matters of degree and  perhaps relative significance at a given point in time, but today it seems hard in many cases to  know how to get the sign right A few key examples, starting with Asia At the time of the  Humphrey-Hawkins meeting in February, most of us felt that the impact of Asia was going to be  just about right in that it would give us just enough slowing I think that is pretty much the view  that the staff and the Greenbook still carry However, in just 90 days we have been through two  clearly identifiable cycles of how we have felt about the Asian impact on the US economy It  looked as if it was going to be more benign around the time that we met last, and now, as President  McDonough and others have observed, things look very ominous again  In the case of the interaction between productivity and compensation, which is  obviously a key determinant of costs and hence prices, it is hard to read either productivity or  compensation trends right now We have new calculations on productivity, which I enthusiastically  welcome, that suggest far more improvement than we thought earlier On the other hand, in the  area of compensation we have had an ECI in recent quarters that has been remarkably benign,  particularly the latest reading which actually was down To what extent are we entitled to rely on  that kind of information and for how long? If both of these factors behave at all positively, and I  think there is a significant chance that they might do that other things being equal, this virtuous  cycle that we have been experiencing could go on for a very long time  In the case of inflation, the CPI shows very clear signs of moving up on an adjusted  basis One way to look at those adjustments is to say that some time back we were at price level  stability and didn't know it; now we are in the process of losing it But as President McTeer and  others observed, there are virtually no other price series that confirm this deterioration    5/19/98  What about inventories? We have had an amazingly strong accumulation of  inventories recently, and yet the aggregate levels do not look excessive I'm sure there will be a  drag of some sort from inventories, but how much and when is it going to happen?  We just cannot know yet how all this is going to develop and net out I feel that we  will have to tighten policy, but I do not believe that we should tighten policy now I lack the  confidence to sit tight because I think there is too much uncertainty to say that we are sitting tight,  but I do suggest that we should sit still [Laughter] "
3382,1998-05-19," I concur with your recommendation, Mr Chairman "
3431,1998-08-18," That inventory will be up! [Laughter]   Thank you, Mr Chairman The morning has moved well along and I  am the last in the queue, I believe, so I will be very brief At the last meeting, the Committee was  wrestling with the very uncomfortable dilemma of having two sets of concerns that pulled in very  different directions We have been wrestling with the same concerns all morning The question  for today seems to be what has changed over the last few weeks The answer perhaps is that not    8/18/98  much has changed fundamentally and definitively, but I think there are some potentially very  significant straws in the wind Thanks to inventories and Asia, the expansion slowed dramatically  as expected in the second quarter, confronting us now with the question of whether or not this  moderation will settle in as a new regime as suggested by the Greenbook I thought the case that  was made there was quite impressive But if the stock markets still have the stamina for one or  more bull runs left in them, confidence could be reinforced and we could again easily find  ourselves in an excessive growth mode for much, perhaps all, of the forecast period That  obviously could present significant difficulties in the long run My assessment is that domestic  risk remains on the upside but perhaps not so heavily as earlier The next several months should  tell that tale  Internationally, one is hard pressed to identify any news of improvement To the  contrary, deflationary pressure seems to be increasing Japan appears to be fumbling the ball,  which may further endanger the entire region Long-held fears of contagion with some boost from  weak oil prices have become reality and have impacted Russia and parts of Latin America The  downside risk seems to have intensified outside our borders, calling even more strongly for  caution  We still have the bifurcated mix of factors that existed on July 1 My sense, however,  is that for the moment at least, the upside domestic concerns may be a bit milder while the  downside international concerns may be cause for even more caution While both of these straws  in the wind now blow in the same direction and suggest a softening expansion as a rising  probability, I do not think that this warrants a change in our policy stance at this time But we are  moving toward more balanced risks "
3432,1998-08-18," Mr Chairman, I can certainly accept your ""no change""  recommendation As far as the symmetries go, I can accept symmetry without great angst because  I think there clearly is a strong case for it But I would prefer to stay with asymmetry because the  basic structure of the risks that we have been living with for some time is still intact in my view  There is a case for reorienting our directive a little by moving toward symmetry, but for me  economic conditions have not yet changed enough to change the policy stance To repeat, I can  certainly accept symmetry "
3487,1998-09-29," Mr Chairman, when we discussed this issue earlier, I spoke at some  length against the idea of early release and I still feel the same I would like to restate my views  briefly, if I may, even though most of my concerns already have been expressed First of all,  please recall that the Lindsey paper that supported our earlier discussion showed that over the  past 12 years, the tilt in place at the time of each FOMC decision was in the same direction as the  decision itself only 527 percent of the time In the other 473 percent of the time, the decision  differed from the existing tilt Thus, the tilt has been nearly perfectly worthless as a predictor of  policy decisions [Laughter]  In my view, this and other problems give us three reasons not to change our  announcement practices, and they provide me with a notion of what the results would be if we  did First, this record shows that an early release over the past decade would frequently have  misled the general public, which is only concerned with deeds and not the fine nuances of  economic reasoning As a consequence, I am convinced that with early release we would  experience a severe loss of credibility that is the lifeblood of our policy's effectiveness Second,  early release of an asymmetry would often be the equivalent of a policy move that the  Committee had just decided not to take, and the Committee could never know as it voted what  forces it might inadvertently be setting in motion an hour or so later when the announcement was  made Third, if an asymmetry were in place at a meeting where the issues were close, the very  existence of a publicly known 6- to 8-week old position could influence the adoption of a less  than optimal new policy    9/29/98  As a consequence of all this, I am confident that, after being burned a couple of times,  the Committee would simply cease to employ this very useful convention That would be a  shame because the tilt legitimizes the uncertainty that is frequently present and the delay that is  frequently appropriate, and it also aids materially in building a consensus In sum, I can see no  helpful elements to an early release regimen and many serious negative consequences  On the rewording of the directive, truth to tell I like the existing language and I would  be a little sad to see it go Everyone who is interested and needs to know understands it perfectly  well, and more importantly it constitutes a bit of quaint Americana that we should cherish  [Laughter] That said, I would support a change if that is the Committee's wish, and either of the  two wording options and the suggested amendments are perfectly acceptable to me Option 1 is  fine, but I think there is much to be said for Option 2 because of its greater continuity with the  present practice Thank you   Americana "
3488,1998-09-29," Mr Chairman, events are moving quite rapidly It was only last July  that the Committee began to get concerned about the emerging bifurcation being introduced by  an ongoing very strong domestic economy interacting with a deteriorating international situation  In less than 90 days, policy risks have shifted dramatically to the downside If the Committee  should respond to this situation this morning by easing policy, I will support that decision but not  without considerable hesitation and misgivings While growth in overall economic activity  clearly has been slowing recently, our domestic economy remains remarkably robust Though  decelerating from earlier this year, final sales remain strong; labor compensation is rising; new  jobs continue to be created; consumer sentiment remains high; long-term credit is available at  rates not seen in decades to support housing and motor vehicle sales; and the stock market has  slipped but it has not collapsed If this beat goes on for long, the slippage in capital spending  could soon reverse and an up-cycle in inventory spending could once again emerge  It may well be that we will experience no more than the moderate slowing of the  expansion that we have long expected and for which we fervently have hoped The odds have  become lower that this is all the weakness that will occur yet it is highly questionable in my view  that slower economic growth alone would call for an immediate reduction in interest rates Of  course, far more is involved as this situation plays out against a background of ailing world  economies, fragile financial markets that could turn very ugly very quickly, and a continued  quiescent inflation rate in the United States I am concerned that we are now at risk of falling  behind the curve It would seem on balance that we have an opportunity here to take out a  modest and relatively inexpensive--in terms of risk--insurance policy, and I believe we should do  so Consideration of actions stronger than that should await the unfolding of future events  Thank you    9/29/98 "
3489,1998-09-29," Aha! [Laughter]   Mr Chairman, I support your 25 basis point move, and I prefer  symmetry for two reasons First, that is what the facts of the situation call for in my judgment  Secondly, lowering the fed funds rate could well ""spook"" this market if such a move is combined  with an asymmetric directive The market might see the Committee as badly frightened rather  than responsibly concerned This could induce the very sequence of adverse events that policy is  intended to discourage in the first place Should evolving conditions so warrant, we can just as  well move policy further from a symmetric directive "
3553,1998-11-17," The problem that I have with a longer time frame is that we review  the tilt sentence routinely at every meeting We may not come to the same conclusion from  meeting to meeting, though we tend to do so more often than not In any event, the tilt adopted  at a given meeting is operative only in the intermeeting period because we always review it at the  next meeting   Mr Chairman, I am on record as in favor of taking out the sentence  that has been under discussion, and that is still my preference I do agree that the sentence is  redundant, but I also think that it would be confusing to the public Its subtleties are rather deep  I have no problem with the sense that the sentence is attempting to convey I certainly agree  with the Vice Chairman that this Committee, under your leadership, does not have a problem in  this area at all But I find the sentence confusing, and for that reason I don't think it serves us  well I also would like to repeat that I support the notion of changing the timing reference in the  previous sentence from ""in coming months"" to ""in the intermeeting period"" as suggested by  President Broaddus   Mr Chairman, I have no doubt that Peter has a real problem that  needs to be worked on, and I wish I had an answer for him However, I very much identify with  Presidents Jordan and Poole in that I would prefer to stay out of this market It seems to me,  Peter, that given the very small size of these issues, if you buy indexed bonds in the same  proportion that you buy regular bonds, you would be buying so few that you probably would not  alleviate the problem in this market   I guess it's a new notion to me that we would be promoting the  market by buying some of these bonds and retiring them from circulation "
3554,1998-11-17," Thank you, Mr Chairman I will bat cleanup here The fundamental  worldview of hawks and doves is always evolving, but I do think that both of those birds are  alive and well To oversimplify, a hawk's view of policy today might well be that, with the US  economy strong and the world's financial structure shaky, our policy should be to insure that our  financial system remains a rock-solid anchor to windward That is the best thing that we can do  to help both the world and ourselves, hence a bias toward firmness A dove's focus might be on  the US economy as the engine whose forward drive is essential to the world's stability and    11/17/98  recovery, and US policy should insure that that engine stays in high gear, hence a bias toward  ease  I find much that is appealing in both of these arguments and I don't want to have to  choose one path over the other Fortunately, if we stay focused on the same mission that we  have pursued for so long--namely, seeking maximum sustainable growth fostered by price level  stability--I think we can reasonably seek both of those objectives, and the best policy, as before,  still lies there  How do we identify that policy path? As always, that comes from assessing the risks  and trying to determine how strong they are and where the balance lies I believe the balance of  risks has migrated to the downside, particularly as it relates to the likely timing of potential  shocks To be sure, upside risks remain and could readily resume their dominance of only just a  few months ago First of all, of course, our primary concern for many quarters now is still with  us Economic activity is still very strong, labor markets are still very tight, and that means that  inflation is still a major potential threat But I believe that that scenario is of diminished  probability for all of the reasons with which we are familiar The good news timing-wise is that  if we should see that scenario evolving, its latent risks should materialize slowly enough for us to  have time to counter them if need be  I worry more today about the potential for very serious mischief that could arise in the  stock market if it should boom to new highs That could put us in severe jeopardy of a crash that  could bring down a great deal more of the world and, indeed, our own economy with it My  hope is that, as a slowing economy results in declining corporate earnings, this market will  self-correct in an orderly way However, a real crash has too high a probability to give me much  comfort, and easier policy may heighten the chances of a plunge in the market    11/17/98  The downside risks seem to be growing and, perhaps of even more importance, could  burgeon much more quickly, perhaps severely and without much warning The international  risks, we know, certainly have those characteristics There could well be others yet to unfold in  this dynamic environment That the US economy is slowing seems to be a growing probability  While that may be desirable within limits, once a downward trend gains momentum, it is hard to  know how far and fast it may go and what it might take to arrest a decline if that becomes  necessary In today's world, I think that is a more than usually important factor  I do think we should keep a wary eye on deflation There are some signs that its  impetus may be slowing, but in the context of an increasingly sluggish US economy, if that is  what should ensue, it could become a real danger  To sum up, Mr Chairman, I do not believe that we are behind the curve, but I do  believe that the ground is shifting Perhaps we need to shift a bit more with it I see little reason  to wait as any upside risk would likely emerge rather slowly over time, whereas the existing  downside risks could appear suddenly and soon The respective time frames are quite  asymmetric My mother used to say ""a stitch in time saves nine"" We have taken two so far, and  three might do it "
3555,1998-11-17," Mr Chairman, I unequivocally support your recommendation, but I  must say that I have a lot of sympathy with the views of those who would prefer to maintain a  steady policy "
3616,1998-12-22," Mr Chairman, I will go along with this suggestion out of respect for  the majority view that I know exists and also your effort to try to resolve the issue But I do so    12/22/98 84  with considerable trepidation For one thing, I think it is going to put you particularly as well as  the rest of the Committee in the position of having to make some very difficult judgments as to  when we should make a statement and when we should not More often than not, that is  probably going to be a very close call The second observation I would make is that once we  start this, no statement immediately becomes a statement Let us not kid ourselves about making  a statement occasionally We are going to be making a statement at every meeting, even those  where we make no actual statement   I believe that the market will come to see our lack of a statement as  indicating that there was essentially nothing going on at the meeting and that everything is just  rolling along at wherever it was perceived to be before And I think that is a statement It will  be an implied statement  I also have considerable skepticism about whether we would have the ability to go  back to the current status quo should that turn out to be desired I think President Parry hit it on  the nose when he said it was a step in the right direction It is a step! [Laughter] It will clearly  be difficult to go backwards should we subsequently, for whatever reason, desire to do so But I  will go along for the reasons stated "
3617,1998-12-22," Mr Chairman, the Greenbook and most forecasts foresee a slowing in  the US economy I share that view because, after all, as we've heard this morning, the  manufacturing sector is slowing and related to that net exports continue to deteriorate, although  we hope the rate of change will decelerate Consumer savings have gone all the way into  negative territory, and for that and other reasons consumption seems sure to slow Investment  has been on a tear for a long time That seems bound at least to moderate to a more normal pace  Profits are already slowing, which implies risks to the stock market and an attendant wealth  effect And so forth  However, what do we see going on around us? The fourth quarter of 1998 appears to  be substantially stronger than we had earlier believed, giving the economy a lot of momentum  going into 1999 Interest rates have been coming down since our last meeting The effects on  the real economy of our earlier rate reductions are only beginning to kick in The dollar is a little  weaker, which will be stimulative if it continues, as it is forecasted to do New job creation    12/22/98 44  continues to be strong Unemployment is actually going lower it would appear Consumer  sentiment remains high Retail sales are strong, particularly in the cyclically sensitive areas like  housing and autos With an important possible exception of Brazil, which many have  mentioned, foreign financial pressures on the real economies in many areas seem to be easing at  least for now To date, there has been no great change evident in the pattern of inflation  All in all, Mr Chairman, at this moment I am not at all clear in which direction the  next policy move should be, let alone when it should occur "
3618,1998-12-22," I agree with your recommendation   Mr Chairman, I think I would prefer option 3, although I don't feel  strongly about most of the differences I would delete the sentence Ed Boehne talked about on  potential changes in the funds rate because I view it as more confusing than helpful I do feel  rather strongly about taking out the ""in coming months"" phrase, which appears in both versions,  options 2 and 3 I think it is irrelevant because we always review our stance of policy at every  meeting ""In coming months"" has no meaning and could easily be harmful in the sense that it  might appear to commit us to a direction for policy over whatever period some people might  interpret as ""in coming months"" And our views on that could change quite radically  On the final sentence on the monetary aggregates, I have no strong feeling I don't  think it is doing any harm and the day may well come, perhaps soon, when we would be glad to  have it in there So, I would leave it alone "
3669,1999-03-30," Thank you, Mr Chairman The basic condition of the   economy in this country is well known by everybody here It has been very well   articulated this morning and I will not try to recite again all the factors involved At our   last meeting I felt that the risks faced by policymakers were balanced but that if the   upside risks brought on by overly strong growth did not begin to moderate soon, they   would need to be addressed That moderation has not become evident as yet and the case   can be made that the time may have come to take a first step   I find myself pulled toward an asymmetric directive But two factors give me   pause First, an asymmetric directive, if immediately announced under our new policy,   would quite likely cause a spontaneous increase in market rates, especially since it would   come as a surprise to many Such a response might well turn out to be premature but,   more importantly, would be undesirable because of my second reason That second   reason is that we seem to be moving ever closer to what could become a very nasty war   in the Balkans Indeed, it has begun We all pray for an early peaceful solution, but we   cannot know what will happen At a moment such as this, if the Committee considered it   necessary to raise rates for whatever reason, it should and would do so If, however, the   Committee were merely inclined to get a preemptive jump on a likely threat, I question   whether it would be wise to do so at a time like this, rather than await further   developments in a potentially dangerous situation Like the military itself when it is   heading toward a fight, it probably would be a good idea to keep our powder dry  "
3670,1999-03-30," I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman  "
3713,1999-05-18," Thank you, Mr Chairman At the last meeting, and indeed for   some time before that, it seemed that the risks to the outlook were balanced, with a slow,   steady drift to the upside That continues with little sign of a significant moderating trend   setting in Like others, I have been expecting such a shift for a long time, but I would   like to be more confident than I am now that it will emerge spontaneously   Industrial production has resumed vigorous growth We’ve continued to   generate a quarter of a million jobs per month, which is wonderful of course Inventories   are low, and major cyclical swing factors like housing, autos, and capital spending, which   should have eased before now, simply have not done so Of course, I should note that we   have some contrary news on housing this morning The stock market continues to create   wealth Inflation remains remarkably quiescent, but here again I would like to be more   confident that this will continue The April CPI was a jolt of yet to be determined   significance But beyond that commodity prices may have begun to turn and, of course,   energy prices already have turned up Foreign growth should improve and will have an   impact on commodities and other import areas And unemployment in the United States,   driven by demand pressures, appears to be headed to 4 percent or lower The magnificent     5/18/99 45   productivity gains of recent quarters, even if they are largely continued, cannot be   depended upon to hold these forces at bay indefinitely   At the last meeting two factors seemed to inhibit the Committee from   considering any action and both of those have dissipated Six weeks ago any change by   the Fed would have been a great shock to the market, but not today The Balkans was an   important unknown then but, for better or worse, it now appears to be headed for a stand-  down To be sure, there are still downside risks and we have no clear and present   inflation danger And we could bask in this virtuous cycle for some time yet The   question before us, of course, as it has been, is how best to help prolong this excellent   economic era for as long as possible The emergence of an inflationary surge with some   gain in momentum would surely mark the beginning of the end of that No actual move   would appear to me to be required today, but it may well be time to assess how best to   start leaning into the wind Thank you  "
3714,1999-05-18," Thank you, Mr Chairman I certainly concur with your   recommendation I am a little concerned, however, about the interpretation of the tilt In   my view the Committee should not feel that it locks us in to an early move Everyone no   doubt recalls that last summer our directive was asymmetric toward tightening for three   meetings from late March until mid-August and we never did tighten Subsequently, of   course, we eased in the fall Something unforeseen could happen again We should be   open to that possibility and remain flexible   One further thought, Mr Chairman I would hope that in our public statement   we will de-emphasize the April CPI number and stress the underlying trends that I think   are really motivating us  "
3768,1999-08-24," Second    Second   CHARMAN GREENSPAN All in favor say “aye”   SEVERAL Aye    Second    Peter, if we are ready for a more nuts and bolts type question here,   I’m wondering about the timing of this It seems to me highly desirable, if we are going to   do this, to do it as rapidly as possible But there is a lot of work to do How is this going to   flow as far as the timing is concerned for these inquiries, preparations, announcements,   putting it in place, and so forth?    If you can meet that timetable, that would be excellent I think it is   pretty ambitious, but we need to try to do it that way  "
3769,1999-08-24," Thank you, Mr Chairman I believe I am the final hitter in the lineup   today and the day is getting on, but let me offer a brief summary of the situation as I see it,   although this is admittedly rather repetitious The economy continues to exhibit a great deal   of fundamental strength though we may be getting a bit of the long-expected slowdown   However, the consensus expectation for the second half is for growth of 3½ percent or likely     8/24/99 69   more than that, which would mark a return to a pace above a sustainable level Left   unconstrained, this could go on into and perhaps through next year, which would introduce   substantial additional upside risks So far, the overheating this threatens has been more than   damped by strong productivity gains, with important assistance from special world cyclical   factors While this could well continue for a time, it seems to me increasingly dangerous to   depend too heavily upon productivity alone to hold inflationary pressures in check, as the   reinforcement provided by a weak world economy seems likely to be dissipating If   overheating were allowed to occur and ignite a cost-driven rise in inflation, it could be quite   difficult to deal with Serious downside risks to economic activity exist, as always, with the   most readily identifiable potential culprits liable to be the sky-high stock market and the still   fragile world economy and exchange rate structure as well as the ever-present possibility of   exogenous shocks But at this juncture the downside risks would seem to be of both lower   magnitude and probability than the upside risks   The federal funds rate is still 50 basis points below the level that existed prior to the   financial crisis of a year ago While one cannot by any means say that all vestiges of that   episode have disappeared, conditions have improved markedly I can see little motivation in   recent experience or likely short-term prospects for continuing all or perhaps any of the   remaining degree of stimulus put in place at that time Thank you  "
3770,1999-08-24," I concur with your recommendation, Mr Chairman, for all the   reasons that have been expressed around the table  "
3819,1999-10-05," Thank you, Mr Chairman As we’ve all been saying, the economy is   resurging after its second-quarter slump and the inflation news continues to be highly favorable   It’s amazing to me that policy formulation can become more difficult when all the news is good,   but it has Recent news has made our choices still more difficult As I look at the available policy   alternatives, it seems to me that a perfectly plausible case can be made for at least three different   policies And there is a perfectly plausible rebuttal argument against each Yet choose we must,   and I’ll leave that discussion for the next phase of our meeting   Let me make two brief observations Many supply side factors that have contributed   importantly to this favorable inflation performance are shifting adversely Cheap oil has gone   away; bargain commodity prices are firming; the dollar has ceased to strengthen and has begun to   reverse; world demand for US exports is beginning to increase, further straining our labor force;   and interest rates have been rising Our strong productivity surge has obviously been of vital   importance and appears to remain vibrantly in place  But going forward, we must judge if it’s safe   to depend on that almost entirely to keep rising cost pressures at bay   Secondly, the demand side looks increasingly frothy to me Consumption is surging, even   as consumers continue to run with a negative saving rate And that, I think, introduces the danger   of fragility Consumer sentiment is rising again from a consistently elevated reading We will   shortly get a new reading, but to date new job formation continues strong, with many reports of an   inability to fill job openings We seem to be entering an inventory cycle of unknown dimensions   Capital spending remains very strong and purchasing managers report slower deliveries and higher     10/5/99 40   prices Housing activity appears to be slowing, but auto sales continue to fly higher and higher,   defying gravity   This Committee has been correct for several years in allowing the economy free rein to   grow, and I feel comfortable that we have responsibly timed a course reversal in recent meetings   Is it now time to rest on our oars a bit?  Perhaps, and a strong case can be--and has been--made for   that But I think it’s worth noting that the fed funds rate today is ¼ point below where it was on   September 29th of last year, the date of our first downward move At that time the unemployment   rate was at 45 percent and the level of real GDP was 4 percent lower than today The rate of GDP   growth in the third quarter of 1998 was 37 percent, slightly slower than the rate now anticipated in   the third quarter of this year We must take great care not to risk losing the degree of stability in   prices that we have worked so long and hard to achieve and that has served our economy so well   Thank you  "
3820,1999-10-05," Thank you, Mr Chairman As I listened to the go-around, I found myself   identifying with those who would have preferred to go ahead and tighten today But I am   comfortable supporting “B” asymmetric, basically for three reasons First of all, both in the context     10/5/99 66   of what we’ve talked about here today and also for a number of other reasons, I’m delighted that   the window still appears to be open for action in November Secondly, there is an abnormally   strong flow of data that will be coming in over the relatively brief period of time between now and   our November meeting, and that should be of great benefit to us Thirdly, how we do it is part of   the reason for supporting “B,” in my opinion We talked about this yesterday in Roger Ferguson’s   working group, and I am beginning to feel--I don’t think I was alone in this view--that it could be   very counterproductive if we did something in a new way today It would be ad hoc We haven’t   really thought it through in terms of where we’re going or where we want to wind up But more   importantly, the market will not be prepared for it at all It would introduce an additional   complication at a time when we don’t need any additional complications It could induce   considerable confusion, possibly volatility, and unfortunate speculation So I’d be very careful   about doing something new and different that was a departure from our past practices I think that   would be highly undesirable The market is only now beginning to become a little more   comfortable with the procedures we have recently adopted, and to change them on the fly scares   me   What then does that call for? This is a change in the directive and it represents a change in   the Committee’s central thinking if, as I believe, we have a consensus for “B” asymmetric And I   think the most straightforward way to handle this would be to adopt an asymmetric directive,   announce it to the public, and append a brief explanation to our statement    And it would be a departure from what we’ve done for the last few   meetings   SEVERAL That’s right    Yes, sir  "
3869,1999-11-16," Mr Chairman, I am sympathetic with much of what has been said   around the table, particularly President McTeer’s views and those of Governor Meyer and   President Minehan But I really do believe that Ed Boehne has it right, that we just cannot do   this by Committee I hope you can find some ways to make some changes in this draft that will   accommodate the views that are being expressed  But, basically, I think we have to leave it to   you after you hear what the rest of us have to say    I would welcome an opportunity to review a little further the   language that was suggested about the Chairman’s latitude to act between meetings I have no   problem with the substance of it, but I would like to work with the language a bit more   Concerning the wording in the announcement that Roger referred to at the end of his   remarks, I would strongly support alternative I--describing the balance of risks--because I think   it’s appropriately informative and accurate And I like the fact that it avoids implying in advance   that a determination has been made by the Committee to move one way or the other We do not,   in fact, make such a determination We review the situation from a zero base at each meeting   So, in my view, what appears in alternative I is the more appropriate presentation of how the   FOMC leaves each meeting  "
3870,1999-11-16," Thank you, Mr Chairman By this time of the morning most of what   needs to be said has already been said But let me briefly summarize how I see the state of play   and offer several comments that I hope might be useful as we move toward our policy   formulation   It seems clear that the economy remains very strong, with a lot of ongoing momentum   True, we do see some better defined indications of slowing activity, with housing apparently   topping out and quite possibly autos as well Other air pockets may well appear, but the   momentum remains impressive New jobs continue to be created in substantial number, driving   unemployment down even further Consumer sentiment has rebounded from its brief and     11/16/99 40   shallow dip The stock market paused for a time, but recently the strength appears to be   broadening and the market seems to be moving into a new up leg Foreign economic growth   looks both more solid and more rapid--possibly a very potent influence on our own outlook The   year 2000 is an election year and those are generally strong Inflation remains quiescent One   should always look for signs of serious potential weaknesses or a slowdown, but other than the   ever-present danger of shocks it’s hard to identify very many looming in the forecast period In   short, the risks seem distinctly on the upside   My formulation of the key question before us is How and when might today’s   healthy strength deteriorate into unhealthy overheating? And the obvious second question to be   addressed shortly is What policy today is most likely to be beneficial a year from now?   Let me make several quick observations First of all, stronger world growth is highly   desirable However, it does complicate our inflation outlook A lower dollar, stronger export   demand, and a higher level of world resource utilization all put new upward pressures on our   price level This is an important reversal of the favorable disinflationary impact we got from a   weaker world in the past several years   Second, the baseline Greenbook forecast calls for some tightening over the forecast   period but still projects a rising rate of inflation through 2000 While a case can be made--but   not by me--that the rate of inflation likely to be reached by the fourth quarter of 2001 would still   be within acceptable limits, I’m concerned about what that rising trend might imply for policy   This Committee could be required to make very strong tightening moves to counter it   Finally, there is the apparently strong growth in the rate of productivity improvement,   the Chairman’s second derivative It has served us wonderfully well But going forward from   here, what are the parameters of its likely impact?  At one end of the spectrum the improvement   could continue for some period of time, but as the Chairman observed it will not do so   indefinitely, with overheating potentially a subsequent condition At the other end, while the   probability may be low, it could disappear very soon and we could find ourselves scrambling to   avoid the consequences To me perhaps the highest probability is that the rate of change will   remain positive but will not be strong enough by itself to hold off the cost increases resulting   from stronger world growth, the wealth effect, and ever tighter labor markets And an earlier and   stronger rise in prices could result     11/16/99 41   At the last meeting the Chairman summarized his analysis by observing that we are   not far from where we want to be and we’re not behind the curve I agree But we may need to   move further in order to be sure that we stay there Thank you  "
3871,1999-11-16," I concur with your recommendation, Mr Chairman  "
3932,1999-12-21," Yes, I’ll start, Roger I don’t know that I can add much either to   Roger’s excellent memo or the summary he just gave or to Bill’s very cogent disagreement,   which everyone has given an enormous amount of attention to I’m in the majority that   favors Option 1 First of all, I would like to say relative to the analytics and other concerns   that there are sophisticated market analysts who make a very good living--I carefully do not   say earn a good living--opining, criticizing, and questioning the Fed Some are academics   and they have academic purposes, and others are either speculating or doing the intellectual   work for speculators on the basis of the way they read the Fed I doubt that any language   exists anywhere that will foreclose this process completely I don’t think either of these   options or anything else anybody would be able to craft can achieve that end, much as I   wish we could   I believe that our objective here is to be as informative as we can while ensuring to   the best of our ability that we are accurate and clear about what we actually say We want to   take care not to mislead the public, either explicitly by saying more than we intend to say or   implicitly by opening up possibilities that we could be misunderstood through the   implications that somebody could draw from what we say I think all of our discussions   have been focused on how best to do that The facts are that at each meeting where we   adopt a tilt, bias, or asymmetry or whatever you want to call it--or decide not to do so--it   doesn’t mean any more than what our proclivity is at the time of that meeting It can’t mean     12/21/99 63   any more than that because conditions always change, as we know, and considerations   always change That’s why we have a zero-based review at every meeting that we have   And the record will show, I think, that the tilt evaluation has very little or no predictive   power concerning future policy moves over any particular time period And in my view, we   should be very careful not to leave any impression that it does   In my opinion, the best way to do that is simply to place the weight of the evidence   on the scales as it relates to our two objectives, which we have in this proposed statement-­  price stability on the one hand and sustainable growth on the other Then we should   articulate how those scales read at the time we are looking at them They will either be   balanced or they will be weighted toward a danger in one direction or the other If we feel   that we have to expound further on that, it can be done through a statement released to the   press That is where I come down    And one would have to try to do that within the context of what we   knew at that time--   --not what we know today, which is considerably more More   weight has been given to the risk of inflation than we knew would be the case at the time   that statement would have been made    Two opposed  "
3933,1999-12-21," Thank you, Mr Chairman I raised my hand this morning mainly to   be recorded as present and participating in this section of the meeting [Laughter] That’s   because little seems to have changed in recent weeks The economy apparently continues to   have a strong head of steam, the inflation news continues favorable, and productivity growth   remains strong Barring a significant shift in momentum or some external shock from Y2K   or elsewhere, it appears likely that more tightening could well be required over the forecast   period, with the Committee focused more heavily on how much and when That outlook is     12/21/99 39   juxtaposed against the substantial tightening of recent months that has not yet had its full   impact on the economy, and which could possibly provide all or most of the restraint   necessary in this episode Consequently, it is fortunate that the challenging millennium   rollover period, which is now at hand, is also on its merits an appropriate time to rest on our   oars just a bit and assume as low a profile as possible Thank you  "
3934,1999-12-21," Mr Chairman, I can certainly live with either In my view they are   almost as broad as they are long I do favor the symmetric language because I think it is our   clear intention at this point not to change policy, and symmetry is the way to say we are not   going to raise the funds rate I do have one concern--with apologies, I think! It does seem   possible that this Committee might feel forced into an intermeeting move as we get into   January--well after the Y2K experience but before the February meeting If that is a   possibility, then the language of the symmetric directive tends to foreclose that when it says,     12/21/99 56   “At its next scheduled meeting the Committee will assess…” I think we could fix that,   again with apologies    I’d simply remove the word “scheduled”   SPEAKER(?) That’s right We could have an unscheduled meeting    Then it would read “at its next meeting”  "
3991,2000-03-21,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  While the data are moving around a bit,   as they always do, it seems to me that the situation facing the Committee today has changed very   little since our last meeting  As has been the case for some time, as we all know, we see   extremely strong demand driving the economy toward overheating on the one hand, but on the   other we see to date only the scantiest evidence of rising price pressures as a result  However, it   continues to appear highly likely that at some point strong demand will force heightened price   pressures  Consequently, I see little choice but to stay the course that we have been following    Thank you   "
3992,2000-03-21,"  I agree with your recommendation, Mr Chairman  "
4037,2000-05-16,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Once again it seems that the basic   conditions facing the Committee are little changed from those prevailing at the time of the   most recent several meetings, except that perhaps many now familiar concerns have been   escalating further  The economy has turned in another remarkable quarter, and recently hard   evidence has begun to replace earlier perceptions that compensation increases are accelerating   and some measures of inflation may now be on the move  There is little point in further   reciting the factors at work here  It appears clear from this discussion that most, if not all, of   those around the table see the risks as continuing to be heavily on the up side, with further   policy moves in order  As the Bluebook discusses, the operative question is  By how much?   There are a number of reasons to feel it is unlikely that inflation is suddenly about to   surge  Among other factors the dollar remains remarkably strong  Oil prices appear to have   peaked and commodity prices generally have flattened out  Productivity increases continue   to hold unit cost increases at bay  And the impact of policy easing in the fall of 1998 should   be dissipating while the tightening over the past year should increasingly be kicking in  I   believe we are still on or perhaps still ahead of the curve, although some inflation creep      76  seems inevitable  However, any signs of economic slowing are scattered at best and quite   inadequate in my view to provide confidence that the needed easing of activity is likely to   occur without significant additional policy moves  It is helpful that both the real economy   and financial markets today seem to be presenting us an unusual window  The more   aggressive policy path is both expected and by many considered acceptable and is thus likely   to present less risk than the more conservative alternative in the near as well as the longer   term  I believe we should grasp this opportunity  Thank you    "
4038,2000-05-16,"  I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman, for all of the   reasons that have been stated around the table  "
4086,2000-08-22,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I apologize that I have no handout, [laughter]   but I’ll try to make up for it by being brief  The incoming data that we’ve been reviewing all   morning really need no repetition and I would only add that on balance they seem benign and   favorable to a truly remarkable degree  It may be a midsummer night’s dream but I think the recent       65  data could contain the seeds of a near-utopian extension of our recent superb era  If a modest   downturn does set in for an extended period, productivity improvements could continue to hold unit   labor costs flat  And if we have the good fortune to avoid the potential negative shocks from both   known and unforeseen sources, the stage would be set  We would experience sustainable growth,   higher real incomes, slower but continuing job creation, and steady, perhaps at some point receding,   inflation  The only other thing one could ask for is major league baseball in Washington!    [Laughter]   That is an enticing but quite plausible prospect to be sure, but it would be folly to adopt it   as a locked-in scenario and I would not suggest that we do so  The real world is still a difficult and   challenging place  Inflation is creeping up, the current account deficit does continue to grow, the   stock market and consumer debt are dangerously high, and household savings are dangerously low    Hot spots, both economic and political, do glow threateningly around the world  And the favorable   outcome relies almost entirely on a continuation of productivity increases unprecedented in recent   decades  If all this were not so serious and important, and if this Committee were not so squarely in   the middle of the vortex, it would all be great theatre  At any rate, to wait and to watch intensively   seems the best posture for today  "
4087,2000-08-22,"  I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman  "
4133,2000-10-03,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Over time it has seemed to me that there is a   certain recurring rhythm to the work of this Committee  There are times when we are faced with a   need to reassess the appropriate fundamental course of policy and other times when we are focused   on questions of how much impetus may or may not be needed to move further along an established   path  And then there are occasions when an intermediate-term objective appears to be being met,   which raises a new set of issues and puts us into a period when it is desirable to wait and see what   incoming data tell us about evolving conditions  We may be in such a wait-and-see period today    We now appear to be in an economic slowdown, which most if not all of us have been seeking  And   new questions present themselves  How long-lasting and how deep will this slowdown prove to be?    How will the course of inflation react?  Will inflation slow with the economy, continue to creep   upward regardless, or perhaps accelerate in response to conditions previously in place?  Many      71  scenarios have a certain plausibility, but I believe the Greenbook baseline is as good a bet as one can   make today, and it calls for a wait-and-see approach for now  I believe that represents the rhythm of   the day and, therefore, that the present policy stance remains appropriate     I agree with your recommendation, Mr Chairman  "
4178,2000-11-15,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  It is now pretty well beyond question that   the economy is in a slowdown, and this leaves us clearly facing new, quite different questions   than those we have been grappling with over recent years  The fact that these new questions are   precisely the ones we would have anticipated earlier this year when we thought ahead about   dealing with an emerging slowing economy does not make them any easier to answer now that   they are at hand  The two fundamental questions I see as operative today are first, how deep and   long-lasting will this slowdown prove to be?  And second, will inflation flatten in tight   correlation with a slowing economy or will it continue to drift up, driven by the momentum of   earlier conditions and/or perhaps by an economy that does not slow enough for long enough?   Concerning the slowdown, there is evidence of it all around us  We have been   examining it all morning and it is quite possible that weakness will foster further weakness    Governor Gramlich and Presidents McTeer and Hoenig listed factors that could cause that  But I               69      believe it may be a bit early to get overly concerned about the downside potential  There is still   substantial strength out there    Let me cite a few factors  For openers, in my view the Greenbook forecast can hardly   be considered weak  Consumer confidence remains very high and is perhaps rising again  And   consumer spending in the weaker third quarter was considerably stronger than in the more robust   second quarter  In general it seems to be holding up well  Job creation continues--slower but   hardly anemic--and incomes continue to rise  The stock market has stalled, but except for the   more egregiously overvalued stocks of a few months ago, it is still quite elevated by historical   standards and holding up well so far despite having plenty of excuses to crater  Business   investment is likely slowing from its earlier unsustainable pace but shows no sign of collapse    Fiscal policy is likely to become more stimulative under the new president, regardless of who he   may be  The economies of our trading partners as a group are projected to continue to grow--at   around 4 percent--which should cushion an incipient decline here  Certainly the potential exists   for the situation to weaken quickly and perhaps even precipitously, but I'm not sure that that's the   most likely scenario as of today   Concerning inflation, what I see happening is that from a low base it is now sluggishly   but clearly moving up  Perhaps in today's high productivity environment this might be more   easily reversed than in prior eras  But I feel that the longer this uptrend goes on, the harder it   will be to stop  And should the economy reaccelerate soon, inflation may well accelerate with it    The interrelationship of compensation costs and productivity will continue to be key, as will   energy prices  We will watch closely, of course  Fortunately we have time to watch and to   evaluate  Between the easing of upside risks on the one hand and ongoing substantial               70      momentum in the economy on the other, there would seem to be no urgent need to change either   rates or rhetoric at this time  "
4179,2000-11-15,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I strongly support your   recommendation  I fear that if we went to neutral language, it would be read by the   market as the first step in an easing cycle  Many in the market expect that and I think   they would see a change of that sort as confirming their belief  And I believe that could   prove to be very seriously and importantly misleading  The Greenbook and at least some   of us here see a further tightening as the most likely next move  Obviously that could be   wrong  It could even be wrong quite soon  But I do not see any need to make a change               92      now  Maybe we'll want to do that at the next meeting; maybe we won't  At any rate, I   see no need to be preemptive based on the evidence that’s before us today     Machine or hand count?  "
4228,2000-12-19,"  One more comment on inventories?  As one who in an earlier incarnation   had responsibility for managing inventories, the technology that’s available to managers today is   light years better than we used to have some time ago--not only information technology but many      22  other things as well  As a consequence, there's a micro control capability, absent an absolute decline   in final demand of course  That ability to micro control is going to lead, I think, to more little saw   tooth type variations in inventories rather than the large waves that we saw earlier  And I would   submit that the likelihood is that the inventory recessions that we remember historically are a thing   of the past     But perhaps increasingly     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Things have been moving fast recently  Two   meetings ago we thought we might have a real slowdown at hand but could not yet be sure  At the      57  last meeting it was clear that a slowdown was under way but its characteristics were not yet   ascertainable  Today we are confronted with several recent weeks of strong and concerning   downside data  While a softening was expected, I have been surprised at the often seriously   weakening news about autos, consumer confidence, corporate earnings, retail sales, high-tech   expenditures, and foreign economic growth, among other things  Clearly, the balance of risks has   shifted substantially downward   However, considerable strength remains, albeit less robust in almost every sector While   credit extension has slowed and asset quality concerns have appeared, banks remain very healthy    Indeed, many interest rates have fallen, which will bolster activity  And while productivity increases   may slow with economic activity, the basic momentum in productivity growth remains strong    Business investment spending is slowing but continuing, with capital deepening remaining a   corporate imperative  Oil prices are easing, but remain shock-prone and it must be noted--and has   already been noted--that natural gas prices are on a tear  New jobs are still being created, although at   a slower rate  I would argue that the composition of the decline in the stock market from the   intergalactic levels of a few months ago is more a sign of the market's strength than of its weakness    My main worry there is that market prices are still very high by historical standards   I would make two key observations, and each leads to a key question  Observation   number one It is clear that the economy is transitioning to a lower growth level, and within limits   this is welcomed  Question Will this decline bottom out spontaneously at an acceptable growth   rate, perhaps not too far below trend growth, or will its momentum carry it dangerously lower?    Observation number two By most measures inflation is off its lows and is slowly rising  Question   How will inflation behave in this slowdown, characterized as it is by an intensely competitive and      58  high productivity growth environment?  Will inflation stall out quickly in this environment or will   momentum carry it on up, driven perhaps by rising unit labor costs?   On balance, it would seem wise to begin to move to counter the new weakness, given all   the uncertainties and the lagged response of the economy to policy shifts  But how and by how   much?  Making a policy decision today in this situation reminds me a bit of how I feel upon   checking into a hotel room and finding it too chilly  I'm confronted with how to reset a strange   thermostat of unknown properties  Several clicks in the warming direction are available, but how   many clicks will most likely result in a comfortable temperature when I return in a few hours after a   dinner meeting?  My usual response is a firm but cautious reset to start with, knowing that additional   warming clicks are available if it stays too cool, but minimizing the likelihood of inducing   overheating and having to spend the night in an unpleasant and unnecessary sweat!  [Laughter]  "

4274,2001-03-20,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  There's very little that I can add at   this point about the economy, so I’ll be brief  But let me try to summarize the situation       3/20/01 75  It was 100 percent predictable well in advance of the economic slowdown that   going through such a period would be painful  We are now in a slowdown and it is   painful  It was almost as certain that after a period of slowing a time would come when   we would welcome an upturn but would have to go through a very disconcerting stretch   of uncertainty about whether an upturn or more decline was in the cards  We seem to be   in that stage now  In recent days we’ve all been studying the data, reading analyses,   receiving briefings, and sharing ideas  The bottom line would seem to be this While   there are good reasons to believe that the economy will soon turn up--and I believe that is   the highest probability outcome--we cannot know or be overly confident that an upturn is   in train  It is still possible that the various negative forces existing today will drag us into   further weakness  Our policy choice must be made in the face of this very fundamental   uncertainty     In golf, which I play poorly, club selection before a shot usually presents the   player with three options--an aggressive choice, a central tendency, and a conservative   choice  [Laughter]  Each option usually has its own plausibility  In different situations a   player might well go with any of the options, depending on his or her objectives at the   time and an assessment of the risks  Shortly I expect Don Kohn to tell us that in this   game a conservative choice is to ease 25 basis points, 50 basis points is a central   tendency, and 75 is aggressive  Of course, the loudest voices in the gallery want us to go   for it, but that doesn't mean that we should  In deference to your request that members   not discuss policy positions until the next part of the meeting, Mr Chairman, I will   withhold further comments until then  [Laughter]     3/20/01 76 "
4275,2001-03-20,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Let me comment briefly about   each of the choices along the spectrum of alternatives that are most plausible here   Twenty-five basis points is the most conservative possibility  With inflation   quiescent and quite likely to stay so for some time, I just don't see any necessity to keep   such a tight hold  Indeed, I perceive that it would be quite risky to do so  So that   alternative has little attraction for me at this time   The most aggressive choice is 75 basis points  While the financial markets are   clamoring for it, the data from the real economy seem firmer than such a move might     3/20/01 92  imply  Most particularly, I fear that the message a 75 basis point move would send   would be totally wrong  People in the real economy might perceive us to be in panic,   which we are not  Stock market investors might see us as trying to save them, which   would not be correct but could nevertheless create a serious moral hazard that might be   quite difficult to eradicate  And this move would take short-term rates down toward a   low level, which could begin to constrain our options should further easing become   necessary  Finally, there is at least some small possibility that a strong, early upturn in   the economic expansion could make even this level seem too low in the not too distant   future, which would introduce an entirely new set of dynamics   So, I believe that 50 basis points is the best choice and that asymmetry toward   weakness is the correct tilt because I think the risks are still on the down side  Thank   you     I have the language we used in December if nobody else does     Would you like me to read it, Mr Chairman?     The comparable sentence in the press release of December   19th read  “The Committee will continue to monitor closely the evolving economic   situation”     No  "
4318,2001-05-15,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Are we beyond the crisis stage of our   deep slowdown and are we now entering a firming and turning period?  Much of the market’s   recent action and sentiment indicates that that is likely the case  And certainly if increasing   difficulty in arriving at a firm conviction about monetary policy is symptomatic of a sea change,   then I, along with Bob McTeer, probably am an indicator that we are there  I hope and   cautiously believe that that is the case and that the economy is bottoming out  Recent incoming   data suggest that it is  Last week initial claims fell  April retail sales were robust  Consumer   sentiment showed an improvement  Both headline and core CPI are moving upward ominously,   possibly suggesting renewing strength in the economy  The inventory correction seems well   advanced  Our high-tech problems look to me more and more like another episode of sectoral   rolling recession that we have often seen before in industries such as energy, construction,   defense, agriculture, autos, and others  They seldom drag down the entire economy by   themselves     So, things are starting to look better  But a closer inspection reveals that much of this   news is quite tenuous  Initial claims are a helpful but volatile series, and we have only one   favorable week to go on  Obviously, we’ll need much more to know if the rising pattern is     5/15/01     70   reversing  And with unemployment likely to go higher, that seems questionable  April’s strong   retails sales were accompanied by downward revisions to previous months  Stronger consumer   sentiment needs a lot of confirmation  While the CPI is rising, the PCE and other price series are   not  And while a great deal of inventory reduction is taking place, inventory-sales ratios are still   very high in many sectors     As for the rolling recession in the high-tech sector, it could prove to be more   troublesome than most of its predecessors  It is occurring simultaneously with a number of other   problems and imbalances in the economy including--in addition to the concerns already   mentioned above--record household debt burdens, over-investment by business firms and over-   spending by consumers, higher energy prices, a bear market for stocks, and a worldwide   slowdown  Can all this be handled at the same time that our most dynamic sector of recent years   is going through its own rolling recession?  It is a concern  Possibly fiscal and certainly   monetary policy could help provide the needed extra boost to pull us through to renewed growth   To sum up, Mr Chairman, I believe we are winning, but the fat lady has not yet sung    I suggest we would be well advised to keep the easing pressure on now, hope this is the last time   it is necessary to do so aggressively, and then we will be free to focus more clearly on price level   stability in future periods    "
4319,2001-05-15,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support your recommendation  I would   add that I am concerned that too overt a comment today about the possible ending of this easing   process might well be a bit premature for two reasons  First, it would be premature if some of   these downside probabilities that we’re concerned about materialize; if they do, it could be a   problem to have said that  Second, if this release will have an asymmetric tilt--as I think it should   because it’s the only honest thing that we can say now--then that coupled with too strong a   statement about ending this process could send the market a very confusing message and have a   counterproductive impact      Mr Chairman, I’d like to support Governor Meyer, particularly on   softening the statement at the very end of the second paragraph  I believe “threatens to keep the   pace of economic activity unacceptably weak” is a bit stronger wording than we need to use  I   think the language he suggested, “continues to weigh on the economy” is both accurate and   adequate  "
4362,2001-08-21," Thank you, Mr Chairman  As usual, by this time our discussion has   thoroughly dissected and evaluated the economy, and little remains to be added  So please   indulge a short-timer for a few concluding ruminations     First of all, it’s necessary to acknowledge, as almost everyone here has, significant   disappointment in the data that have come in over the intermeeting period  The main driver of   this slowdown, capital overhang drying up capital expenditures, looks no better  The inventory   correction, to my great surprise, drags on still  The world economic outlook looks even more   bleak, with political and financial tensions threatening to exacerbate the situation further    Although housing somehow continues to levitate, recent auto sales may be hinting that the   consumer is tiring, which could become a serious concern     Not everything is negative, of course  Industrial production and labor market   conditions may be stabilizing  The tax rebate checks are flowing, Fed easing should be kicking   in, inventory balance is coming into view, and energy prices are falling  Nevertheless, on   balance one must be concerned At the last meeting, there was speculation that the balance of   risks might be moving toward symmetry  At that time, I expected to be firmly in that camp by   today While I am indeed edging in that direction, I’m not ready yet to drive down the tent pegs   and settle in I’d like to, but I just can’t   Shifting the subject a bit, two strains of recent media comment strike me as   wrongheaded First there has been the suggestion that monetary policy isn’t working  Have   these people given any thought to what this economy might look like today if policy had not   changed this year?  If anything, I’d suggest that policy has worked more quickly than usual and   precisely where it was needed most, shoring up consumer and stock market confidence  And     8/21/01 59   now the traditional lagged impact of policy should start to be felt   Second, one is already starting to hear complaints that a recovery will be weak when it   comes  Here again I wonder if our critics have pondered the implications of a strong rebound?   Given the very high absolute level of activity that we have even today, I hope and expect that the   recovery will be moderate  An early boom beginning from here would lead quickly to major   new problems     Mr Chairman, in my view monetary policy is not part of the economy’s problem   today And going forward, I see monetary policy as having only a marginal role in the solution    At the first of this year a strong policy response was critical and I’m proud of the way this   Committee responded at that time  But now I feel that if we visibly but modestly support the   natural forces of recovery and remain patient, we can be most effective   Let me conclude where I began  Obviously, on balance things are still weak  But I   continue to believe in the mantra of recovery initiated by tax and interest rate cuts and rebalanced   inventory positions, aided by lower energy costs and now, perhaps, a somewhat lower dollar    But we cannot ignore our serious investment collapse, a very dangerous world situation, and the   possibility of a tiring consumer  What really concerns me most of all is that we must remain   concerned at a time when we expected to be relaxing a bit  It’s just possible that we may have   problems ahead of us that we do not yet see  At any rate, we’re not out of the woods yet  "
4363,2001-08-21," I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman  "
4409,2001-10-02," Thank you, Mr Chairman  First of all, my congratulations to   the Greenbook staff for a fine job under impossible conditions  However, as the authors     10/2/01 68   themselves are at pains to point out, this and all other forecasts today can have only a   limited credibility  This is evidenced by the quite appropriately wide spectrum of the   alternative scenarios, several of which are virtually as plausible as the baseline forecast   itself Yet policy must be made  How are we to meet that necessity?     I felt earlier and feel today that monetary policy made its most important   contribution to reversing this cycle over the first half of the year, and I’m proud of what   was done by this Committee  Given what is already in the pipeline, together with the   possibility of somewhat lower rates, policy seems very supportive  Changes from here   on will likely play a relatively minor role compared to developments in fiscal policy,   consumer confidence, and the progress of the war on terrorism  Monetary policy was, in   my opinion, a key positive force earlier, but the focus today may be to ensure that it does   not become a negative factor in the economic equation  How could that happen?   In the short run, this may be one of those very strange times when appearance   could be the most important reality  The Fed is on the recovery team, of course  But we   must be seen to be on that team by the man on the street, both on Main Street and Wall   Street  To be so perceived will be a positive force for recovery, whereas to be seen   otherwise could be a major negative  As our nation struggles to recover from a major   trauma, surprising the markets could be an additional trauma we just do not need right   now This condition will hopefully change soon and the day will likely come when a   policy surprise will be appropriate, but not today  Fortunately, Mr Chairman, inflation is   most likely going to trend downward over the forecast period, giving the Committee   some further room to maneuver and time to reverse course in an orderly manner       10/2/01 69   I believe the Committee will soon be facing two successive sets of challenges   and the sooner the better in each case  The first will be when and how to terminate this   easing cycle when the economy stabilizes  We obviously are not to that point yet  I hope   the end of our easing process will be followed shortly by the second challenge,   determining how and when it will be necessary to begin to damp the enormous amount of   stimulation that has been and will be pumped into this economy first by monetary policy   and soon by fiscal policy  I believe the Committee may be entitled to take some   satisfaction in the role policy has played in recent years, but the future will probably   prove to be at least equally as challenging as the past  What is needed today, however,   seems pretty straightforward  Thank you  "
4410,2001-10-02," I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman    "
4455,2001-11-06," I really should pass at this point!  Thank you, Mr Chairman  At the time   of our last meeting, the economic horizon already appeared dark, but there was little hard data yet   available to judge the severity of unfolding events  Since then we have gotten considerable   information that indicates that we have on hand a steep and rapid decline that may be starting to feed   on itself in a vicious cycle It’s not a pretty picture   It continues to be my view that monetary policy played a crucial and appropriate role in   the economy over the first half of the year  But we have now entered a period when its influence   will be subordinate to the unfolding of other events, political and military, domestic and   international, and how they impact on net with the psyche of the American consumer  Our challenge   today is to identify how monetary policy can most usefully assist in assuring a positive outcome, and   that will be discussed shortly  This will be an interesting exercise because even if everyone had   precisely the same view of the economic outlook, several different policy prescriptions can be seen   as the best way to go   Although fiscal actions under consideration have been discussed earlier by several around   the table, please let me make a brief comment on the expectations that a temporary investment tax   incentive may induce a significant early spurt in capital investment  Obviously, such a tax break is   quite attractive and tempting  However, given the present environment of extremely low capacity     11/6/01 69   utilization, rising unemployment, and weakening demand, this gambit may prove disappointing    Beyond whatever level of capital spending will occur regardless of events, a great many firms,    especially the smaller ones that constitute half or more of the nation’s production, are likely to   conclude that attractive as this incentive may be, they simply cannot afford to acquire nonessential   additional capacity when their existing capacity is so underutilized and the outlook is so uncertain    Larger and stronger companies who have more maneuvering room in managing their capital   structure are better candidates to accelerate their investments  However, they may wait and see until   the last minute before the incentive sunsets before making major discretionary commitments  If that   day is in the second half of 2004 it may come too late to be of much help, as the tale of the economic   recovery will by then have long since been told  If the economy is rebounding, they will be   investing anyway and the incentive would be unnecessary  If the economy is still in the doldrums at   that time, this incentive is unlikely to smoke them out, and policymakers will be searching for   stronger medicine  Thank you    I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman    I think the word “necessary” is good  "
