5  I will be referring to the exhibits in “Material for Briefing on  Trial-Run Policy Projections”    As part of its exploration into various approaches for enhancing the Committee’s  communications, the subcommittee on communications asked FOMC participants to  provide information on their individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy   More specifically, participants were asked to provide projections for the average level  of the federal funds rate target in the fourth quarter of each calendar year through the  forecast horizon of 2014 and over the longer run  These projections correspond to the  appropriate policy that participants incorporated into their November SEP  submissions  Participants who see the first policy firming occurring after 2014 were  asked to provide their assessments of the likely year of liftoff, as well as their  economic projections for that year   I have divided the handout’s exhibits into those similar to the ones seen in the  standard SEP release (these are exhibits 1 and 2) and those that might be useful for  internal discussions (these are exhibits 3 and 4)   As shown in exhibit 1, participants’ funds rate projections have a central tendency  of 13 to 67 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2012  Beyond 2012, differences in  views about the timing and pace of tightening can be seen in the widening of both the  central tendency and the range of projections  By the end of 2014, the central  tendency for the funds rate is 13 to 250 basis points  Thus, participants agree that by  the end of the forecast period, the policy rate will remain considerably below its  projected longer-run value, whose central tendency is 400 to 450 basis points The  longer-run projections represent the value of the funds rate to which the economy will  converge over time in the absence of further shocks  This longer-run value depends  on both the longer-run inflation rate, which the central bank can determine, and the  equilibrium real interest rate, which it cannot                                                     5 The materials used by Ms Mester are appended to this transcript (appendix 5)   November 1–2, 2011 126 of 282              Exhibit 2 provides histograms of the trial-run responses  As shown, there is  somewhat less disagreement about the appropriate path of policy—at least over the  next couple of years—than the central tendencies and ranges might suggest  A large  majority of participants—11 of 17—see the funds rate remaining at current levels  through 2013, consistent with the Committee’s current forward guidance that  economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal  funds rate at least through mid-2013  In contrast, by 2014, only 5 participants see the  funds rate still at current levels, and the range of projected values is quite wide  This  result suggests that, while participants are in fairly close agreement about their long- run objectives, they differ more significantly in their assessments of the economy and  about how monetary policy can influence economic outcomes   As shown in exhibit 3, there is considerable disparity in views about when  appropriate policy would require the funds rate to move off the zero bound  The  modal year is 2014, but three participants project no change until 2015 and one  projects no change until 2016  In contrast, one participant judges that the appropriate  year of policy liftoff is this year, and three others, in 2012   Participants cited several factors that informed their policy judgments  Those  favoring liftoff in 2014 or later cited slow growth and high unemployment coupled  with moderate inflation, high and persistent resource slack, and the effects of the zero  lower bound in limiting monetary policy accommodation  Those favoring an earlier  liftoff cited the need to forestall inflation pressures and financial and structural  imbalances, and the need to keep inflation expectations anchored  More generally,  some participants indicated that their views of appropriate policy included further  clarification of the Committee’s forward guidance, and some noted a relationship  between the Fed’s balance sheet and their funds rate paths   The trial run provided information on economic projections beyond the standard  forecast horizon for those participants anticipating that the first funds rate increase  would occur after 2014  This allows us to look at participants’ projections of  economic activity aligned on the year of the first increase rather than on a calendar  year  This is a step toward gaining a better understanding of participants’ views of  the economic conditions that underlie their assumed policy paths  Participants could  find such information useful in their internal discussions of policymaking and  communications issues, such as clarifying the conditionality of the Committee’s  forward guidance   It is important to remember that we do not know the exact timing of a  participant’s first rate increase—the collected information reveals only the level of  the funds rate in the fourth quarter of each year, and a participant could be  anticipating the first change in the funds rate early in that year or late in the year  So,  to get a sense of expected economic conditions and the expected change in economic  conditions at the time of the first projected rate increase, the top panel of exhibit 4  shows the central tendency and range of projections of real GDP growth, the  unemployment rate, and PCE inflation for the current year (2011), for the year prior  to liftoff, and for the year of liftoff   November 1–2, 2011 127 of 282              As indicated, in the year prior to their first rate increase (the middle bar in each  forecast panel), the central tendency of participants’ projections is for economic  growth to pick up from the current level of around 1¾ percent to between 2½ and  3¾ percent; for the unemployment rate to decline from around 9 percent this year to  between 7¾ and 9 percent; and for total PCE inflation to decline from around  2¾ percent this year to a range of 1½ to 2¾ percent   Then in the year of liftoff (the third bar in each forecast panel), participants  generally anticipate a slight acceleration in GDP and that the unemployment rate will  continue to move down—but the central tendency is fairly wide at 6½ to 8 percent   The central tendency of the inflation projection in the year of liftoff is about 1½ to  2¼ percent   Of course, while the central tendencies and ranges give summary information,  they don’t reveal the connections between an individual participant’s policy  assessment and his or her economic projections  The bottom panel of exhibit 4  displays some of that information in a set of scatter plots of pairs of variables from  each individual forecaster in his or her year of liftoff  It is important to note that  forecasters can have similar views of the economic conditions needed to spur liftoff,  but their views on the timing of when those conditions will be reached can differ  substantially  I’ve highlighted two points in the first scatter plot as an example  Each  of these two forecasters sees growth around 3 percent and the unemployment rate  around 8 percent when the fed funds rate moves away from the zero bound, but one  thinks this will happen in 2012 and the other thinks it won’t occur until 2014     As seen in the first plot, several participants are projecting that the first rise in the  funds rate will need to occur before the unemployment rate falls to 7½ percent and  with growth at 3½ percent or less  As shown in the bottom-right plot, all participants  anticipate that liftoff will need to occur even though inflation is under 3 percent and  the unemployment rate is at or above 6½ percent   These exhibits and those distributed on Monday are meant to illustrate how  information about participants’ policy expectations might facilitate the Committee’s  internal deliberations  If it would be helpful, the staff could collect and present this  information on an ongoing basis and assist in exploring approaches for disseminating  such information to the public through the SEP  Thank you     Yes, you are  One thing is in the handout that we distributed on   Monday—we did deviations from the long run—an individual’s forecast of long run  You can at   least see how far away they are from where they think the long-run gap is  But I would direct   you to look at those, and maybe that’ll give you some insight   The other thing we thought about doing is amending the one chart that is basically “Year   of Liftoff” in levels  You could imagine doing changes and then doing a central tendency and   the range of that  But derivatives of derivatives of derivatives get to me, although I read your   memo, and you have a third derivative in your loss function  [Laughter]
