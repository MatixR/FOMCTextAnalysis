36,1976-04-20,KIMBREL,"  Moving back to the acceptances, Peter, were these reductions  accomplished altogether in maturities?    Mr Chairman, for a slightly different reason, I think I would prefer to  see the downside reduced also  I have not reasoned out this closing of the spread, but I am  concerned about the difficult price signals that continue to emanate  And I guess if we really are  meaningful in trying to accomplish some price stability, I’d like to see us gradually move in that     4/20/76 - 24 -           direction  For that reason, I think I would like to see the 4 to 7 range prevail, with the idea of  maybe truly reflecting that, over that period, we are trying to accomplish some more price  stability  The other ranges, I think, would be satisfactory to me as you suggested    Mr Chairman, what latitude does that leave us, then, for any possible  action today that would  continue to be slightly tightening?    Mr Chairman, if our visits with some key businessmen the last couple of  weeks in New Orleans and Jacksonville--areas that we have generally regarded as     4/20/76 - 41 -           sluggish--[give us] a reasonable reading, than we have some concern that recovery is so much  stronger than the numbers would seem to indicate  Sure, these people are talking about the  difficulty with apartments, condominiums, office buildings, even shipyards and airplane  building, and yes, even cigars, but by and large they are exuding an awful lot of optimism   Apparently, within the confines of their own business, [they] are making decisions on that basis  [while] also accepting that unemployment is still a little high  They are not reading this as taking  a significant social toll because of the opportunities to provide for that     Against this, I think we feel that inflation could break out a good deal sooner than would  appear [to be the case now]  The recent price increases of steel and copper and gasoline, [even  though] supplies are assumed to be reasonable, has heightened the concern for price adjustment   So, for this reasoning, I would like to associate myself with alternative B and the number you  suggested  But definitely for 4-1/2 to 5-1/2, maybe for the reasons Mr Guffey has suggested,  and to move to the midpoint of that before our next meeting  "
62,1976-05-18,KIMBREL,"  Well, I come out pretty close to Governor Jackson, but maybe for  slightly different reasons  I’ve felt that since the first of the year it looks to me that M1 and M2  have exceeded the upper bounds of our long-run targets, and I think it is not an exaggeration to  suggest that the banks and thrift institutions in much of our area are almost awash with liquidity   South Florida for instance--the banks and savings and loan associations have reduced the rate on  their certificates, and actually the thrift institutions are turning away funds in excess of $10,000  for any account already existing or any new account  So what we see at least in that area is that  capacity is available to finance expansion     So, for logic alone, it seems that we at least ought to limit our short-term maximum to the  top of the long-term maximum that you have suggested  So I guess I would want to reduce even  more than 7-1/2, to the 7 number relating to logic  I guess the M2 does not make a great deal of  difference  But then for the exact same reasons Governor Jackson suggested, I’d like to see the 5  to 6 percent range [for the federal funds rate], with the idea that we’re going to center that maybe  slightly above the current rate  I guess this is not the point, but I would also like to inject that I  hope we would be prepared to move promptly even with the discount rate if the [federal] funds  [rate] moves above the current level    Mr Chairman, in that context, then, since we apparently really are  [unintelligible], I wonder in the wording if we could add just one word in the fourth line, “money  market conditions consistent with more moderate growth in monetary aggregates”  "
116,1976-07-19,KIMBREL,"  Mr Chairman, maybe I’m looking through a different set of glasses, but  I’d like to ask, along the same line, just how confident Mr Gramley feels about these  construction projections  In our own case, you ask for specific examples, here are a couple  A  major utility that shelved a nuclear construction project three years ago has recently announced  the resumption of it at a much higher cost of construction    And in the last couple of weeks, visiting with two of the larger builders in our area--one  specializing in manufacturing plant construction and the other in industrial parks--the industrial  builder said that within the last two months they had negotiated contracts for more construction  work than they had in any previous two-year period in their entire existence  The other indicated  that they were no longer pricing bids reasonably, that they were adding  [to their bids] simply to  miss the new contracts because they could not carry them out if they got them     So maybe these instances are entirely unique, but at least in visiting with those [businesses,  we see] there is construction under way in our area, and I am just wondering how confident you  feel about these construction projection figures     7/19-20/76 - 31 -    Yes    No, one is in industrial parks, but they are major industrial parks    Rent controls in Atlanta, is that upon supply?    No, none at all    Mr Chairman, I guess [I’m] biased towards an anticipation of a stronger  renewed expansion than would appear in some quarters  Associated with that is my continuing  anxiety about general price stability and the concern for the difficulty that we could experience  later this year with a necessity for a larger degree of firming if we fail to take some modest move  now  I could accept these ranges you suggest without difficulty  If I had my druthers, though, I  think I would prefer a half point reduction in [the lower limits of] M1 and M2 [as well as on the  topside], resulting in ranges of 4 to 7 and 7 to 9-1/2  "
143,1976-08-17,KIMBREL,"  Mr Chairman, maybe mine is an extension of Mr Winn’s interest, but  maybe a slightly different concern with compensation and with the pressures he outlines for price  moves  I wonder, though, on the other side, if I read the Greenbook numbers correctly, they’re  projecting a rise in compensation of about 8 percent over the next half year and  7-1/2 percent by  the end of 1977  Just wondering, with wage settlements and the experience in prices Mr Winn  relates to, whether these modest numbers may very well be a reflection or feeling that inflation is  not going to be a tremendous factor through 1977  You can expect to see some reduction    Mr Chairman, I’d like to pick up at the same spot and suggest that I  very much hope that the seasonal opportunities will be utilized to accomplish some reduction of  reserve requirements for the reasons that were already stated  I’m hopeful that this would be a  good opportunity to capitalize on that     For the other, [unintelligible] longer-run expectations remain good  We have not seen a  lack of funds [that would] threaten  the economic upswing  The liquidity positions of both the  lenders and the borrowers remain [unintelligible], certainly at this moment--an easier monetary  policy would change the attitudes that are prevailing  So we would certainly be inclined to  associate ourselves with the suggestions of alternative B  "
164,1976-09-21,KIMBREL,"  Mr Chairman, I’m concerned how staunchly Mr Zeisel [would] support  the prices [projection]--5 to 5-1/2 [unintelligible] I guess is limited only by food and energy  If  these wage rates should start picking up and if these industrial price hikes stand, I wonder how  strongly he feels that [unintelligible] these numbers look pretty good at 5 to 5-1/2      Mr Chairman, I think we accept the feeling that there may very well be  a temporary lull--but temporary, really  And we share many of the optimistic observations you  named earlier  We would be somewhat reluctant to engage in any obvious easing at this  particular time, fearful that, with everything else, the market could misinterpret [it]--that we were  unduly concerned about the present state and were moving at this juncture to accommodate that,     9/21/76 - 23 -    [which is] more than we really feel  With no apparent end to the federal deficit--and, like you,  my question earlier certainly indicated that I have some difficulty with prices over the next five  to six quarters with over a 5 to 5-1/2 percent increase     I guess that if we could maintain something of a steady posture, I have the feeling that  businessmen themselves would be encouraged to make some forward commitment  Though I,  too, would favor [remaining] very close to exactly where we are at the present time, I do feel  some concern, that if we stay at this specific spot very long, particularly with interest rates and  federal funds rates, that when we do move, there is going to be an overreactive reading of our  move at that time  So I would hope that we maintain a steady posture but not unreasonably long     I guess I should not pass this way without hoping that, some time--and not too far away--it  would be convenient to consider some adjustment in reserve requirements  Announcing maybe  that this is not intended as an easing move but with idea of encouraging bankers to not give  difficult lending terms and to consider some [unintelligible] more aggressive practices and, not  the least, to reduce inequities with nonmember banks  "
186,1976-10-19,KIMBREL,"  Mr Sternlight, what was the general market reaction to your  determination to try for no option for early redemption of [unintelligible]    Mr Chairman, I believe my question was answered in the response to  President MacLaury with regard to the possible injection of additional expenditures for the  shortfall and [unintelligible], and I believe Mr Gramley suggested that the projections do  indicate some slight [unintelligible], but that was my problem     10/19/76 - 13 -    Mr Chairman, reluctantly, I guess, I’m prepared to accept some small  monetary ease  I think I share the expression of Mr Gramley this morning that I honestly do not  believe that monetary policy action at this point is going to accomplish really what we would like  to see  From our vantage point, I have not recognized lack of liquidity as a major reason that  lenders are still being reluctant partners  I would obviously prefer to see some temporary fiscal  stimulus, but I don’t see that forthcoming, so the next alternative, I guess, is to accept almost  exactly--or exactly--the specifications you suggested  I think that’s about as good as we can  accomplish at the moment        Mr Chairman, like Governor Wallich, I too am in total agreement with  the long-term policy of gradually reducing our longer-range targets, particularly in recognition of  our reduced inflation  I therefore would like very much to see us inch down to the 4-1/2 to 6-1/2  [range for M1,] particularly since we have not really been using that range, as you’ve pointed  out  In fact, continued low interest rates do make the savings and time deposits attractive, and  maybe it would be technically fair--and as was suggested earlier, maybe it would have some  announcement effect--if we rightfully eased [M2] back to 8 to 10  I have no trouble with what  you pointed out, but if I had a particular preference, I guess I would prefer to have 4-1/2 to 6-1/2  [for M1] and 8 to 10 on M2    "
208,1976-11-08,KIMBREL,"  Good morning, Mr Chairman and gentlemen  I too am concerned about  the appearance of a possibly weaker economic situation from three months ago and maybe even  the potential for some adverse publicity that we would encounter from lowering our long-range  target  I find myself more impressed by our need not to compromise our responsibilities  In the  last week or ten days, we have moved around the District a good deal, discussing with  businessmen, and I have not detected in any area feelings that any of these men are suggesting  that there’s a lack of funds available, that the lack of these funds is in any way limiting their  plans  There seems to be ample liquidity     The other thing though that does appear to be concerning businessmen in our area is still  the specter of inflation  And maybe, certainly in recent days, there seems to be almost a phobia  that we are destined to have [price] controls  The limit of those controls is the only thing that  seems to be yet unresolved  Well, then, I feel we have to move to think about our part in the  contribution to the economy, and I think it [was] already alluded to that we’d be better served to  remain consistent in our continuing  a gradual reduction of our long-range targets     I think that Federal Reserve policy is likely to be rather obvious and is rather obvious over  the near term  I sense that the business community is rather eager for us to reassure them with  some contributions to stability  It is against that background, Mr Chairman, that I would like to  see us continue our plan of reducing, gradually, the upper range  And I would like to see M1  move to 4-1/2 to 6-1/2  I expressed before, and say again, because of the usual quirks of the time  deposits [unintelligible], it’s not that bad on M2  I’m perfectly willing to accept some gradual  increase there  But more importantly, today, I’d like to see us continue our practice of gradually  moving down the M1 range to [in this case] 4-1/2 to 6-1/2     11/8/76 - 10 -            Mr Chairman, I could accept, I guess, a very, very modest increase in  these, but I’m much more impressed that any such movement now would thoroughly confuse the  market  I really believe it will be difficult for us to pass that message along  I prefer simply at  this moment to reduce the upper range of M1  "
225,1976-11-16,KIMBREL,"  Any magic in those numbers that they arrived at?    Won’t you be having the chairmen and the deputy chairmen [of the  Reserve Bank boards] here in a couple of weeks?  Would you feel at liberty to discuss this with  them at that time?    Mr Chairman, I think [there is] not much more to be added because I’m  prepared to accept almost literally just what you concluded  I think there is adequate liquidity, I  see no indication of any lack of liquidity in the system, so I do not foresee the need for easing for  that reason  I remain considerably concerned, as do our directors, about inflationary  expectations  I would also hope that consideration of the discount rate could be favorable,  maybe of 1/4 point, and I say that mainly because of the announcement effect that might have  with the market  Obviously, it isn’t being used a great deal, but I think it might have some  favorable influence from the announcement     As for the numbers you assigned to alternative B, I am prepared to accept all of them  I  guess I feel very strongly, though, that if we could, I would hope we could operate almost  [always] in the range of 4-3/4 to 5 percent  During this period, I would be reluctant to see the  rate come below [4]-3/4 and I most assuredly would not like to see the rate going up  I am  prepared to accept the numbers you assigned there  I would hope actually it would be somewhat  more constrained  "
251,1976-12-20,KIMBREL,"  That was exactly the thrust of my question, Mr Chairman  Is any  urgency attached to making a decision this afternoon?  Could we delay and await some further  action before making this final decision?     12/20-21/76 - 6 -          Mr Chairman, I wonder if I could get just a little amplification of what  is intended at the bottom of page 3, “suggest in handling these transaction and no attempt shall  be made to establish rates that appear to be out of line with underlying market forces”  I wonder  if we could have just a little further indication of what--     12/20-21/76 - 8 -          The very last phrase at the bottom of page 3   SPEAKER(?)  The date of the document   SPEAKER(?)  What?   SPEAKER(?)  The date of that document?    Revised Authorization    That’s right, very good  Question withdrawn    Mr Chairman--well, I guess the fiscal stimulus you’ve been toying with  is at the level of $15 billion    You suggested that the lower OPEC prices produced a slightly higher  GNP next year because of the lower rate  Have you toyed with any alternatives with less than  $15 billion, [as] some of the new Administration people seem to say that they are going to wait     12/20-21/76 - 41 -         until somewhat later and observe  And the chances this might not be the figure, it might be  lower than that--have you toyed with any of that?    Mr Chairman, I am encouraged by the timely movement of the interest  rates  The fact that M1 has been growing generally within the long-term guidelines   [Unintelligible] of course pointed out here, late December, early January often finds us with a  volatile money supply, and this brings me to what you suggested yesterday, that there are times  for pause  And I very much think that this is one of those  With all of the action, it seems that if  we were to provide any additional stimulus at this time, we might be pressing unduly     I also have just one more observation  And that is, there seems to be almost unanimous  acceptance that there will be a rather generous fiscal stimulus  Of course, the only thing  unresolved is the magnitude  If, indeed, that magnitude should not be [forthcoming] or [it acts]  in a different manner, it’s generally assumed we could possibly see some erosion of confidence   I’d hate to see that happen, and I think we could judge that better a month from now  I would be  happy to see us stay very much the way we are, with the money market proposal related to  alternative B--exactly where we are  "
281,1977-01-17,KIMBREL,"  Mr Chairman, I don’t know about the numbers, but I think the  discussion with our own directors and the consensus [among] businessmen comes out pretty  close to that expressed by Governor Lilly, and it’s not optimistic  I think also that they have a  concern that the cost may be indirectly associated with unusual weather conditions [and will]  provide an opportunity to pass through energy costs and labor costs  They’re enormously  concerned about the prices and the potential for inflation  I think, though, that the expectation of     1/17-18/77 - 31 -           our people is that prices are sure to escalate, but that the mood is going to continue [being] very  good     Now, I wonder if the staff has given some thought to the possibility that some capital  spending has been delayed, waiting for the determination of possible tax advantages this year,  and it may be we have some [spending] coming on stream that was waiting for the possibility of  taking tax advantages    Mr Chairman, I particularly appreciate your willingness early to give  some evaluation of your reading of the possibility of thwarting fiscal policy by any action of  ours  Candidly, I would feel somewhat reluctant to raise the M1 ranges, but I continue to be, as  expressed earlier, very much attentive to inflationary possibilities--they continue to be  unsatisfactory--and expectations, from my vantage point, are even more disturbing   Nevertheless, I think we need to demonstrate our concern for that expectation, and I am  impressed with the prospect for maintaining a gradual lowering of the long-term target  So with  that I think I would be very happy with exactly the prescription you have suggested    Mr Chairman, I believe Governor Partee has phrased my honest feeling  about this  If had my druthers, I [would] really prefer to see the funds rate with a somewhat  larger spread  I recognize the problem that we face and am prepared to accept this narrower  4-1/2 to 5, but that doesn’t mean I am overwhelmingly happy about it     In M2, I would like to hope that we could not exceed the long-run targets, or maybe that’s  too much to expect at this moment, but I would like to see us shave at least a half point, to 7-1/2  to 11 if we could; but within that, the alternative B seems to be the most acceptable  "
306,1977-02-15,KIMBREL,"  Mr Zeisel, you refer to minimum likelihood of the labor force  negotiations this year, I wonder if your projections have accorded any dimensions to the  possibility [of an] increase [in] the minimum wage     I really had in mind any further increase though    I’m not so sure  At least in the south Florida area, the CD related to  foreign is significant  And so much so that some of the larger banks have put a $150,000 limit  on what they will accept from foreign sources    Mr Chairman, [unintelligible]  Do you have any information that  refunds are likely to be, in timing or amounts, significantly different from the usual this year?    Mr Chairman, I think we share the same concern for the delicate  uneasiness and all of the reasons you suggest, but I did detect that you referred to the weather- induced distortions that we are experiencing  And I think they, too, are contributing to that  uneasiness  I think this caution that’s been generated has probably pushed [backward] some of  the capital investment commitments for two or three months  I don’t think we need to anticipate  any of this in our action  I personally would like to see more definitive developments both in the  fiscal area and in the business community before we move     I guess I have a natural inclination to rather anticipate some movement in the federal funds  rate, and would be naturally inclined to spread that from a 4-1/4 to 5-1/4, but I guess my restraint  is more in the area of trying to maintain some stability at this particular moment  I think that  would serve us better for this immediate period  So I would opt for alternative B exactly as is  written, and the specification   "
333,1977-03-15,KIMBREL,"  Mr Chairman in those lumber figures, I think maybe even that’s  conservative according to some of the builders, because they are almost quoting a $1,000  addition to the price of lumber in the average home in our area at the moment  So just the  lumber alone is becoming a substantial deterrent in cost--particularly in houses    I’m not sure we can say that, Mr Chairman, because every time the  Administration says that [they] are not interested, it surfaces again  So if they’d just quit saying  “we are concerned,” I think it will settle back down  But “the louder thou persisteth”--it seems  to be coming through to the businessmen    Mr Chairman, I thought I’d acknowledge the [unintelligible] weather  conditions induced and the uncertainties, but I guess I am quickly moved to the feeling that  Governor Partee discussed somewhat earlier  I think the economy actually is going to be much  stronger in the third and fourth quarters than we have [assumed]  Inventory-induced stronger  real growth [and] capital investments--I think that’s going to react in prices, create difficulties in  financial markets, relate to interest rates  And I’d hope that maybe even now we’d begin to not  offset or necessarily anticipate but to be aware of and guard against some of that and against  excessive growth in the aggregates     With that I would be quite happy with the numbers you have assigned to the aggregates   In the federal funds area, I’m perfectly agreeable still with the 4-1/2 to 5-1/4 numbers  But more  than I’ve heard expressed otherwise, I’d want to lean a little bit more in the area of 4-3/4 to  4-7/8  And if we are indeed going to be moving in the area of 7 percent by the end of the year or  early next year, I think that we might as well begin to gradually do that without a precipitous  move    Just a question, Mr Chairman  Timing really must have come into the  discussion--with these exceptional cases or delicate banking structure--that you resolved to your  own satisfaction  "
359,1977-04-19,KIMBREL,"  Question, this to Mr Zeisel  In your report, you make reference to the  change in minimum wage  What sort of projections are you using with regard to your  expectations of what the minimum wage will be?    Mr Chairman, I have labored with the thought that there’s probably  never going to be that ideal time for us to make these moves, but listening to our own people and  observing events in our own area, I continue to be considerably impressed with inflationary  expectations, the prices, businessmen who are still fearful that controls could come along  I  accept the uncertainty that the energy message induces, but I also have to associate with that the  at least reasonable expectation that [the energy initiatives] may contribute further pressures on  upward price movement       4/19/77 - 32 -           I recognize almost an abundance of liquidity, so I guess I am almost forced into feeling  that we ought to move, and we ought to move in a fashion that would not shock the markets, to  be certain, but would leave no question that we were attempting to restrain any inflation that  would be forthcoming  Mr Chairman, I would like to see us move the lower range of M1 to 4-- down a half point  I would like to see M2, upper and lower, down a half, to 6-1/2 to 9-1/2  M3,  a half point upper and lower, to 8 to 11    Mr Chairman, I think the numbers are perfectly acceptable as you  assigned them  Except at the midpoint, I guess I have to be more leaning away from  asymmetrical  I’d like to see it [at the] actual midpoint, and maybe not too far away      [Unintelligible]  "
387,1977-05-17,KIMBREL,"  Well, Mr Chairman, indeed, in our area, we are hearing an awful lot of  very happy news  Everything is relative, though, I guess  But I was concerned at our breakfast  meeting last Friday and in some of our sessions very recently with businessmen that, for the first  time, we’ve been observing purchases anticipating high prices or anticipating the possibilities of  some slow deliveries  I wonder if you are observing this in other areas    You would not assign a great dimension of current purchases against  borrowing from the future    Well, businessmen    Mr Chairman, it isn’t often that our view in the deep South coincides so  much with New England, but this morning I’m very close to Mr Morris  We’ve done a little  more than our usual checking on attitudes and relationships with businessmen in the last couple  of weeks  And we find them ebullient  We find the expectation [for] the economy strong and  likely to continue, including the New Orleans area for investment and retail trade  Our Florida  friends are almost completely overlooking the weather-induced difficulty [with the] citrus  [crop]--[they] almost think that it was an act of providence [because of] our overproduction     Right, right  The vegetable people have already come along with a crop  to regain [unintelligible]  Flowers and houseplant people are full speed ahead, so they are very  happy  Tourist [offices] admitted that the studies they are making with relation to gasoline are  not very scientific, but they are [saying] that [it] would take a dollar a gallon to very much  [reduce] tourist activity in Florida     Well, moving [from] that to the possibility that the minimum wage is going to be raised,  I  have come [to] the very strong feeling that business leaders are confidently expecting that the  system is going to lean against inflationary pressures that are building  Frankly, I think we  should, and I concur on that view and that we should continue to do so gradually  If I had any  difference of view with the numbers you’ve specified, I would take 5-1/4 to 6 percent on the  federal funds rate and use it  We’ve stuck for some months and then gradually moved since our  last meeting, so I think the market really is about ready to accept this restraint  I’d accept the  other numbers you’ve assigned under an aggregates objective    I hope they do a better job of that than they do some other things    Really got our share of--  "
449,1977-07-19,KIMBREL,"  Mr Chairman, just a bit curious--in your basic assumptions, what are  you incorporating about the minimum wage changes, and do these have any significant  implications for your projections?    Mr Chairman, I, too, feel that it’s an appropriate time for us to make  some lowering of these targets, for the reasons already suggested  There appears to be adequate  liquidity in the system, a foreign exchange consideration  The economy, as certainly we read,  appears to be moving rather well  I would hope that we could have that continue for some period  of time, but with a very strong look at the continuing price problem  So I would feel that we  could have the M1, 4 to 6; the M2, from 7 to 9; no particular change in M3     Having said that, though, I would certainly leave to others the extent to which there is a  feeling that the current legislative environment would make it something less than prudent to  move in quite that direction  But I would hope that this would be an opportunity; we could begin  to make a visible move to restrain inflation, maybe [for] a good while    And so will I    In our [Treasury] financing, if we are going to move, would we need to  do this very quickly?    Treasury financing  "
475,1977-08-16,KIMBREL,"  Mr Chairman, [we see] a good deal of concern in the farm area at the  moment because of the extended drought and difficulties of the corn crop and the possibilities of  some financing of the farmers against the difficulties of the production of corn  However, many  of the others are coming along very well--peanuts, soybeans, citrus operators, and vegetable  people have not done badly at all     The businessmen are still possessed of a good deal of uncertainty related to a few things  that have been commented on here  energy, tax, environmental concerns, and certainly inflation   But against all of that we still detect a rather optimistic outlook for most of these businessmen   Even in the construction area, two of the large regional construction companies recently  suggested that they were intentionally adding extra margins of profit simply because they had all  the work they wanted to take on anytime soon  It was simply, if they took anymore work, they  were going to make certain that they made an extra profit on it  Construction, sure, the housing  is still very strong  Particularly on the west coast of Florida, it’s almost incredible what’s  happening in the residential construction area and the prices that are attached to it  Industrial or  commercial construction, federal building yes, but utilities, Coca Cola, Bell  Contrary to the  difficulties of paper on the West Coast, new paper and pulp plants are being built in Alabama   New hotel in New Orleans  So certainly it’s not doom and gloom there at the moment    Mr Chairman, operating, I guess, from a personal hunch that maybe the  economy is moving along somewhat stronger than it would appear in some segments--    --I believe we are reasonably agreed that our fundamental task here is to  try to bring the money growth back into the target range, and if that should [require] almost no  growth in the aggregates in the near term, that translates with me as at least [a] slightly less  accommodative posture  So I find comfort in the numbers you have assigned to M1     I guess I would not like to see the federal funds rate slip below the 6 percent range since  they have accomplished that  I would hope that maybe we could stay somewhere in that area for  the near term  Also, to see that range widened if we possibly could  I’ve been uncomfortable  with such a narrow range for some time  Maybe even if we [lowered] the bottom [limit] of  5-3/4, I’d like to see [us raise the top limit] up to 6-3/4 if we could, to begin to widen that, not  with the idea we would move immediately above the 6 percent, but certainly [strengthen] the  inclination not to slip below that until we’re somewhat more comfortable in what is happening  with the money numbers     As to the discount rate, our directors for some time have been under the impression that,  with the inflation and with the growth, a change would be appropriate  I would personally prefer  to see a smaller move, 1/4 [point], but maybe the numbers now are such that the market is  reasonably conditioned, and if we could not move again another 1/4 point within a month to six  weeks, I would prefer to have a 1/2 percentage point and do it reasonably early     Friday of this week    Simply, Mr Chairman, to the background environment in which this  question comes  Is it one of openness and fairness or is it with some ulterior motive, or do you  detect any--I guess a reading of the background from which it springs    Mr Chairman, I guess that was pretty much the thrust of my original  question  Is our relationship in this such that these people are just eager beaver to have them  August 15, or are they willing to sit down and counsel a little bit with Mr Coyne and wait for  January or something--could ease off---or is there some real point they’re trying to make  I  guess what I’m saying is, if we want to maintain our orderly process of releasing them in January  and that means something to us, can we sit down with them and say, “Well, you’re going to get  them in January--can you wait?”    That’s what I guess I would--  "
504,1977-09-20,KIMBREL,"  I promise you it’s not going to take that much time, Mr Chairman  Just  expanding, though, the ideas--the consumer installment credit  I guess our people are somewhat  less optimistic about the total new automobile sales over the coming year than you would  project, and I recognize that these numbers, if we read them correctly, are pretty close to what  General Motors is saying  But I guess we are looking at the likelihood that used cars are going  to be somewhat less as a trade-in, and if indeed [unintelligible] anticipating an increase next  year  I guess we are wondering how firm you feel your projections are     9/20/77 - 21 -    I don’t feel so bad about mine as I did before    Mr Chairman, my reasoning is almost identical with Mr Coldwell’s   Just expressed the numbers exactly  I’m not sure [whether], on the federal funds, we would even  want to enunciate the asymmetrical note, but I think I’d be much more inclined to let the market  forces take the funds rate up as soon as practicable  I have the feeling that up to now, at least,  the increases in short-term interest rates have had only a modest impact on the long-term rates or  on the flow of mortgage funds  Considerable liquidity remains  I continue to be something less  than impressed with the progress we’re making on this inflation, the energy costs, and the ripple  effects or [unintelligible] upward thrust, or however you want to word it  With the minimum  wage possibilities forthcoming, and our lack of impressive productivity gains, I really think we  still have to apply some further modest restraint and get back to, say, with your numbers, 2 to 7  [for M1], 4 to 8 [for M2], and 6 to 6-3/4 [federal funds rate]  "
528,1977-10-17,KIMBREL,"  Mr Chairman, we have not had a chance to pursue this to great lengths,  but there have been several indications in the last two, three weeks that life insurance companies  are indeed beginning to invest in our area, in single-family investments, mortgages    Single-family mortgages in our area  Now, whether that could be  characterized yet as a major decision, I’m not sure, but there are known instances that that is  beginning to happen    But his neighbor across the street is doing that, though  Equitable is,  indeed  Because this happens to be one of those that we’re familiar with    Well, now this--    I believe they’re having their normal brokers    Mr Chairman, I guess I should [say that] the negative features that relate  to us are entirely, at this moment, apparently strike related  Lockheed, of course, yesterday  voted to strike in the Atlanta area, which is a significant employer  On the other side, the New  Orleans dock workers apparently have voted reluctantly for going back to work and eliminate  some of that bottleneck there  The concern also is about the activities of coal miners in  Alabama, Tennessee, and they work a day [on] and a day off, so at least those are clouds  But  east Tennessee barely remembers that there’s been any change because their employment there is  full speed ahead  The west coast of Florida is experiencing the same sort of rebound that is  difficult to comprehend in the real estate, housing area  The Louisiana and south Alabama oil  exploration people are almost uncontained  They just can’t get enough rigs and enough people  to work  They are as excited about their future as [unintelligible]  Even in the Atlanta area, the  feeling is one of optimism  So, Mr Chairman, we just simply must come out in our area with a  feeling that things do not look blue over the next few quarters    Mr Chairman, in our visits and contacts, we seem to be encountering  about as many people who think that we, the Federal Reserve System, are going to fail in our  mission of trying to maintain some inflation control as there are those who think that we may  overdo  So with that, I guess, I personally then become regretful that the visibility of these  money numbers has attained such a stature and that we toy with them so  But having gotten  there, then I think we have to maybe share what you commented on earlier--that our major  emphasis should be on facilitating the orderly expansion of the economy     In that vein, I guess I personally feel that we ought to, at this juncture, reaffirm our  determination to accomplish some slow growth in these monetary aggregates  Consequently, I’d  like to see us with alternative B pretty much as they appear, with a single exception of M1, and  that to 4 to 6  And the basis for that extra 1/2 percentage [point] reduction there would be, as has  already been mentioned, that we’re going to be [starting] from a higher monetary [base], [so] it  would be helpful if we also indicate there that we are contemplating some restraint    Mr Chairman, I come out very close to that [position] just enunciated   Earlier we had indicated that we feel slightly more optimistic than the staff had projected, and  we remain hopeful, of course, that the money demands will ease off, but we are continuing to be  anxious about the concern for inflation  I think we would accordingly prefer numbers associated  with C, but we could accept B with the feeling that we would very much hate to see at this  juncture the federal funds rate sink below 6-1/2  So for that reason, I think we’d like, maybe,  alternative B numbers associated with the 6-1/2 to 7 percent federal funds  "
558,1977-11-15,KIMBREL,"  Mr Chairman, I would very strongly also follow the recommendations  of Mr O’Connell  It seems to me that we might very well anticipate many, many things that can  come along, but I rather think that it would be wise to take these in a logical order; and to     11/15/77 - 15 -         attempt this, we still are able to get together to discuss these subsequently  I rather think it  would be wise for us to kind of forgo trying to anticipate too much for the future and accept the  recommendations that he made    Mr Chairman, I think our views do not differ substantially at all from  that projections of the staff  If we [saw] any weakness, it might be that we would anticipate  slightly less strength in the housing starts than the staff suggests     Visiting with our businessmen reveals interesting differences--they generally expect a  rather good, strong 1978, but [are] extremely uncertain--almost bordering on unhappiness--that  relates to certain government policies, energy, tax reform, and minimum wage decisions   Interestingly, a group of predominately black college professors visited with us the last week at  the Bank  The most outspoken part of their discourse was with their unhappiness with the  minimum wage increases  It came as something of a surprise to us because they were  anticipating that the black youths were going to be losing the jobs and would be creating social  problems     Generally, though, I think we would come out pretty close to the staff projections and with  the feeling that ’78 is not going to be such a bad year    Mr Chairman, I too think that the ranges suggested in alternative B are  desirable  As earlier indicated, I have been, and am, disturbed about the uncertainties that  continue to haunt the financial markets  I would think that the very best we could do would be to  provide some small measure of stability, and I’d like to suggest that we maintain that posture  I  obviously do not want to ignore the continuing inflationary expectations or possibilities, and for  that reason I would be rather reluctant to see the funds rate drop below the 6-1/2  But I still think  that, at this time, maybe the range suggested there would be desirable  "
583,1977-12-19,KIMBREL,"  Mr Chairman, I find the paper to be rather helpful, and it’s even  approaching erudite, and I like the approach [and] share the suggested procedure  I think this  discussion has been productive, and I think it certainly comes under the heading of advance  planning is prudent  Having said that, I have a natural preference for a wider interest rate spread,  but I think, beyond what we have done, I’d elect to wait [for] some more of the details of the     12/19-20/77 - 29 -         Merrill decision without trying to resolve everything here, anticipating what the court’s going to  dictate      Mr Chairman, I think from our vantage point we are inclined to feel that  the projections for automobiles are rather optimistic, significantly so  We have a similar view  about housing  As a matter of fact, it would seem that the projections are almost at the high end  of the surveys we’ve seen available, and I’d like to query if there’s any special reason that we are  not aware of that would give the staff this amount of optimism  We hope it’s right, but we don’t  share it at the moment    Amen, Mr Chairman  "
624,1978-01-17,KIMBREL,"  Mr Chairman, I think we too are hearing, as President Willes suggested,   more comments about inflationary expectations  The business community seems to be worrying   Maybe it’s the uncertainty that exists, but we seem to be hearing more of that  I think net we would  come out close to what the staff has projected [though] from our vantage point we would be  somewhat less optimistic about housing developments  We don’t see that quite as strong over the  year as they are projecting and we’re possibly even somewhat less optimistic about total  automobile sales than they are suggesting  Looking though at the total revenue tax  changes--revenue drag--I wonder if the staff has done any projections or incorporated a possibility  of any influence from the refunds for this year that might be different from usual--if indeed they  might make any contribution to possible spending      Peter, if we are anticipating a Treasury financing we attempt to   accommodate that  If we were to move to, say, 7 percent, how much time [would that give us]?   When would the Treasury be announcing?      Presumably then we have a week     That was my question     Mr Chairman, I guess I would prefer alternative C  Although Mr Volcker   has fine-tuned it, I would hate to see the funds rate moved down any, so rather than that, I think I  prefer to see [a funds range of ] 6-3/4 to 7-1/4 percent, particularly after Mr Axilrod’s statement  and the Bluebook’s [indication] that we may very well have to move earlier than later  So I would  prefer to see that composition at the moment    "
653,1978-02-28,KIMBREL,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I too think that the staff projections appear very   reasonable this time  Like others, we too are happier with the projections for the automobile and  housing numbers  As we had commented a couple of times previously, we thought they were a  little ambitious; these appear more attuned to our own beliefs     It may be only in degree but we are somewhat more optimistic about the unemployment   possibilities; we may be influenced by our own area but we’re slightly more optimistic about the  total employment picture than is projected [in the Greenbook]  We seem to be reaching, in some  areas particularly, a situation that I think simply cannot be characterized as unemployment, so we  feel somewhat more optimistic  On the contrary, though, we feel somewhat less sanguine and less  optimistic about the prospects for inflation, influenced maybe by the continuing high Federal  deficit and the trade deficit  We are impressed also by the fallout of the coal strike, both its  determination of increased utility rates and also the likelihood that the final settlement will be  somewhat higher than we anticipated and may well contribute to other larger labor negotiation  increases  Continued comment by the Administration about voluntary wage and price [restraint] is  almost a red flag as far as our business people are concerned  It generates what we would       2/28/78           23  characterize as a self-serving expectation of inflation that may very well be somewhat higher than  the staff projects  But other than that, we think the [staff’s] numbers are very reasonable      Just a question, Mr Chairman  That means you would leave M2   unchanged?     Just to proceed  I followed you very carefully and [was] right with you all   the way  I do think our credibility is involved  And I think it=s becoming maybe more important to  hit the targets than it is to set them  I guess my only possible variation would be on M2  I might  lean to reducing the upper end of that 1/2 point also  But otherwise I share completely your views      Mr Chairman, these numbers associated with alternative B are rather   attractive to me  If I had a personal preference, and absent your very last comment that maybe the  time does argue for no change, I guess it would be easing down M1 1/2 percentage point [on the  top and bottom] to 1/2 to 5-1/2 percent, M2 as suggested [in alternative B], and the funds rate as  indicated there  I sure would hate to see [the rate] go below 6-3/4 percent and yet I absolutely  would not during this period want to see it go above 7, although I have a personal bias against  restricting the range any more than it is  So I am prepared to accept [the numbers in “B”] as they  are with the single suggestion that, absent the timing [issue], I=d prefer to see the M1 range reduced  1/2 point    "
677,1978-03-10,KIMBREL,"  May I ask one question about numbers, please?  Governor Wallich, I’m   not sure I quite followed the discussion about the $16 billion and the [$400 million] and maybe the  resulting $24 billion  Are we expecting, as a result of this--if it moves along--that initially at least  we will be operating from a $24 billion level of exposure?      So again, our exposure, at least in this part of the operation, would be   approximately $24 billion     Well, Mr Chairman, I share some of the anxieties already [expressed]  I   strongly hope that we can handle this in a manner [that will encourage action] to address the  fundamental causes  But I don’t see any strong or definitive alternatives, and I think this is a part  of the package that we need to associate with  So I would be inclined to try to develop it    "
696,1978-03-21,KIMBREL,"  Mr Chairman, it seems to me that maybe that’s an extreme effort--trying   to decide the extent of disorder and the [scale of operations needed to counter] the disorder  The  final statement suggests that there’s going to be close consultation at all times  I guess I find some  difficulty in trying to distinguish [the degree of] disorder and would be more inclined not to try to  get to that point  Won’t this be a difficult operation--to try to describe or distinguish the disorder as  you contemplate?      That’s exactly what I am talking about     Mr Chairman, I’m sure [our view] is influenced heavily by the Sun Belt   exposure but [based on] our recent swing around the District [talking] with community leaders,  including ladies and consumer advocates, we are just unavoidably attached to the idea that inflation  is rampant, and we are very, very much concerned  It’s pretty difficult to find anything close,  except their concern for an energy policy of some kind--even if it’s bad as long as they know the  rules We hear this over and over  Inflation is the number one [concern], then energy, and then  buildings  Sure, the Latins are very prominent in our area and are buying heavily but [it was] just  announced [that] the Canadians are buying a 13,500 acre spot just south of Miami for a huge  development  Employment, [in terms of finding] skilled people, is difficult so I guess we have to  be very much concerned about inflation at the moment  This leads me immediately to ask Mr  Kichline how strongly he feels about the [projections for] unit labor costs  Looking at the  projections for output per man hour and compensation per hour and relating them to the recent past,  do you feel pretty good about those overall?      I, too, am very much concerned about the inflation and inflationary   expectations that we’ve encountered, and I think we ought to take advantage of this opportunity to  move--maybe not aggressively, but certainly there’s the opportunity for some modest move   Playing with the numbers I guess I, too, would like to close the range some so M1 I’d maybe put at  4 to 8 percent; I have no objection to 5 to 9 on M2  For the federal funds rate, I would very much  dislike seeing the rate sink below 6-3/4 percent but again, hopefully, it would not move above 7  unless we had some additional numbers [and the need to move it up] became apparent  So, I would  like to see a 6-3/4 to 7-1/4 percent range, with some modest leaning upward    "
720,1978-04-18,KIMBREL,"  Just simply a question What is our potential for loss in this kind of  operation in the current situation?      Mr Chairman, we are now very close to the staff’s projections   Particularly this time with the reduced real GNP growth and the projected high inflation rates, we  are getting very close to what my own staff has been trying to impose on me for some months now   Both the demand-pull and the cost-push forces, we think, are very much at work  Let me give a  few examples [from] our recent visits with businessmen in our area and our directors  They [talked  about business in terms such as] “extremely good” or “booming”  Tourist business in our area is  the best since l973  Offshore gas and oil business is booming  Office space in several areas is  tight Trucking in [unintelligible] the Teamsters; trucking can’t handle the business  This is  translating into enormous inflationary expectations in calculating the new decisions being made,  and expectations, of course, are translating already into calculated high interest rates  If indeed     4/18/78             23  there is a slowdown in the last quarter of this year, or even early next year, many of our people will  have miscalculated that  We would have to associate ourselves on the side of [believing that] the  risk of the economy moving too fast is very real      Mr Chairman, philosophically I’d like to see us reduce [the range]  Maybe  your comment that it isn’t worth the effort at the moment [is right], so as an alternative I would  hope that our performance does indeed take us within the ranges and that we make an earnest effort  to accomplish that  [Unintelligible] suggestion that some of your early comments might include  with reference to the fact that we are going to make an added effort to keep within these ranges   With that I would be inclined to maintain them as they are      I share, Mr Chairman, the consensus that seems to be clear that the views  expressed be yours  It would avoid the potential at least of having a Babel in the house      As I expressed earlier, Mr Chairman, I feel strongly that the economy is  already rebounding  And with the Treasury likely to actually be paying off some debt, I believe the  time [to tighten] is here  I would support a gradual firming during this period rather than an abrupt  move later on  The numbers that seem to attract me are 4 to 8 for M1, 5-1/2 to 9-1/2 for M2, and  for the funds rate 6-1/2 to 7-1/2  And I’d move pretty promptly to the midpoint, with a monetary  aggregates directive    "
761,1978-05-16,KIMBREL,"  Mr Chairman, we too are becoming increasingly concerned about the burst  of activity  [We thought] first that maybe it was a rebound from the winter induced difficulties, but  that does not seem to continue now  We think it’s a matter of genuine concern  Housing for  instance, [we were] thinking the availability of mortgages and the cost of money would be limiting  that  It is not happening  Real estate fellows are telling us they have never known business to be  better  [There’s a] scarcity of sites in some areas and prices are just jumping  And we are less  optimistic over the total price [picture] than suggested here, partly because of the demands of labor,  number one  And frankly, the scarcity of skilled labor is becoming very marked in some areas   Farm prices we think are likely to add an extra kick or two  And almost every group of  businessmen we join now suggests that they are anticipating price increases and are adjusting-- marking [up] for that purpose      Incidentally, Mr Chairman, I’d mention the yacht [business]  One of our directors happens  to be a builder of luxury yachts and could not take another order for the rest of this year  The  customs people running the drug traffic insisted that he do two for them to be specially designed to  be a little bit faster than the [others]  That’s sort of the demand in that field      Mr Chairman, from our vantage point, I think we’d want to associate with  those who want to snug cautiously  Maybe we do not contribute to the inflationary restraint at the  moment but I think the market psychology can be very helpful and I am encouraged by the  responses we’ve been able to obtain in that area recently, sustaining efforts both in the equity and  the foreign exchange markets  Accordingly, I’d like to see us move cautiously with [a funds range  of] 7-1/4 to 8 percent maybe skewed to 7-1/2 but not be reluctant to move if the aggregates suggest  it  [The ranges I’d propose] there are 3 to 8 and 4 to 9    "
789,1978-06-20,KIMBREL,"  I think our view, [based on reports] from directors and visits with  businessmen, would very closely parallel Dave Eastburn’s, which is something odd to have  happen in our area  We would be slightly less optimistic than the Greenbook numbers  [There  are exceptions in] a couple of instances, particularly employment  I really think employment  may continue somewhat near the present level; you could say that in our area at least  Jobs are  still available  The soliciting [through] ads continues to be very, very strong  I think we are  beginning to see some surplus and some shortages in other areas  Price increases are  broadening; maybe this has been influenced largely by our agricultural relationship  But also we  are hearing more and more [about price increases] in building materials and some of those     6/20/78                18  [areas] mentioned by others Smaller labor groups are suggesting that they have to increase  prices now, possibly anticipating that they may have some restraints later on  Inflation  psychology, we gather, is spreading rather rapidly  Homebuyers do not seem to be deterred by  higher costs  We are learning that a much larger number of institutions are limiting the loans  they are making for homes, but the buyer himself does not at this moment seem to be very  restrained by the cost  We are also seeing office buildings that are being started with  considerably fewer tenant commitments than would have been true fairly recently      On the inventory build-up, just an aside  The chairman of one of our larger department store  chains suggested very confidentially that they felt they were over-extended and that this fall his  buyers would either be heroes or unemployed  He didn=t know which it might be  The availability  of trucks and rail cars are distorting a lot of our operations  Farm products can=t move because the  trucks and rail cars are simply not available; phosphates can=t be moved to the ports; oil from the  ports can=t be moved inland  This is distorting, and how long that will continue, we certainly don=t  know  Final demand may be slowing down, but we think the catastrophe [involves] inflation  pressures; price increases remain very, very strong   In trying to reduce these to numbers, I guess  maybe a deflator of 7-1/2 percent; on unemployment, though, I think we would stick pretty much to  6 or maybe 62 to 63      About 4 percent      Peter, did I understand you to suggest that the dealers would be upset with  an increase after today=s meeting?      Mr Chairman, admittedly interest rates have been moving up  I,  nevertheless, have failed to detect that it has deterred very much the hectic pace of bank lending  So     6/20/78                35  I think it=s appropriate in that context, plus our enormous concern for continued inflation, to continue  our move  I would like to see the funds range under alternative B, 7-1/2 to 8-1/4 and moving as  promptly as appropriate to 7-3/4 and to 8 if necessary without consultation  To maintain some  indication that we=re trying to work these ranges down, I=d like to see us at maybe 6 to 10 for both  M1 and M2    "
817,1978-07-18,KIMBREL,"  Quickly  Jim, I didn’t detect any comment on inventories  But in the  Greenbook you [have] pretty conservative [numbers] over this period  Do you feel comfortable  with the continuing situation we have with the inventory outlook?      Mr Chairman, I, too, think there’s a lot of strength left over this period  I  am somewhat pessimistic, though, about the collective bargaining calendar, the possibility of an oil  price boost, the impact of the minimum wage and social security increases, and the stagnation of  productivity  That brings me to feel that the GNP growth may be about 3-1/2  I have prices at  about 8 percent and unemployment probably at 6       7/18/78              15    Mr Chairman, I’ve heard the comments about the fact that we have not  been hitting the ranges and that we ought to adjust them, and I am completely unimpressed at the  moment  I think the timing could not be worse  It would tend to confuse the markets at a time     7/18/78              32  when they are already uncertain  It would contribute to our credibility [problem] even more  I  would strongly opt for maintaining the ranges exactly as they are, with a dedication on our part to  be more diligent in attaining those ranges      Mr Chairman, I would like very much to see us continue to lean against  the price trends  And I would like alternative C with the federal funds rate shown there, M1 at 4 to  8, M2 at 5 to 9, and an aggregates directive       7/18/78              42  "
841,1978-08-15,KIMBREL,"  Mr Chairman, we have observed pockets of weakness, but on balance  our people are still very optimistic  They’re concerned more than [anything else] I guess about  prices, for the reasons pointed out [by others]  Labor and energy--the availability and the cost--are  very [much in the forefront] in their considerations price wise  Also in the background is the  possibility of OPEC repricing or changing the manner in which it prices  Even in the food sector-- cattle prices [and] related [products]--they expect strength  And price supports seem to indicate  that food is going to be [unintelligible]  Even the lumber area continues to show the possibility of  increased prices       Well, that brings us to the numbers I guess if we were going to be specific, we'd say 3  percent or less on real GNP, unemployment at 62 percent or more, and at least 8 percent on the  deflator      Mr Chairman, I, too, would like to see something in the range of 4 to 8,  6 to 10, 7-3/4 to 8-1/4, moving promptly to 8, and an aggregates directive  For some time I've had  sympathy for a discount rate increase  [My view on that is] much stronger, realizing that with the  timing, though, maybe we wouldn’t be accomplishing with this a reduction in reserves, and I would  very much like to see something in that area      Mr Chairman, I, too, have not been particularly fond of swap lines all  along, so I have some difficulty generating any warmth for this one  I'd like to feel that maybe we  could move in this area and generate some favorable psychology, recognizing that stability would  be desirable now  But these numbers that are suggested to possibly accomplish it--very candidly  excite me  Then when I look back to my own area and recognize the emotions that have been  generated among the textile people and the automobile people and think about how unpopular this  could be--and frankly, bottom line, how costly it could be--I really am not excited  Frankly, I'm not  impressed with the forthcoming nature of the Japanese  I personally would like to see something  [from them] that was visible--was positive and known--before we move into this  I think the timing  could be most unfortunate  If I seem to suggest that I lack some enthusiasm, that's correct    "
868,1978-09-19,KIMBREL,"  Mr Chairman, we think that there's considerable [momentum] for   another 15 to 18 months  Against that, though, we are somewhat concerned that the growth may be  slower than the staff has projected and yet the inflation rate may be faster  We, too, may have a  biased look at the moment, prejudiced by housing because of the exciting developments in our own  area  Calling around to a number of housing and mortgage people in the last couple of weeks  indicates that [they are] just excited and think that the outlook is extraordinarily fine  Nevertheless,  in reading the Redbook I notice that is not shared around the country so I think we have to temper  that a little bit  Generally, we're not far from the feeling of the Greenbook      Mr Chairman, I associate myself with those who have suggested that  monetary policy may indeed have some influence at this juncture  And I liked Steve Axilrod's  comment that we could minimize any risk of undue increases in the aggregates  So for both  domestic and international reasons, I'd like to see us move the M1 range to 4 to 8 and M2 to 6 to  10, with a federal funds range of 8-1/4 to 8-3/4--the same numbers you used--and an aggregates  directive    "
893,1978-10-17,KIMBREL,"  Just simply a clarification  In the interest of getting a sentiment  Would  this be a reciprocal arrangement?  If they were initiating swap drawings, they would expect to pay  the Treasury bill [rate]?      Mr Kichline, [regarding] liquidity measures, at an investment seminar in  Atlanta this last week a vice president of Prudential was quoted as suggesting that Prudential was  committed through 1979 with no additional opportunity  That came as something of a surprise  Is  that reasonable or are we hearing any of these types of suggestions in other spots?      I don't know  He may have been talking about their decision to commit X  amount in private placements or something  I really was not there and did not hear [what was  said] It was just a quote that came up that suggested that they were--      It does  Yes, that is my point      Mr Chairman, we too are a little more pessimistic than the staff, with real  GNP at about 2-1/2, unemployment at about 6-1/2, and our price index at about 8-1/2      Well, Mr Chairman, maybe [my question should be] directed to you   With the several references to the Administration’s anti-inflation program, I wonder if there are any  significant items of intelligence that you would feel free to share with us        Mr Chairman, without repeating many of the other fine points made, I  think we would opt for alternative 2, a money market directive, the range for the federal funds rate,  though, of 8-3/4 to 9-1/4, and moving promptly to 9    "
920,1978-11-21,KIMBREL,"  Mr Chairman, we are not quite as optimistic about the price level as the  staff  Looking at some individual performances, I guess we pretty much are like the Southwest   People have been reading the professional economists and are fearful of recession  But if quizzed  about their individual business, they simply do not expect that business is going to be much  weaker There are few, rare exceptions--maybe textiles but that's a different [issue]  By and large,  interest rates are taking their toll but there's an awful lot of commitment, full speed ahead  We're  not expecting that there will be a recession and that it is inevitable in our area      Mr Chairman, I still think we'll have slow growth, obviously, but maybe  at 1-1/2 to 2 percent  Unemployment this time next year may be about 6-1/2 percent  On prices,  I’d say 7-1/2 to 8-1/2       11/21/78              16    Mr Chairman, I too am concerned about being discredited, but I think we  might be able to consult and have no real concern about that  I would like a money market  directive with essentially the numbers you have used  If I had any concern, it would be about a 9  percent ceiling on M2    "
946,1978-12-19,KIMBREL,"  Peter, have the losses been concentrated in a few dealers or are they  pretty generally scattered throughout?      I just have a question to Jim  Did I follow, Jim, that you were suggesting  that maybe because of the weather the housing growth has been borrowing from the future?  You  would [expect] some considerable weakening because of borrowing--      Mr Chairman, it’s our judgment that we would prefer to see some slight  additional firming  Loan demand continues strong, but we are not observing any real likelihood of  a crunch  It seems to me that funds would be available at a price  And indeed, we aren’t very  comfortable in feeling that the money growth moderation we have experienced recently will prove  very lasting  Productive capacity and help wanted ads lead us to believe very strongly in our area  that we’re very close to full employment     While we would not want to suggest that we feel a recession is inevitable or not inevitable,  we are alert to the fact that the consumer pull-back could be real and a continuing discussion of this  as an inevitable event will be [a self-fulfilling prophecy]  We are more impressed at the moment  by the fact that the nervous reaction and the lack of confidence in our foreign exchange markets  need some continued attention on our part  Likewise, the domestic financial markets I think are  more and more beginning to question our willingness to face the fundamentals of continuing  mounting inflation  So, with what would appear to be little assurance that prices and inflation  expectations are going to improve in the near term, I think we would like to see some additional  firming but of a very modest amount      Bob, you’ve lost that one, come on       Mr Chairman, many of the regional Banks have [unintelligible] but we,  too, heartily support this  I guess if there’s anything that hasn’t been said, it’s that we feel any  significant developments during that period would tend to balance out  Any one monthly variation  would not have the significant impact, so we do support [this]; some of our staff did some work  early this spring related to this, so we are supporting it     "
1002,1979-03-20,KIMBREL," M r   Chairman, I, too, share the feeling that  some business weakness, but not anything major, is likely early next  year I recognize that no two periods are exactly parallel, but  history suggests that some things we experienced in ‘73 and ‘74 are  coming back Certainly, we are seeing a lot of anxiety about the  prices of oil and food We‘re seeing capacity constraint difficulties  that have already been [mentioned] There is the feeling that  inventory building cannot be very far behind and some concern that the  labor growth we have seen may be related as much as anything else to  additional people entering the labor force [in an effort] to offset  [the effects of] inflation Indeed, [inflation] is the number one  concern that we continue to hear about and it’s taking its toll We  would be reluctant to put much emphasis at the moment on movements in  the aggregates because they are confusing, both to us and to the  market as a matter of fact It would appear that the markets are  expecting some slight firming I feel that our failure to do that  might very well raise some unnecessary and unneeded questions at the     3/20/79 -16-   moment It would seem that foreign exchange markets also would  probably welcome a touch of firmness Finally, while our projections  are pretty close to most of the Board staff's projections, I want to  make [clear my1 feeling that the staff probably has not projected a  rate of price increases as high as we think it will be; we expect that  to be more like 9 percent or probably above 9 percent   Mr Chairman, I think Governor Coldwell has  just spoken my piece I would favor exactly the numbers [he proposed1  of 4 to 8, 3 to 7, and 10 to 10-1/2 percent I would not like to see  the funds rate drop below 10 percent; I think that clearly would be  misunderstood In my view the danger is on the side of inflation  And with our visibility in the markets, both domestic and  international, any failure to recognize this danger of inflation could  indeed cause us problems I would like to see us with alternative B  and those numbers   I find it a little difficult too, Mr Chairman   The funds range is just entirely too narrow I  think the aggregates ranges are fine     3/20/19 -33 -   "
1026,1979-04-17,KIMBREL," Mr Chairman, [after] listening to our own  directors on Friday and [based on1 our own testing of the activity and  the sentiment in our District during recent days, we are more nearly  attuned to the [analysis] by the staff this morning than we've been in  some time We recognize the enormous uncertainties about prices, the  aggregates, and business growth, and I find it almost useless to  belabor this since we are very close to the staff's [projections] this  morning   Mr Chairman, I would much prefer at this  particular juncture to see [policy] cast in terms of a money market  directive I have trouble with these [Bluebook] ranges I personally  would not like to see them change, so I’d like roughly 2 to 6 percent  on M1 and 4 to 8 percent O h  M2 I would very much dislike having the  fed funds rate drop below 10 percent during this intermeeting period  At the same time, I‘m not very anxious to see it move up very much--  maybe a shade to 10-1/8 percent with a range of perhaps 10 to 10-1/2  I’m not a subscriber to such a narrow range, but in this environment  it may flow reasonably well So I‘d go with 10 to 10-l/2 percent with  probably 10-1/8 at the moment   Right   I like the 3 to 7 percent much better and,  obviously, 4 to 8-1/2 percent is fine, particularly if we’re going to  have a money market directive   Yes sir   No   Mr Chairman, maybe I'm [approaching] the  problem from a slightly different angle but I think it may be prudent  action to acquire some of these [currencies] My question, though, is  that I'm not sure I followed Alan when he was suggesting the  dimensions The numbers you suggested were $500 million and then $2  billion I'm not sure what you're thinking now   M R   HOLMES As you recall--1 think it was at the February  meeting--we had been running with an informal limit of $150 million  There was nothing formal about that [limit], but it was an informal  one that we had always respected at the Desk In February I noted  that we were making some progress in repaying [our swap debt] and I  suggested that the Committee might want to consider [acquiring] $500  million and the Committee [approved that] Now we're suggesting,  since we have made such tremendous progress repaying swap debt and  since there may be opportunities to acquire some more [foreign  currency balances] in the future--heaven knows if there really will  be--that $2 billion does not seem an inappropriate amount I would  note that at the peak of our swap borrowing we had risks on the other  side of several times that amount   Yes   MR MAYO Yes  "
1078,1979-05-22,KIMBREL," Mr Chairman, we have just concluded a series  of meetings with business leaders around the District and two  impressions continued to come through almost monotonously One was  the fear of continuing and even escalating inflation and the other was  concern about the supply of gasoline Coming from those meetings I  guess we have more reason to believe that we are now in or very near  some business slowdown I'm not saying that that's bad; it may be bad  or it may be timely Frankly, we have reason to hope it's true and  that the slowdown will be moderate and last for some modest period of  time Our projections are pretty close to those of the staff We  [agree with1 those generally   Moving [on to other1 concerns that we heard in these  discussions, many related particularly to the recreational field  Cruise ships are altering drastically their pattern of going to ports  where they cannot be refueled For the first time since it opened,  Opryland in Nashville, Tennessee had motel rooms available over the  weekend before last Travel in the area is limited over the weekends,  not because gasoline is unavailable but because people fear that it  may not be available The coal operators that we talked with  characterized [their business] as a disaster area Inventories are  tremendous; even at reduced [prices] there are no markets available  Some of the mines are simply discontinuing operations temporarily In  the natural gas area they are talking of abundant supplies and no  limit until maybe it all comes to a screeching halt in late '81 or  '82 Residential activity, particularly in South Florida, is of boom  proportions The activity there is just unbelievable, with much of it  coming from offshore Caribbean interests that are buying not one, but  four or five units at a time Some are occupying units and some are  not even bothering to occupy them There is no restraint for funds  that we detect from the banks; however, we are beginning to learn more  and more of some restraints at the thrift institutions In terms of  the major feeling that came through in our discussions with these  people, it was not one of recession but rather a modest [slowdown]   We are inclined to believe that the widening of the ranges  that Steve is suggesting is fine; we don't have any difficulty with  that But, frankly, we would be very anxious to maintain the present  posture with regard to the funds rate We rather like it where it is  and think it is taking its toll If we had any strong feeling, it  would definitely be against any downward drift [in rates] We think  that would be wrong and would be interpreted in the market as a  feeling that we are giving up to some extent on our tug against  inflation As for the discount rate, we would favor a slight increase  simply as an adjustment move   I like the idea of a money market directive  I, too, had in mind for M1 that maybe a range of 0 to 5 percent would  be fine And for M2 I had thought maybe 4 to 8 percent--   Yes   I could buy it, but I would prefer the 8-1/2  percent also   I really don't like it   [I would agree] with the memo   Yes  "
1096,1979-06-27,KIMBREL," Mr Chairman, I personally would subscribe to the idea of trying to  maintain our posture for a reasonable period and try to observe the effects as they develop I  would be reluctant to move too quickly at the moment I am very mindful though of the  troubling news in the consumer price information [released] yesterday and the weakness of the  dollar that you [mentioned] But like Paul Volcker, I think much of this is related to OPEC  pricing and the difficulties associated with that So I guess I’d prefer to wait a few days and  observe [developments] very carefully and hope that stability may come along  "
1123,1979-07-11,KIMBREL," Mr Chairman, several segments of the economy  in our District are reflecting unusual strength But I think the  composite would come out not significantly different from that  described in the other [Districts] and as envisioned by the staff If  anything, we are impressed by both bankers and businessmen in their  escalating frustration with the regulatory environment That seems to  be spilling over into consumer pessimism and if anything we read that  as somewhat more [prevalent] than the staff has reflected At the  same time we detect also a sense of considerably more willingness to  accept some restraint to try to deal with our inflation difficulties   Against that background, I would very much prefer, for both  international and domestic reasons, to attempt to accomplish some  stability And it's my feeling that the ranges suggested by Steve  Axilrod would involve maintaining something [close to] our present  posture and for that reason I would accept completely the numbers  proposed by him   Mr Chairman, just a point of clarification  there Paul Volcker's comments left an impression that we were not  going to be staying the same if we used the numbers that Steve Axilrod  had suggested During the break I spoke to Steve Axilrod and I really  would like to be reassured that indeed we are staying the same by  [using the numbers he suggested] So I guess I'm trying to reconcile  [the comments of] Volcker and Axilrod   The activity in the foreign exchange markets  continues to disturb me, Mr Chairman, but I believe the suggestion  that you made deals with that directly and forthrightly Meantime,  alternative 11 just as it is shown [in the Bluebook] is acceptable to  me   I have a slight preference for a money [market  directive]   I think not It might be difficult I‘d  rather have no change at the moment  "
1192,1979-08-14,KIMBREL," Mr Chairman, from my vantage point we are indeed beginning to recognize some slower growth That may be somewhat less evident in the Southeast than in other parts of the country, but with all of this we are also observing some [developments] that do not provide a great deal of encouragement, specifically in the area of consumer confidence area Perhaps much of this is generated by the energy concerns and the toll they're taking in every part of the economy and also the contribution they're making to inflation, and that in turn is extracting its pound of consumer confidence We have never seen the man on the street demonstrating the lack of confidence that he seems to be generating at the moment Add to this the recent strength in the aggregates and we've become quite concerned about our total credibility From the foreign exchange side, we seem to be getting unmistakable readings that what we do today and certainly over the next few days will be extraordinarily visible We will be watched from that vantage point and also [from the perspective of] new leadership on this Committee I think that makes our action today--and the direction of our action today--more than usually visible That also spills over into the domestic arena; we are going to be having more than usual concern I would venture that most of you have been called more frequently in the last ten days than you have before [by people] wondering what was going to happen here today and over the immediately succeeding days  I recognize the risks that are associated with almost any action we take, particularly if it's in the direction of some slight firming Even though the movement should be slight--even symbolic,  -28-    8/14/79  which is the term I believe you used, Mr Chairman--I think it would be desirable at this particular juncture Also I view the [appropriate] timing of the move with some additional pressure in monetary policy [as] now So if indeed in the not too far distant future we find it appropriate to take a turn toward ease, some strength will have accrued, some different posture would have identified itself with us so as to permit the easing that would be [needed] But as of this juncture, consumer confidence and attitudes, visibility, [and] both international and domestic [issues] lead me to want to add some degree of additional restraint today "
1223,1979-09-18,KIMBREL," Mr Chairman, from our vantage point we are  seeing some contrasting developments early on The farmers are very  excited; generally expectations are for one of the best farm years  ever Business people are still reading the papers and saying "" I  read  that but I don't feel it in my business"" Developments in residential  sales and construction in the area are harking back to the early '70s  It's incredible some of the stories we are hearing about sales and  possibilities in certain areas of the District We add to that, of  course, the visit of an unwanted gentleman hurricane in the Mobile  area and that confuses things The banks were not open yesterday, and  we are not sure that they are going to be open today And 10,000  people are still without power So, we don't know what the total  impact of that is going to be   Business loans in the District have not followed the national  pattern They are somewhat weak, but consumer attitudes are also  discouraged and uncertain Add to that [what we said in] our earlier  discussion of the growth in the aggregates and the apparent lack of  restraint on [such growth] in recent months [Nevertheless,] at the  directors meeting last Friday the feeling was I think unanimous that  there is not going to be a credit crunch but that inflation is going  to be about as strong [as it has been] for at least the rest of the  year Add to that the uncertainty of foreign exchange markets, and I  have to associate myself with the expectation that maybe [the  slowdown] has gotten somewhat deeper during the last month since I  have been involved with the Desk and I think there is really some  urgency that we ought to be directing more attention to restraining  money growth I don't detect in the markets any great concern that if  we do that, they are going to fall out So I would hope that we would  at least maintain our present posture with possibly some leaning  against any new growth--as much as anything else to try to preserve  our credibility I recognize that we have been hoping for slower  [monetary] growth for some months; but it hasn't come and I am not     9 /18 /79  -22-   persuaded that it's imminent I guess that pretty well suggests that  I would have no difficulty agreeing with our directors' recommendation  to increase the discount rate a full 1/2 percentage point   Please state them again, Mr Chairman   I'm very much in tune with that, Mr Chairman  That's almost my prescription  "
1262,1979-10-06,KIMBREL," I hate to keep asking, but is the funds range  11-112 to 15-1/2 percent, as Nancy suggested?  "
1306,1979-11-20,KIMBREL," Scott, you [requested Committee approval of a  renewal] in the event you do not have an opportunity to repay it Are  you optimistic on that?   I second   Peter, if those two [dealer firms] are  deleted, you’ll have a net number of trading firms then of--?   Ted, the dollar amount then in tbis last  quarter actually would average out to about what?   Mr Chairman, we too have considerable  appreciation for the staff projections but I guess we would assign a  higher priority for some [possibility] of a tax cut next year than the  Greenbook seems to suggest Also, the South and the Sun Belt are  frequently characterized as areas that will not suffer [in a  recession] to the same degree as the rest of the country But I  happen to have a slightly different view I think anything occurring  in the rest of the country is going to happen there And the same  [logic] flows to the fact that real price movements and inflationary  expectations are so deeply entrenched at the moment that I think we  simply must do something to try to dislodge that Added to that is  the significant concern and influence of the foreign exchange markets;  the unsettled [conditions1 there at the moment are an added dimension  that I think requires [concern] on our part We recognize, too, that  there's almost a belief that we will relax [our policy] too early  And that leads me to feel that the realities of our existence suggest  that a continuation of our present policy may be easier now than  possibly in 1980 when unemployment or other outside pressures are  being brought to bear, even if inflation continues unacceptably high   So reading these numbers slightly differently from some of  the others, 1 feel that alternative C is pretty close to where we are  at the moment I'd be happy to see that continue, even the 11-1/2 to  15-1/2 percent [federal funds range] And I'd prefer to see the  borrowings more in the $18 billion [areal where I believe they are at  the moment So I prefer ""C"" with those [specifications] I'd add  "
1337,1980-01-08,KIMBREL," This may be just a preference, but what were the main reasons you were reluctant to include overnight RPs and Eurodollars in the M1 measure?  Mr Chairman, I guess for different reasons I would opt for not going to longer projections Frankly, there are so many uncertainties that there are enough difficulties with 1980 And even there, I would hope that we could relate our longer-run look at 1980 to the actual targets that were in place for 1979 and not our results or our experience for 1979 I would not be too much for changing these during the year, even with the chances of recession or OPEC influences I think [any] changes we are going to make [in the ranges] are going to have a rather minimum influence, and I'd be inclined to stick to our longer-run targets In doing that I have a preference for looking at those associated with alternative 2 Contrary to what some of the others have suggested, I'd be inclined to narrow the target ranges, maybe still with 4-1/2 to 5 percent as the midpoint, but certainly not wider than 4 to 6 percent if M-1B is what we are going to be talking about  Mr Chairman, I continue to be concerned about the expectations and realities of our price level and about the possibility of the influence we can have on our exchange rate frailties at the moment I'd be very anxious to reaffirm our posture, a posture that would indicate a continuing steady move to a general reduction of the growth rate [of money] I recognize that this might very well contribute to interest rate changes, but [with] some more flexibility But in the real world we simply have to be a little attentive to the level of [unintelligible] I think we cannot move quite that abruptly All of that leads me to feel that I'd be rather comfortable with the numbers associated with alternative C "
1364,1980-02-04,KIMBREL," I have a personal bias toward contemporaneous reserves And if we were operating so that we could accomplish it, I would certainly opt for that But I suppose our real thrust [should be] Desk efficiency in discharging our directives, and those at the Desk don't seem to be too enthusiastic about contemporaneous reserves I accept that against the environment of the costs of programming such a change at the Reserve Banks and commercial banks And, Mr Chairman, right at the moment any change in our relationships with our member banks, even this, is not exactly very well timed  Mr Chairman, our views are not significantly different from those enunciated by the staff To put numbers to them For real GNP, we're looking at a minus 2 percent; for the unemployment rate, we're in the neighborhood of 8 percent; and for the CPI, 11 percent We do feel, though, that the fiscal [package] may be considerably easier than the staff is now reflecting We certainly would not support a tax cut unless it were directed toward capital investment We wonder if defense spending may not be somewhat larger, particularly in the private sector anticipating [orders] Finally, Mr Chairman, we are growing somewhat concerned--and our concern was not lessened any by Mr Sternlight's comments yesterday afternoon-- that the market increasingly is believing that we are not slowing money growth to the extent it expected from our October decision [Given] that and our track record in this upcoming period of the year when with tax refunds we've been somewhat less than successful in anticipating what money growth would be--if indeed we miss that as  -36-    2/4-5/80  much this year and we do have excessive money growth--I have to believe that inflationary expectations are going to be escalating again and may contribute more trouble than we need So, I hope that we will be demonstrating pretty forcefully that we expect to restrain [money] growth  Fourth quarter-to-fourth quarter  I guess 9 or 9-1/2 percent  Mr Chairman, one specific thing I would like to see is that the 1980 targets be related to the 1979 targets and not the 1979 results We are all [talking about] the uncertainties Of course, there does not seem to be much uncertainty about [the risks of a] recession and all of us are accepting that there are going to be inflationary tendencies and expectations And I feel that our actions should attempt not to provide any unnecessary opportunities for strong money growth I would hope that we indeed will begin to lower these monetary goals gradually For that reason I also accept the thesis of  -51-    2/4-5/80  narrower ranges, not more than 2 percentage points, and frankly with a strong determination to achieve them and control [money growth] So I would [narrow] the alternative III ranges and I end up with 3-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent on M-1A, 4 to 6 percent on M-1B, and 6 to 8 percent for M2  Associate me with that, too  Just to be sure I am with you, read those numbers one more time  -71-    2/4-5/80 "
