  Some time ago I spent many hours in the library at Columbia going  through in detail the Memorandum of Discussion, but on prior [unintelligible] to this Committee   And contrary to my expectations, they were very happy hours, because I found the memorandum  rich in detail and insight into the workings of monetary policy in the Federal Open Market  Committee  Recognizing that I’m just a guest here today, I have just a note on that basis--some  sadness in seeing these particular documents--      Thank you, Mr Chairman  My original predilection was to be very quiet  today and listen and be instructed by the members of this Committee  But as I have listened to  the discussion, it appears to me that the issues are sufficiently important that the District should  at least be represented in deliberation     One of the happy things that has happened to me upon my appointment is that I have been  called by more than the usual number of businessmen and others to give me their greetings and  well wishes  And that has afforded an opportunity to hear from what for me would be an  unusually large sample of businessmen from around the country, and it has been interesting to  me as they have discussed the rebate, their expectations of what the energy package would     4/19/77 - 33 -           consist of, their expectations as to what the President might do in terms of inflation, and so on   And for better or for worse, the message that a large number of them have had is that, while they  expect the energy program to be troublesome and somewhat disruptive and certainly to have a  positive impact on price increases, and while they expect the President to try to do something  with inflation, they are not sure how successful he will be with that  They are greatly relieved by  the withdrawal of the rebate  And putting all those things together, they seem to give more  weight as reflected in increases in spending plans and so on, than they had in earlier weeks and  months     All of which is just a way of saying that if there seem to be risks in the current forecast,  they would all seem to be on the side of greater inflation rather than less  And if that’s the risk  that we focus on most intently when we think about what to do with these ranges, I think our  District would very much support the notion of doing something     I would take the arguments that Governor Partee made, and I guess I’d just almost reverse  them in a sense that, given the expectation for additional inflation, at least the possibility of that,  that would weigh in my mind to argue almost the opposite of what he did  I would be happy to  go beyond those suggestions that you made, but fortunately I understand these discussions come  up every three months, so that there is another opportunity relatively soon to reassess that when  more information is in  So we would certainly go along with the suggestion you made,  emphasizing that it is in large part more a signal that the System intends to continue to pursue the  objective of bringing inflation in line  I think the comments that have been made that our actual  performance over the months ahead will have more real impact on what happens [unintelligible],  that’s except for the psychological one, which I think is of real import     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I hate to admit it, but I find I’m getting  confused with this discussion and having a little difficulty understanding--     I hope that, when I go back to the clean air of Minneapolis, I can figure out  what happened     Lest that be the lasting impression, let me say that I find that I’m delighted  to see that my former colleagues in Philadelphia and my former neighbors in New York seem to  agree on the same prescription, and still being favorably under their shadow, I’d like to align  myself with their comment      Thank you, Mr Chairman  Just one question  When our staff worked  through the numbers for this month, they came out in general very close to where you came out   They did place less confidence in consumer spending and more confidence in business fixed  investment  I just wondered, suppose that consumer spending was not as strong as you are  assuming; would that really do much to your feel for the vigor of the expansion?      Thank you, Mr Chairman  Last month--which, of course, was my first  meeting--the Committee was very cautious in approaching policy  And I suspect that was, as  you indicated, very prudent in light of the uncertainties that the Committee faced  But I, for one  at least, feel much less cautious today than I was inclined to feel last month  Most of the  uncertainty relating to the energy program seems to be uncertainty as to what would get passed  rather than how much of an impact it would really have on business spending  None of the  businessmen in our District really are changing their plans or have any inclination to change their  plans  The underlying economy is strong and seems to be getting stronger each time we look at  the numbers, which raises again the threat of increased inflation  The international situation  would seem to call for a very careful management of the expansion in the economy  And I was  interested in Paul Volcker’s comment about how do you change people’s willingness to grant  large wage increases, and there has been a feeling that there’s nothing you can do about that     But I guess I’m not persuaded  In Philadelphia, they’ve just had a very serious transit  strike  A statement made by city government at one point was, we’re just not going to give you  any more money  They went out on strike for a long time and finally settled for no more money   And then the next group that came in to settle after that, settled at precisely the same rate       I think that’s exactly right  And that’s my point  I think if businessmen  think that every time there is a little adversity, whether it’s an increase in the Social Security tax  or something else, and we are going to bail them out with monetary policy, they’ve got no     5/17/77 - 25 -           inclination to stand up  But I get the impression from many that I’ve talked with that they think  we are serious about combating inflation, and they think that’s very good  They’re looking for  that kind of support and strength in the actions that they are taking     Well, given that, I would have a preference for taking a fairly significant step toward  moderation in the rates of growth in the aggregates  And even though I’m currently trying to  negotiate for a mortgage, and this is probably not in my self-interest, I would not be at all averse  to seeing interest rates increase  I think the numbers that you have come up with in terms of the  aggregates are certainly fine  It would not disturb me if we had negative growth in M1  I guess  the only concern I would have is whether--well, I don’t really understand, I guess, the way the  Desk works  The range 5-1/4 to 5-3/4, I wouldn’t be at all concerned to see it go up to 5-3/4, but  I get the impression that you only use the upper portion of that range if the aggregates are  growing more rapidly than these numbers would suggest and so on     I see, okay     All right, that’s a little different than my understanding, and that helps  I  guess, if anything, I’d be inclined to go 5-1/4 to 6 just so the Desk did feel willing to move fairly  aggressively on [the] interest rate  The only other comment I would make is that, in addition to  these steps in terms of open market policy, I would think that, fairly quickly, we might want to  consider an increase in the discount rate, and I know our own board of directors is becoming  increasing inclined to move in that direction      I have just one question, Mr Chairman, following along essentially the  same line that Governor Coldwell was on earlier  I assume, given the robustness of the  economy, that if your forecast for M1 turns out to be in error, and you are surprised by the  number that you see, [would you] expect to be surprised with higher, stronger numbers?     Thank you, Mr Chairman  We’ve talked a lot today about uncertainty,  about businessmen’s feelings, and so on  It seems to me that one element of consistency  between what businessmen tell us and what we’ve heard around the table today is an increasing     6/21/77 - 33 -         concern for inflation  And I guess, in the comments that you made earlier about the salutary  effect that monetary policy has had on businessmen’s expectations--I find that very compelling,  and I would take that same argument, that same logic, and apply that in a context today of  suggesting that we ought to continue to give fairly overt signals that we are sensitive to that  concern and we are going to continue to press gradually and modestly in that direction, even at  the risk of some increase in short-term rates  That has the added advantage--if the Bluebook is  correct, and I find the argument fairly sound--that an increase in rates now would imply a  smaller increase in short-term rates 9 to 12 months down the road, and that would have some  obvious advantages as well  So I would prefer to see the Committee move in the direction of  alternative C     Change of focus for just a moment  As I understand, we’ve changed our  practice so that we are accommodating these RPs currently      We are offset through the open market   SPEAKER(?)  If we were to continue to do that, is there a compelling need to go to the  IRS for the ruling itself, or can we just let it ride and continue to accommodate these types of  transactions?      Thank you, Mr Chairman  In part of my attempts to educate myself on  what the Committee has been doing, I took a look at the economic outlook that the Committee     7/19/77 - 40 -    appeared to agree to in January of this year and then the policy that was decided at that time--the  base that was associated with that  And then I compared that with the economic outlook for four  quarters hence, and then again with the base that was associated with that  And it would seem  that, if the Committee were to, in effect, stay even and not account for the base drift, it then in  effect would be saying that it wants more real growth in GNP and a lower unemployment rate  and is willing to pay a price of higher inflation to get that than was the case in January  That’s a  very awkward way of saying [it], I’m afraid  It seems that it will be perfectly consistent with  what the Committee did last January, in the face of deteriorating inflation and somewhat stronger  economic growth than the Committee foresaw at that time, to simply move down to the 4 to 6  and 6 to 9 that the majority seems to have recommended at this time  And that’s certainly where  I would come out      Thank you, Mr Chairman, just one quick question and then two  comments  Are you going to circulate that little analysis that was done on the seasonal  adjustment of the unemployment rate?     I would like to see it  I don’t know if anyone else would  The two brief  comments I would make are, first of all, the discussion relating to using property values as a  form of liquidity  One area that I think has been misunderstood rather broadly is the area of  using farm land as a source of liquidity  In our part of the country, we get in the press almost  every other day a story of how awful it is that farm lending is going up so rapidly  And the fact  of the matter is that they really are just taking what has become the greatest increase in their net  worth--the value of their land--and converting that into tractors and new homes and swimming  pools and other sorts of things     And the debt-equity ratio for the farm sector as a whole has not changed one bit in spite of  the tremendous increase in farm lending--the total value of farm land has gone up so much that  the ratio has not changed  In fact it got to the point where, in Minnesota, they were going to  have a little demonstration in favor of higher price supports, and so they went to the state capital  and drove around the capitol in their tractors  And they were then going to drive to Washington,  but they decided that their point might lose its value if they had a great big long string of brand  new $50,000 tractors driving around the Capitol in Washington  And I think they are right   They have held up remarkably well in what’s considered to be a disaster     With regard to capital spending, one of our industrial directors made the comment that if  he didn’t listen to anybody else he would be very optimistic about what’s going on  And so to  follow that up, we had the leaders of all of the large corporations in the Twin Cities area in for  lunch one day, [firms] like 3-M and Honeywell and Control Data and Toro and so on  And this  story was very interesting; they universally spent the first half of the lunch complaining about all  of the uncertainties--energy and taxes and everything else that they could think of that was  wrong  And I was about ready to conclude that they weren’t spending any money on anything,  so I just asked them what their capital plans were, and the lowest increase in the group was 75  percent  Most of them hovered around a 100 percent increase in capital spending for the year  ahead     9/20/77 - 17 -     A 100 percent increase from the year passed  Now interestingly enough,  they all admitted that they were not building new physical facilities [and] that the kind of  investment they were engaging in [was] new equipment, new ways of making their physical  plant more productive  But they are looking at very large numbers  No, we don’t have the steel  and so on in Minneapolis  But we have a rather broad cross section of the rest of [industry], and  I think if anything we may be pleasantly surprised by the amount of capital spending that we  [will] see over the next year or 18 months     We are trying       It doesn’t take long     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Just one quick comment  Almost everybody  seems to agree that we need to continue to move  There may be some differences in timing, and  in that regard I’d like to echo the comment that Dave Eastburn made, and that is, I am fairly  persuaded by the staff report that says, in effect, if you move interest rates a little sooner, you  can get by with a smaller overall increase in the rates over the course of the next year  So I  would join those who have indicated that they prefer to see a relatively small but prompt move in  the funds rate  And, of course, if the aggregates continue to go [unintelligible] the range that you  mentioned, that they would move even further      Mr Chairman, we agree with the optimism of the Board staff, even though  it is somewhat more optimistic than many others that we read  And even though we had the  snow in October, in fact we’re slightly more optimistic than the Board’s staff  We think that  there’s a little tendency on the part of many observers, as they see a particular economic statistic  come out, to read more into that than perhaps is warranted       Well, we find, for example, that in each of the areas that we have been  talking about so far today, consumer spending, housing starts, and so on--while a particular  number may be low for a month or two, the feedback we keep hearing from our retailers, from  our businessmen who are making their plans for capital spending, and so on--very much like  Willis Winn reported--we just see things continually coming on line out there that almost seem  to belie the general pessimistic statements that we seem to hear from professional forecasters       No, we’re getting this feedback from around the country  And precisely  because of our geographic peculiarities, we have asked our own staff as well as our directors to  reach out elsewhere to make sure we weren’t being overly influenced by the things in our  District  I do have one question that we find a little difficult to deal with  And I don’t know  whether you or the staff would care to comment  We would like to know what the best guesses  are as to whether there will be additional protectionist measures over the next 12 to 18 months  and how significant they will be, because that will have a rather significant impact both on  output and prices     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I find your arguments for both cases very  persuasive; wish I’d made them myself  You indicated that on M1 you had an open mind, and to  the extent I can, I’d like to nudge you in the direction of the 6 rather than the 6-1/2  I found the  argument that you gave for that particular alternative very compelling  The question has been  raised about credibility  I guess I just assume, if we drop it down to 6, we’re going to do, to the  extent we can, what we need to do to get money down so that we will have credibility  So I  don’t give that argument as much weight as perhaps some of my colleagues     I am disturbed by the comment that Ernie made at the end of his remarks  And that is that,  over the last three quarters, with the growth in the aggregates, the base [for M1]has moved [up]  about 1-1/4 percentage points  And if we don’t continue to move down the range for M1 as well  as the others, by not doing that, in fact, policy will be moving in a more accommodating  direction than I think this Committee has wanted  Now I know that’s a difficult point to make  and have understood by the public, but nevertheless, I would feel more comfortable, if in     10/17-18/77 - 46 -         addition to moving the upper ranges for M2 and M3 down, if we also made that modest move  that you suggested on M1      Mr Chairman, when this whole business started I was a very strong  supporter of the System point of view  But experiences of the last couple of years, especially as  I see what uncertainty does to the way people make decisions, kind of makes me wonder if  there’s anybody besides me who would like to reconsider our basic position  It’s not as clear to  me as it once was that things might not be, in fact, better if we stated fairly clearly and fairly  explicitly what we were trying to accomplish rather than having, as we now do, a lot of people  trying to guess--and sometimes they guess right and sometimes they guess wrong, and we get a  fair amount of churning and other things in that process  So I just wonder if I’m way out in left  field, or whether there’s anyone who would like to examine the basic--     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I appreciated Chuck’s comments on the  longer-term outlook  I guess it seems clearer and clearer to me that what actually happens  depends more and more on what we and other branches of government do between now and  then  I have two interesting comments that were made to me that I think are indicative of that   One is, [an executive of] a firm in our District that is an international supplier of capital goods  equipment made a comment the other day that I found a little surprising  He said, if in fact there  is a clarification of national economic policy, and some of the uncertainties are reduced, our  biggest question is how would we [deal] with the onslaught of orders that our potential  customers are talking to us about  His impression was that flood gates were just kind of there,  and if anything triggered that, business would be a lot stronger than we are apparently expecting     On the other side of that, one of his colleagues, also [at] an international supplier of capital  goods equipment, said, if you guys don’t get those money supply numbers down so that the  outlook for inflation looks better, we are going to take what is now a 100 percent increase in our  capital budget and reduce it by 50 percent  So, what we do and what other parts of government  do in this particular environment is going to have an awful lot to say about what the second half  of next year in fact really looks like, and maybe even sooner than that     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be very brief  We have a little bit of a  credibility problem in our District--I’m speaking now just for our District  When we publicly  announced growth ranges that they have indicated to me they wanted to take seriously, they keep  questioning why we can’t [hit] them   SPEAKER(?)  “They” refers to whom?     11/15/77 - 39 -           Businessmen  And I give the usual responses as to what happens and so  on  What that suggests to me is that, while I would love to kind of relax and enjoy what’s going  on, I’d feel better if we took advantage of the opportunity to do whatever we can to get the  numbers down to a more reasonable level  So I would have a strong preference for your 1 to 6,  or even for the radical suggestion of Bob Black of 0 to 5  And my guess is, that could be  accommodated within the federal funds range that was listed under alternative B      Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be very brief because I’ve heard most of  the things I was going to say  I’d like to fall in line with Governor Wallich and those who  expressed the concerns that they have and will just make two brief additional comments  [A  point was] made in the discussion--if we follow this procedure, interest rates will move if we  intend them to move, otherwise we will avoid unintended sharp movements in interest rates  I  have a little difficulty with that because I’m not sure we always know what rates we really intend  to have  We may think we do in the short run, but as we gather more information, often we’ll  come back and wish that something else had taken place  So that distinction is not as clear in my  mind as it may be to some others     Second, I would simply point out that while there are announcement effects and market  reactions to changes in interest rates, there can also be--and in fact, I think in recent history, have  been--more frequent announcement effects and market reactions to changes in the aggregates   And so it’s again not quite as clear to me that this is as conservative an approach as it may  appear to be  This is [in keeping with] what we are doing  It’s in that sense that I accept that   But it’s not clear to me that we might not, by following this procedure, generate some market  and other kinds of reactions that could, in fact, be quite sharp because there are now a large  number of participants who do look at the aggregates and respond accordingly  So I think Phil’s  comment on what to do [with] the range in the aggregates is a very real one that we may have to  confront perhaps sooner than we’d like to      I don’t know how to ask this question without sounding incredibly naive,  but I’ll ask it anyway  I haven’t had the impression as we’ve talked about policy in the six  months that I’ve been here that usually, when we get to that stage, we talk very much about the  international implications of policy  And yet what I’ve heard so far this morning would suggest  that at least other countries think we ought to be doing things in terms of monetary policy that  would have an effect in terms of the exchange rate  I guess my question is, what role does it  play?  How does it fit into our thinking, these kinds of international questions, when we talk  about domestic policy operations?     Hopefully you won’t limit those comments to Texas     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I would just like to pick up on the comment  that Dave Lilly made with regard to expansion in capacity  As you know, I have been reporting  that the businessmen in our District have had very aggressive expansion plans  At the same  time, they have done exactly what you suggested, David, and had significant increases in  capacity by making do with their own plants Their interpretation of that, though, at least as they  played it back to me, is that they have done that because they have been uncertain about the  payoff of more permanent increases in capacity, primarily because of energy and taxes, and most  importantly, in their case, inflation  And if they could resolve in their own minds any of those  things, then their feeling is that the more long-life kinds of expansion to capacity would come on  stream relatively quickly and in rather large amounts     Now, following that up, we have been more optimistic than the staff over the last six  months  More optimistic than most people around the table  As I hear the discussion today,  people seem to be moving a little bit in our direction, and as much as I hate to admit it, we are  moving--not for the short term but for the longer term--back the other way  That is to say, we  are less optimistic about the latter half of next year than we have been, but I think for a very  important reason, and that’s the one identified by Governor Coldwell  The businessmen in our  area are becoming increasingly concerned about the prospects of inflation for next year  And  that is causing them to re-assess what, up to this time, have been very ambitious capital spending  plans     I don’t know whether this is typical elsewhere in the country  And it’s not to the point yet  where they are changing anything  But what they are telling me is they are re-looking at some of  those things, and if those current concerns continue, then it seems to me that we could start to  have, at least in our area, some reductions in plans that I personally think could be quite  unfortunate and quite significant     We haven’t had any of those this year of any significance; I don’t have any  information on that      Thank you  I have one question and then a comment  I don’t have a chart on   prices in [my set of charts]  Is mine just short or is there none?      Well, I was, and I guess it is very similar in part to what you just said  The   [issues] of prices and profits are very closely related in my mind at the moment  Since we don’t  have a chart on prices, let me look at the chart on the growth rate for real GNP  Governor Coldwell  made, I thought, a fairly cogent argument that inflation may be stronger in the second half of next  year than the staff is projecting  We have been quite optimistic about business plant and equipment  spending for the last nine months, reflecting in large part the area of the country that we come from     1/17/78             19  where they have been very bullish  We have had real [cause] for the concern in the last two months  now and that latest survey didn’t help us at all  It was lower than we were expecting       Plant and equipment spending      I had a group from the ten largest corporations in our area in for lunch   yesterday and they expressed more caution than they have over the last nine months  It may be that  we just have a very funny view of the world, and I wouldn’t rule that out at all, but if you look at  the chart for growth in real GNP it shows what I would regard as a very strong impact on real  economic performance associated with the tax cut  It seems to me that there is at least a possibility  that it would not have that effect--that in fact it could be neutral or even negative in terms of  business spending   [That assessment stems] from the following point of view  The businessmen  that are talking to me are very concerned about inflation and are becoming increasingly concerned  about inflation  The statements they are making to me suggest that if they get any more reason than  they already have to be even more concerned, rather than spending more they are going to spend  less  Depending on how they view a tax cut, particularly if it’s not skewed in their favor but is  skewed in the direction away from business, you could well see real business spending that is either  the same or even less in the face of a tax cut than without it  So, while we have been very  optimistic, and we are trying to hang onto that as long as we can, there is a bigger question mark in  our mind with regard to the second half of next year than there had been up until now because of  the way expectations of inflation seem to be influencing business thinking in our area       Thank you Mr Chairman  I guess I remain convinced that the best way we   have of unraveling the very strong expansion that we have is to fail to deal as aggressively as we  can with inflation  Everything inside me says now is a great time to pause  But I am persuaded by  Mr Roos’s comment that we are not likely to have a better time than right now, given both the  international situation and people’s perceptions of the unemployment rate and so on  I think if  nothing else it would be desirable to limit it and reduce the upper range for M1 so that we would  have a little better chance to in fact get within the long-run targets where we want to be  The 2 to 7  percent I think goes in that direction  On the federal funds rate, the argument on the bottom I think  is correct  The way I’d prefer to see the Committee deal with that would be to [adopt] 6-3/4 to  7-1/4 percent        I was going to change the subject      The second question  Is the probability that the government will take the   kind of fundamental steps that you talked about going up, going down, or staying where it was?       Thank you, Mr Chairman  It=s interesting to me in the meeting today to hear   a number of people express feelings about inflation in stronger terms than I think they have in some  recent meetings  That has been typical of my experience with people outside of this Committee   [Inflation] does seem to be a concern that more of our people have, and for that reason the major  difference we have with the staff forecast is on their expectation of inflation  They might be right;  we hope they are right  [But] inflation could well be higher than they have projected and I guess  the point I want to emphasize is the one that Dave first made--that it=s perfectly consistent to be  increasingly pessimistic about inflation and, at the same time, to be increasingly pessimistic about  the real economy  [That’s] because, given the state of expectations people have, based on what has  gone before, additional inflation does create additional uncertainty, both from the point of view of  what that means for the kinds of positive calculations [they] have made and for what that implies in  terms of what they think government policy might be  All of those things added together raise real  questions as to how viable plant and equipment spending projects might be, whether it really pays  to invest in a new automobile and all kinds of things  So it=s perfectly consistent to become  increasingly pessimistic on inflation and on the real [economy] at the same time  The policy  dilemma, of course, is that you may then reach the opposite conclusion in the current environment  [than] you have in previous years in trying to respond to that  But that=s a discussion for the next  part [of our meeting]       Thank you, Mr Chairman  I won=t make any comments on the numbers  I=d   just like to indicate that there seem to be two points of view expressed  One is that we don=t need  to do anything about M1 because it=s nowhere near where we are anyway, so it=s kind of irrelevant   The other point of view is, I think, the one you expressed initially--that we ought to leave it so that  we can close the gap between where we are and where we say we=d like to be so that we increase  [our] credibility  And I=d just like to align myself very strongly with the notion that we ought to  take these long-run targets very seriously  We ought to make sure that in the short run we do what  we can to get [monetary growth] in line with these targets and it=s on the basis of that assumption  that I think your proposal is the right way to go at this meeting       Mr Chairman, I=m prepared to go along with alternative B, but I would just   like to make a procedural comment or a theoretical comment or whatever kind of comment  While  I understand the arguments for staying where we are, I have difficulty in my own mind knowing  what it means to stay where we are  Chuck mentioned the possibility that we could get a very low  March and I think that is a possibility  My understanding is that it is precisely in those periods of  uncertainty of the kind that we are now moving into--and I=m talking about uncertainty in terms of       2/28/78           49  the real economy, not money [growth] and that sort of thing--that we ought to pay more attention to  the aggregates rather than less, because should we have made a mistake in our perception of how  strong the real economy is, for example, the best hedge against that would be to keep the money  supply from going very low for several  months in a row  And, of course, conversely on the upper  side  I=m not prepared to debate this today because it=s not the time, but I think one of the real  issues we have as we go down the road is what kind of uncertainty we have regarding the real   economy and where that pushes us in terms of how we define staying where we are  If we think  about that, we may well find that we want to flip on their heads the kind of rationales that we=ve  used today and go in exactly the opposite direction        Thank you, Mr Chairman  With the information I personally have, frankly   I’d be inclined not to do anything  I’m concerned about the expressions that have been made about  the package that seems to be evolving--that in terms of fundamental solutions of the problems it is a     3/10/78              10  little weak  I haven’t heard any discussion yet of what I consider to be the most serious  fundamental problem and that is the question of inflation  So just sitting out here in a snow storm,  if I had my druthers, I’d just as soon not do anything  On the other hand, I am willing to  acknowledge that those of you who are more intimately involved can see lots of things that I can’t  see and have a much better sense of the possibility of dealing with some of these fundamentals  depending on how cooperative we are on this sort of a package  So, on that basis, I’d be willing to  go ahead and do it  But I must confess that I do so very, very reluctantly        Thank you, Mr Chairman  I was impressed with Jim’s comment that on   the price side the risk would seem to be on the upside rather than the downside in the absence of  some effective Administration anti-inflation policy  I’d like to ask you or him or anybody what the     3/21/78              32  chances are that we will have an effective Administration inflation policy and if we do, what that is  likely to consist of       May I just pursue that a little bit further?  The businessmen that I have   spoken with have read reports of most of these things that you’ve [mentioned] and greet them with  a very high degree of skepticism  Even if the Administration tried to do them, the businessmen I  speak with are very skeptical that [these programs] would have any salutary effect at all on what is  happening with regard to prices  Do you share that skepticism or are you more optimistic that they  might in fact work?       He asked my question     3/21/78              43      Personally I think it would be very desirable to have you use ranges of an   expression of opinion on the part of the Committee because whether we like it or not various  people look at what we do  They try to evaluate how well we do it and in the long run I think that’s  a good thing in terms of how we perform our job  That’s information we use in making our  policies and, therefore, it ought to be information which ultimately the public has access to in order  to see why and what we did        Just to respond to that point because I think that’s one of the key points to   the argument on the other side, which is that we ought to be making policy looking ahead as to  what’s going to happen six to nine months down the road  What happens now is that it all seems  patently inconsistent to the public because we appear to be tightening when there’s no reason and  we appear to be easing when there’s no reason  I think it would be a great advantage, in terms of  our ability to do our work, to have those kinds of statements out in the public domain       Thank you, Mr Chairman  I came to this meeting prepared to be an outlier,   and I find that I am very comfortably in tune with a large number of my colleagues      I would make just one comment  I agree with everything that has been   said I think Governor Wallich gave my speech much better than I was prepared to give it  And I  find great comfort in the fact that Chuck just gave almost the same speech  And that’s a rather  unusual occurrence       I think 8 is the top number that I’d like to see on M1  I’m really not too   concerned what we make the bottom; 4 is fine with me  Frankly, I really don’t care much about  M2 because I’m not sure in the current environment that it means very much--or at least I don’t  understand what it means  I would have a preference for 6-3/4 to 7-1/4 on the funds rate with the  same provision that Governor Wallich mentioned      The only additional comment I would make is that we have all expressed the hope that by   taking this kind of action we can deal with the inflation problem--which we all seem to understand  as the number one problem--and somehow simultaneously not aggravate the unemployment  problem  My guess is that by taking this action today we may well be, if we persist, increasing the  risk that unemployment will be as Chuck has suggested  I for one am willing to take that risk, but I  think we should do that knowing that that’s the course that we’re embarked upon       I agree with you       Thank you, Mr Chairman  I feel very comfortable with the staff forecast  The numbers are almost identical to the ones we have been using  To the extent that it is wrong--  and we are wrong on the price side--I’d like to comment on a couple of things that I think are  relevant  There is a growing acceptance of the notion that expectations of businessmen and  consumers have a certain degree of self-fulfilling activity in them  People sign contracts and  conduct behavior that in effect helps validate their expectations  In that regard, we had a group of  former directors from throughout the District in our Bank last week, representing a large cross  spectrum of activities in our District and I took a little poll as to what their expectations were for  inflation  It was interesting to me that I found nobody below 7 percent  The vast majority thought  that for l978 inflation would be above 7 percent and half of them were expecting double digit  numbers in l979  And I thought I had a grim outlook!  It was nothing compared to what they were  [expecting]  Now, it doesn’t make a whole lot of difference whether their expectations are soundly  based or not, in the sense that if that is their expectation and they operate on that expectation, it has  very serious implications both for inflation and, of course, for the kind of recession that would put  in place      The second reaction that we got from that group and from our own board was that in terms of  labor negotiations going on in our District, people are not distinguishing between the coal  settlement as being in one world and the other settlements being in a different world  The unions  that are coming forward are saying that they got that kind of [wage package] in coal and we expect  that kind of thing in our industry  At least in the preliminary posturing they are taking a very, very  hard stand      A third point is that the reaction in our District to the President’s anti-inflation speech was  really quite negative  The general response on the part of the business community and the financial  community was that the inflation was primarily government-based and yet the President is telling  the private sector that they are primarily the ones who have to solve the problem  As a result, it  was almost counterproductive rather than helpful in terms of moderating people’s expectations as  to what the future holds  So if I had to make a guess, I would come out with the same numbers that  the staff does  And to the extent that they are wrong, I think we are facing more significant  inflationary pressures than any of us would like to believe       4/18/78             20     Thank you, Mr Chairman  May I ask a question before I make a comment?  When you present the Committee’s view on these long-range targets, do you envision making  explicitly a statement to the effect that they’re not being lowered but one of the reasons is because  we intend to be more diligent in trying to actually come [within] the ranges that we have set?       But you would envision stating that principle publicly in connection with  presenting these ranges?   I think that is fairly critical because that is one of the few restraining  influences on inflationary expectations that is left  I think that will be an important message and  will come across importantly       That is right  I agree with that  I would like to make just one comment on  the credit thing  I agree that we ought to live within the law  I wonder if it would be worth  considering the context in which we present whatever credit figures we present  We never use     4/18/78             33  those in these discussions as targets  I don’t know of a theory of credit determination--or of bank  credit determination--of prices or anything else  And if we are going to pass those numbers on, I  think somehow we ought to do it within a context that indicates how we actually use or do not use  those numbers so that the public isn’t misled       I won’t repeat anything I said in the letter; I would like to add two comments,  if I may       Thank you  First of all, I think we are accountable to the public for what we  do  And if there is some fundamental thinking behind the policy positions that we take, somehow  it seems right to me to put that out in the public domain  Second, many members of this  Committee already put out forecasts of one kind or another in speeches they give or questions they  ask and so on  So I have a feeling that we are not really giving away anything we don’t give away  anyway  Third and finally, I am a little perplexed by the argument that somehow if there were  differences of opinion expressed that that can be used to divide us and be divisive and so on The  Supreme Court renders opinions without that problem and lots of other deliberative bodies do  I  guess I just can’t quite follow the logic which says that if we acknowledge what everybody knows  privately--and that is that members of this Committee have different views--that somehow that can  be used to either inhibit us or to damage the policy process  So I think there are some advantages  to putting it out and I fail to see the disadvantages       Thank you, Mr Chairman  This is a strange day for me  I find that I not only  agree with the staff but I agree with Chuck Partee almost in total       I know it  It really has me worried; I’ve got to go back and rethink my  position!       The only modification I would make is that I would be slightly more  aggressive than some--but I think with the majority--in having M1 at 4 to 8  That simply forces us  to be a little more aggressive on the funds rate if April and May come in strong  I very much like  the 6-3/4 to 7-1/2 federal funds range and moving very promptly on the first piece of that       If we have in effect made 7-1/4 the operational top, it seems to me that the 8  percent top would be satisfactory        Thank you, Mr Chairman  I guess I have a slightly different view than some  of those enunciated so far  I suppose it hinges in part on the slightly different estimate as to how     5/5/78              6  much strength will stay in the numbers as we go down the road  I’m concerned primarily about  two things  One is that I think the inflation outlook is a little bit worse  It seems to be getting a  little worse each time we look at it  [Second], I think the argument that you made with regard to  how the most recent policy actions have been received is right and I have the feeling that even  some additional action, if necessary, will also be received in the same way  Therefore, I think it  would be a plus not only in terms of inflation but in terms of our basic confidence in the economy   Third, it seems to me that if we’re looking at nominal increases in GNP of the kind that Jim and  Steve have talked about--[an expectation] we share by the way--the rates of growth in M1 and M2  will be under persistent upward pressure throughout the rest of the quarter  Therefore, we’re going  to have to move rates up rather significantly to try and keep those numbers in [line]  And finally, I  just have the feeling that last year we tried to get a [unintelligible] through the last three quarters  and we persistently overshot our objectives for the aggregates because of the special factors that we  kept seeing  I’m very concerned about [having] that kind of performance again  So I would have a  rather strong preference not only to raise the discount rate but to use the full range for the federal  funds rate        I agree basically with what the staff has [forecast], with two fairly significant  differences, I think  One is that I agree very much with Henry’s statement on the outlook for  inflation  Last week I had a meeting with 170 primarily middle level businessmen--chief financial  officers and that sort of person  I took a little poll and 80 percent expected inflation of at least 8  percent for 1978; 40 percent expected inflation of 10 percent or higher in 1979  You know, it just  doesn’t make any difference whether that is soundly based or not  If that feeling is widespread,  they will make decisions that will in fact generate those kinds of rates  So, as I look at it, I think  the inflation forecast that the Board staff has is probably still on the low side  I also agree with  Frank, for slightly different reasons, that the chances are that real growth in ’78 will be still  somewhat higher than we really would like to have, given where we are  We are a little more  optimistic on housing than the staff is, reflecting primarily [our view that] the thrifts will get more  money than the Board staff thinks       On consumer spending, I think the Board staff is right  We think that is going to be quite  strong  This may come out kind of funny because it’s hard to articulate, but it seems consistent to  me to have a negative reaction be the basic reaction to inflation in terms of consumer spending and  yet still in the short run have consumer spending, particularly for durable goods, go up  That’s  because what you would expect in a period of inflation is a substitution--purchasing durables  which, if you buy on credit you then rent from yourself for the rest of the time and substituting that  for other kinds of nondurable services you ordinarily would have bought  What that would mean is  that in 1978 we will continue to get strong consumer spending as [people] make this change in their  spending decisions  And then, unfortunately, that could be one of the things that comes back to  haunt us in 1979 if we fail to make a soft landing--where we get a significant fallback in consumer  spending  So in terms of real growth for ’78, we are quite optimistic, but increasingly pessimistic  about what all of this means for ’79       As I listened to most of the discussion, I seemed to follow it well right until  we got to the policy prescription and then I wonder what--     SPEAKER(?)  That’s the trouble with listening!       I’m going to make a different recommendation, so I guess I’d better explain  briefly why  First of all with regard to the inflation outlook, I thought that we all pretty much  agreed earlier in the day that it is very serious and most of the risks are on [the high] side  While  it’s perfectly true that we can’t do anything about that in the short run, I think it’s also true even for     5/16/78              36  non-monetarists that in the long run you tend to get the same rate of inflation at which you have  allowed the trend rate of money to grow  Chuck made the point earlier, and I think it’s a very  critical one, that abstracting from the first quarter--which I think has to be considered an aberration  because of what was happening in the real economy--the trend rate of growth of money is up  And  my guess is that when people look back at that they’re going to say “There they went again and  they followed a pro-cyclical monetary policy, with the trend rate of growth of money increasing  precisely at the time when inflation was increasing and we were at a very high level of capacity  utilization”  So it seems to me, while there are always reasons why we need to be concerned about  bulges and that sort of thing, that if there ever were a time when we ought to get the trend rate of  growth of money down, now is the time to do that  And I think that will have an impact, although  unfortunately a moderate one, in 1979, and it will have a significantly greater impact beyond that   And if we don’t get the trend rate of money growth down then all we do is simply validate the  higher inflation rate that we’re looking at through 1979     I think, too, that the point Phil Jackson made is a very crucial one  People are looking very  closely at the moment at what we do and if they see us quote “easing up” in whatever way they  [view] that--the rate of growth of money or whatever--I think that can have a very serious short-run  implication in terms of inflation  We currently have the inflation rate expected to go above 7  percent for 1978  That means that, at current levels of interest rates, the Treasury bill for example  has a negative real rate  Now, I know there are lots of technical ways of trying to figure out what  real rates are, but just making very crude calculations here we are accelerating inflation at almost  near full employment and we still have some negative real rates of interest  And that seems to me  to be a very strange posture for us to be in  So I’m not at all concerned about a further movement  of interest rates      Second, since we have had an enormous bulge in April, we are looking for a reduction from  that in May  But in order to get that reduction we’re going to have to have what I think would be  one of the largest drops in the history of the series to get it  The staff’s forecast for May and June is  6-1/2 percent coming off that huge increase in April  I can’t conjure up in my mind why we would  want money to grow any faster than that in May and June because that will still give us for the  quarter [growth] of money of over 9 percent  So in terms of M1, I would put the range at 2-1/2 to  6-1/2 because I don’t see why we would want--coming off the very strong April number--to have it  go any faster than that in May and June  And that will still give us a quarterly number that I think  is too high  In conjunction with that, I have M2 at 4 to 8 although I go in the opposite direction of  Steve  I become less confident about M2 as we move into these kinds of periods rather than more  confident about what it means  In terms of the federal funds rate, I would prefer a range of 7-1/4 to  8 and would let it get there as fast as the aggregates suggest that it should        We are just voting on the narrow question of whether we prefer to go to 7-1/2  immediately or whether, if we do that, we can then accept the rest of the package?       I was going to say almost the same thing  I feel uncomfortable because it’s  not clear to me whether we are just changing words or changing policy, and I’d like more time to  think about it        I=d like to come back for just a minute to the little dialogue between Jim  and Larry  One of the things that=s obviously going on now is that the econometric relationships  in most of the models we have don=t work as well as maybe they have in past times  But one of  the reasons for that is because it=s not possible to model effectively the way people form  expectations and then the decisions they base on those expectations  And it=s not at all  inconceivable to me to have--and I think you gave up too easily, Jim--          It seems to me that if in fact you had higher interest rates, there is a way in  which that might be perceived in the world as reducing the expected rates of inflation, and that  would have a rather substantial positive impact on investment and other forms of spending and,  therefore, a rather positive impact on real growth  For that reason I=m not sure, even if we have  higher interest rates than you=re assuming in your forecast, that that automatically means lower  real growth  It depends on the context in which that takes place  If it takes place in an  environment where those higher interest rates are perceived as having a moderating impact on  inflation, then the impact on real growth could be neutral or it could be positive  I=m not sure we  will know until we get there, but it=s not at all clear to me that higher interest rates automatically  mean that real growth will be smaller, particularly in  light of--       Well, housing is a very difficult sector; [its performance] depends a lot on  what happens to Regulation Q ceilings and the impact that has on financial flows  I will readily  admit, however, that if interest rates escalate significantly in a short period of time, housing will  have a difficult time sustaining itself  It would still be possible, however, to have that  compensated for and then some by business and other types of spending  Jim commented that  one of the reasons we don=t see business spending coming along the way we=d all like to see it is  because of the uncertainty and so on associated with inflation  If we could really do something-- as we might have the possibility of doing--to change that perception, then it seems to me we  could have a rather vigorous growth and be [unintelligible]  I=m not predicting that but I think  that=s--        I guess all I=m saying is that I=m not really sure  That may well be the case  But I think one can make an argument that under the very special circumstances we face, we  could get quite a different reaction than one would normally expect       6/20/78                8     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I will try to be brief   First, farmers are smiling   And if they scowl when their net worth is down to a million dollars, you can imagine how good it  must be if they are smiling  We have a couple of the largest food processors in the country, General  Mills and Pillsbury, and they confirm what Chuck said  The rate of increase in food prices is not  going to moderate during the rest of this year  And I think that does give real pause in terms of what  the overall rate of inflation is going to be  In terms of second quarter to second quarter, for prices  our guess is 7-1/2 percent; if we are wrong, our guess is it will be closer to 8 than to 7  In terms of  unemployment in the second quarter, frankly, I don=t know  Unlike some others around the table--       My feeling is that it does depend on what we do  I don=t think that is cast in  concrete  I find the scenario that Phil and Chuck outlined all too likely  I think we could do  something about that  I doubt that we will--“we” meaning both the Fed and the Administration--but  I think we could  I am somewhat encouraged by the Miller reduction in the deficit, at least that is  how the paper described it in our part of the country         Well, whatever it was, I thought that was good  If we had more of that, I could  get fairly optimistic, but I don=t know how much more there is going to be  [On unemployment], for  a number my guess is that by the second quarter of next year we will be at 6 percent or a little above   I think it is going to go down a little bit, but then it will start coming up; and how high it will get, I  don=t know  In terms of real GNP, since we are talking about an average, I feel a little more  confident about that  I think that will be somewhere between 3-1/2 and 4 percent over that period  simply because we are going to have so much going on between now and then     I would like to make just two additional comments  One is on housing because of high interest  rates  If you look at a l0 percent mortgage, which we are starting to look at in some places around  the country, those interest [payments] are tax deductible for those who pay [taxes]  If you have an  inflation rate of over 7 percent plus the full l0 percent is tax deductible, consumers aren=t going to  shy away from 10 percent mortgages because the real cost to them is very, very low  So if we have a  problem in housing, it is going to be because the financial markets aren=t going to be allowed to  work in such a way as to keep the money moving into that sector  Second, I think that the prospect  for real growth depends to an unusually large degree on the prospects for inflation  And the kind of  scenario that Phil and Chuck outlined I think is a direct consequence of people=s expectations with  regard to inflation  To the extent that we in our policy discussions can impact on that, that will make  me more optimistic than I am       Let me make just one comment on interest rates, since so many people have  commented on them, before I give my projections  We have moved interest rates up fairly  significantly this year  And yet if you look at the increase in rates in this expansion relative to a  comparable point in previous expansions, we=re way below where we normally would be  And  given the fact that inflation is higher than in those earlier expansions, it seems to me that no matter  what your persuasion--whether it=s monetarist or Keynesian or anything else--our interest rate policy  has been very moderate indeed  And the level of real interest rates is very low  The 90-day  Treasury bill rate currently is zero in real terms  If we=re talking about being essentially at full  capacity with inflation accelerating, I find it difficult to be concerned about a rather substantial  upward movement in interest rates  However, being the moderate person that I am, I must say, Mr  Chairman, that I=m troubled by the fact that there=s always a reason why we can=t do what we kind of  would like to do  Somehow it seems to me that we ought to force ourselves to at least push in that  direction  I like Ernie Baughman=s suggestion very much of having an M1 range of 4 to 8  I think it  would do exactly as you suggest, Phil  It would force us quickly to move the rate up, which is  precisely what I=d like to see us do  I=d like to have a federal funds range of 7-1/2 to 8-1/4 and I’d be  happy to have discussions before we move above 8 percent  But I think we must go toward 8  relatively rapidly  On M2, I think 6-1/2 to 9 is a more prudent range than the one that has been  recommended       Instead of changing the words, why don=t we just do it?       Don=t give up        Thank you, Mr Chairman  For reasons that Henry and Ernie articulated  more clearly than I can, I have come up with these most likely numbers real GNP of 3-1/2 to 4, but  with the risk clearly on the downside; inflation of 7-1/2 to 8, with the risk in that case on the  upside; ending up with an unemployment rate of around 6 percent, with the risk on the upside      I would like to make one comment if I may, Mr Chairman  And that is that it seems to me  that this particular exercise in the current state of the economy depends very crucially on what we  individually forecast monetary policy will be, because I think people do respond to monetary  policy more quickly than they used to  I don’t think the lags are as long  And that is particularly  true in terms of the impact that they perceive monetary policy will have on expected rates of  inflation and how they then build that into their forecasts and spending decisions  Because of that,  it seems to me that in reviewing things like the simulations the staff put together, which I  personally found very useful, there is a problem  I like the tradeoff [in the staff’s model] much  better than most that I have seen come out of the models  Nevertheless, there always is a problem  in trying to model the way people form expectations and then behave [based] on that  It is possible,  for example--going back to the question that Chuck raised--that you could have higher interest rates  and have that consistent with more rapid real economic growth  [That could occur] if the higher  interest rates were generated by lower rates of growth of money and if that, in turn, made people  expect lower rates of inflation and, therefore, in response to lower rates of inflation and lower  uncertainty associated with inflation they spent more  It seems to me it is that kind of possibility  that we need to keep very carefully in mind as we think about the likely course of events over the  next year       Thank you, Mr Chairman  I feel very strongly that we ought not to change  the long-run ranges, and for more than public relations  Steve made a comment about a further  downward drift in money--if [the staff estimate] is right--that was l percent  I think that’s the  number you used, Steve  With the growth in money in the past quarter, we have base drift of l  percent  So just to keep the existing ranges would mean not really 4-1/2 to 6 but 6-1/2 to 8  We  have had, as Chuck mentioned, 79 percent growth over the last four quarters  If you look back, we  have had above 7 percent growth in money for a very long time now  And I don’t see how we are  ever going to deal with the inflation problem unless we do something to bring the rate of growth of  money down  If we were to do that, I think we could have a very positive rather than a negative  impact on the outlook for a recession  So I would like to keep the long-run ranges both for M1 and  M2 where they are today  I would heartily endorse what Chuck said on M2  We have no basis at  this point to make the kind of switch that [operating on M2] would imply, and I think we should be  very, very careful before we do that       It might have been just as well, Mr Chairman!  If I could, I’d just make one  comment on interest rates, since there seems to be so much concern about rising interest rates  We  seem to accept easily the notion that if we want to look at real wages we adjust for inflation, and  that if we want to look at what is happening to profits and depreciation, we adjust for inflation   Most of the economic theory that I know says that if you want to look at the real bite of interest  rates, you also adjust for inflation  And interest rates adjusted for inflation are not high at all  I  think that is the sense that Phil probably means when he says we are not very tight  In fact, we  have had negative real rates of interest on Treasury bills, for example, for over two years  This is  in contrast with periods in the early ’60s and most of the ’50s when real rates of interest not only  were not negative but they were positive      I don’t see how we can deal effectively, when we are at full employment, with accelerating  inflation and still have substantially negative real rates of interest  So it does not bother me to have  interest rates go up; I think they should go up  If they don’t go up, I think we are simply  guaranteeing more rapid rates of inflation, which will then guarantee, in turn, higher interest rates  One of the most stable and profound relationships we have in all of economics is the relationship  between inflation and interest rates, and I don’t think we hold [inflation] down by failing to move     7/18/78              41  interest rates up now  So I think we ought to make another move  I think that the federal funds  range ought to be 7-3/4 to 8-1/4 and that all of the numbers I have heard so far [for the M1 and M2  ranges] are too high  They will not move us in the direction that we need to go  I think something  like 3 to 7 percent would be more appropriate for M1       Yes        Thank you, Mr Chairman  Real GNP 352, down from 353       That's the first  Inflation of 7-1/2 to 8 percent and unemployment around 6  percent  The only comment I would make--I guess we've all been going through the same kind of  exercises trying to see where the imbalances are and whether we really see a recession coming  I  don't  Things do seem remarkably well balanced for this stage in the expansion  I would endorse,  however, the concerns that have been expressed about what has happened in labor  That not only  has some potential difficulties for prices, as has been indicated, but a severe work stoppage  In our  state they're talking about how high interest rates are and they want to put usury ceilings back to 8  percent for the homeowner, that sort of thing  If the response of labor is such that it's forceful and  effective, then that could generate some of the imbalances that could precipitate a recession  Other  than that, I think [the outlook] on the real side remains good at this stage and inflation is the only  thing that's really [unintelligible]       M1 for the last six quarters has grown at about 78 percent, as you  suggested earlier  It seems to me that if we're to give any kind of meaningful signal to labor  negotiators next year, to people concerned about the dollar internationally, and to anybody who  looks at inflation and our policy responses to inflation, we are going to have to do something that  makes people feel confident that we are not going to continue money growth at that rate  On the  other hand, I agree with all of the comments that have been expressed that we ought not to move  too sharply or we will precipitate a recession  We have done that in the past; we ought not to do it  this time  I think we can avoid doing it  But I also think that we could move the rate of growth of  money down to around 7 percent--a reduction of about 3/4 of a point on average--without  precipitating a recession  And I think that would have very positive impacts in terms of not only  the dollar internationally but the rate of inflation domestically      Now, with what's happened to money in July and the expectation for August, and also given  the comments that Chuck made about the possibility that the numbers might be a little weaker  rather than a little stronger, it would seem to me that this is a good time to move carefully in that  direction and still kind of hedge our bets a little bit  [We could do that] if we accepted a lower  ceiling for growth in money for the 2-month period but also indicated that we wouldn't allow rates  to move up too high  Therefore, if money growth did come in strong, we still wouldn't have a very  precipitous move in the federal funds rate in the short run  I'd really like to see the  Committee--coming at the end, it's clear to me it's not going to happen because everybody has  already given other ranges--have an M1 range of 3 to 7 percent  [I say that] because if we always  have our ranges straddle the midpoint of where we want to be, as long as inflation is going in the  direction it's going, we are always going to err on the high side  We will never get down below  where we are unless we kind of force ourselves down by bringing the ceiling rate down  So I  would have M1 from 3 to 7, M2 from 6 to 10, and then the federal funds rate from 7-3/4 to 8-1/4,  which means that under my aggregates conditions [directive] we might hit that top fairly quickly      8/15/78             26  But at least we wouldn't go above that unless the Committee made an explicit decision to go above  it       The midpoint would be 8 and I'd have no problem moving to that  I would  also agree with those who have indicated that increasing the discount rate would be a desirable  thing to do       I'm still thinking about it  I certainly would not vote for 8-1/2; I might vote  for 8       I have nothing to add  I am on the side of those who are skeptical        I'd just say ditto to what Roger said      Since I have been accused of being a maverick, may I quote a statement   that you made, Mr Chairman, with which I'd like to agree to show that I am in the mainstream      At least  But this one was particularly interesting to me This was in a letter   that you sent to Congressman Reuss and it says “theoretical and empirical work by economists  indicates that the trends in monetary expansion over the longer run have little impact on the  behavior of real output and employment, the primary impact being on prices  Thus, if the monetary  authority makes clear its commitment to the achievement of money stock growth rates that will  ultimately be consistent with price stability, it will have provided a reliable basis for planning  This  has been the direction in which the Federal Reserve has attempted to move during the past three  years and in which we plan to continue to move in the years ahead”  I think that's a very positive,  correct statement--one with which I agree 100 percent  I must say that if we adopt the ranges that I  see put down here by some members of the Committee at least, we will not be consistent with that  statement  And in my judgment we will have the consequences that are implied by that  We will  not have the environment in which appropriate business and other planning can take place      I'd like to make just two brief comments before I give what are going to appear, I'm sure, to   be outrageous recommendations  The first is that it’s a common assumption--I think in the System  as well as outside the System--that it is not possible to reduce the rate of growth of money without  precipitating a recession  And I think there is substantial reason to believe that there is a way in  which that could be done  That is to say, you could reduce the rate of growth of the aggregates and  you could reduce the rate of increase in prices and not precipitate a recession  Obviously, I don't  have the time here to explain that, but it seems clear to us with the work that we have done with  regard to how expectations are formed and how that influences people's decisions that it’s possible  to do so  In that light I'd suggest that perhaps one reason why businessmen seem increasingly  pessimistic may well have to do with inflation--that inflation is a cause of that pessimism rather  than the fear that we are about to enter into a recession  We do not see the risk of a recession in the  foreseeable future, in the absence of some major shock--a serious strike, or the dollar goes wild, or  some sharp adjustment in policy, or something like that  Therefore, it seems to me that inflation is  still clearly the number one economic problem that we have  And I just don't see how we will ever  deal with that in a way that makes people believe that we are going to deal with it unless we do  something to get the rate of growth of money down           9/19/78            27   Our errors, in the recent past at least, have been in being surprised on the up side in terms  of the growth of the aggregates  We keep looking for that to fall off and we are always  disappointed in hindsight because it doesn't  It seems to me, therefore, that we really ought to have  for M1 a top rate of growth of 7 percent  That is not likely to be achieved over the course of the  next month, but it will do exactly as Chuck suggested  It will force us to move the interest rates up,  which I think we should do  And I would like to repeat something I've been saying now, probably  ad nauseam, and that is that interest rates are not high  Real interest rates are still negative; they are  not biting  Credit is flowing like crazy  So I think we can do that without any substantial risk to  real spending decisions  So I think we ought to have an M1 range of 3 to 7 percent  I have trouble  with M2, just as I would with the M1+, because of Regulation Q ceilings but 6 to 10 would be fine  for me on M2  I must say that I think both for domestic reasons and international reasons the  thought of a federal funds rate of 9 percent isn't at all disturbing to me, so I'd like to see us use that  full range  And I would suggest a federal funds range of 8-1/4 to 9 percent       I'd go immediately to 8-1/2       Thank you  Jim, [my question relates to] the last table where you run the  simulations that we get from time to time  The work that we've done with models like the one you  use--we haven't done it with yours and I don't think we can--suggests that if you build in some  mechanism for rational expectations, you get quite different patterns than this, including a much  more rapid impact on prices and perhaps substantially less impact on real output and  unemployment  Do you have anybody who is going to try and fiddle with that with your models to  see if the same thing happens with yours?       It can change substantially the perceived impacts of policy alternatives       No, but the point is that even--       My point is a different one than that  If you take the same models and  construct them just a little bit differently and then apply them to the same data, you get a  substantially different perception of policy impacts than if you do it the way the model is currently  constructed  You can fit it--         10/17/78 14                The only point I'm making is that you can have a model which fits historical  data just as well and yet generates dramatically different future time paths  That's the only point  It  is not a question of whether it fits history well, because it fits history just as well       Mr Chairman, what Henry and Phil said is pretty much what I was going to  say on the forecast  The only other comment I was going to make was about Dave's comment on  the President's program  I think enough of that program has been [leaked] that people have figured  out what they think it's going to be  To the extent that in some sense it's more effective in doing  something to prices than people currently expect, it seems to me that that also raises the possibility  that it could precipitate substantially slower growth than we're expecting  If people's income and  profit potential turn out to be less than they now expect them to be, that's precisely the kind of  shock that can lead to a retrenchment in economic activity  So while it may have some impact on  prices, it may also have an unexpected impact on output and unemployment       I don't disagree with you at all       I found Steve's presentation very helpful  I'd like to follow his presentation  to make a couple of statements as much by way of making sure I understand what he said as well as  arguing what I think is right  If you look first at M1, for example, without adjusting for automatic  transfers, there is a question as to whether or not the 6-1/2 is the right ceiling or not  If we didn't  face the November 1 problem, then that's what we'd be debating, among other things  And I think  we ought to treat that question separately from the question of adjustment for automatic transfers  first, because some of us think 6-1/2 is still a right number and we ought to debate whether it  should be 6-1/2 or 8  But second, Steve made a very interesting comment when he said that he  thought a 4-1/2 percent shift was highly likely  Let’s suppose that we had a 4-1/2 percent shift and  we maintain an M1 range of 2 to 6 percent  Then that means that you could have, given our current  environment, rather than a 6 percent growth in M1 a 1-1/2 percent growth in M1 before you've  violated your ranges  So what we would in effect be doing, if you attach much probability to that  kind of a shift, is that not only do we not take 6-1/2 as right, but we're willing to live with 10-1/2   And I for one would find that prospect absolutely unbearable      So in making whatever adjustment we make, it seems to me that as a technical matter it  might help in terms of policy if we discuss pre-ATS [figures] to see where we come out on that and  then discuss the adjustment after that  The only way we can make the adjustment is to figure out  what we think the most likely adjustment is  And if you gave equal weight to 1-1/2 [and] to 4-1/2,  then the most likely is 3 or whatever  [So I’d] make the adjustment on that basis and then proceed   Otherwise, it seems to me that we run a very serious risk of biasing the results and ending up with  a substantial change in policy based simply on a relatively narrow technical matter       If you have 1-1/2 and you hold it at 6, then clearly you’ve biased it the other  way  That's precisely my point  The only way that I can see to deal with that is to try and figure  out what you think the most likely outcome is and then go accordingly       Mr Chairman, we have similar kinds of uncertainty when time deposits start  bumping against ceilings and so on  We never qualify those  It's not at all clear to me why we are  going to summarily downgrade M1 just because we have increased uncertainty of a kind that's  similar to what we have often with M2 or M3       I would just like to point out [something], Mr Chairman, again making the  distinction that nobody seems to find acceptable  Pre-ATS, assuming no adjustment were going to       10/17/78 47             take place, if we had a 7 percent growth in M1 for the 2-month period, given the current  expectation for October of around 3-1/2 percent, it would mean that November could come in at  10-1/2 percent before we do anything  If you then add ATS on top of that and have post-ATS an  M1 target of 6-1/2 or 7 percent, you're talking about growth in M1 for November of anywhere from  10 percent on up, however much shift there is  And I just can't imagine, given the report that we  had on the international situation [and] our concern about inflation and all the rest of it, that we  would find that acceptable  I like Chuck's notion of having a limit on M1, but I wouldn't choose 7;  I'd choose something like 5     And it's not clear to me, even though there is this uncertainty, that the thing to do is to just  jettison M1  We know something about M1; we can get a feel for how things happen  We're going  to have at least one full month without ATS and it seems to me that maybe we're a little too quick  to give [M1] up  On M2, it seems to me that for reasons Phil Coldwell stated we ought to have a 5  to 9 percent range  I don't like money market [directives]  If the Committee goes with one, which  it seems clear that it will, I think we ought to have a range that goes at least to 9-1/2 and move  immediately to 9  And I would say in the absence of some weakness that we don't see, we ought to  move over the course of the month to 9-1/4       8-3/4       Hang in there, Paul        I would like to make just one comment on Jim's comments on capital  spending  It seems to me that the long-term cost of capital for business has not gone up  Bond  rates, for example, went down after the November 1 announcements  So there's nothing in that  which would indicate that business spending ought to be less  And what I am hearing from  business people in our part of the country, at least, is that we might get even the opposite  That is  to say, as expected rates of inflation come down, which they are starting to do now as [people] see  the policy actions that have been taken, that reduces a little bit the uncertainty with regard to the  future they face   And when you invest in long-term investments that you don't expect to come on  line until 1980 or 1981 anyway, that is beyond the horizon most people seem to be concerned  about  So they are talking very seriously in several companies in our area of increasing their  capital appropriations and budgets over the next two years  So it seems possible, at least to me, as  we work our way through this, that rather than having a decline in business spending we could  actually have an increase       Well, most of it would start to be spent in the last half of next year; it would  take at least that long       The kind that have been notoriously weak in the current expansion       You're all talking about a class of models that I don't understand  I feel  really quite comfortable with the staff forecast  We don't believe in what we refer to as the geriatric  view of business cycles--that just because they're old, they die  I don't think that's necessary  We  don't see anything in the current expansion that is so typical that it compels us to conclude there  will be a recession  There are quite a few things about this expansion and about where we are now  that are not at all typical and would seem to indicate that we could have a reduction in the rate of  inflation without causing a recession     I repeat the point that I made last time about models because that, I think, is an important  point  If one changes one basic assumption in most of the existing models--namely, the way  expectations are formed--those very same models with the very same structure fit the history just as  well, and yet have radically different implications for policy and radically different forecasts with  regard to recession  So even though they fit history in the way they're built, you can build them  only slightly differently and have them fit history equally as well and not generate a recession  forecast      I think one reason we are not expecting a recession is because, given our view of the world,  we think we have a very tightly reasoned theory which suggests that a recession is not inevitable   And we think it's not a question of our ignoring the history or ignoring what's going on  And as we  talk to businessmen we get great confirmation of that  They don't see anything inevitable in the  recession and this is one case where I hope they listen to their own instincts rather than their  economists  I think they more likely could be right      Now, if we get a recession, everybody is going to say “My goodness, look what  happened” My guess is that if we get one, it's not going to be caused by the policy moves that have  been taken but by a major work stoppage or by a very difficult winter or something else--and not  by the things that the press is talking about at the moment      Having said all of that, we're between 2 and 3 percent for real growth, 7-1/2 to 8 percent for  inflation, and around 62 percent for unemployment       For reasons which Paul and others have talked about, I would like a funds  rate range of 9-3/4 to 10-1/4 percent and I would move promptly to 10  I think, frankly, if we don't  do that, the market will be quite surprised and disappointed and it will unravel everything that we  have done  For M1, I would like a maximum of 5 percent; if we have anything greater than that  we're allowing growth in December excluding ATS that I think is really unduly large and, again,  will have a very bad message for the market  I’d have a 6 to 9 range on M2  And I don't know  what to make of M1+ so I don't have a number on that       May I add, Mr Chairman?  I strongly prefer an aggregates directive       If we would vote for this, we would tolerate almost 12 percent growth in  M1 in December before we move       That's right       Well, it’s not December, but almost  I'll vote yes        Thank you, Mr Chairman  With regard to inflation, I still see about 8  percent  It’s not surprising that we continue to see high numbers  It just takes a long time to [see  the effects of policy tightening]  We are going to see high numbers from now until sometime fairly  far into the next year and, unfortunately, we have to be just a little patient on that      With regard to real growth, [I’d say] somewhere between 2 and 3 percent  The only real  difference we have with the staff on the outlook is that we still remain substantially more optimistic  about business spending than the staff does  A typical comment from businessmen that I’ve talked  to is that of a worldwide manufacturer in our District who says, “We have gone essentially four  years without major business spending and we are essentially at full capacity  We don’t care what  interest rates are, we’ve got to build the plants”  We just have a feeling that there is something  there        With regard to the international situation, I think Chuck is right  The economics of that  price increase should have redounded to our benefit  And because that didn’t happen, I think  Scott’s response is also right that what people are looking at is some assumption as to the policy  response rather than the economics that are involved  I guess that is the most worrisome thing   They still don’t believe us when we say we are going to stick with it  They think at the least sign of  trouble we are going to back off, and I think that’s too bad      With regard to policy, I did the same thing that Henry did only on a slightly different issue-- looking at policy moves rather than history on our forecasts of prices and unemployment  I don’t  know whether it’s Christmas or what, but I feel as I listen to the Committee that I am rapidly  turning from a hawk into a dove because I am starting to get nervous about repeating what has been  a fairly typical mistake for the Committee  And that is that once it gets religion it goes too far  As  anxious as I am to get [the aggregates] down, I want to get them down slowly precisely so we don’t  precipitate the recession that I think we can avoid if we are careful  Now having said that,  intellectually--        I am not willing to jettison the aggregates  They’re imperfect but they are  one of the few things that we have some strong analytical and theoretical base for  I think they are  just fraught with problems  Steve mentioned the possibility of a shift in demand  If that’s going on  at the same time we have ATS going on, we could badly fool ourselves in looking at low numbers  and think we are doing something when in fact we haven’t done anything  So I think that’s a very  real risk  And how we hedge that against my previous concern, [which] is just to keep from going  too far and causing a recession, I’m not sure I know  In the short run it seems to me that the  problem is not quite as difficult because we have had such a long period of strong growth  So if we  err a little bit on the side of weaker growth for a month or so, I don’t think that’s going to have any  lasting impact  And if the international situation tells us that somehow we need to have a little  further response, I wouldn’t object to that  But I must say that I personally am getting very close to  feeling that we need to be really careful so that we don’t go too far too fast and cause a major  problem     12/19/78          15         Can I just make sure I understand the arithmetic?        The forecast for December is 2 percent and if you had 3 percent ATS that  would be 5 percent for December  If you had your proposed 6 percent cap on M1 for the two  months, that would allow 10 percent growth in January--or if you add another 3 percent for ATS,  13 percent in January       You would move [the funds rate] before you get to the top, with an  aggregates type directive       I’m not trying to delay the issue; I’m trying to understand       So that, theoretically, you could get about 8-1/2 percent for the two months  if you add ATS back in  But that would be with the funds rate moving up potentially as high as  10-1/2       I would like first to make a commercial, Mr Chairman, and disavow that I  am a monetarist  We hold a balanced portfolio in Minneapolis         Someday when we have more time we will explain the substantive  differences between the monetarist and what’s even worse, I might say, and that’s a rational  expectations-ist  But that’s another story     I can live with the specifications that Steve gave, on the assumption that we really don’t  envision any circumstances where we’ll let the fed funds rate drop this time and we’ve built in a  mechanism where if the aggregates do become strong we’ll move the rate up          Well, is Jim going to describe how he proposes to do this?        I’d just like to point out--I think it supports the subcommittee’s  recommendation--that we do not currently have any place that I know of in the country, let alone in  the Federal Reserve System, an econometric model that can be used with any great confidence  through the kind of simulation that we are talking about  So while we go through the exercises, I     12/19/78          58    think the real point we ought to understand is that there is no way we can say on the basis of those  exercises whether our proposed policy is consistent or inconsistent with the President’s programs   So in a way we have a dilemma that isn’t as bad as we think because we don’t have to lie or  anything else  We really don’t know based on those models whether we are inconsistent or not   It’s an entirely different kind of discussion than I think would be implied by what we have been  talking about so far  My fear is that we are going to mislead ourselves into thinking that we can  determine with more precision than we can exactly what the options are that we face       We hope to have for the Committee, in a few months, some simulation views in the MTS  model to indicate that there is really nothing we can say about the breakdown in nominal GNP  between prices and real output, with any degree of confidence at all, based on the way that model is  currently working  And that’s not a criticism of that model any more than any other  It’s just a  fundamental difficulty we are having [in] how these things are being done         Thank you, Mr Chairman I'd just like to ask  one question about the monetary policy assumption Up until the  fourth quarter of 1978, money grew on average about 8 percent You  have an assumption of 6-1/4 percent, adjusting for ATS Does that  also include any adjustment for the 2 percent shift in the demand for  money?   M R   KICHLINE Yes, it does It's consistent with the  Bluebook; in effect, you add 2 percent to the 6-1/4 percent A s  you  know, in the fourth quarter--and apparently in the current quarter,  the way things are shaping up--the money demand function has begun to     2/6/79 -7-   differ from actual experience We're picking up some of the drift  that Steve Axilrod had assumed a year ago It didn't show up for 3  quarters, but we held on to that assumption and it eventually showed  up So we do add 2 percent to the 6-1/4 percent    When you say add 2 percent, what I'm trying to  figure out is what measured M1 growth will be consistent with this  We can take 3 percent off for ATS?    That's all Now, what about the shift in demand  for NOWS?    And another way of saying it is that if measured  money adjusting for ATS is 6-1/4 percent, without the shift it's  really 8-1/4 percent    For this level of interest rates--which in  effect means if that shift takes place, then there'd be no change in  monetary policy in terms of M1 from the past two years on your  assumption for the forecast period Right? If that shift takes  place, then you're not assuming any additional restriction in monetary  policy from what we have had over the last two years   M R   KICHLINE That's right    It wasn't taking place last year    And we got 8 percent growth     2/6/79 -8-    If we get 6 percent growth plus the 2 percent,  then we're essentially where we were in '78 and most of '77   SPEAKER(?) That's right    All right, thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman I won't quibble with  the staff's forecast I would simply point out that we think they have  done an incredibly good job on a horrendously difficult task In  terms of the probabilities, there is the possibility that the economy  could be stronger as well as weaker If businessmen really were  convinced that we were doing something about inflation, then those  business numbers could come in significantly stronger That's what we  keep hearing in some of our Districts at least They are telling us  that's a possibility   with regard to policy, I have been fascinated by the  discussion today Humphrey-Hawkins presents both a major dilemma and  a major opportunity, it seems to me I feel very shaky about  simulating econometric models out into 1980 In fact, [at our Bank]  we happen to feel shaky about simulating them period We are not sure  they work But, clearly--and I think the staff would agree--they work  less well for 1980 than they do for 1979 On the other hand, given  our view of the world, if we were to announce and then follow through  on a credible policy, our feeling is that we can have a very salutary  impact on what happens in 1980 Without boring you with all the gory  details, our theory would tell us that we can in fact have less  inflation without more unemployment in 1980 if we have policies in  1979 that are consistent with that [objective]--policies that are  firmly held to so that people really believe we are going to follow  through on them That suggests to me that while the staff's forecast  for 1980 shows relatively little [improvement] on price performance  and rising unemployment--and I think that may well be the case--we  have the possibility in 1979 to lay the groundwork for a much better  performance on prices  slack in the economy but on the way people operate given what they  think is going to happen with government policy on inflation   That better performance would not depend on   In our view, then, that makes what we do with the long-run  ranges this time absolutely critical because this is when we announce  them to the world and then have to deliver on them Ignoring the  politics for a minute--1 know I play these numbers games and somehow  they seem very important to me and maybe not so important to other  people--let's look at the range that Steve gave for M1, which was 2 to  5 percent If you take the 5 percent, add 3 percentage points for ATS  and 2 percentage points for a downward shift in the demand for money,  that's a potential maximum growth of 10 percent If you take the  midpoint of 3-1/2 percent [in Steve's range], which presumably would  be our target, and add those 5 percentage points for the same reasons,  that would give us an 8-1/2 percent target for 1979 That's exactly  [the growth] we had in '77 and '78, and I think that was too  expansionary  average at around 8 percent So I, for one, would feel very  uncomfortable with a target of 3-1/2 percent If we just follow  through the logic for a minute without thinking of the politics, which   We got too much inflation by allowing money to grow on     2/6/79 -20-    I am not equipped to do, a desirable range for M1 would be something  like 0 to 3 percent That would give us a midpoint of 1-1/2 percent;  and if the assumptions on ATS and the shift in the demand for money  are right, then we get 6-1/2 percent growth at the midpoint    Well, I'm getting to that If they are wrong--  if all we get is ATS, for example, and not the downward shift in the  demand for money--we then move up to the top part of the range which  would be 3 percent plus the ATS, which is again 6-1/2 percent If  there is a greater shift in the demand for money then, of course, it  would go the other way We are all guessing at this point but there  seems to be the possibility that the shift could be greater as well as  smaller So it seems to me that if we want to change policy--and  maybe we don't--from the 8 percent growth we have had, then we have to  move the M1 range down to something below what anybody to this point  has suggested I would suggest that the range be 0 to 3 percent which  in my mind says, given the most likely set of assumptions, that we  would really be going from 8 percent to 6-1/2 percent under the old  rule For M2, whatever you all decide is fine with me; I can't  understand M2 or M3 or any of the other aggregates, with due apologies  to my friends from San Francisco    Well, with a rather wide range of uncertainty    I have a feeling that I'm about to vote for a  money market directive, which means that in the years I've contested  with this Committee the Committee has won and I've given in    I would like to say that I'm very sympathetic to  the suggestion Dave made; I think that's probably right But I wonder  if we ought not have some concrete notion just among ourselves as to     2/6/79 -36-   what magnitude of growth in the aggregates would tend to precipitate a  call I say that because if Steve is right on the shift in demand for  money in the first quarter at 3 percentage points and we have the ATS  effect at 3-1/2 percentage points, we could have zero growth in  measured MI for the first quarter and [in effect] M1 would still be  growing at 6-1/2 percent So if M1 growth were coming in at 6 percent  on average during the first quarter, that would be [equivalent to  growth of1 12-1/2 percent, and I don't think that's what we want    I understand I just think we ought to have a  not ion--   CHAIR" MILLER Well, we ought to have an understanding and  I don't know how best to articulate that understanding Each of you  sees the money numbers as they are published each Thursday Having  seen them, if we haven't called a meeting and you think we need to  talk, just call us I think we can leave it to communication; if  anybody feels that it's time to talk, we'll talk That's one way to  do it Then we don't have to [set] numbers    I think I’d like an unbiased--    --but I’d like to retract what I said earlier; I  think we have to have some aggregates in it    Sorry, Mr Chairman, may I just ask a question?  I‘m not sure what Steve is assuming in these numbers about the demand  shift for the first quarter    So if we got 8 percent growth for the 2 months,  what would that be for the quarter if we get the 3-1/2 percent shift?     2/6/79 -42-    So we‘d get 6-1/2 to I-1/2 percent    I’m just trying to understand, Chuck, what the  numbers are I think we’re talking about policy and not arithmetic     Thank you I just wanted to ask how you treated  the impact of decontrol of oil prices and how that fed through to the  forecast for inflation Was it any different than you would have  treated it if the same amount of increase came simply as a result of  an OPEC [price] increase? Is my question clear?    Well, in addition to that, there is another  factor and I don’t pretend to know exactly how to [take it into  account] When OPEC increases its prices, it does so without an  increase in supply In the case of decontrol there‘s at least a hope  that it is going to have a supply-side effect When one works that     4 /17 / I 9    through the system, it's not clear whether in general--though clearly  energy prices will go up--the inflation rate will go up    Thank you, Mr Chairman When economic theory  and data appear to be in such disarray, it seems to me that we ought  to introduce real factors AS exhibit A I would like to show the  Committee the last shoe I was able to purchase, which cost me $559  It was made in Nebraska, which is someone else’s District, I‘m happy  to say But it’s a clear demonstration of the fact that inflation is     4/11/19 -20 -    a real problem and that when guidelines are imposed, quality just goes  to pot    I would simply like to say, when I see all these  arguments about real interest rates coming back to haunt me, that I’m  beginning to wonder why I did that Inflation numbers in the first  half have been very bad; I don‘t think that should surprise any of us  They‘ve been a little worse than we expected, I guess, but we did  expect bad numbers I think the second half is going to look better  Whereas last year I was anxious for strong and aggressive action, this  year--two operations later--I’m painfully convinced that slow and  steady as she goes is the appropriate policy    I’m afraid it comes too late, M r   Chairman,  since I’m no longer a voting member But I like both your recitation  and your specifications and I would go with those     4/11/19 - 2 8 -     No     4 / 1 7 / 7 9  -45-     Thank you, Mr Chairman I'd like Murray's  record to show that we agree substantially with all of the portions of  Jim's forecast that are correct and disagree violently with those  portions that are incorrect!     5 /22 /79  -17-   M R   MAYO That's pretty good Keep going    Well, somebody told me that's [all] we're left  with! I just have a couple of quick comments We're very much in the  staff's camp with regard to business spending We still think that it  could turn out to be a plus for the year and could be the sector that  will carry us through with positive real growth I must say that your  report on new orders doesn't sound very consistent with that I hope  that turns out to be a fluke On the inflation side, we think a case  can be made that is slightly more optimistic than the staff's--not in  the near term but in the longer term If you think as we do that the  basic rate of inflation is determined primarily by the size and  direction of the federal deficit and by the stance of monetary policy,  both of those basically have been moving in the right direction That  would suggest that the long-run outlook for inflation is a little  better than we might suppose Food and OPEC and all these other  things somehow keep making life less orderly than we would like But  even so,  our feeling is that we may be moderately pleasantly surprised  on the inflation side   As for policy, we certainly wouldn't want to tighten up,  whatever that means I'd like to suggest that a tightening of  monetary policy can be done in a number of ways, in our view at least,  including a change in the rules of the game And we would put the  application of reserve requirements on RPs and things like that as a  change in the rules of the game that would have a tightening effect  so we hope that will not be done In terms of interest rates, I agree  with what Steve said In terms of the aggregates, I almost thought he  was going to say that given what has been happening we could start to  give more credibility to M1 and, therefore, we could narrow the range  He went in the opposite direction and he lost me So, I'd like to  think about that for a minute    I have a preference for "B" as it stands     Mr, Chairman, Chuck Partee gave my speech even better than I wrote  it, so I have nothing to add     Thank you, M r   Chairman Jim, implicit in your  inflation forecast on the table in the last sheet of the handout and,  in fact, explicitly in your responses to Larry and Chuck, is a belief  that there is a short-run tradeoff between inflation and unemployment  Can you tell me what data there are in the last decade that make you  think that such a tradeoff even exists?   M R   KICHLINE There’s very little I know that most people  like to believe the short-run Phillips curve is dead The Board‘s  model essentially has that construction and it‘s one of the few models  that has worked very well on both prices and unemployment in the last  year If we as a staff had believed it, we would have been right on  [the mark] in terms of the inflation forecast and also the strength of  unemployment It’s a very difficult area Frankly, I think one has  to look at information from a variety of sources I do, in fact,  believe that there is a tradeoff At the same time, I believe that  expectations are very important And what will happen in 1980 hinges  very importantly, I think, on inflationary expectations, confidence,  and market structure It’s difficult to model those sorts of things  So the tradeoff that I think is still there may be waning, frankly  But until there’s very strong evidence to the contrary, I would still  believe that one has to sacrifice some real performance to get much  improvement in prices using aggregate demand management policy    Well, taking a different tack than Chuck did  If people really believed that the policy response this time were  going to be different than it has been in the past--that fiscal policy  would not be tremendously stimulative and monetary policy would not be  tremendously stimulative--how possible would it be in your mind, then,  that we could in fact have lower inflation than you predicted without  substantially higher [unemployment]?    I think Henry and Phil have put their finger on  the basic decision we have to make and that is Do we bite the bullet  and really try to do something about inflation or do we get deflected  by a host of other problems? I would like to assert, without taking     7/11/79 - 2 0 -    the time to prove it--because the Committee has neither the time nor  the patience--that there is very little evidence that monetary policy  can do anything to offset an oil price increase in terms of  ameliorating its real effects on the economy In our judgment, there  is little if anything we can do systematically to offset increases in  unemployment or to offset declines in real growth Therefore, the one  thing we can have a systematic impact on, and should have a systematic  impact on, is the rate of inflation, and that should be our primary  objective And I think we can do that without making unemployment  worse than it would otherwise be That's the assertion   The implication of that is that I very much agree with what  Henry said for the long-run range for 1979 I was going to argue that  we ought to lift the bottom of that range so that we don't let money  grow too slowly but he scared me away from that with his reference to  whatever staff investigation is going on that has identified some  other factors and if that's right, that would worry me I would just  point out that even if we keep the existing ranges and assume 1  percent for ATS we could have money growth between now and the end of  the year at 6-1/2 percent and still fall within the 4-1/2 percent  ceiling range, which I think would be an appropriate rate of growth  for the second half of the year If we took what was alternative B in  the Bluebook, we could have money growth--with ATS--at 10 percent  between now and the end of the year, which I think clearly would be  the wrong response in the face of the inflation problem that we have   With regard to 1980, heaven only knows I guess without  information of the kind that Henry was talking about, I'd be inclined  at this point to keep ' 8 0  the same as '79 until we figure out a bit  more about what's going on    We are prepared to prove it    I'm just wondering if it would be consistent  with what you suggested, which I think is a move in the right  direction, if we indicated that what we would look at would be  adjustments for ATS and other things that might influence the demand  for money The market is very concerned and some of us are very  concerned about some of those other things    But we allowed substantially lower growth in the  first half because of those other things    I would find alternative I1 acceptable     Thank you, Mr Chairman I found your comments very helpful and I am very sympathetic with them I guess the only thing I'd like to do is to make you feel a little less insecure about the impact of where I think you are heading and what that would imply in terms of the real economy and recession  It seems to me that as we look at what's happening in the real sector, two issues are relevant One is what caused the recession that we are heading into I think you rightly attributed that primarily to the energy problem And if that's the case--and I happen to think it is--there is really nothing that printing money or, I would add, deficit spending could do to offset that Second, as you know, we have convinced ourselves at least in Minneapolis that even if that weren't the case, there is no exploitable tradeoff between inflation and unemployment So [in our view], a conscious decision to go easy on money in order to ameliorate the unemployment effect just really wouldn't have any impact In fact, that would have the effect  -23-    8/14/79  you suggested--that is, it would come out in terms of prices rather than in more rapid real economic growth and less unemployment  So it seems to me--with inflationary expectations clearly having worsened in contrast to our expectation earlier that they would start to get better about this stage of the year--that we almost single-mindedly have to devote ourselves to the task of doing something about inflation Then the question is What do we do and how do we do it? I found Steve's comments very helpful and useful in that they implied a tremendous amount of uncertainty about how to figure out what is happening to the demand for money I don't pretend to be able to forecast that any better than anybody else, and the implication of that to me is that we have to try rather hard to hold the short-term rate of growth of money in line on the assumption that we can then respond in whatever way is appropriate to hit the long-run targets I'm impressed by the fact that money is growing too rapidly We talk a lot about ATS but lots of other [financial instruments] have come into use as money substitutes, as we have talked about; I think you've even mentioned them on occasion, [Mr Chairman] If we add any portion of those to the rate of growth of M1, for example, we get really quite large numbers Let's assume that we get 48 percent growth of M1 for August, which I think is the forecast Any of the ranges proposed in the Bluebook would allow for high double digit growth in September, excluding these other non-M1 factors I think that would just be much too rapid growth at this very critical time So I think we need to reduce substantially any of the ranges that are listed here in the Bluebook, perhaps going with the range we have at this time which is 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent And if it turns out that that requires an upward adjustment in the funds rate, it seems to me we've got to do that in the short run in order to head off what I think would be a substantially more serious long-run implication   Henry made the point that I wanted to make I would just like to follow up and point out that if we take 4 to 8 percent with a money market directive and if the forecast for August is correct, then M1 growth in September would have to be over 11 percent before we move [on the funds rate] And that's 11 percent without any add-on for any of these near-money things Somehow that just doesn't strike me as being a very forceful move to combat inflation So, I think we really do have to decide either to drop the ranges substantially if we're going to have a money market directive or we almost have to have an aggregates directive so that we begin to move if those numbers come in very high in the range    Mr Chairman, this is Mark Willes Dave  Eastburn expressed our views with regard to the federal funds [range]  Also, I'd like to agree very much with what Frank Morris said about  lagged reserves I think we are getting trapped by our own procedures  here, making our life more difficult It is my view, too, that we  need to think through not only the question of the discount rate in  this specific instance but what kind of procedures we are going to use  on the discount rate If the fed funds rate is going to bounce  around, and it seems that it is, and if we are going to have borrowing  numbers of the kind we've been talking about here, that raises some  real questions in my mind, both about how we administer the rate and  how we administer the window itself Finally, I would like to say  that the point that Larry Roos just made about announcing our targets  and procedures is, in our judgment, absolutely fundamental Markets  really do work a lot better if they have more information and I think  we are making our own situation substantially more difficult by  creating additional uncertainty in the market and therefore  aggravating some of the very things that we would like to see settle  down So I would hope that we give that very serious consideration  That's ail I have     1 0 / 2 2 / 7 9  - 8 -      Just two things, Mr Chairman I wanted to  make a comment very much along the lines of the question asked by Phil  Coldwell The national and international companies headquartered in  our region who deal not only in the manufacturing area but in the  retail area report exceptionally strong orders and backlogs They're  surprised; they can't believe it So it may well be that the fourth  quarter is buying a little from the first half of next year and this  quarter will be a little stronger than we expect   Second, I want to tell the staff how much we appreciate  their finally understanding rational expectations because we noticed  that in our copy of the supplement to the Current Economic and  Financial Conditions the page that is supposed to have capacity  utilization on it was blank And we think they finally understand!    I have to admit that I don’t know what‘s going  to happen to the real economy I’m not sure I even know how to go     11/20/79 -20-    about predicting that at the moment because it seems to me that it  depends so much on what OPEC does and what the Congress does and lots  of other things I will go on to say, which will be no news to some  of you, that in terms of policy it’s not clear to me that it makes any  difference what the real sector does over the next twelve months  because I’m not sure that we have any demonstrated ability to have an  impact on that--in a predictable way anyway Therefore, for slightly  different reasons, I end up exactly where Phil did in terms of  focusing on inflation as the primary objective   In terms of how we should do that, I have great concern  about the process that we are using It’s not that I think we made a  mistake in going to reserves I think that‘s a tremendous step  forward But I’m not sure we have done that in such a way that we are  likely to have a reasonably good chance of being successful One of  the things that we know is that if we change substantially the way we  conduct policy, that is going to change people’s behavior Therefore,  all of the old statistical relationships that we have been able to  look at in the past--relationships between interest rates and reserves  and monetary aggregates and so on--might well be in the process of  changing because we have changed our focus presumably from interest  rates to reserves So all of the discussion that we have about trying  to pick a monetary aggregates target and then backing away from that  step by step to figure out what the reserves ought to be and the  associated interest rates and so on, just strikes me as being  backwards   It seems to me that the only reasonable prospect we have of  really making it work is to start at the other end and say, okay let‘s  fix reserves and then let the system adjust to that Clearly, we  don’t know exactly what impact that is going to have because we don‘t  have any functions that are relevant in the new environment But it  doesn’t seem to me that a lot of the things we have been talking  about--unless we are lucky--are going to lead us to any kind of  predictable result either in terms of the aggregates or in terms of  interest rates So I just feel very uncomfortable with the nature of  the discussion that we are having in terms of how we hope to reach a  policy decision I can construct, given the kinds of conversations we  have had so far, a relatively simple model that would say that what we  would end up with are reserves that are totally demand determined  And it seems to me that we are trying to do just the opposite of that  We are trying to make reserves and, therefore, the aggregates supply  determined Yet the mechanisms we have set up would have just the  opposite result  some things we have said this morning, I hope either today or in the  near future we can discuss in detail the experiment that we are  trying I say that because it‘s not clear to me, regardless of what  the ultimate objectives we set are, that we stand a very good chance  of getting exactly where we want to go unless we just turn out to be  lucky   S o ,  going back to yesterday’s discussion as well as    Why is that, M r   Chairman? Why would that  scare you if in the short run [the funds rate] went up?    It sounds like you're talking about an interest  rate target    That‘s because of large CDs    Your preference at the moment is to have it in  January So in terms of our planning we should be thinking more of  January than December, right?    It would just be easier in planning if we could  fix on one or the other as the dominant one I’m happy to go to  January I think that makes a lot of sense, but I would prefer to fix  on one date rather than two     Thank you, Mr Chairman I'll just make two brief comments I'll start out by saying that I don't pretend to understand the procedures, so my comments are probably way off the mark But the discussion fascinates me It strikes me very much like the discussion one reads in the paper each morning where people are explaining what happened in the stock market They always have some specific reason for why the stock market did what it did I don't think we really know how all these demand functions--for excess    1/8-9/80  reserves, borrowed reserves, nonborrowed reserves--are changing in the short run I just don't think [we know] anything that can make us reach very comfortable judgments on why things are doing what they're doing Going back to Henry's comments, at times borrowings are in some sense restrictive and at times they're not; it all depends I think the banking system can have a net borrowed position for a long time and not feel constrained at all, depending on an array of various factors So, I just feel very uncomfortable with the procedure that we seem to be getting into where we're modifying paths and making adjustments and so on because presumably we are able to identify shifts of a kind that I don't see how we can identify Now, I don't know what the alternative to that is But somehow it seems to me that we've got to work our way to a position where we figure out which of these things really matters most--nonborrowed reserves, total reserves, the base, or whatever it is--and set the dial on that and then just let it run for a while And if we see the dynamics that we ought to see, that's fine; if we don't, then we have to go back and find something else I feel very [un]comfortable with the situation where we think we can operate on a reserves basis the same way we were operating on a federal funds rate basis I think the two are very different kinds of procedures; we can't move from a federal funds target to a reserves target and make all these very refined calculations and adjustments   I'd just like to indicate that I have a lot of sympathy for what Governor Coldwell was saying I think we need to try to get a feel for what the limits are; and the only way to do that is somehow to decide which of the reserve targets is really relevant If you think total reserves is the relevant reserve target, then the tolerance limit on that ought to be essentially zero and we can adjust the others however we want to in order to get--   Well, we don't control it because of the way things are apparently set up We can change things and set it up so we can control it   Well, I don't think that's right at all All I'm trying to say, though, is that there is no arithmetic exercise that one can go through to figure out these limits One has to [understand] the dynamics of the system and what we really want to try to fix and what we're willing to adjust in order to keep the other things fixed That's all I'm trying to say   I'm fascinated by what Steve just said in terms of the table for publication Can you go through that again?   So people could construct any M they want?   My wife made me promise that I would be more agreeable in the new year, so I would like to say that I agree with everything that has been said I'd like to say it, but the fact is that I don't agree But since the hour is late I will be very brief in stating my disagreement We all agree that the outlook is uncertain Where we disagree is whether that makes any difference or not If we really think that if we knew what the outlook was we could affect it in a systematic way, then we end in one side of the [corner] But some of us have the view that even if we think we know what is going to happen, there is no systematic, predictable, effective way that we can have an impact on it Because of that, one can end up with quite different policy implications I feel perfectly comfortable in the abstract in saying that, yes, the outlook is uncertain but that policy ought not to be uncertain Policy ought to be a given, and by making policy a given we can in fact reduce some of the uncertainty of the outlook The implication of that is that we should not only decide but should specify in great detail what our targets are for the next five years Unfortunately, we have one minor problem with that, which is that a change in technology is going on in the financial markets that makes all the numbers, if not irrelevant, at least highly uncertain So, since you have given us an extra month, I would like to wait another month and then be able to come back and tell you what I think those numbers ought to be It's clear that we can't in the current environment spell out any M for the next three years because the technology is bound to change in such a way that it would make any number we specify obsolete It may be that we are going to have to move to some kind of reserve target and spell that out for three years But whatever we do, we need to find a way to reduce the uncertainty of the outlook that is associated with policy We can't reduce the other uncertainties, but we can reduce that uncertainty I think that would be a substantial accomplishment indeed   Next month   Following along your question and Governor Wallich's comments, I'd like to ask Jim a question and then reserve the right to comment on what I think his answer will be The Chairman forced you into a policy recommendation on fiscal policy Would you indicate--you've got to have some idea in mind since you gave that statement--what that would do to your own forecast? Would you be willing to spell that out?   The tax cut would lead to a reduction in the deflator?  -57-    1/8-9/80   But in a way even better   That's what I thought Well, we've been having a lot of discussion about tax cuts and responding to recession and so on, which is a conversation that is similar to those we've been having for the last 10 years And the only comment I would make is that we do that based on models that have proved to be off track almost every year for the last 10 years That suggests to me that we have something misspecified Of course, some of us think we know what that is And I just think now is a time when we're going to have to be very cautious about what we think we really can do to try to have an impact in a systematic way on real variables I think we all agree that we can have an impact on inflation; but it's not at all clear, based on the Fed's model--or any other model--that we have had to revise virtually every year because it went off track, [that we can have an impact on real variables] Our view is that the model has gone off track because it's misspecified; and it's misspecified in such a way that it does not make it a reliable tool to use to do these kinds of exercises I think we play a very dangerous game if we think we can say with very much precision that we're going to have an impact on these real variables by cutting taxes $30 billion or $50 billion or whatever it is when the best guess at the moment, as far as I can tell, is that all it will do is have an impact on inflation and have practically no impact on unemployment or real GNP or any of these other things that we really would like to get a handle on   I think at the moment that's the best guess   No, I didn't say that Clearly tax policy, monetary policy, and lots of things can have an impact on real economic activity But as far as we know it can't have a predictable impact We're going to change lots of things Any time tax policy changes it's going to change things It changes incentives, it changes functions, and so on The question is Can we predict in a fairly reliable way what that impact will be? And I don't see anything that suggests that we can because all the models that we have used to try to make those predictions have proved to be misspecified And there's no reason to suppose that they are any better specified now than they were ten years ago  -58-    1/8-9/80   It's not a question of variance It's the fact that the parameters are unstable and will respond, in our view of course, to expectations Therefore, by failing to factor expectations in, we've completely misspecified the shape of the economy Ten years ago that would have sounded like an absolutely absurd assumption I think now the evidence is rather considerably on that side I just want to point out one thing I think people as they've heard me talk about it have said Well, he was a monetarist and this is just one mode of monetarism The theories that we're talking about were primarily developed by Keynesians In fact, the people around our place who have done the most work on it originally came to us to work on optimal control theory and used a model like the Fed model to develop optimal control techniques So, it's not as if it's just the monetarists who think they've found a new tool to play with I think it's a very serious challenge to the bases we've been looking for in terms of making the kinds of decisions--   Well, the best guess that we can make, if we try to make adjustments--and one can't do this in a very precise way, of course, except in a very simple model--is that, yes, we can predict the direction fairly precisely But the extent we can predict what would happen to real output is essentially zero   Yes, on average   Yes, it is There's no question about it But the evidence--I'm not sure I'm happy to say it but I will--is increasingly consistent with that view   Thank you, Mr Chairman It's amazing to me how I can have such a fundamentally different view about how the world works than Chuck Partee and yet find that he stated my policy position much more eloquently than I could ever state it Whatever you wrote down for Dave Eastburn and Chuck Partee, write down for me and that would be great I would just say that on Bob Mayo's point, it's not clear to me that a bad decision is better than no decision at all; I think we ought to publish all the numbers and let people help us find out--   I don't think we have enough information   But you can't [play] that game for a quarter You can do it--   Mr Chairman, could you explain how the discount rate influences--   That's a little different than I thought   Well, that's a very interesting view of the world   Well, I don't want to prolong the discussion, but it makes me very nervous that we would take what in effect is a deterministic, very short-run model and decide the time path for changes in the discount rate, then market rates I think that's a very questionable thing to do   Well, what's the short run? Is it 2 weeks or 4 weeks or 6 weeks? We could get exactly the opposite results if you change the time horizon by a relatively small amount   Fairly quickly    Thank you, Mr Chairman I found Henry's comments and Chuck's comments particularly useful So I would like to [be recorded as agreeing with] whatever you wrote down for them I would add one thought, which goes back to the comment that Bob Mayo made I am not much for gimmicks, either But if there's a bank relations problem, as many think there is, it just might be possible that the kind of proposal Bill Poole made can be structured in such a way that we don't give much away but present it to the banks as though we are giving them something when we are taking away lagged reserves His kind of penalty scheme, for example, in terms of the carryover would make it possible to say that we are going to take away lagged reserves but we are going to give banks some flexibility they don't have now And yet if we structure that penalty in the right way, in fact, we're not going to give away much in terms of sloppiness in the reserve figures Looked at in that way--unless, as Chuck says, we get the whole thing solved with the bill--it might be useful to consider a gimmick like that simply as a bank relations vehicle It may be a means to get the advantages and not have the negative bank relations impact that some of us, at least, are concerned about   Thank you, Mr Chairman Like Governor Schultz, I found this a particularly interesting presentation, but I think for a slightly different reason   Without touching that line with a 10-foot pole, I want simply to refer to the very last chart! I think the staff has done us a great service in presenting that because with all the conversation about whether the increase in the CPI is going to be 92 percent or whatever, if you look at that band [depicting the range of error], that's an incredibly large band We talk about the CPI in the fourth quarter and it could be plus or minus some very large numbers While it's useful to go through these exercises to see where we come out, I think we really don't pay as much attention as we should to the enormous uncertainty that attaches to these forecasts We've had some people doing some work at our place--and I don't understand the technical details so I won't take you through it--but let me just give you an example of the kinds of problems one runs into in making  -27-    2/4-5/80  quantitative forecasts If you think of watching a wagon on a TV screen or a movie screen, you'll notice that the wagon is going forward and it looks like the wheels are going backwards The reason for that, of course, is that as the wheel goes forward in the first frame the spoke is up in the center and then it goes forward and it's the second frame before it gets all the way back up to the top again and so on around So, even though the wheel is moving forward, when you take pictures, it looks as if it's moving backwards   You're exactly right It depends on the speed of the projector and the speed with which the wheel is moving Now, let's suppose that decisions are made in continuous time and you take econometric snapshots on a monthly or quarterly basis It could be a matter of pot luck that the speed of the decisionmaking framework and the speed of the projector are the same If they're not, you can actually take a picture that gives you just the opposite view of what's going on We happen to think that in many cases that's exactly what happens We have all these nice pictures that are actually giving us pictures exactly the opposite, in terms of policy implications, of what is going on in the "real world" and how it's functioning I simply say that to indicate that I think we need to be particularly [cautious] at this time, given not only the uncertainties in the world but the uncertainties about the tools that we're working with, about what we think we can even say in terms of the time path for the economy over the next eight quarters   If you press me to the wall, I will I don't think I can say anything with any credibility, but I'll give you numbers anyway And if the numbers turn out to be--   With that great big long caveat that I just gave you, the numbers that we have in terms of real GNP for 1980 are more positive than the staff's We think on balance that there's going to be some very modest positive real growth during 1980 and we tie that in with what we see happening with fiscal policy and slightly stronger business investment I don't quarrel at all with the staff's deflator number or their CPI number If anything, though, given what I just said about defense spending and so on, those numbers might turn out to be low rather than high I also don't quarrel with their unemployment numbers   Yes  -28-    2/4-5/80   Yes, the deficit is understated   But by how much, I--   I think a tax cut would be a disaster   Thank you, Mr Chairman I just couldn't disagree more with some of the comments I have heard and I agree entirely with some others Chuck and I have this running discussion about how we finance nominal GNP He has his view My view is that  -50-    2/4-5/80  if you try to do [it his way], you just chase your tail If in fact there is a relationship between money and inflation, by persistently trying to finance nominal GNP we end up generating more inflation-- even at an accelerating rate--which therefore we have to finance and so on So I would hope we would not take that [route]   That's right Now, what I find most puzzling-- and I will copy one of Fred Schultz's lines, which I always thought was mine, and that is that I have a very simple mind--   I would think, if we agree that the outlook is very uncertain, that rather than arguing for more flexibility we would argue for less That's because if the time pattern of the economy is very unpredictable, then there's no way we can respond to change it in a predictable way and, therefore, we ought not to be responding We ought to respond less rather than more, the greater the uncertainty about the outlook As a consequence, unlike Nancy's and John's earlier suggestion that we do all we can to preserve our flexibility, I would say just the opposite I think we ought to pick a path that we want to follow for the long term and stick to that path as long as we can unless we receive major information that suggests we're way out of [line] for one reason or another Of course, rational expectations would say that even if we got such information, it's not clear we could do anything about it and, therefore, we ought not to respond Having said all that, obviously, I would much prefer the specifications of alternative III That looks like a very large drop for M-1B from [growth of] 8 percent in 1979 to [a range with an upper limit of] 6-1/2 percent in 1980 But the Bluebook says on the previous page that for the last six months M-1B growth has only been 61 percent, so the drop isn't as big as it might appear from the [table] on page 6 So, I would go with alternative III I must say I am in the group that thinks the range is too wide I would be concerned if money [growth] dropped, assuming we are measuring anything corresponding to money, down to 3 percent On the other hand, I would certainly hate to see it above 6 percent So, I'd prefer a narrower range but would not want growth to go above 6 percent on M-1A or 6-1/2 percent on M-1B   But the problem, Mr Chairman, is not the quarter point difference on the midpoint Where people separate is on where they think the bottom ought to be or where the top ought to be And that's why Steve's proposal, I think, will get most of the votes It's not the quarter point difference; it's where one is willing to let it go on one side or the other   But that's precisely why people care so much about either the bottom or the top Even though we may miss, if we're going over the top, that raises the flag a lot faster than if we're still within all the ranges   Take an acceptable vote on alternative III; I think you'll get 9 out of 12  -65-    2/4-5/80    I'd go to 18 and leave the bottom where it is    I would just like to respond to the one question you raised about farm credit  -20-    3/18/80   We have recently done a survey of our country banks and they tell us they are as tight as a drum, and the farmers tell us [the banks] are as tight as a drum Yet we have very few of the country banks trying to pass on those loans to the city banks, which are not tight as a drum When we get behind that, [we find that] they're passing them off like crazy to the PCAs and so on, but they're reluctant to pass them off to their city correspondents simply because the price is so high So it's not really a question of availability in the normal sense, but a question of their unwillingness at least to this point to try to pass those higher rates on to their farm customers who are used to substantially lower rates Now, I don't like the implication of that, in terms of the direction we seem to be going, which is to give preference to small businesses But I think that is the real issue in their mind It's not that the money is not there; it's just that they're unwilling, so far at least, to contract for the higher price  The only other comment I would make is that, like many others, I was disappointed in the movement in the President's program for fiscal 1980 That puts a little extra burden on [monetary policy] for this year Therefore, to the extent that we do err, I think we're going to have to err on the tighter side rather than the easier side For fiscal 1981, I favor the reverse of that If the deficit in fiscal 1980 is around $35 to $40 billion and then in fact [the budget] really does get balanced in fiscal 1981, that's a $35 to $40 billion [swing] in one year That strikes me as a little larger than we've normally accommodated and unnecessarily runs the risk of aggravating whatever recession we're in It's too bad [the effects] weren't evened out a little, with a little more in '80 and a little less in '81 I think that has implications for us in terms of how hard we press during the next few months   Well, the country banks have loaned out about everything they have But typically, now, given the current prime rate, the loans are at below prime, and they're reluctant to pass those on to the city banks   That's right  -21-    3/18/80   What would you do to the funds range?    I promised my wife I'd be quiet today But as long as you've given me the opportunity, I'll just make a few brief comments We had Yoshiho Suzuki from the Bank of Japan in our Bank the other day and asked him to give a speech to some local people It was very interesting to hear him in that speech analyze the Japanese experience where they have wholesale prices, because of oil imports, going up by about 24 percent and the consumer price index going up by about 7 percent They in the Bank of Japan ascribe that to their willingness to hold firmly to fairly stable rates of monetary growth We found that a pleasant message, as you can imagine, in Minneapolis   To some extent, profits have gone down Also they have found reductions in energy utilization being forced by the policy and so on There has also been a cut in real incomes because wages have not adjusted They haven't allowed wages to [rise with inflation]   And 5 percent productivity [growth] That doesn't hurt It's a question of what leads what; and that's a whole other discussion, which I won't take time for The only other thing I'd say, Mr Chairman, is that I've listened to this discussion today with great interest and was particularly interested in the way Chuck posed the issue As we look over the history of what the Committee has done, what the economic profession has done, and what the economy has done, it seems to me that we ought to have very modest objectives because it's not at all clear that we understand in a very detailed way how this complex system of our works and how we can intervene in such a way as to make it work substantially better Therefore, it's a question of trying to minimize perceived risk And it seems to us, given our current state of understanding, that the best thing we can do is to lay out for all the world to see a fairly simple policy procedure, a rule that we're going to follow I think it's very hard to lay out such a rule in terms of interest rates because interest rates are subject to too many variables But we can lay out such a rule in terms of the growth in the aggregates It's not going to get us to heaven; it's going to have some undesirable consequences from time to time But on average monetary policy is probably less disruptive if it is more predictable than otherwise As a consequence, it seems to us that the decision we made last fall was a wise one and we ought to stick to it And we ought to be rigorously consistent about that because at least over time, as the markets come to understand that we are going to be rigorously consistent, we will reduce substantially not only the risk associated with our own policies but the over-reactions that the market sometimes makes to their perception of our policy So, as others have said, if interest rates are going to go down, I think this is one time when we just    4/22/80  ought to let them go down because we've got to make sure that we establish the credibility in the basic policy thrust that we've been following    Minneapolis prefers 10 percent
