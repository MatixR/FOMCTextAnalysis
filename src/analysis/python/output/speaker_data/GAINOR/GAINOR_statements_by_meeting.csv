964,1979-03-20," Mr Chairman, the Ninth District economy has  been very strong and continues strong Our District's unemployment  rate is lower than that for the country, at 44 percent versus 5 8   percent Our help wanted advertising is at a record high in the Twin  Cities area Farm income in our District is up sharply The  inflation rate in the Twin Cities was 11-1/2 percent for the last  year, considerably higher than for the country The only negative  factor in our otherwise positive picture is housing starts; they are  down And at least in Minnesota we're not willing to say that that  isn't weather-related this year    On the national level, we continue to be very  concerned about inflation Of course we're uncertain, as everyone is,  about the impact of the oil shortage, and we don't fully understand  the current state of the monetary aggregates So in view of the  uncertainty about oil, housing, and the aggregates, we would favor  holding the line for this month    Mr Chairman, we would favor alternative B  "
1010,1979-04-27, Fine  
1096,1979-07-17," Mark Willes is not at the Bank This is Tom Gainor and I'll make the remarks   We have not been encouraged by the President's speech nor by the reactions to it We agree with the points that have already been raised that the condition of the economy makes it very difficult for us to take monetary action at the present time I understand the crisis in the international markets, though, and I agree with the comments that have been made that we're in a day- to-day situation here and we should look at it from that basis I would be very glad to see us consider it again tomorrow or the next day if something changes in the international situation We don't favor action at this time "
1118,1979-07-19," Mr Chairman, for the reasons already stated we would favor a 10 percent discount rate and a 10-1/2 percent fed funds rate "
1167,1979-09-18," We prefer an aggregates directive, Mr Chairman,  and we could go with the ranges you prescribed  "
1429,1980-05-20," Mount St Helens has covered the Ninth District with [inorganic] ash but it hasn't wiped us out yet, Mr Chairman We favor adherence, as closely as possible, to the money supply targets set by this Committee previously We think they were reasonable targets in the long-range [plan to reduce] inflation, and we'd like to see them followed We would favor alternative A as a means of getting there and we would widen the range for the funds rate We would favor dissolution of the credit restraint program as early as it can reasonably be done "
1450,1980-06-05, Yes 
1476,1980-07-09," With respect to wages and prices, I agree entirely with Bob Forrestal that the best thing we could do is dismantle the program as soon as possible and I'd recommend that On the issue of a tax cut, we assume a cut of the magnitude projected, around $28 billion We'd prefer that we not have it If we have to have it, though, we'd like it to be deferred, preferably until after the election  With respect to 1980, we favor continuation of the existing ranges, alternative I I think that's consistent with what we told Congress and everyone else earlier in the year and we should follow through on that commitment As to 1981, we favor strategy 2, which supports the concept of an orderly reduction over time in the ranges that we're aiming toward In deference to the point that Ernie made about legislative uncertainty and so on, it's probably better to waffle on how we state our plans for 1981 but I definitely think strategy 2 is the right one "
1502,1980-07-25," And Minneapolis   Minneapolis, too "
2731,1985-02-12," We've come down on the optimistic side of the staff forecast a little higher on GNP and a little lower on the deflator But those who have talked about the agricultural sector are    2/12-13/85  certainly reflecting our views There are serious debt problems; collateral value is falling; and it has become a fairly hot political issue in our District and elsewhere, as you can imagine There are bills in every one of our [state] legislatures to try to provide some relief for the agricultural sector Most deal with ways to moderate the impact of debt service for the farmers And, of course, one of the objectives is to provide some liquidity for spring planting--cash for seed--which is a very serious issue While we don't think it is monetary policy's role to deal with this, monetary policy is not going to be immune in that there is a great deal of sensitivity to interest rates And if rates start to rise, I think perhaps some political pressure that currently is not on the Fed will gravitate toward us So we are concerned about rates in that context   We would line up with those who favor alternative II Our forecast shows very favorable growth, even with that range, and we think it's appropriate   We too would favor alternative B If we were going to fine tune it, however, we would move to the direction of ""C,"" probably to 7-3/4 percent or something like that [for M1] "
4332,1991-10-30," Mr Chairman, we haven't seen anything in our economy that would lead us to do something immediately We think there could be a case for bringing the funds rate down because of slow money growth But that would be the only basis we would see for that Our preference would be to wait until Tuesday's meeting to make a judgment "
4372,1991-12-02," Mr Chairman, this is Tom Gainor in Minneapolis   There's no substantive change here either At our Advisory Council meeting last week, about half reported flat activity and the other half were more optimistic than that Retail sales over the Thanksgiving weekend were affected by a record snowfall, which didn't do much for the retail sales It did do a whole lot for the sales of snow removal equipment! That's the one hot spot in our District One other positive note was that the  did report some pretty good activity in residential building going on in this area "
