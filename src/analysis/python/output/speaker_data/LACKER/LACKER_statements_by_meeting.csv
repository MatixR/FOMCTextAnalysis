5332,2004-08-10,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Fifth District economy expanded at a   somewhat slower pace in July, as manufacturing and retail sales softened but services strengthened    August 10, 2004 63 of 103          In manufacturing, our diffusion index for shipments, just released today, fell last month but remains   in positive territory  The manufacturing employment index was also in the positive range,   consistent with anecdotal reports from the Carolinas, where much of our manufacturing industry is   concentrated  Job losses due to plant closings in textiles and furniture continue but have been offset   recently by job gains at new plants and plant expansions in other manufacturing industries  Our   new orders index for manufacturing picked up in July, though, suggesting some improvement   ahead  And manufacturers tell us that prices paid accelerated in July; they complained about price   increases for raw materials, particularly for steel and copper    Turning to our index for service firms, revenue was strongly positive again in July,   indicating continued strong growth in the Fifth District service sector in recent weeks  In contrast,   our survey indicated that retail sales revenue slowed, and many store managers are reporting slack   sales  A senior officer at a large bank in our District reported strong demand for credit in the   midlevel corporate market and positive consumer credit quality trends  Contacts in the DC area   noted that the commercial real estate market here has gone from “good to white hot”  An executive   at a national media company reported extremely strong TV ad revenues for the first half of the year,   even excluding political advertising, which is very strong this year  Last week, though, she reported   a pause in forward momentum for the third quarter, but she said that the industry remains optimistic   for the fourth quarter   Turning to the national economy, I was disappointed, too, by the weakness in the payroll   employment reports  Those data, along with the softness in consumer spending, have elevated my   concern about the downside risks going forward  At this point, though, I share the Greenbook’s   view that these negative developments are likely to be reversed before too long, for reasons that   many people have gone into around the table and I won’t repeat here  Moreover, the change in the   August 10, 2004 64 of 103          corporate profit numbers due to the annual NIPA revisions suggests that markups are less elevated   than we once thought  As a result, the risk of disinflation due to a more-rapid-than-expected decline   in markups now seems lower   Furthermore, the moderation in core inflation measures of late suggests a diminished risk of   a protracted rise in inflation  Consumer inflation has continued to increase, given higher food and   energy prices, but the fact that inflation expectations have fallen somewhat since the spring, in spite   of the rise in overall inflation, supports the view that inflation will remain contained  All in all, I   think there’s good reason to believe that the economy will work through this difficult period and   move toward a balanced expansion in product and labor markets with stable prices   On the whole, I still think the most dangerous risk that we’ve faced so far this year has been   the apprehension of financial markets about the Fed’s falling behind in raising the funds rate  I   believe the Committee was correct last spring to keep financial markets calm by communicating its   intentions to lift the funds rate target this year and next  That message showed markets that we   recognized the risk of inflation and that we would give appropriate priority to price stability  I also   think that our follow-through in raising the funds rate in June and in indicating our intention to take   another step today were necessary to sustain the credibility of that commitment   It was always possible that we might receive some disappointing data after we began raising   the funds rate, and it turned out we did, but I think we should follow through today for several   reasons  First, the market has already eased policy for us by reducing the speed at which it expects   us to raise the funds rate  Second, not to follow through would risk undermining the credibility   against inflation we have been working to maintain  Given that credibility, we can always ease   policy quickly and substantially—should the weakness in the economy develop into something   August 10, 2004 65 of 103                                                            3 The materials used by Mr Madigan are appended to this transcript (appendix 3)   more serious—by signaling our intention to draw out the pace of the funds rate increase  Thank   you    "
5333,2004-08-10,"  I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman  I think it is appropriate   that we maintain a high hurdle as we go forward before skipping a beat  I believe this measured   August 10, 2004 80 of 103          approach is important, as Governor Bernanke said, to maintain the credibility of our commitment   against inflation  Even with a few more soft patches as we go forward, I think that’s going to be the   ever-present danger in the near term   I also share your opposition to including the phrase “sustainable growth” in the last   sentence, but for a slightly different reason  The way it is worded there makes it sort of a twin pillar   of our obligations  We have moved over the last few years to recognizing a difference between our   desire for price stability and our desire for sustainable growth, and I wouldn’t like that difference to   be eroded or fuzzed up in the public’s mind  "
5382,2004-09-21,"  The way we operate, Dino is asked to supply reserves against two   different demand curves—a maintenance period demand curve and a daily demand curve  And   there’s a yield curve relationship within a maintenance period that ties the daily rates together    To ask him to make the funds rate do this step function I think is asking a lot  That would be   September 21, 2004 10 of 100          asking him to disrupt markets to some extent on a day-to-day basis, pushing against the fear of   overdraft and the fear of lock-in on the part of banks  That doesn’t seem to make sense to me   either  To Vincent’s point, the fed funds futures market builds in an expectation of this step   function  What we’re asking Dino to do is not to fight against that  We’re not asking him to tip   our hand; we’re asking him to go along with what the yield curve says about what the rate is   going to do after the meeting  I don’t see that as prejudicing the Committee’s discretion   "
5383,2004-09-21,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Economic growth in the Fifth District   softened further in recent weeks, but we don’t see any indications that the expansion is off track    Manufacturing shipments and orders continue to expand, although manufacturing employment   appears to be flat or declining in our District  Retail activity in our region has been soft lately,   consistent with the national figures  Outside the retail service sector, activity has been flat   overall since August, but our District continues to outpace the nation in residential construction    We’re hearing complaints about the cost of construction materials, and the scarcity of heavy-  equipment operators appears to be limiting construction work in some areas  More broadly,   while our directors and other contacts report expanding economic activity across a variety of   sectors, there is a lingering sense of unease about the pace of this recovery  Several contacts say   that firms are reluctant to add workers, and many attribute this to concerns about the   continuation of the recovery   September 21, 2004 48 of 100          Turning to the national economy, in spite of the encouraging net job growth in August   and the upward revisions to the data for the two previous months, the September Greenbook has   written down expected job growth this year from what was anticipated in August The end-of-  year output gap is correspondingly a couple of tenths wider than in the prior projection, and   there’s a commensurate reduction in the expected path for core consumer prices both this year   and next  I think it’s reasonable to project that the labor market will gradually improve and that   the output gap will close by the end of 2006, helped along by a less aggressive rise in the funds   rate as built into the Greenbook forecast  That said, though, I think that the recent data have   clouded the picture enough to suggest substantial downside risk in the outlook  Evidently we’re   not returning just yet to the growth rates that we had been anticipating prior to the recent soft   patch  Thus, some markdown in the expected funds rate path seems warranted   Much of the financial market nervousness about inflation evident earlier in the year   seems to have receded  Nevertheless, financial markets still expect a funds rate about 75 basis   points higher by the end of 2006 than does the Greenbook  That expectation continues to keep   long-term interest rates higher than they otherwise would be  The Greenbook anticipates that   long rates will come down as we follow through and raise the funds rate on the expected path   The result is something of a central banker’s dream—a rising policy rate accompanied by falling   long rates  However, should the economy truly need the greater stimulus assumed in the   Greenbook, we should be alert to other possibilities in the period ahead  Markets might again   get more nervous about inflation, and long rates might rise rather than fall as we indicate a less   aggressive rate of increase in the funds rate  Clearly, that would be counterproductive   Accordingly, I think we should be cautious about sending such signals  We could well   find that our credibility for low inflation is sufficiently secure that signaling our intention to   September 21, 2004 49 of 100          move the funds rate up less aggressively succeeds in lowering long rates and stimulating the   economy  On the other hand, we might be unpleasantly surprised  "
5384,2004-09-21,"  I support your recommendation, particularly about the last sentence of   the statement  "
5440,2004-11-10,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Fifth District economy continued to   expand in recent weeks  Manufacturing growth continues but seems to be slowing a bit  Our   shipments index fell somewhat but remains solidly in positive territory  The new orders index,   however, slid toward a neutral reading, and our manufacturing employment index remains at   neutral as well  Many contacts in manufacturing continue to comment on higher material prices  A   manager at Rohm and Haas in North Carolina noted ethylene and propylene price increases, but   said he was holding the line on his product prices  And a GE manager in South Carolina noted   increases in raw material prices but said prices for the turbines he produced were rising even faster   Our most recent survey still indicates strong growth in revenues and employment in the   service sector  Retail activity appears to have slowed since the end of the period covered in our   Beige Book report  Big ticket sales in particular seem to have been weak in recent weeks, and most   November 10, 2004 37 of 107    of the auto dealers we surveyed said sales were down  One of our directors in the energy business   said that in his view energy prices were unsustainably high, and he cited several factors that he   thought indicated they’d be coming down significantly soon  He also reported that many CEOs he   knew were complaining about the expenditures required to comply with Sarbanes–Oxley; they   thought it was a major drag on the economy  In particular, he noted a scarcity of the skilled   personnel necessary to implement those systems  A North Carolina banker said that, although there   are pockets of negativity, his contacts generally thought the business outlook was good there  And   a contact in West Virginia reported that railroad shipping is a significant problem for the coal   industry  He cited scarcity of labor in that sector   Turning to the national economy, the October jobs report shows healthier employment   growth since the summer, and this suggests greater strength in the labor market than we had   previously supposed  Aggregate hours are already more than ½ percentage point above the third-  quarter average, and the steadily increasing growth in average hourly earnings that has been in train   for months evidently continued into October  The rise in both hours and wages gives a welcome   boost to personal income, and that should help support strong growth in consumer spending going   forward  Rising wages together with slower productivity growth have pushed the growth in unit   labor costs up to or even above the rate of inflation recently so that the disinflation risk continues to   abate  All told, with inflation and inflation expectations well anchored, the economy appears to be   doing noticeably better than it seemed at the time of our last meeting  And if the economy   maintains its strength, we will need to continue to let the funds rate rise   As I see it, we are likely to be balancing two related concerns going forward  First, there’s   the continuing weakness in business investment spending relative to what we might have expected,   given the strong cash flows and low interest rates we’ve seen this year  Because of this, I think we   are likely to want to keep our real interest rate increases to a measured pace  However, market   November 10, 2004 38 of 107    participants expect us to raise the funds rate faster than the Greenbook projects is necessary to   maintain price stability  The discrepancy between market expectations and the Greenbook forecast   suggests a second concern that we might at some point fall behind the curve, as it were, in   tightening monetary policy   If the job market gains momentum in coming months and suspicions about the   sustainability of the recovery recede, real inflationary pressures could well develop  In that case, we   would want to act decisively to preempt any uptick in inflation rather than await an uptick and then   react, and I presume we would do so  But even if inflation remains perfectly stable, we will need to   let the real interest rate rise as the economy gains strength  We shouldn’t let stable inflation   expectations lull us into adjusting the equilibrium real rate less rapidly than is required to resist a   real boom-and-bust cycle such as we saw in the late ’90s  In the current case, it will be difficult to   discern when and how much interest rate tightening will be necessary in the period ahead, just as it   was then  But above all, we don’t want to encourage the belief that we signal a steeper expected   funds rate path only in response to tangible signs of shifting inflation expectations because our   ultimate goal is to eliminate such shifts  "
5441,2004-11-10,"  I agree with your proposal, Mr Chairman, about raising the rate and about   the statement  My own sense is that the funds rate is more likely to lie on the path of the market’s   forecast than that in the Greenbook, and I don’t think it’s the right time to pull down the yield   curve  With regard to our statement, I agree with Governor Bernanke that we shouldn’t be looking   to turn back the hands of time and increase the variance in the market’s forecast for the future fed   funds rate  "
5495,2004-12-14,"  I strongly support expedited release for a lot of the reasons that Governor   Kohn and others have expressed  I have a general predilection toward more transparency; the more   information in the markets, the better  I just want to make three points  One is that bringing this   information out earlier in time would resolve uncertainty earlier  If we see any market reaction to   this, for the most part it would just represent a shift in the timing of market volatility  It doesn’t   seem to me likely that on net, in any global sense, it’s going to add any market volatility  So we   shouldn’t let the magnitude of perceived market reactions dissuade us or give us second thoughts   down the road  The second point I want to make is that I do see this as alleviating some of the   pressure on the Committee with regard to the drafting of the statement  But, Cathy, I think this cuts   both ways  After expedited release of the minutes, the statement will stand as the Committee’s   latest communication for only three weeks  To some extent, that could make it easier to   communicate and agree on phrasing rather than harder, since only three weeks are at stake rather   than an entire intermeeting period  I agree with Don  I wouldn’t want to see the extent of the   communication we do in the statement cut down  Finally, there’s one tiny detail that I hesitate to   bring up, but it sort of surprised me  If it were up to me, I’d like to see it changed  Apparently, it’s   the tradition that nonmembers’ policy statements are excluded from the minutes as they’re written    Now, I don’t remember ever noticing this before, and I can’t remember seeing it in the orientation   package I got  [Laughter]     Which one?     Mr Chairman, let me just say a couple of things  First, there is this   mechanism for distinguishing between members and nonmembers  So a view about policy could   easily be attributed to a nonmember  Second, many statements about the economy by members as   well as by other participants seem integrally linked with their statements about policy  Today’s   meeting, I think, was an excellent example of that  Third, I view the purpose of the minutes as a   means to communicate to the public the deliberations that occurred at the meeting, rather than the   deliberations of the Committee—   December 14, 2004 90 of 118             Well, that’s a different philosophy; I’ll grant that     May I ask a clarifying question?      Vincent, in the discussion in the minutes that refers to the first part of the   meeting on the outlook, where you use the terms “most,” “many,” and “several,” is the   denominator—  "
5496,2004-12-14,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Fifth District economy continued to   expand at a moderate pace in recent weeks  Our service firms reported solid growth in revenues   over the last two months, while retailers told us that sales have been flat  In particular, big ticket   sales remain weak, and car sales are said to be soft   District manufacturers reported that growth in shipments and new orders have tailed off over   the last month  Shipments were basically flat in November  Although building permits were off the   pace of a year ago, housing markets remained generally strong in our District  In labor markets, our   information indicates job gains in services and retail but virtually unchanged manufacturing   employment in November  Price increases at District firms have trended higher, though they are   generally remaining under 2 percent, according to our contacts  There was a notable change in the   tone in manufacturing firms regarding pricing, however  They are now increasingly saying that   they can pass through price increases to their customers, unlike earlier in the year when they said   price increases were more difficult to pass along   Turning to the national picture, data received in recent weeks also indicate that economic   recovery has continued at a reasonably healthy pace  Consumer spending has advanced at a pretty   December 14, 2004 37 of 118           solid trend rate in recent months, capital spending has been fairly brisk, and housing keeps coming   in on the strong side  Every passing month of growth at this pace raises my confidence in the   staying power of the expansion  The Greenbook expects real GDP to expand around 3½ to 4   percent through 2006, and the output gap is expected to close gradually by then, with PCE inflation   remaining stable around 1½ percent  This is a relatively attractive outlook, and it’s one I’m   comfortable subscribing to   I was particularly relieved to see the elimination of the disconnect that was in the November   Greenbook between the staff’s projection and market expectations regarding the future path of the   federal funds rate  Since the November meeting, that disconnect has been resolved through an   increase of about ½ percentage point in the Greenbook’s projected rate path, putting it only a little   below market expectations of the future funds rate  This was a favorable way of closing the gap,   since it was accompanied by an upward revision in expected growth in the Greenbook and reflects   more confidence in the strength of the recovery going forward     Another disconnect remains, however, that eventually must be resolved  The Greenbook   sees CPI inflation leveling off at about 1¾ percent in 2006, and yet the Greenbook also reports   survey estimates of ten-year-ahead expected CPI inflation in the 2½ to 3 percent range  Moreover,   the Bluebook reports expectations measures of between 2½ and 3 percent based on inflation-  indexed Treasury spreads  So it seems that a range of measures are telling us that inflation will be   noticeably greater than we think it will be  This inflation disconnect will be resolved eventually one   way or another, as I said  We may get lucky and see market expectations drift down to a level   consistent with 1¾ percent on the CPI, or we may not be so lucky   One interpretation of the persistence of inflation expectations at these levels is that the   public believes that our long-run tolerance range for CPI inflation extends up to 3 percent or more    December 14, 2004 38 of 118           If that’s the case, it may be difficult for us to resist an upward drift in inflation as the economy   recovers  Moreover, we can’t be sure that expected inflation won’t drift up still further, if actual   inflation begins to drift up  But if we’re unwilling to tolerate CPI inflation near 3 percent, then we   may need to maintain tighter monetary policy than otherwise to ensure that the disconnect between   the public’s expectation of inflation and ours is resolved in our favor  Thank you  "
5497,2004-12-14,"  I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman  I’m happy to finish the   year holding the all-time Committee record for highest fraction of meetings at which I’ve raised   interest rates  [Laughter]  "
5553,2005-03-22," I’ll pass    Thank you, Mr Chairman  In recent weeks, we have received evidence of   a continuation in the slowing growth in our District that we noted in our Beige Book report  Retail   sales, which in the Beige Book were reported as having leveled off, began declining in early March   by our indicators A slump in big-ticket sales has evidently dragged down retail activity in recent   weeks District manufacturing activity continued to expand but at a slower pace than in February    Our March diffusion index, to be released this morning, came in at about neutral, which is down a   bit from February   Interestingly, hardly any of our textile and apparel industry contacts are citing the surge in   imports from China as an important factor for them  Their reports on shipment trends are fairly   evenly split between expanding and declining We continue to receive reports of substantially   higher raw materials prices across an array of industries     The housing market remains quite strong in several areas in our District  Concerns over so-  called bubble conditions are widespread among our real estate contacts, especially in Northern   Virginia and in coastal areas, although prices seem to have topped out in several high-end coastal   communities                                   March 22, 2005 39 of 116  In banking, the CEO of a community bank operating in North Carolina and the western   portion of Virginia said business is as strong as train smoke  Not being very familiar with train   smoke, I asked him how strong a reading that represented  He noted about the only thing stronger   was battery acid [Laughter]   Turning to the national picture, the economy looks noticeably stronger today than it did at   the end of January The Greenbook now estimates that real GDP grew at 43 percent in the fourth   quarter of last year, substantially higher than the previously estimated 35 percent  First-quarter real   GDP growth has been revised up substantially Expected future real GDP growth is essentially   unchanged And there is little revision to the path of potential output over the forecast period The   slowly improving labor market suggests that the output gap is still on track to continue diminishing   in the near future     On the inflation front, unit labor costs continue to be well behaved The recent spurt in   energy and import prices has elevated the overall indexes, but any spillover into the core indexes   seems likely to abate  So I’d expect core PCE inflation to return to near 1½ percent after not too   long   The Greenbook forecast is conditioned on a path for the fed funds rate 50 basis points higher   than in January, a path that nearly matches the market’s expectation over the forecast horizon  All in   all, I think this is a good outlook In my view the most likely risk is that inflation expectations will   be driven higher—by a more sustained increase in oil prices, by a sharper depreciation of the dollar,   or by a more rapid closing of the output gap than we expect   The most worrisome evidence of rising inflation expectations is the change in market   measures of near-term inflation compensation  For example, the TIPS five-year inflation   compensation, which has been drifting up fitfully over the past year or so, has increased by about a                             March 22, 2005 40 of 116  third of a percentage point since the last FOMC meeting  We would expect large oil price increases   to generate some movement in these compensation measures based on anticipations of pass-through   to consumer energy prices  So the recent increase in the five-year TIPS spread may reflect merely a   sort of expected arithmetical pipeline of future CPI increases  And, consistent with this, chart 1 of   the Bluebook shows that a substantial portion of the increase is attributable to the first year of the   five-year horizon and that compensation for years four and five hasn’t moved much   On the other hand, the Bluebook also shows that significant increases have occurred over the   intermeeting period in forward inflation compensation two and three years out, and these movements   seem hard to rationalize based on the current pipeline effects alone  Of course, these expectations   pertain to the headline CPI figure, which is going to be elevated only temporarily above core   inflation, I think Indeed, the Greenbook calls for core CPI inflation to remain anchored at close to 2   percent, and that’s a projection I’m quite comfortable with   All this suggests that inflation expectations, although they have been creeping up, are not yet   a problem  We’ll have to adapt our plans, however, if inflation expectations behave in a way that is   inconsistent with our intentions We can start by making sure that our behavior is not exacerbating   the problem     The public learned from the minutes of our February meeting that we had deferred   specifying a quantitative target range for inflation That left open the question of how much more   inflation we would be willing to tolerate If we’re not willing to specify a numerical target or upper   bound for inflation, then we should find some other way to signal our determination to hold the line   on inflation somewhere, preferably before that line is crossed  Thank you  "
5554,2005-03-22," There’s something highly ironic about this whole discussion to me  We   initially introduced the balance-of-risk statement in order to communicate about the direction of   policy without talking explicitly about interest rates or policy We were relying on this sort of   simple version of a policy rule whereby the public could generally decode what we were talking   about Then in 2003 we hit a problem because we had both rising real growth and falling inflation,   and we needed to disentangle it into two different parts After that, we trumped it with another   statement that is now widely seen as conveying the real information about the direction of policy    So the balance of risks is seen as communicating about the direction of the economy and, ironically,   we’re putting “policy” into the balance-of-risk statement in order to clarify its meaning about the   economy    Mr Chairman, where I was going on this was to say that we have the   minutes now to convey in a rich format what we view as the likely direction of the economy and of   policy I think we’re having trouble with this, and we are going to have trouble with this—and I   don’t have any view about whether now or May is the right time to change the language—because   we’re placing more weight on the balance-of-risk statement    The ultimate place I was going was to suggest that sometime soon we   consider dropping this whole statement    I hope that is the decision As for the balance-of-risk assessment, I don’t   think we need it in the statement  I don’t think it serves any purpose    I, too, support your policy recommendation, Mr Chairman, and I can   support the language in alternative B for now Also, I didn’t realize I was under an obligation to   communicate about the language before the meeting, and I apologize for confusing the meeting in   that regard   I don’t think that we ought to pull information of a forward-looking nature out of the   statement on net, but I made the suggestion I did about returning to the balance-of-risk assessment   statement, because my sense is that what’s labeled line 6 here is really bearing the weight of   conveying our sense about the future And I wouldn’t want to reduce the statement if it meant less   transparency and a less forthcoming communication with the public   I would point out that with this addition of the phrase “appropriate monetary policy action”   we’ve essentially put the nail in the coffin in the original version of the statement  It now decidedly   conveys no information about policy except that we want it to be appropriate, which presumably   everyone always knew [Laughter]   Let me just comment about alternative C  We’re in this evolving economy and   communicating with the public, and we expect certain reactions of them and they expect us to have   policy evolve and react in a certain way Alternative C is a zero probability event, and I’m not quite   sure I see the value of communicating by describing a counterfactual future that is so far from   reality I think we can find other ways to convey a sense of what looks likely to us going forward  "
5601,2005-05-03," On balance, after hitting a soft patch in March, economic activity in the   Fifth District appears to have bounced back somewhat in April  The improvement was centered in   manufacturing and retailing, where modest growth replaced flat activity in March  Services firms,   meanwhile, continued to report the moderate growth we’ve seen over the last several months   District manufacturers suggest that demand generally remained solid, and many indicate that   they’ve successfully passed through higher energy and materials costs  Our shipments and new   orders indexes both moved up for April  Most of our manufacturing contacts say that they do not   plan to reduce capital spending in coming months and that they remain reasonably optimistic about   future prospects  The exception to this picture is, as usual, in the textile, apparel, and furniture   industries that compete directly with Chinese producers  They continue to complain of a lack of   pricing power, and their capital spending is generally limited to maintaining rather than expanding   capacity Our index of manufacturing wages continues to firm even though the employment index                                    May 3, 2005 29 of 116  weakens The wage gains are being reported in higher-skilled industries, however, while it is   elsewhere in the sector that workers are being shed   The recent bounce in retail sales in the Fifth District appears to be centered in big-ticket   items  In our April survey, big-ticket sales posted their strongest reading since July 2003 Sharp   upticks were registered in retail employment and wages as well  Housing activity remains solid in   our District Home sales are strong in most areas and quite robust in some, including my own   neighborhood where I received six offers in one day on my house!   On the inflation front, our April survey suggests that price pressures remain contained,   though the rate of increase in prices paid by manufacturers edged higher  We continue to hear   concerns about having to pay higher energy prices, and a few producers also complain that higher   energy costs are dampening consumer demand   Turning to the national picture, the data we’ve received since March have been   disappointing on both the real side and inflation The slowing in the real side has been broad-based,   and although it has been relatively mild overall, the deceleration in capital spending is particularly   disappointing given the expectation that business investment would generally drive this expansion    On inflation, core PCE inflation continues to move up  The latest report shows it at a 29 percent   annual rate over the last three months, considerably above the 17 percent rate over the twelve   months to March  If this situation were to persist, it would present a classic dilemma for monetary   policy weakening real growth and rising inflation   At this point, however, there are good reasons to think that it will not First, the economic   fundamentals underlying this recovery appear sound  Prospects for growth in real household income   look good, and, although capital spending may not soon replicate last year’s strong pace, investment   prospects look reasonably good as well As a result, I share the Greenbook’s view that the soft patch                                    May 3, 2005 30 of 116  should be temporary  The Fifth District reports of a rebound in April that I mentioned earlier are   consistent with this view as well   Second, weak real data did not change the Board staff’s estimate of potential output  Instead,   the Greenbook forecast has a more protracted narrowing of the output gap, with a significantly wider   gap still near 1 percent to the end of 2006 It seems reasonable to believe that this wider output gap   will help push core PCE [personal consumption expenditures] inflation back below 2 percent, and   this view gets some support from the gratifying fact that TIPS [Treasury inflation-protected   securities] inflation compensation has declined a bit since March, both for the first five years out and   the five years after that  Moreover, market participants expect inflation to remain that well   contained even with about ¼ percentage point less of expected tightening by the end of 2006 than   had been foreseen as of March That raises the likelihood that actual and expected inflation can be   contained without the aggressive type of funds tightening that has been needed to do so in the past   One might think that with eight weeks to go until the next meeting and with the possibility of   the soft patch expiring soon and removing the dampening effect on out-year inflation expectations,   we run the risk of being overtaken by events and rising inflation pressures  I tend to think, however,   that market participants understand our preferences well enough that the yield curve will react   sensitively to the data should inflation risks pick up We should be sure that our communications   don’t inhibit that process  "
5602,2005-05-03," I have a comment on process  I appreciate the earlier distribution of Table   1, which is a procedure we decided on at the last meeting  On reflection, I’d like to register some   reservations about it It has the effect of shifting substantive deliberations out of the Committee, and   it prevents us as Committee members from benefiting from the reasoning and thoughts of our   colleagues on the FOMC We don’t know what other members are communicating during the   period leading up to the meeting  I’m not sure exactly the right way to get around this, and I hope   we can revisit this topic sometime soon  But one possibility would be to have members submit their   suggested changes to Table 1 in writing Then, after the close of some suitable comment period, the   staff could distribute those suggestions so that we could glean what people are thinking when they   suggest changes to the language rather than having to reverse engineer via exegesis    I support 25 basis points and alternative B I agree that we should not   soften the statement at this meeting  And in fact, when I read alternative B, I interpreted it as   tightening somewhat by removing the statement about energy prices not having fed notably through                                    May 3, 2005 97 of 116  to core consumer prices  If anything, I was leaning toward a tighter statement, but I think   alternative B would serve us well right now   I want to again endorse President Yellen’s notion that we should look for an occasion to   remove the balance-of-risk assessment from the statement at the earliest opportunity  We can be   clear about what we are doing; I think it is hindering communication now  I also agree with her with   regard to President Poole’s memo  Unavoidably, we are communicating to the markets  And to   expect to do so by devising formulaic language that is going to last beyond a couple of meetings is   too optimistic on that score, I think   I also want to note that on the idea of an exit strategy I agree with you that it’s pretty hard to   envision a statement to accompany no rate change that would also induce markets to believe that   we’re sure to increase rates at the next meeting  I don’t care that much about the shape of the yield   curve between now and six months out, and I would prefer raising rates at the first meeting and not   at the second So, I think putting a fine point on it doesn’t make sense   Now, having said that, when we do get to a point where we pause, I think it’s going to be   important not to drain the sensitivity out of the yield curve  We do not want to convince markets   that we think we’re going to be done for several quarters or for a couple of years  We want to   maintain in markets some sensitivity to incoming data—to believe that we might move ¼ point   either way on the funds rate And because of that I’ve tried to avoid using the term “neutral” to   characterize the rate at which we will stop moving, but there are other approaches to that I suppose    So, again, I can support what’s on the table  "
5645,2005-08-09," Yes, I have a question and a comment  The question is whether the   revision in the nonmarket core PCE price index should cause people to revise the number they   carry around in their heads for the documented upward bias in the PCE    I was asking if this corrects any known sources of bias  If you’re   looking for sources of bias and document them, and this doesn’t affect any of those, then it   strikes me that it shouldn’t change our notion of the upward bias, right?    We should still think it’s X    All right Thanks My comment has to do with your line of questioning,   Mr Chairman  It doesn’t seem to me from the models I’m aware of that reaching that wall, as   you put it, has to result in an acceleration of nominal things as opposed to real things, which   would accelerate The late ’90s seems to me a good example where our credibility—the way we                                August 9, 2005 26 of 110  were expected to conduct monetary policy—allowed that link to be broken  Is that consistent   with your interpretation of the ’90s, Mr Chairman?    Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Incoming economic data since our last   meeting have been consistent with a reasonably paced recovery and well-contained inflation    Payroll employment has been solid  It has even accelerated a bit lately, indicating steady   improvement in overall labor market conditions  The ISM [Institute for Supply Management],   industrial production, retail sales, and durable goods orders all came in stronger than anticipated,   and the GDP report exceeded what was expected in the June Greenbook   The recent strength in business investment bodes well, I think, for the ability of that   sector to take the baton from the housing market should it wane  For now, though, households   seem confident enough in future income prospects to continue to expand spending, particularly   on durable goods and housing Thus, the outlook for the remainder of the year is brighter now,   and the Greenbook has marked up second-half real GDP by ¼ point                                 August 9, 2005 41 of 110  Our information on the Fifth District’s economy is broadly consistent with the national   outlook Retail sales picked up markedly in July, as shopper traffic and big-ticket indicators both   rose significantly Employment growth in the sector seemed to moderate last month, however,   unlike the national figure In the service sector outside of retail, revenue growth picked up and   employment continued to expand at a steady pace   Manufacturing shipments rose modestly in July, but new orders declined  Excluding the   ailing textile industry, things look much better but still registered a bit of a slowdown in July    Employment in manufacturing continues to decline  Our surveys indicate that price pressures   remain well contained in our District in both the manufacturing and service sectors  And the   housing market in our District remains quite robust   In response to the stronger real outlook, the yield curve has shifted up significantly  The   10-year Treasury yield has risen over 40 basis points since just before the June meeting, and the   5-year yield rose 47 basis points as of a couple of days ago Market participants are now   expecting substantially more tightening this year and next year—an assessment with which the   Greenbook concurs The federal funds rate is now expected to reach 4¼ percent by mid-2006,   an upward revision of about 50 basis points since our last meeting   In comparison, inflation expectations have been remarkably stable  Inflation   compensation, as measured from the TIPS [Treasury inflation-protected securities] curve, has   increased only 5 basis points at the 10-year horizon since the June meeting and has actually   fallen at the 5-year horizon—and this despite the fact that oil prices have risen substantially on   net   It’s quite striking that the stronger real outlook over the intermeeting period has led to   higher expected real interest rates and little change in expected inflation  Stable inflation                   August 9, 2005 42 of 110  expectations are obviously a good thing, although they are stabilized right now at the upper end   of my comfort zone and I’d be happier if they were ½ point lower  What’s really impressive,   though, is the public’s belief that we will move the funds rate by whatever amount necessary to   prevent stronger real prospects from showing through to future inflation  Our past behavior and   communications evidently have given people a fair amount of confidence that we will allow   short-term real rates to fluctuate as needed in response to changing fundamentals     This, Mr Chairman, was the idea behind the question I asked you earlier  The issue is   whether the economy might be able to withstand fluctuations in capacity utilization or the output   gap, or however we measure it, without necessarily having these real relative price changes that   are naturally going to occur in that circumstance pass through to overall inflation  This implies,   however, a fairly flexible outlook for policy rates, even if market measures of expected inflation   do not move around very much  I think one of the most important challenges we are going to   face over the next year or so will be to preserve and enhance this confidence the public has in the   responsiveness of policy to evolving economic fundamentals  Thank you  "
5646,2005-08-09," I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman  I’m relatively agnostic   on language, though I slightly prefer President Poole’s suggestion on section number four  If I   were going to put my two cents in, I might suggest adding something along the lines of an   “unwelcome further rise in inflation,” but I’ll wait  "
5690,2005-09-20," Yes I want to ask you about the effects of Hurricane Katrina on output    and potential output You read off a list of effects  Obviously, there has been some destruction   of capital stock Workers have been displaced; there has been a break in relationships between   them and their employers, and obviously there will be some sort of search process to reconnect   them with the labor market  And then there are the transportation disruptions  Those all seem to   me like factors that affect productive capacity, and I would have expected them to appear as   changes in potential output So I’m curious as to why output changes by more than potential    Well, the reason I ask has to do with high-frequency movements  You   used the word “structural” there, which tends to be associated with slowly moving trends—   variables with bars over them or that kind of thing  And in an instance like this, I think a key   factor is the extent to which some high-frequency or rapid change in productive capacities may   have taken place  So, I question sort of letting it all be in the output gap and then saying, “Well,   in two quarters the output gap will be back to where it was”  Given the way the output gap   appears in theoretical models that we use to teach people how to think about policy, this would                               September 20, 2005 18 of 117  invite them to think about policy in the current period differently than if the empirical estimate   had potential changing fairly sharply along with output in the current period  That’s the reason I   ask    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Fifth District economic activity appears to   have expanded at a quicker pace from mid-August through mid-September  For the most part,   production and sales in our area were not substantially affected by Hurricane Katrina  Shipments   from District factories accelerated from August’s modest upturn, and new orders grew for the   first time since May  Service firms reported faster growth in their revenues, and they maintained   the moderate pace of hiring seen in early August  Retailers told us that overall sales grew   modestly Labor market conditions remained solid, with District job growth maintaining the   moderate pace of recent months   Hurricane Katrina had relatively few real effects in our area, as I said, causing only some   scattered and short-lived outages of gasoline and interrupting raw materials shipments to a small   number of manufacturing firms  In addition, higher gasoline prices, combined with fears of   availability, seemed to curtail tourist activity over the Labor Day weekend  Another hurricane,                            September 20, 2005 61 of 117  Ophelia, battered the Carolina coast last week, but preliminary assessments suggest it was not   any more damaging than the typical, run-of-the-mill hurricane    While several of our contacts tell us that higher fuel costs will squeeze profit margins, the   majority tell us that they are passing on cost increases to their customers  Many firms report that   customers are more receptive to price hikes in the current environment  With about half the   responses in as of yesterday morning, preliminary results from our September business surveys   are showing that both prices paid and prices received are rising at a quicker pace than in August,   and expected price trends have generally ratcheted up as well    Turning to the national picture, the Greenbook’s forecasts for output and its components   appear broadly consistent with private forecasters and with what we were hearing from our Fifth   District contacts Prior to Katrina, the economy was growing at a reasonably strong pace but   with some signs of inflation pressures rising from elevated oil prices  And the real effects of the   hurricane that are projected in the Greenbook forecast appear quite plausible, given the   difficulties of assessing the temporal extent of the disruptions to economic activity   But on the inflation side, the Greenbook forecast paints a picture that I find somewhat   distressing The staff’s inflation forecast has been steadily drifting up over time—as shown, for   example, in the fine new table on page 21  [Laughter]  And it was revised up markedly for this   meeting  Core PCE inflation is near 2½ percent throughout 2006 and does not fall below 2   percent until 2007 Inflation expectations move upward as well, which causes growth in   compensation and unit labor costs to step up significantly at the beginning of next year  This   would put inflation appreciably beyond a range I view as consistent with price stability                            September 20, 2005 62 of 117  While the real, quantitative effects of the hurricane are uncertain at this time and may   prove more moderate than first feared, the qualitative implications for short-term real rates seem   quite clear to me  A real interest rate is, of course, the price of current resources relative to   forgone future resources, and for a number of reasons Katrina has caused a temporary scarcity of   current resources A portion of the capital stock in the affected region has been destroyed or   damaged, and workers have been separated from employers  It will inevitably take time and   resources to rebuild the capital stock and reestablish productive labor market matches   The good news is that these effects are likely to be relatively short-lived  Within a year   or so, we are likely to be back to more or less where we would have been in the aggregate  But   this means that, if anything, Katrina should cause real interest rates to rise to encourage   adjustment to the temporary scarcity of current resources  The fiscal response to the disaster   points in the same direction regarding real rates  The sustainability of federal deficits was   questionable prior to Hurricane Katrina, and the spending amounts being proposed for hurricane   recovery efforts just strengthen the case for tighter policy   I think we have to be careful about reasoning on the basis of the gap between current   output and estimates of potential output  Some estimates appear to identify the decline in   potential primarily with a small estimated effect of lost capital  Such approaches see the supply-  side effects of Katrina as minimal and, therefore, interpret most of the decline in output as a   shock to aggregate demand   This makes it tempting to a naive policymaker to consider counteracting the   macroeconomic effects with easier policy  But all of the real resource effects of Katrina of                            September 20, 2005 63 of 117  which I’m aware amount to reductions in our current capacity to produce goods and services    Lower real interest rates can do little to counteract these reductions   I think we should be careful about the widely cited analogy in the public press to the   1970s when oil supply shocks were subsequently followed by recessions  I say this recognizing   that several participants around the table were somewhat closer to monetary policy than I was   then But in the 1970s, inflation expectations were untethered, and people came to expect us to   allow energy price shocks to feed through to overall inflation  We often confirmed that   expectation by keeping real interest rates from rising  In fact, at times, we kept nominal rates   from rising as fast as inflation and, thus, real rates fell  We were then forced to raise rates   dramatically to bring inflation back down and, in the process, exacerbated the real effects of the   oil price shocks   So, to interpret the effects of Katrina as signaling an imminent shortfall of aggregate   demand is to draw the wrong lesson from the 1970s, in my view  The right lesson for us today is   the importance of keeping inflation expectations anchored in the face of this shock  At our last   meeting, we noted the relative stability of longer-term inflation expectations as measured by the   TIPS inflation compensation numbers, even in the face of sustained oil price increases  But the   behavior of the fed funds futures prices and the TIPS curve since Hurricane Katrina suggest to   me that our credibility is seriously incomplete, in the sense that many market participants appear   to think that we might be willing to tolerate elevated inflation for some time in an attempt to ease   the real effects of the hurricane  Our action and statement today should provide the public with   greater certainty about our near-term intentions  Thank you  "
5691,2005-09-20, I support your recommendation  
5736,2005-11-01," Yes  I apologize for even asking this  I may have become color-blind this   morning, but I can’t tell which firms are which at the bottom of page 3  There are two tiers, right?    Don’t tell me all of them, but which ones are at the bottom?     Thanks   "
5737,2005-11-01," Dave, I would like to ask a little more about the Greenbook baseline  First,   tell me more by way of characterizing the path of inflation expectations  And second, characterize   the forces and the relative weights that bring core inflation down in the second half for next year     How much of the acceleration that you describe in inflation expectations   occurs from here out?  You talked about a certain amount from ’03 to now    Yes  On this point, what President Poole is suggesting is well posed  It’s a   forecast conditioned on replicating sort of an arbitrage-free set of observable financial asset prices   going forward  I don’t want it, though, because I want a mixture of the information that is conveyed   by the market and the staff’s judgment  I want a combination of that  The approach you suggest is   a useful exercise to ponder  But as long as the staff is clear about how their assumptions differ from   those embodied in market prices, I’d rather see a combination, personally     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Recent data confirm that economic activity was   growing at a solid pace pre-Katrina, and we appear to have remained on track since then, at least on   an ex-hurricane basis  The direct effects of the storms appear to be limited to the disruption of   productive capacity along the Gulf Coast  Outside of the affected regions, real activity continues to   expand, as suggested by the September industrial production report and the third-quarter GDP   figures   In our District, there are few signs that this year’s hurricanes have directly affected real   economic activity In fact, we’ve seen a broad pickup in activity since August  Our October   manufacturing survey indicates that shipments, orders, and employment grew at or above the   previous month’s pace  Services firms also reported strengthening revenue growth in both                                      November 1, 2005 39 of 114  September and October, and retail sales increased moderately in both months, as broad sales   increases outweighed a drop in auto and light truck sales   Concerns about the macroeconomic effects of these hurricanes obviously center on the   significant bulge in energy prices  The continued growth in nominal consumer spending ex-autos   since Katrina is evidence that the effects of energy price increases have not yet dampened household   demand, and there seems to be little indication of a hurricane-induced downshift in investment   demand either  So the evidence is consistent with my hypothesis that the hurricanes are essentially   a supply disruption with little independent effect on demand, and thus, the real interest rate path   should be, if anything, higher than it otherwise would be   A second concern regarding the macroeconomic effects of the hurricanes is the potential for   energy prices to pass through to core inflation  Here the recent news on core prices has been   encouraging  Core PCE inflation came in at 13 percent for the third quarter and has averaged 15   percent since March, right where I think we would like it to be  One would expect most of the pass-  through to take a couple of months to materialize, however, and in that regard there are several   unsettling signs worth noting  Within the Fifth District, for example, our surveys show a surge in   prices paid for both manufacturing and services over the last two months  Moreover, the average   reported rate of increase in prices received in both surveys has accelerated significantly in   September and October   Consistent with these quantitative signals, a larger number of our contacts now say they’re   able to pass through part or all of their increasing costs to their customers  In addition, the average   rate of price increase our respondents see for six months ahead has also surged, and our index for   expected wage increases in manufacturing has skyrocketed to over 56 for October  This diffusion   index has a midpoint of zero, and it had been averaging below 30 recently  So a reading of 56 is                                         November 1, 2005 40 of 114  consistent with the anticipation of a fairly broad-based upswing in inflation, although obviously it   could just be a false alarm   Another unsettling sign is the recent behavior of TIPS inflation compensation measures    These have drifted up a couple of tenths since June and are now bouncing around in the   neighborhood of 26 So I think we were right to downgrade inflation expectations from “well   contained” to merely “contained” in our last statement, and I think we should view a further erosion   of inflation expectations as unwelcome   The extent to which energy price increases pass through to core inflation is fundamentally   determined by the public’s expectations regarding future monetary policy  My sense is that we have   just a brief window to head off such pass-through should it threaten  The Greenbook does foresee   significant pass-through, with the core PCE inflation rising to 24 percent in the first half of next   year and then gradually falling back down to under 2 percent  Inflation expectations appear to trace   out a similar hump-shaped path  In the face of this outcome, the Greenbook has us raising the funds   rate to 4¼ percent in December and then stopping there for a year, at least ¼ point short of where   markets expect us to go    I would question the plausibility of this joint outcome  First, I do not think we would or   should stand by while inflation prospects erode as noticeably as they do in the Greenbook  Nor do I   think we could count on inflation expectations to gently drift back down after surging as the   Greenbook expects—at least not without forceful action on our part   For today, I’m comfortable with the alternative B statement  But should more definite signs   of pass-through emerge in coming months, we should be prepared to communicate forcefully and   convincingly our intention not to accommodate a deterioration in core inflation of the magnitude   portrayed in the Greenbook                                              November 1, 2005 41 of 114 "
5738,2005-11-01,"  I support your recommendations, Mr Chairman, and I support the statement   I just want to register a thought or two about language  As we approach December, I recognize that   the change in language that everyone is anticipating is a change that would be associated with   stopping or at some point moderating the pace at which we increase the funds rate  I, like Don   Kohn, have always interpreted “accommodation” to mean the rate is less than what we think it’s   going to be after the next meeting  I can’t think of another coherent way to interpret that  I think   that is always what it has meant   In that regard, there are lots of words that people use that involve implicit counterfactuals    The word “neutral” is one, for example; the word “equilibrium” is another one I understand very                                                 November 1, 2005 96 of 114  well the mechanics of what the Bluebook does, but that to me doesn’t correspond to a path our   economy could conceivably get to from where we are now  So it has always troubled me for us to   make reference to these fairly complicated and elaborate counterfactual simulations in describing   interest rates And I’d be reluctant to go in the direction of the formulaic option that Vincent put   before us yet again—with compliments for his persistence—that makes reference to something   that’s clearly off the equilibrium path   Let me mention another thought about language  I recognize that some around this table don’t   share as heightened a sense of concern about an uptick in core inflation as I do  My fear is that that   has some positive probability  And if at some point we feel about a rise in core, if it should move   up, the way we felt about a fall in core in mid-2003, I think we would find it desirable to   communicate our dissatisfaction with that and our intention to prevent it  Obviously, our sequence   of communications in mid-2003 had some fits and starts, but it was ultimately the communication of   our intentions that stabilized expectations  That established sort of an effective floor to the level of   inflation that market participants thought we were willing to tolerate  And I worry about changing   the statement in a way that everyone associates with a pause when there’s still a likelihood out there   that we may have to engage in a communication exercise of another sort  I’ll leave it at that  "
5780,2005-12-13,"  I share President Poole’s longing for more understanding of the productivity   forecast My understanding is that what you call “structural” is essentially a moving average  I’m   interested for this forecast, since there is such a big markup in that, to know the extent to which the   markup in the structural productivity outlook is merely an arithmetical consequence of a moving                                          December 13, 2005 24 of 100  average that had some recent upside data come into it  And the description about how you’ve altered   your forecast included a reference to a technical factor that I think went over my head  Can you help   us with that?    If it’s too much, we could do it offline  And more broadly, I’m interested in   understanding the framework you have for forecasting this  It’s not clear how that works  If there is a   memo or paper that you could refer me to that laid out all the machinery, I’d really appreciate it     Okay  If I could just follow up for a second In the late ’90s, your forecast of   productivity growth seemed to display a cyclicality—almost a responsiveness to recent productivity   growth—that in hindsight took it up above where productivity growth came in and then down below   it Are you worried about the sensitivity of your forecast to recent data?    Okay I didn’t realize that  Thanks                                            December 13, 2005 26 of 100   Thank you, Mr Chairman  On balance, economic activity is growing at a   solid pace in the Fifth District, though auto sales are faltering and housing markets are cooling  On   the upside, employment conditions have been strengthening, with signs that the job numbers are   increasing even at District factories  Outside of autos and big-ticket items though, retail sales   strengthened substantially this month  Retailers indicate that holiday sales are solid, and they’ve   become more optimistic about prospects for the first half of ’06  Auto sales are weak, though, and   SUVs remain unpopular even after the season’s first snowfall  Services firms are also upbeat, with                                   December 13, 2005 41 of 100  revenues and employment growing over the last two months  Home sales remain at high levels but   we are receiving widespread reports that activity is decelerating, particularly in northern Virginia   where markets have been quite robust in recent years  A number of independent reports describe “a   return to normalcy” in residential real estate markets, with houses actually being on the market and   not getting multiple bids on the first day  Manufacturing continues to hold its own  Although   shipments and new orders were softer in early December, the hiring index was up for our District, and   firms have become notably more optimistic about their early ’06 prospects   District price pressures seem to have eased somewhat in December  Although retail prices   were reported to have advanced at the same strong pace as in November, outside the retail sector   services’ prices have decelerated from October to December  Manufacturing price gains peaked in   November in our series, and our preliminary numbers show that both prices paid and prices received   slowed sharply this month   Turning to the national economy, we’ve received a string of favorable data since our October   meeting, suggesting both that the economy had considerable momentum prior to this fall’s storms and   that the effects of the storms on economic activity outside the affected region and the energy sector   have not been as large as feared  I’m particularly encouraged by the continued strength in business   investment spending in the present quarter, as evidenced by capital goods orders and the ISM   numbers I’m also encouraged by anecdotal reports of a cooling in District and national housing   markets  These reports are consistent with a continuing handoff from residential to business   investment  That said, I’m tempted to paraphrase Solow, though, and say that the slowdown in   housing appears to be visible everywhere but in the housing activity data  [Laughter]   Consumer spending has held up quite well  My sense is that the most important source of this   stability and strength is households’ beliefs about their real income growth in the near future  For this                        December 13, 2005 42 of 100  reason, given the Greenbook forecast for income growth in the near term, I would not expect a   flattening of housing prices to seriously dampen consumer spending  Rather, I expect, consistent with   the Greenbook, consumer spending growth to come in on the strong side going forward, with the   saving rate rising only slowly   The inflation picture has also improved notably since our last meeting, in my mind  The   October core PCE number was heartening, and inflation expectations have been well behaved  Both   survey measures and TIPS compensation spreads have come down off the post-Katrina highs they   reached earlier this fall   While the inflation picture is somewhat better, it does leave some room for concern, in my   view  This Greenbook forecasts a 22 percent core inflation rate for the first half of ’06, less than the   last Greenbook, but it still makes me somewhat uncomfortable With oil prices appearing to have   found a stable range in the neighborhood of $60 a barrel and with natural gas prices remaining high   and volatile, I think it will be several months before the risk of pass-through can be completely put to   bed As for the econometric evidence about pass-through, I’d note that expectations regarding our   policy response represent a latent variable that of necessity is omitted in most econometric exercises    I take less comfort from the econometric evidence than you do, President Yellen  Our preemption   may be required for the pattern you found in the ’90s to actually continue to be confirmed in the data   In the meantime, I think we need to ensure that the public understands our resolve with regard   to inflation  And the real funds rate in the neighborhood of 2 percent is very likely too low for an   economy that’s in a sustained expansion with relatively full resource utilization  So I think it’s   appropriate to follow through today with a 25 basis point increase in the funds rate  "
5781,2005-12-13," I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman, and I support alternative B   We’ve been engaged in a very constructive dialogue over the last week or two—or several weeks—   about how to remove some of the elements of our statement that have been mainstays for some time    I think it’s important for the rationale paragraph to end with a reference to inflation pressures   remaining a concern  I think the risk statement the way it’s formulated in row 4 accomplishes its task   in the most sensible and straightforward way, by clearly just stating outright what we think is going to   be required to maintain balanced risks   With regard to the word “measured,” when it was originally deployed it clearly meant less   than or equal to 25 basis points  I’m not quite sure it retains that strong an association to that  I think   it’s unlikely in the current situation that dropping “measured” would be interpreted as opening the   door for a 50 basis point move, but I don’t have a strong opinion one way or another  So I’m happy   either way regarding the word “measured”   Looking ahead, I think that the challenge for us is going to be how to communicate a reaction   function, meaning how the pattern of incoming economic data is going to map into our choice of a   policy rate  In particular, the challenge for us is going to be how to communicate about that reaction   function when we get to a point where we want to rest for a meeting or two  That discussion is   obviously for another day, but I think it will be important to avoid language at that time that   encourages the public to place too high a probability on the rate remaining unchanged for an extended   period I say that because if the public thought we were locked in for a long time, it might undesirably                                               December 13, 2005 73 of 100  dampen the yield curve’s sensitivity to incoming data  That would be unfortunate  So, those are my   comments on the statement  Again, I support your recommendations  "
5826,2006-01-31,"  Very respectfully, Mr Chairman, I’d like to vote against the foreign   currency operation authorization  Those of you who were here when my predecessor registered a   similar dissent three years ago, and three years before that, should be familiar with the reasoning    For those of you who were not here then, the case is very simple  Sterilized intervention can’t   possibly be more than fleetingly effective unless it serves as a signal regarding future monetary   policy operations  To the extent that such interventions are seen as providing such a signal, we risk   confusing the public regarding future monetary policy and threaten to compromise our   independence  And to the extent that such interventions do not signal future policy support and thus   January 31, 2006 6 of 106    have no lasting effect, we risk compromising perceptions of our competence  And neither outcome   is desirable  So very, very respectfully, Mr Chairman, I will decline to support the authorization  "
5827,2006-01-31,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Fifth District economic activity continued to   advance broadly in December and January  Service-sector employment and revenue strengthened,   and retailers reported generally strong sales and a pickup in hiring  In manufacturing, the signals   are mixed  Shipments flattened out in December and turned down in January, and our new orders   index turned negative as well  At the same time, we’ve seen a very sharp rise in our index of   expected manufacturing shipments six months out  Major swings in this index do a pretty good job   of predicting subsequent upturns in orders and shipments  The last time we saw a rise nearly this   steep was at the beginning of 2002, and a sharp rebound in orders and shipments soon followed    While the figures for prices paid and prices received for both manufacturing and services have come   down off their November highs, they remain noticeably elevated, and measures of expected price   trends have moved up over the past two months   January 31, 2006 42 of 106    On the national economy, until I saw the fourth-quarter GDP report, I was thinking that   economic growth was on pretty solid footing  Friday’s report came in weaker than expected, of   course, but as Dave Stockton mentioned, it appears plausible that several temporary factors are at   work  So I continue to think that prospects for economic growth are pretty good this year  Both   employment and consumer spending are likely to continue expanding at a healthy pace, and the   fundamentals for business investment point toward fairly robust spending growth   At our last meeting, I, like many others, believed that the threat that energy-price increases   would pass through to core inflation and inflation expectations had diminished since the immediate   aftermath of Hurricane Katrina  However, I wasn’t convinced that the threat was entirely behind us,   and unfortunately, my concerns on that score remain  Oil prices have nearly returned to their   September highs  The fourth-quarter core PCE price index came in at 22 percent, 03 above the   Greenbook’s estimate, and the Greenbook has reversed course and marked up the ’06 inflation   forecast a bit  The staff is now expecting core PCE inflation to rise to 23 percent in the middle of   2006 and not to fall below 2 percent until 2007 and then only slightly below  This forecast   represents a bulge that is somewhat more extended than I would like to see  So, for today, I believe   we should strive not to move the near-term yield curve down   In the broader context of the historic nature of today’s meeting, however, it’s quite striking   that among the prominent subjects are a quarter-point bulge in inflation and the issue of whether   long-run and trend inflation should be 15 percent or 20 percent  Few now doubt whether the   Federal Reserve can or will keep inflation stable, a question that was seriously in play decades ago    Your leadership in the intervening years, Mr Chairman, completed the work begun by your   predecessor to restore the expectation of price stability that had been lost in the transition from the   prior commodity standard  Given the number of centuries that regime was in place, I believe future   January 31, 2006 43 of 106    monetary historians would be justified in marking the Volcker–Greenspan era as a millennial   transition  This achievement required altering public expectations about the trend rate of inflation   that we would tolerate  It also required substantially damping the association between strong real   growth and resurgent inflation  Moreover, it required demonstrating that there was no need for   adverse cost shocks to spawn higher trend inflation  The key to all of this, in my mind, was   establishing a pattern of predictable FOMC behavior that was well understood by the public    Leading this transition as you did, Mr Chairman, required tremendous acumen and tremendous   courage  Personally, Mr Chairman, I count serving with you, however briefly, as one of the   greatest privileges an economist could imagine  "
5828,2006-01-31,"  How do your inflation expectations evolve in your two simulations, and in   particular, how are they affected by policy?  Is it just through the effect of resource slack on actual   inflation?     Thanks     I support a ¼ point move today, Mr Chairman, and I support the language   in this statement  I’d be ready to support today moving to voting for the whole statement consistent   with the global march of democracy, but it’s hard to be against further deliberation, especially   within the Federal Reserve System  So I’ll defer to my colleagues and agree to that course of   action  [Laughter]  "
