  First, let me add to Cathy’s commendations for Joe and Linda and the   excellent background papers  My question relates to Tim’s in a way  It has to do with the locus   of disorderliness  The prospects for disorderly adjustment seem to motivate and animate a lot of   this analysis  And it strikes me that a lot of the risk regards the rest of the world  Some of our   trading partners have been known to resist the appreciation that accompanies the type of   international adjustment that we’re looking at here  In particular, some developing countries   often resort to macroeconomic commitments like exchange rate pegs that they have only a   limited ability to follow through on in a consistent way  These commitments are not perfect   substitutes for the credibility that comes with deep and resilient markets and a credible   June 29-30, 2004 50 of 203          commitment to low inflation  It strikes me that those kinds of commitments by these countries   enhance the prospects of their being susceptible to domestic macroeconomic instability in   response to changes in US macroeconomic conditions and the type of adjustment that we’re   looking at here  I wonder if you’ve given any thought to that or what your general reactions to   that notion are      I have a question for David  First, I want to applaud the analytical focus on   the behavior of the price markup since it obviously has swung a lot in the last couple of years and it   is a key swing determinant in the inflation outlook  I was wondering to what extent the markup is a   forward-looking variable in the models you use  In many analytical or theoretical models of price   determination it is, in the same sense that the saving rate is a forward-looking variable in the   permanent-income model  Second, I was just curious  What kind of error bands or uncertainty   band charts would it be possible to construct about the price markup?     Just to follow up on what Roger was asking about the panel in chart 3 on   housing valuations  In that panel the relative movement of the two measures is somewhat key to at   least the intuitive persuasiveness of the argument that housing might be overvalued  I understand   the units of the real long-term Treasury yield  I don’t understand the units of the rent-to-price ratio       But you set the scale, too, right?  You could set it so that the zeroes are the   same on both axes?     Yes, that’s true; they ought to have the same zeroes it seems   June 29-30, 2004 90 of 203            That’s right  But in the chart, the staff has the zero set at very different   places on the two scales     I’m just wondering, how did you decide where to put the zero?  If you put   it much closer to where the zero is for the long-run Treasury rate, the squiggles in the red line would   be a lot smaller     Right  And your argument has to do with the size of the squiggles?     The gap between these two lines?      That’s fine for now   June 29-30, 2004 91 of 203            In the Fifth District, the economic recovery appears to have strengthened in   May and early June  Manufacturing activity continued to expand, although the pace has lessened in   recent weeks  Shipments and new orders are up, and there are spot reports of increased export   demands in Europe and China, particularly for some niche technology products  Despite the slower   pace of output growth, employment in manufacturing has increased on net in Maryland, Virginia,   and South Carolina but continues to fall in North Carolina, with its heavy concentration of textile,   apparel, and furniture plants  For the District as a whole, I get the sense that manufacturing   employment is expanding even more slowly than in the nation     Outside of manufacturing, however, hiring is definitely picking up  In fact, several of our   contacts are reporting signs of emerging tightness in labor markets Consistent with these reports,   our diffusion index for District manufacturing wages picked up sharply this month  Our survey   reports also indicate that the pace of materials price increases eased somewhat in May and June,   although firms continue to complain about higher prices for selected commodities such as steel and   concrete   Retailers are reporting moderately higher revenues, but they say that sales growth in early   June has slipped a bit from May’s pace  Elsewhere across the service sector, however, revenue   growth seems to have accelerated in recent weeks  Commercial Realtors have reported a moderate   uptick in retail leasing activity recently, but office and industrial leasing remains sluggish overall    June 29-30, 2004 120 of 203          Residential construction is still quite strong in our District, and now we are getting consistent   reports of strong commercial loan demand   Consistent with the evidence from the Fifth District, the recovery of the national economy   appears to be deepening and broadening, particularly in business spending and hiring  I think we   have every reason to expect to maintain this traction and to see a well-balanced expansion take hold   in the quarters ahead  The Greenbook projects real GDP to grow at around 5 percent for the   remainder of ’04 and to slow to the rate of potential growth thereafter, closing the estimated output   gap by early ’06  This projection seems quite reasonable to me   Headline inflation has been running higher than we would like over the last couple of   months, but for several reasons it seems plausible that this recent increase will turn out to be   transitory  The output gap is still sizable  The markup of prices over unit labor costs, as we   discussed earlier, is well above its long-run average, and given that, it seems most likely to decline    Inflation expectations seem to be reasonably well anchored  Moreover, year-over-year increases in   measured consumer inflation are still moderate  For example, core PCE inflation on a year-over-  year basis remains inside the 1 percent to 2 percent range consistent with price stability  On the   other hand, short-run inflation expectations have moved up in recent months together with actual   inflation, and financial market measures of inflation compensation at longer horizons have drifted   higher as well  Moreover, as the Greenbook notes, market-based inflation expectations appear to be   sensitive to declarations of the FOMC’s resolve to hold the line on inflation  The fact that the path   of the fed funds rate expected by market participants exceeds the baseline path assumed in the   Greenbook can be interpreted, as I read it, as evidence that financial markets continue to be nervous   about upside inflationary risk  The market’s reaction to Monday’s inflation figures bolsters that   notion, I think   June 29-30, 2004 121 of 203          All in all, though, I think we positioned ourselves reasonably well coming into this meeting    The labor market recovery is on track, inflation seems likely to moderate in the near term, and   markets expect us to move interest rates higher at a fairly healthy clip  I think the main challenge   for monetary policy in coming months will be gauging the speed with which we need to increase   interest rates to hold the line on inflation     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Fifth District economy expanded at a   somewhat slower pace in July, as manufacturing and retail sales softened but services strengthened    August 10, 2004 63 of 103          In manufacturing, our diffusion index for shipments, just released today, fell last month but remains   in positive territory  The manufacturing employment index was also in the positive range,   consistent with anecdotal reports from the Carolinas, where much of our manufacturing industry is   concentrated  Job losses due to plant closings in textiles and furniture continue but have been offset   recently by job gains at new plants and plant expansions in other manufacturing industries  Our   new orders index for manufacturing picked up in July, though, suggesting some improvement   ahead  And manufacturers tell us that prices paid accelerated in July; they complained about price   increases for raw materials, particularly for steel and copper    Turning to our index for service firms, revenue was strongly positive again in July,   indicating continued strong growth in the Fifth District service sector in recent weeks  In contrast,   our survey indicated that retail sales revenue slowed, and many store managers are reporting slack   sales  A senior officer at a large bank in our District reported strong demand for credit in the   midlevel corporate market and positive consumer credit quality trends  Contacts in the DC area   noted that the commercial real estate market here has gone from “good to white hot”  An executive   at a national media company reported extremely strong TV ad revenues for the first half of the year,   even excluding political advertising, which is very strong this year  Last week, though, she reported   a pause in forward momentum for the third quarter, but she said that the industry remains optimistic   for the fourth quarter   Turning to the national economy, I was disappointed, too, by the weakness in the payroll   employment reports  Those data, along with the softness in consumer spending, have elevated my   concern about the downside risks going forward  At this point, though, I share the Greenbook’s   view that these negative developments are likely to be reversed before too long, for reasons that   many people have gone into around the table and I won’t repeat here  Moreover, the change in the   August 10, 2004 64 of 103          corporate profit numbers due to the annual NIPA revisions suggests that markups are less elevated   than we once thought  As a result, the risk of disinflation due to a more-rapid-than-expected decline   in markups now seems lower   Furthermore, the moderation in core inflation measures of late suggests a diminished risk of   a protracted rise in inflation  Consumer inflation has continued to increase, given higher food and   energy prices, but the fact that inflation expectations have fallen somewhat since the spring, in spite   of the rise in overall inflation, supports the view that inflation will remain contained  All in all, I   think there’s good reason to believe that the economy will work through this difficult period and   move toward a balanced expansion in product and labor markets with stable prices   On the whole, I still think the most dangerous risk that we’ve faced so far this year has been   the apprehension of financial markets about the Fed’s falling behind in raising the funds rate  I   believe the Committee was correct last spring to keep financial markets calm by communicating its   intentions to lift the funds rate target this year and next  That message showed markets that we   recognized the risk of inflation and that we would give appropriate priority to price stability  I also   think that our follow-through in raising the funds rate in June and in indicating our intention to take   another step today were necessary to sustain the credibility of that commitment   It was always possible that we might receive some disappointing data after we began raising   the funds rate, and it turned out we did, but I think we should follow through today for several   reasons  First, the market has already eased policy for us by reducing the speed at which it expects   us to raise the funds rate  Second, not to follow through would risk undermining the credibility   against inflation we have been working to maintain  Given that credibility, we can always ease   policy quickly and substantially—should the weakness in the economy develop into something   August 10, 2004 65 of 103                                                            3 The materials used by Mr Madigan are appended to this transcript (appendix 3)   more serious—by signaling our intention to draw out the pace of the funds rate increase  Thank   you       I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman  I think it is appropriate   that we maintain a high hurdle as we go forward before skipping a beat  I believe this measured   August 10, 2004 80 of 103          approach is important, as Governor Bernanke said, to maintain the credibility of our commitment   against inflation  Even with a few more soft patches as we go forward, I think that’s going to be the   ever-present danger in the near term   I also share your opposition to including the phrase “sustainable growth” in the last   sentence, but for a slightly different reason  The way it is worded there makes it sort of a twin pillar   of our obligations  We have moved over the last few years to recognizing a difference between our   desire for price stability and our desire for sustainable growth, and I wouldn’t like that difference to   be eroded or fuzzed up in the public’s mind     The way we operate, Dino is asked to supply reserves against two   different demand curves—a maintenance period demand curve and a daily demand curve  And   there’s a yield curve relationship within a maintenance period that ties the daily rates together    To ask him to make the funds rate do this step function I think is asking a lot  That would be   September 21, 2004 10 of 100          asking him to disrupt markets to some extent on a day-to-day basis, pushing against the fear of   overdraft and the fear of lock-in on the part of banks  That doesn’t seem to make sense to me   either  To Vincent’s point, the fed funds futures market builds in an expectation of this step   function  What we’re asking Dino to do is not to fight against that  We’re not asking him to tip   our hand; we’re asking him to go along with what the yield curve says about what the rate is   going to do after the meeting  I don’t see that as prejudicing the Committee’s discretion      Thank you, Mr Chairman  Economic growth in the Fifth District   softened further in recent weeks, but we don’t see any indications that the expansion is off track    Manufacturing shipments and orders continue to expand, although manufacturing employment   appears to be flat or declining in our District  Retail activity in our region has been soft lately,   consistent with the national figures  Outside the retail service sector, activity has been flat   overall since August, but our District continues to outpace the nation in residential construction    We’re hearing complaints about the cost of construction materials, and the scarcity of heavy-  equipment operators appears to be limiting construction work in some areas  More broadly,   while our directors and other contacts report expanding economic activity across a variety of   sectors, there is a lingering sense of unease about the pace of this recovery  Several contacts say   that firms are reluctant to add workers, and many attribute this to concerns about the   continuation of the recovery   September 21, 2004 48 of 100          Turning to the national economy, in spite of the encouraging net job growth in August   and the upward revisions to the data for the two previous months, the September Greenbook has   written down expected job growth this year from what was anticipated in August The end-of-  year output gap is correspondingly a couple of tenths wider than in the prior projection, and   there’s a commensurate reduction in the expected path for core consumer prices both this year   and next  I think it’s reasonable to project that the labor market will gradually improve and that   the output gap will close by the end of 2006, helped along by a less aggressive rise in the funds   rate as built into the Greenbook forecast  That said, though, I think that the recent data have   clouded the picture enough to suggest substantial downside risk in the outlook  Evidently we’re   not returning just yet to the growth rates that we had been anticipating prior to the recent soft   patch  Thus, some markdown in the expected funds rate path seems warranted   Much of the financial market nervousness about inflation evident earlier in the year   seems to have receded  Nevertheless, financial markets still expect a funds rate about 75 basis   points higher by the end of 2006 than does the Greenbook  That expectation continues to keep   long-term interest rates higher than they otherwise would be  The Greenbook anticipates that   long rates will come down as we follow through and raise the funds rate on the expected path   The result is something of a central banker’s dream—a rising policy rate accompanied by falling   long rates  However, should the economy truly need the greater stimulus assumed in the   Greenbook, we should be alert to other possibilities in the period ahead  Markets might again   get more nervous about inflation, and long rates might rise rather than fall as we indicate a less   aggressive rate of increase in the funds rate  Clearly, that would be counterproductive   Accordingly, I think we should be cautious about sending such signals  We could well   find that our credibility for low inflation is sufficiently secure that signaling our intention to   September 21, 2004 49 of 100          move the funds rate up less aggressively succeeds in lowering long rates and stimulating the   economy  On the other hand, we might be unpleasantly surprised     I support your recommendation, particularly about the last sentence of   the statement     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Fifth District economy continued to   expand in recent weeks  Manufacturing growth continues but seems to be slowing a bit  Our   shipments index fell somewhat but remains solidly in positive territory  The new orders index,   however, slid toward a neutral reading, and our manufacturing employment index remains at   neutral as well  Many contacts in manufacturing continue to comment on higher material prices  A   manager at Rohm and Haas in North Carolina noted ethylene and propylene price increases, but   said he was holding the line on his product prices  And a GE manager in South Carolina noted   increases in raw material prices but said prices for the turbines he produced were rising even faster   Our most recent survey still indicates strong growth in revenues and employment in the   service sector  Retail activity appears to have slowed since the end of the period covered in our   Beige Book report  Big ticket sales in particular seem to have been weak in recent weeks, and most   November 10, 2004 37 of 107    of the auto dealers we surveyed said sales were down  One of our directors in the energy business   said that in his view energy prices were unsustainably high, and he cited several factors that he   thought indicated they’d be coming down significantly soon  He also reported that many CEOs he   knew were complaining about the expenditures required to comply with Sarbanes–Oxley; they   thought it was a major drag on the economy  In particular, he noted a scarcity of the skilled   personnel necessary to implement those systems  A North Carolina banker said that, although there   are pockets of negativity, his contacts generally thought the business outlook was good there  And   a contact in West Virginia reported that railroad shipping is a significant problem for the coal   industry  He cited scarcity of labor in that sector   Turning to the national economy, the October jobs report shows healthier employment   growth since the summer, and this suggests greater strength in the labor market than we had   previously supposed  Aggregate hours are already more than ½ percentage point above the third-  quarter average, and the steadily increasing growth in average hourly earnings that has been in train   for months evidently continued into October  The rise in both hours and wages gives a welcome   boost to personal income, and that should help support strong growth in consumer spending going   forward  Rising wages together with slower productivity growth have pushed the growth in unit   labor costs up to or even above the rate of inflation recently so that the disinflation risk continues to   abate  All told, with inflation and inflation expectations well anchored, the economy appears to be   doing noticeably better than it seemed at the time of our last meeting  And if the economy   maintains its strength, we will need to continue to let the funds rate rise   As I see it, we are likely to be balancing two related concerns going forward  First, there’s   the continuing weakness in business investment spending relative to what we might have expected,   given the strong cash flows and low interest rates we’ve seen this year  Because of this, I think we   are likely to want to keep our real interest rate increases to a measured pace  However, market   November 10, 2004 38 of 107    participants expect us to raise the funds rate faster than the Greenbook projects is necessary to   maintain price stability  The discrepancy between market expectations and the Greenbook forecast   suggests a second concern that we might at some point fall behind the curve, as it were, in   tightening monetary policy   If the job market gains momentum in coming months and suspicions about the   sustainability of the recovery recede, real inflationary pressures could well develop  In that case, we   would want to act decisively to preempt any uptick in inflation rather than await an uptick and then   react, and I presume we would do so  But even if inflation remains perfectly stable, we will need to   let the real interest rate rise as the economy gains strength  We shouldn’t let stable inflation   expectations lull us into adjusting the equilibrium real rate less rapidly than is required to resist a   real boom-and-bust cycle such as we saw in the late ’90s  In the current case, it will be difficult to   discern when and how much interest rate tightening will be necessary in the period ahead, just as it   was then  But above all, we don’t want to encourage the belief that we signal a steeper expected   funds rate path only in response to tangible signs of shifting inflation expectations because our   ultimate goal is to eliminate such shifts     I agree with your proposal, Mr Chairman, about raising the rate and about   the statement  My own sense is that the funds rate is more likely to lie on the path of the market’s   forecast than that in the Greenbook, and I don’t think it’s the right time to pull down the yield   curve  With regard to our statement, I agree with Governor Bernanke that we shouldn’t be looking   to turn back the hands of time and increase the variance in the market’s forecast for the future fed   funds rate     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Fifth District economy continued to   expand at a moderate pace in recent weeks  Our service firms reported solid growth in revenues   over the last two months, while retailers told us that sales have been flat  In particular, big ticket   sales remain weak, and car sales are said to be soft   District manufacturers reported that growth in shipments and new orders have tailed off over   the last month  Shipments were basically flat in November  Although building permits were off the   pace of a year ago, housing markets remained generally strong in our District  In labor markets, our   information indicates job gains in services and retail but virtually unchanged manufacturing   employment in November  Price increases at District firms have trended higher, though they are   generally remaining under 2 percent, according to our contacts  There was a notable change in the   tone in manufacturing firms regarding pricing, however  They are now increasingly saying that   they can pass through price increases to their customers, unlike earlier in the year when they said   price increases were more difficult to pass along   Turning to the national picture, data received in recent weeks also indicate that economic   recovery has continued at a reasonably healthy pace  Consumer spending has advanced at a pretty   December 14, 2004 37 of 118           solid trend rate in recent months, capital spending has been fairly brisk, and housing keeps coming   in on the strong side  Every passing month of growth at this pace raises my confidence in the   staying power of the expansion  The Greenbook expects real GDP to expand around 3½ to 4   percent through 2006, and the output gap is expected to close gradually by then, with PCE inflation   remaining stable around 1½ percent  This is a relatively attractive outlook, and it’s one I’m   comfortable subscribing to   I was particularly relieved to see the elimination of the disconnect that was in the November   Greenbook between the staff’s projection and market expectations regarding the future path of the   federal funds rate  Since the November meeting, that disconnect has been resolved through an   increase of about ½ percentage point in the Greenbook’s projected rate path, putting it only a little   below market expectations of the future funds rate  This was a favorable way of closing the gap,   since it was accompanied by an upward revision in expected growth in the Greenbook and reflects   more confidence in the strength of the recovery going forward     Another disconnect remains, however, that eventually must be resolved  The Greenbook   sees CPI inflation leveling off at about 1¾ percent in 2006, and yet the Greenbook also reports   survey estimates of ten-year-ahead expected CPI inflation in the 2½ to 3 percent range  Moreover,   the Bluebook reports expectations measures of between 2½ and 3 percent based on inflation-  indexed Treasury spreads  So it seems that a range of measures are telling us that inflation will be   noticeably greater than we think it will be  This inflation disconnect will be resolved eventually one   way or another, as I said  We may get lucky and see market expectations drift down to a level   consistent with 1¾ percent on the CPI, or we may not be so lucky   One interpretation of the persistence of inflation expectations at these levels is that the   public believes that our long-run tolerance range for CPI inflation extends up to 3 percent or more    December 14, 2004 38 of 118           If that’s the case, it may be difficult for us to resist an upward drift in inflation as the economy   recovers  Moreover, we can’t be sure that expected inflation won’t drift up still further, if actual   inflation begins to drift up  But if we’re unwilling to tolerate CPI inflation near 3 percent, then we   may need to maintain tighter monetary policy than otherwise to ensure that the disconnect between   the public’s expectation of inflation and ours is resolved in our favor  Thank you     I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman  I’m happy to finish the   year holding the all-time Committee record for highest fraction of meetings at which I’ve raised   interest rates  [Laughter]     I strongly support expedited release for a lot of the reasons that Governor   Kohn and others have expressed  I have a general predilection toward more transparency; the more   information in the markets, the better  I just want to make three points  One is that bringing this   information out earlier in time would resolve uncertainty earlier  If we see any market reaction to   this, for the most part it would just represent a shift in the timing of market volatility  It doesn’t   seem to me likely that on net, in any global sense, it’s going to add any market volatility  So we   shouldn’t let the magnitude of perceived market reactions dissuade us or give us second thoughts   down the road  The second point I want to make is that I do see this as alleviating some of the   pressure on the Committee with regard to the drafting of the statement  But, Cathy, I think this cuts   both ways  After expedited release of the minutes, the statement will stand as the Committee’s   latest communication for only three weeks  To some extent, that could make it easier to   communicate and agree on phrasing rather than harder, since only three weeks are at stake rather   than an entire intermeeting period  I agree with Don  I wouldn’t want to see the extent of the   communication we do in the statement cut down  Finally, there’s one tiny detail that I hesitate to   bring up, but it sort of surprised me  If it were up to me, I’d like to see it changed  Apparently, it’s   the tradition that nonmembers’ policy statements are excluded from the minutes as they’re written    Now, I don’t remember ever noticing this before, and I can’t remember seeing it in the orientation   package I got  [Laughter]     Which one?     Mr Chairman, let me just say a couple of things  First, there is this   mechanism for distinguishing between members and nonmembers  So a view about policy could   easily be attributed to a nonmember  Second, many statements about the economy by members as   well as by other participants seem integrally linked with their statements about policy  Today’s   meeting, I think, was an excellent example of that  Third, I view the purpose of the minutes as a   means to communicate to the public the deliberations that occurred at the meeting, rather than the   deliberations of the Committee—   December 14, 2004 90 of 118             Well, that’s a different philosophy; I’ll grant that     May I ask a clarifying question?      Vincent, in the discussion in the minutes that refers to the first part of the   meeting on the outlook, where you use the terms “most,” “many,” and “several,” is the   denominator—    I want to start by commending the staff for the background papers that in   my view were quite thorough and balanced   The question today is whether the FOMC should or should not adopt an explicit numerical   price-related objective and, if so, how My feeling is that this is a rather narrow question as it has   been presented to us today in the sense that, given our current practice, announcing such an objective   would not require very much change in Fed policymaking  And yet I think it’s an extraordinarily   important step for us to take   Regarding the operational issues raised in the memo by Wilcox and company, I agree with   the recommendation that the objective should be a consumer price index—either the CPI with a 2   percent midpoint or the PCE price index with a 1½ percent midpoint  These midpoints would allow   for a known upward measurement bias and provide an additional 1 percent cushion against the zero   bound My preference would be to target the PCE index since that measure has some   methodological advantages and it’s what we focus on internally  I also have a preference for   targeting the core measure because that would be sufficient to anchor headline inflation over time,   but it would afford us the latitude to allow the relative prices of food and energy to fluctuate without   necessarily requiring a response I would also favor a 1 percentage point range, from 1 to 2 percent,   rather than a point target, so as to give us a reasonable safe harbor within which we would not be   pressed to explain fluctuations in inflation A relatively narrow safe harbor, however, would   discipline us to explain why there are fluctuations in inflation and how we expect to reverse them   over time  And I’d expect that our inflation objective would be revised only infrequently, mainly in   response to improvements in measurement   With regard to the issues covered by Vincent’s memo, I think we should announce our   objective to the public When we do it, we should emphasize that it’s an incremental step and does   not imply a dramatic departure from how we have been conducting monetary policy  We should   also emphasize that we believe—based on central banking experience both here and abroad and a   priori reasoning, perhaps—that it will enhance the operational power of monetary policy to stabilize           February 1-2, 2005 32 of 177  both employment and inflation  And we should explain that it will do so by better anchoring long-  term inflation expectations and thus improving our ability to communicate in the short run   Admittedly, monetary policy, as many people have remarked here today, has been working   relatively well lately, and we’re already widely credited with making low inflation a priority  So the   question arises of why we should take the additional step now of announcing an explicit long-run   inflation objective For me the argument boils down to three things  First, we all agree that we want   inflation to remain fairly close to where it is now  I took that as a consensus, Mr Chairman, that the   costs of failing to keep inflation this low are well understood And on net, there are no good reasons   to want inflation higher or lower than where it is today   Second, by announcing a specific long-run objective, we would not be giving up much   flexibility that we haven’t already given up or that we shouldn’t be happy to give up  In the process   of establishing the reputation that we have now for our commitment to price stability, we already   have given up the flexibility to let inflation expectations get out of control An announced objective   would be meant to guide our actions in the long run  It would not hinder us, in my view, from taking   the kinds of policy actions we take today to stabilize employment and output in the short run It   would help discipline us, however, to undo and to explain how we intend to undo any short-run   departures from our long-run objective  More to the point, it would force us to respond when   measures of expected inflation move very much outside our target range  There are no   circumstances, I submit, in which we would want expected inflation outside of a narrow band   around our objective for very long Thus, the narrow scope of flexibility that’s at stake here is   something I think we’d be better off without   Third, establishing an inflation objective within the Committee would facilitate discussion    And announcing it, I think, would lead to better public understanding of how we intend to conduct   monetary policy going forward  The value of ambiguity about our long-run intentions has outlived   its usefulness in my view, and I don’t see any reason to retain that ambiguity  Moreover, I think   better clarity about our long-run objective would help us be more transparent about the short-run           February 1-2, 2005 33 of 177  policy process; I agree with President Poole about that Ultimately, I think this is the only way to   secure good monetary policy in the future    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Economic growth in the Fifth District has been   a little stronger in recent weeks Retail revenues seem to have picked up  According to our survey,   seasonally adjusted shopper traffic was stronger in January than in December, and big-ticket sales   firmed after having been weak in the previous month  In the service sector, revenue growth                    February 1-2, 2005 104 of 177  continues to be brisk District manufacturing activity generally firmed in January, following some   softness in December  And although our survey showed manufacturing shipments down somewhat   recently, new orders strengthened and factory hiring was higher   In labor markets, we’re seeing some indications of a pickup in job growth in recent weeks    Data for December had shown only modest gains in our area  Business contacts reported that prices   rose at a somewhat quicker pace in January than in December, though increases for final goods and   services were generally less than 2 percent We continue to hear of sharp increases in prices for   some categories of raw materials  Some District manufacturers indicate that higher costs are   squeezing their margins, but an increasing number of producers indicate that they are passing   through cost increases by raising their prices Pass-throughs are easier, some say, because raw   material prices are affecting their competitors as well, though it isn’t clear why this wasn’t true with   the earlier cost increases Other contacts note that the stronger economic outlook makes their   customers less resistant to higher prices, and this sounds a bit more persuasive to us   Turning to the national picture, the data we’ve received since the December FOMC meeting   suggest that the recovery is on track The forecast for inflation and economic activity in this   Greenbook is little changed from December, and I haven’t seen anything that contradicts that view   In particular, core PCE inflation is projected to remain around 1½ percent, inflation expectations   appear to be contained, and the Greenbook continues to project a healthy real GDP growth of   between 3½ to 4 percent over the next two years as the output gap gradually closes   To my mind, the most intriguing development since December is the flattening of the yield   curve Despite a 26 basis point increase in the two-year Treasury rate since the December FOMC   meeting, the 10-year rate barely moved and the 30-year rate actually declined by 17 basis points    This was clear in Dino’s charts yesterday The behavior of the term structure is just what one would   expect if the public has confidence that we’re going to conduct monetary policy in a way to keep   inflation premiums stable and, thus, keep long-term interest rates low over the long run  The fact   that the TIPS [Treasury inflation-protected securities] spreads have been relatively stable of late also                             February 1-2, 2005 105 of 177  supports this interpretation I read these facts as evidence of the credibility of our low-inflation   commitment, as was commented on at length yesterday   Of course, as we go forward, I think we’re going to have to watch the term structure   carefully for evidence of emerging market concerns about either inflation or deflation  For now,   however, the yield curve evidence, together with overall economic conditions, suggests that the   policy path we are assuming for this outlook is nicely balancing the upside and the downside risks    Meaning it’s the point where the future path of the fed funds rate from that   point on is perfectly flat  So it’s not the probability of when we will first pause    I interpreted you as saying that an identifying assumption more or less built   in is that we move, move, move, move, move and then stop—that we don’t pause and then continue   moving again    Does this use options at all?    Well, with enough pdf you wouldn’t need the identifying assumption    I do, as well    I’ll pass    Thank you, Mr Chairman  In recent weeks, we have received evidence of   a continuation in the slowing growth in our District that we noted in our Beige Book report  Retail   sales, which in the Beige Book were reported as having leveled off, began declining in early March   by our indicators A slump in big-ticket sales has evidently dragged down retail activity in recent   weeks District manufacturing activity continued to expand but at a slower pace than in February    Our March diffusion index, to be released this morning, came in at about neutral, which is down a   bit from February   Interestingly, hardly any of our textile and apparel industry contacts are citing the surge in   imports from China as an important factor for them  Their reports on shipment trends are fairly   evenly split between expanding and declining We continue to receive reports of substantially   higher raw materials prices across an array of industries     The housing market remains quite strong in several areas in our District  Concerns over so-  called bubble conditions are widespread among our real estate contacts, especially in Northern   Virginia and in coastal areas, although prices seem to have topped out in several high-end coastal   communities                                   March 22, 2005 39 of 116  In banking, the CEO of a community bank operating in North Carolina and the western   portion of Virginia said business is as strong as train smoke  Not being very familiar with train   smoke, I asked him how strong a reading that represented  He noted about the only thing stronger   was battery acid [Laughter]   Turning to the national picture, the economy looks noticeably stronger today than it did at   the end of January The Greenbook now estimates that real GDP grew at 43 percent in the fourth   quarter of last year, substantially higher than the previously estimated 35 percent  First-quarter real   GDP growth has been revised up substantially Expected future real GDP growth is essentially   unchanged And there is little revision to the path of potential output over the forecast period The   slowly improving labor market suggests that the output gap is still on track to continue diminishing   in the near future     On the inflation front, unit labor costs continue to be well behaved The recent spurt in   energy and import prices has elevated the overall indexes, but any spillover into the core indexes   seems likely to abate  So I’d expect core PCE inflation to return to near 1½ percent after not too   long   The Greenbook forecast is conditioned on a path for the fed funds rate 50 basis points higher   than in January, a path that nearly matches the market’s expectation over the forecast horizon  All in   all, I think this is a good outlook In my view the most likely risk is that inflation expectations will   be driven higher—by a more sustained increase in oil prices, by a sharper depreciation of the dollar,   or by a more rapid closing of the output gap than we expect   The most worrisome evidence of rising inflation expectations is the change in market   measures of near-term inflation compensation  For example, the TIPS five-year inflation   compensation, which has been drifting up fitfully over the past year or so, has increased by about a                             March 22, 2005 40 of 116  third of a percentage point since the last FOMC meeting  We would expect large oil price increases   to generate some movement in these compensation measures based on anticipations of pass-through   to consumer energy prices  So the recent increase in the five-year TIPS spread may reflect merely a   sort of expected arithmetical pipeline of future CPI increases  And, consistent with this, chart 1 of   the Bluebook shows that a substantial portion of the increase is attributable to the first year of the   five-year horizon and that compensation for years four and five hasn’t moved much   On the other hand, the Bluebook also shows that significant increases have occurred over the   intermeeting period in forward inflation compensation two and three years out, and these movements   seem hard to rationalize based on the current pipeline effects alone  Of course, these expectations   pertain to the headline CPI figure, which is going to be elevated only temporarily above core   inflation, I think Indeed, the Greenbook calls for core CPI inflation to remain anchored at close to 2   percent, and that’s a projection I’m quite comfortable with   All this suggests that inflation expectations, although they have been creeping up, are not yet   a problem  We’ll have to adapt our plans, however, if inflation expectations behave in a way that is   inconsistent with our intentions We can start by making sure that our behavior is not exacerbating   the problem     The public learned from the minutes of our February meeting that we had deferred   specifying a quantitative target range for inflation That left open the question of how much more   inflation we would be willing to tolerate If we’re not willing to specify a numerical target or upper   bound for inflation, then we should find some other way to signal our determination to hold the line   on inflation somewhere, preferably before that line is crossed  Thank you    There’s something highly ironic about this whole discussion to me  We   initially introduced the balance-of-risk statement in order to communicate about the direction of   policy without talking explicitly about interest rates or policy We were relying on this sort of   simple version of a policy rule whereby the public could generally decode what we were talking   about Then in 2003 we hit a problem because we had both rising real growth and falling inflation,   and we needed to disentangle it into two different parts After that, we trumped it with another   statement that is now widely seen as conveying the real information about the direction of policy    So the balance of risks is seen as communicating about the direction of the economy and, ironically,   we’re putting “policy” into the balance-of-risk statement in order to clarify its meaning about the   economy    Mr Chairman, where I was going on this was to say that we have the   minutes now to convey in a rich format what we view as the likely direction of the economy and of   policy I think we’re having trouble with this, and we are going to have trouble with this—and I   don’t have any view about whether now or May is the right time to change the language—because   we’re placing more weight on the balance-of-risk statement    The ultimate place I was going was to suggest that sometime soon we   consider dropping this whole statement    I hope that is the decision As for the balance-of-risk assessment, I don’t   think we need it in the statement  I don’t think it serves any purpose    I, too, support your policy recommendation, Mr Chairman, and I can   support the language in alternative B for now Also, I didn’t realize I was under an obligation to   communicate about the language before the meeting, and I apologize for confusing the meeting in   that regard   I don’t think that we ought to pull information of a forward-looking nature out of the   statement on net, but I made the suggestion I did about returning to the balance-of-risk assessment   statement, because my sense is that what’s labeled line 6 here is really bearing the weight of   conveying our sense about the future And I wouldn’t want to reduce the statement if it meant less   transparency and a less forthcoming communication with the public   I would point out that with this addition of the phrase “appropriate monetary policy action”   we’ve essentially put the nail in the coffin in the original version of the statement  It now decidedly   conveys no information about policy except that we want it to be appropriate, which presumably   everyone always knew [Laughter]   Let me just comment about alternative C  We’re in this evolving economy and   communicating with the public, and we expect certain reactions of them and they expect us to have   policy evolve and react in a certain way Alternative C is a zero probability event, and I’m not quite   sure I see the value of communicating by describing a counterfactual future that is so far from   reality I think we can find other ways to convey a sense of what looks likely to us going forward    On balance, after hitting a soft patch in March, economic activity in the   Fifth District appears to have bounced back somewhat in April  The improvement was centered in   manufacturing and retailing, where modest growth replaced flat activity in March  Services firms,   meanwhile, continued to report the moderate growth we’ve seen over the last several months   District manufacturers suggest that demand generally remained solid, and many indicate that   they’ve successfully passed through higher energy and materials costs  Our shipments and new   orders indexes both moved up for April  Most of our manufacturing contacts say that they do not   plan to reduce capital spending in coming months and that they remain reasonably optimistic about   future prospects  The exception to this picture is, as usual, in the textile, apparel, and furniture   industries that compete directly with Chinese producers  They continue to complain of a lack of   pricing power, and their capital spending is generally limited to maintaining rather than expanding   capacity Our index of manufacturing wages continues to firm even though the employment index                                    May 3, 2005 29 of 116  weakens The wage gains are being reported in higher-skilled industries, however, while it is   elsewhere in the sector that workers are being shed   The recent bounce in retail sales in the Fifth District appears to be centered in big-ticket   items  In our April survey, big-ticket sales posted their strongest reading since July 2003 Sharp   upticks were registered in retail employment and wages as well  Housing activity remains solid in   our District Home sales are strong in most areas and quite robust in some, including my own   neighborhood where I received six offers in one day on my house!   On the inflation front, our April survey suggests that price pressures remain contained,   though the rate of increase in prices paid by manufacturers edged higher  We continue to hear   concerns about having to pay higher energy prices, and a few producers also complain that higher   energy costs are dampening consumer demand   Turning to the national picture, the data we’ve received since March have been   disappointing on both the real side and inflation The slowing in the real side has been broad-based,   and although it has been relatively mild overall, the deceleration in capital spending is particularly   disappointing given the expectation that business investment would generally drive this expansion    On inflation, core PCE inflation continues to move up  The latest report shows it at a 29 percent   annual rate over the last three months, considerably above the 17 percent rate over the twelve   months to March  If this situation were to persist, it would present a classic dilemma for monetary   policy weakening real growth and rising inflation   At this point, however, there are good reasons to think that it will not First, the economic   fundamentals underlying this recovery appear sound  Prospects for growth in real household income   look good, and, although capital spending may not soon replicate last year’s strong pace, investment   prospects look reasonably good as well As a result, I share the Greenbook’s view that the soft patch                                    May 3, 2005 30 of 116  should be temporary  The Fifth District reports of a rebound in April that I mentioned earlier are   consistent with this view as well   Second, weak real data did not change the Board staff’s estimate of potential output  Instead,   the Greenbook forecast has a more protracted narrowing of the output gap, with a significantly wider   gap still near 1 percent to the end of 2006 It seems reasonable to believe that this wider output gap   will help push core PCE [personal consumption expenditures] inflation back below 2 percent, and   this view gets some support from the gratifying fact that TIPS [Treasury inflation-protected   securities] inflation compensation has declined a bit since March, both for the first five years out and   the five years after that  Moreover, market participants expect inflation to remain that well   contained even with about ¼ percentage point less of expected tightening by the end of 2006 than   had been foreseen as of March That raises the likelihood that actual and expected inflation can be   contained without the aggressive type of funds tightening that has been needed to do so in the past   One might think that with eight weeks to go until the next meeting and with the possibility of   the soft patch expiring soon and removing the dampening effect on out-year inflation expectations,   we run the risk of being overtaken by events and rising inflation pressures  I tend to think, however,   that market participants understand our preferences well enough that the yield curve will react   sensitively to the data should inflation risks pick up We should be sure that our communications   don’t inhibit that process    I have a comment on process  I appreciate the earlier distribution of Table   1, which is a procedure we decided on at the last meeting  On reflection, I’d like to register some   reservations about it It has the effect of shifting substantive deliberations out of the Committee, and   it prevents us as Committee members from benefiting from the reasoning and thoughts of our   colleagues on the FOMC We don’t know what other members are communicating during the   period leading up to the meeting  I’m not sure exactly the right way to get around this, and I hope   we can revisit this topic sometime soon  But one possibility would be to have members submit their   suggested changes to Table 1 in writing Then, after the close of some suitable comment period, the   staff could distribute those suggestions so that we could glean what people are thinking when they   suggest changes to the language rather than having to reverse engineer via exegesis    I support 25 basis points and alternative B I agree that we should not   soften the statement at this meeting  And in fact, when I read alternative B, I interpreted it as   tightening somewhat by removing the statement about energy prices not having fed notably through                                    May 3, 2005 97 of 116  to core consumer prices  If anything, I was leaning toward a tighter statement, but I think   alternative B would serve us well right now   I want to again endorse President Yellen’s notion that we should look for an occasion to   remove the balance-of-risk assessment from the statement at the earliest opportunity  We can be   clear about what we are doing; I think it is hindering communication now  I also agree with her with   regard to President Poole’s memo  Unavoidably, we are communicating to the markets  And to   expect to do so by devising formulaic language that is going to last beyond a couple of meetings is   too optimistic on that score, I think   I also want to note that on the idea of an exit strategy I agree with you that it’s pretty hard to   envision a statement to accompany no rate change that would also induce markets to believe that   we’re sure to increase rates at the next meeting  I don’t care that much about the shape of the yield   curve between now and six months out, and I would prefer raising rates at the first meeting and not   at the second So, I think putting a fine point on it doesn’t make sense   Now, having said that, when we do get to a point where we pause, I think it’s going to be   important not to drain the sensitivity out of the yield curve  We do not want to convince markets   that we think we’re going to be done for several quarters or for a couple of years  We want to   maintain in markets some sensitivity to incoming data—to believe that we might move ¼ point   either way on the funds rate And because of that I’ve tried to avoid using the term “neutral” to   characterize the rate at which we will stop moving, but there are other approaches to that I suppose    So, again, I can support what’s on the table    It’s called the real bills doctrine    My understanding is that we’ve used it fairly often in the postwar period, in   the ’60s, ’70s, and ’80s—in early 1980, for example  My understanding is that it hasn’t worked   very well  There have been times when we’ve tried to jawbone the banking system’s allocation of   credit    Yes  I have just a couple of comments and a question  Clearly, there are   some perspectives from which housing prices seem to have drifted out of the usual relationship with   indicators of fundamentals, and Joshua documented some of them  But it seems to me as if there   are a lot of plausible stories one can tell about fundamentals that would explain or rationalize   housing prices  Obviously, low interest rates have to top the list  Strong income growth among   homeowning populations would be on the list, as would land use restrictions, which were   mentioned earlier, and the recent surge in spending on home improvement  I found President   Yellen’s suggestions intriguing  I’d like to offer my own, just in the spirit of adding potential   explanations here And it’s really a version of something Governor Kohn observed, which is that   housing prices are relative prices   I’ve been struck by the fact that a collection of large metropolitan areas increasingly   dominates the national housing figures and that house-price appreciation seems different across   various urban regions  It suggests to me that housing values may be affected significantly by—I   don’t know exactly how to phrase this—sort of the relative microeconomic value of agglomeration    By that I mean the value of the amenities in a city or the enhanced productivity associated with   living in or near where one works  Now, in this age of telecommuting and the Internet, it’s easy to   deduce that the value of living in a city has declined  But it seems plausible to me that the value of a   thick labor market might be increasingly important for certain skill specialties  And it also seems   plausible that the strong demand for urban amenities is evident in the recent vitality of many older                                         June 29-30, 2005 63 of 234  urban cores  So I’d be interested if any of our housing data experts have any information relevant to   that issue    While I have the floor, I’d like to make just an observation  It seems to me likely that a   confluence of several fundamental factors might rationalize the current level of housing prices  So   from that point of view, it’s hard for me to see how it would be reasonable to place a great deal of   certainty on the notion that housing is significantly overvalued, or that there’s a bubble, or that it’s   going to collapse really soon   I think these markets—this is echoing President Poole’s discussion—are too complex  I   think our quantitative understanding of them is too limited to warrant second-guessing market   forces And beyond that, the models that we have of bubbles—Glenn wrote it down—are just some   statistical noise added to an equation  I don’t think we have any models that give us any reason to   hope that we can understand how interest rate changes would affect this little random statistical term   added on to these equations    Having said that, housing prices pose a dilemma for us and are going to pose challenges for   us soon, I think  Rapid appreciations in asset prices can make monetary policy more difficult  They   tend to be associated with tightening labor markets  At the same time, there is a rise in the   downside risk So, even though I’m not very far down Glenn’s decision tree, these are still issues   I’m paying attention to  It feels as if it could well occupy our attention here   But I’d be interested in your reaction to this agglomeration story     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Economic activity in the Fifth District   advanced moderately in May and June  The survey results we released earlier this week showed   that manufacturing shipments edged higher and that revenues of service firms grew somewhat more   quickly this month  New orders in manufacturing seemed to slip this month, however  Growth in   retail sales moderated in June, as our big ticket sales index contracted slightly after having moved   sharply higher in May  District housing markets remained fairly hot—maybe not as hot as Miami,   but fairly hot  Home sales continued at high levels  Bids above asking prices were common in   popular locations  Markets for beach properties and for condos in downtown areas are especially   strong Business optimism seems to be holding up  Survey respondents expect the pace of demand                                  June 29-30, 2005 136 of 234  growth to pick up over the next six months  Our contacts also expect an upturn in capital spending   growth over that period, and price pressures in the District remain contained   Indications are that the national economy continues to perform well, although concerns   about the housing market and energy prices are causing jitters in some quarters about the   sustainability of the expansion  Average net job growth for the three months ending in May   exceeded 150,000 per month—a rate sufficient to keep up the steady improvement in labor markets   we’ve seen since last year  And the Greenbook expects real GDP to average above 3½ percent   through the end of 2006, slightly faster than potential   To me, the most striking revision in the June Greenbook was the 02 increase in the   projected path for core PCE inflation through 2006  Expected inflation is now 21 percent for ’05   and 19 percent for ’06 I found this revision striking, because 2 percent is the upper limit of my   own comfort zone for core PCE inflation  Moreover, market participants are aware that the core   PCE index is the Fed’s preferred inflation measure  And if we allow it to drift much above 2   percent, we run the risk of unhinging longer-run inflation expectations, especially if energy prices   spike up further as well   Having said that, I take heart from the fact that inflation expectations have fallen somewhat   in the past couple of months  TIPS inflation compensation, both near-term and longer-run, has   continued to decline even in the face of climbing oil prices  Of course, inflation expectations build   in beliefs about our future behavior  I read declining inflation compensation, along with the   apparent fall in inflation uncertainty for which Vincent’s staff apparently finds evidence, as   implying that markets expect us to do whatever is necessary to hold the line on inflation     I see three main risks to the outlook  First, with oil markets as tight as they are, the world   economy is obviously vulnerable to a supply disruption that could send prices significantly higher                                       June 29-30, 2005 137 of 234  Second, we’ve been anticipating a handoff from housing investment to business investment over the   course of this recovery  While business investment has continued to pick up, the demand for new   capital appears to be limited now by the rate at which firms expect their output to grow  So the   potential problem is that businesses may be reluctant to pick up more slack before they see that   housing is headed for a soft landing  Yet that reluctance would interfere with or impede a smooth   handoff, making it more difficult to achieve    Third, I find myself worrying about the possibility of an inflation scare in the bond market,   despite the recent decline in TIPS spreads  It’s not clear how likely this is, but if it happened, it   would be very costly  A spike in long-term yields could be particularly harmful today for elevated   housing prices  It would raise long-term mortgage rates directly, obviously  Moreover, it would   force us to raise short-term real rates  And in such circumstances I think it would be even harder for   us to facilitate this handoff of investment from the housing sector to the business sector without an   intervening recession  Thank you    I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman    Yes, I have a question and a comment  The question is whether the   revision in the nonmarket core PCE price index should cause people to revise the number they   carry around in their heads for the documented upward bias in the PCE    I was asking if this corrects any known sources of bias  If you’re   looking for sources of bias and document them, and this doesn’t affect any of those, then it   strikes me that it shouldn’t change our notion of the upward bias, right?    We should still think it’s X    All right Thanks My comment has to do with your line of questioning,   Mr Chairman  It doesn’t seem to me from the models I’m aware of that reaching that wall, as   you put it, has to result in an acceleration of nominal things as opposed to real things, which   would accelerate The late ’90s seems to me a good example where our credibility—the way we                                August 9, 2005 26 of 110  were expected to conduct monetary policy—allowed that link to be broken  Is that consistent   with your interpretation of the ’90s, Mr Chairman?    Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Incoming economic data since our last   meeting have been consistent with a reasonably paced recovery and well-contained inflation    Payroll employment has been solid  It has even accelerated a bit lately, indicating steady   improvement in overall labor market conditions  The ISM [Institute for Supply Management],   industrial production, retail sales, and durable goods orders all came in stronger than anticipated,   and the GDP report exceeded what was expected in the June Greenbook   The recent strength in business investment bodes well, I think, for the ability of that   sector to take the baton from the housing market should it wane  For now, though, households   seem confident enough in future income prospects to continue to expand spending, particularly   on durable goods and housing Thus, the outlook for the remainder of the year is brighter now,   and the Greenbook has marked up second-half real GDP by ¼ point                                 August 9, 2005 41 of 110  Our information on the Fifth District’s economy is broadly consistent with the national   outlook Retail sales picked up markedly in July, as shopper traffic and big-ticket indicators both   rose significantly Employment growth in the sector seemed to moderate last month, however,   unlike the national figure In the service sector outside of retail, revenue growth picked up and   employment continued to expand at a steady pace   Manufacturing shipments rose modestly in July, but new orders declined  Excluding the   ailing textile industry, things look much better but still registered a bit of a slowdown in July    Employment in manufacturing continues to decline  Our surveys indicate that price pressures   remain well contained in our District in both the manufacturing and service sectors  And the   housing market in our District remains quite robust   In response to the stronger real outlook, the yield curve has shifted up significantly  The   10-year Treasury yield has risen over 40 basis points since just before the June meeting, and the   5-year yield rose 47 basis points as of a couple of days ago Market participants are now   expecting substantially more tightening this year and next year—an assessment with which the   Greenbook concurs The federal funds rate is now expected to reach 4¼ percent by mid-2006,   an upward revision of about 50 basis points since our last meeting   In comparison, inflation expectations have been remarkably stable  Inflation   compensation, as measured from the TIPS [Treasury inflation-protected securities] curve, has   increased only 5 basis points at the 10-year horizon since the June meeting and has actually   fallen at the 5-year horizon—and this despite the fact that oil prices have risen substantially on   net   It’s quite striking that the stronger real outlook over the intermeeting period has led to   higher expected real interest rates and little change in expected inflation  Stable inflation                   August 9, 2005 42 of 110  expectations are obviously a good thing, although they are stabilized right now at the upper end   of my comfort zone and I’d be happier if they were ½ point lower  What’s really impressive,   though, is the public’s belief that we will move the funds rate by whatever amount necessary to   prevent stronger real prospects from showing through to future inflation  Our past behavior and   communications evidently have given people a fair amount of confidence that we will allow   short-term real rates to fluctuate as needed in response to changing fundamentals     This, Mr Chairman, was the idea behind the question I asked you earlier  The issue is   whether the economy might be able to withstand fluctuations in capacity utilization or the output   gap, or however we measure it, without necessarily having these real relative price changes that   are naturally going to occur in that circumstance pass through to overall inflation  This implies,   however, a fairly flexible outlook for policy rates, even if market measures of expected inflation   do not move around very much  I think one of the most important challenges we are going to   face over the next year or so will be to preserve and enhance this confidence the public has in the   responsiveness of policy to evolving economic fundamentals  Thank you    I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman  I’m relatively agnostic   on language, though I slightly prefer President Poole’s suggestion on section number four  If I   were going to put my two cents in, I might suggest adding something along the lines of an   “unwelcome further rise in inflation,” but I’ll wait    Yes I want to ask you about the effects of Hurricane Katrina on output    and potential output You read off a list of effects  Obviously, there has been some destruction   of capital stock Workers have been displaced; there has been a break in relationships between   them and their employers, and obviously there will be some sort of search process to reconnect   them with the labor market  And then there are the transportation disruptions  Those all seem to   me like factors that affect productive capacity, and I would have expected them to appear as   changes in potential output So I’m curious as to why output changes by more than potential    Well, the reason I ask has to do with high-frequency movements  You   used the word “structural” there, which tends to be associated with slowly moving trends—   variables with bars over them or that kind of thing  And in an instance like this, I think a key   factor is the extent to which some high-frequency or rapid change in productive capacities may   have taken place  So, I question sort of letting it all be in the output gap and then saying, “Well,   in two quarters the output gap will be back to where it was”  Given the way the output gap   appears in theoretical models that we use to teach people how to think about policy, this would                               September 20, 2005 18 of 117  invite them to think about policy in the current period differently than if the empirical estimate   had potential changing fairly sharply along with output in the current period  That’s the reason I   ask    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Fifth District economic activity appears to   have expanded at a quicker pace from mid-August through mid-September  For the most part,   production and sales in our area were not substantially affected by Hurricane Katrina  Shipments   from District factories accelerated from August’s modest upturn, and new orders grew for the   first time since May  Service firms reported faster growth in their revenues, and they maintained   the moderate pace of hiring seen in early August  Retailers told us that overall sales grew   modestly Labor market conditions remained solid, with District job growth maintaining the   moderate pace of recent months   Hurricane Katrina had relatively few real effects in our area, as I said, causing only some   scattered and short-lived outages of gasoline and interrupting raw materials shipments to a small   number of manufacturing firms  In addition, higher gasoline prices, combined with fears of   availability, seemed to curtail tourist activity over the Labor Day weekend  Another hurricane,                            September 20, 2005 61 of 117  Ophelia, battered the Carolina coast last week, but preliminary assessments suggest it was not   any more damaging than the typical, run-of-the-mill hurricane    While several of our contacts tell us that higher fuel costs will squeeze profit margins, the   majority tell us that they are passing on cost increases to their customers  Many firms report that   customers are more receptive to price hikes in the current environment  With about half the   responses in as of yesterday morning, preliminary results from our September business surveys   are showing that both prices paid and prices received are rising at a quicker pace than in August,   and expected price trends have generally ratcheted up as well    Turning to the national picture, the Greenbook’s forecasts for output and its components   appear broadly consistent with private forecasters and with what we were hearing from our Fifth   District contacts Prior to Katrina, the economy was growing at a reasonably strong pace but   with some signs of inflation pressures rising from elevated oil prices  And the real effects of the   hurricane that are projected in the Greenbook forecast appear quite plausible, given the   difficulties of assessing the temporal extent of the disruptions to economic activity   But on the inflation side, the Greenbook forecast paints a picture that I find somewhat   distressing The staff’s inflation forecast has been steadily drifting up over time—as shown, for   example, in the fine new table on page 21  [Laughter]  And it was revised up markedly for this   meeting  Core PCE inflation is near 2½ percent throughout 2006 and does not fall below 2   percent until 2007 Inflation expectations move upward as well, which causes growth in   compensation and unit labor costs to step up significantly at the beginning of next year  This   would put inflation appreciably beyond a range I view as consistent with price stability                            September 20, 2005 62 of 117  While the real, quantitative effects of the hurricane are uncertain at this time and may   prove more moderate than first feared, the qualitative implications for short-term real rates seem   quite clear to me  A real interest rate is, of course, the price of current resources relative to   forgone future resources, and for a number of reasons Katrina has caused a temporary scarcity of   current resources A portion of the capital stock in the affected region has been destroyed or   damaged, and workers have been separated from employers  It will inevitably take time and   resources to rebuild the capital stock and reestablish productive labor market matches   The good news is that these effects are likely to be relatively short-lived  Within a year   or so, we are likely to be back to more or less where we would have been in the aggregate  But   this means that, if anything, Katrina should cause real interest rates to rise to encourage   adjustment to the temporary scarcity of current resources  The fiscal response to the disaster   points in the same direction regarding real rates  The sustainability of federal deficits was   questionable prior to Hurricane Katrina, and the spending amounts being proposed for hurricane   recovery efforts just strengthen the case for tighter policy   I think we have to be careful about reasoning on the basis of the gap between current   output and estimates of potential output  Some estimates appear to identify the decline in   potential primarily with a small estimated effect of lost capital  Such approaches see the supply-  side effects of Katrina as minimal and, therefore, interpret most of the decline in output as a   shock to aggregate demand   This makes it tempting to a naive policymaker to consider counteracting the   macroeconomic effects with easier policy  But all of the real resource effects of Katrina of                            September 20, 2005 63 of 117  which I’m aware amount to reductions in our current capacity to produce goods and services    Lower real interest rates can do little to counteract these reductions   I think we should be careful about the widely cited analogy in the public press to the   1970s when oil supply shocks were subsequently followed by recessions  I say this recognizing   that several participants around the table were somewhat closer to monetary policy than I was   then But in the 1970s, inflation expectations were untethered, and people came to expect us to   allow energy price shocks to feed through to overall inflation  We often confirmed that   expectation by keeping real interest rates from rising  In fact, at times, we kept nominal rates   from rising as fast as inflation and, thus, real rates fell  We were then forced to raise rates   dramatically to bring inflation back down and, in the process, exacerbated the real effects of the   oil price shocks   So, to interpret the effects of Katrina as signaling an imminent shortfall of aggregate   demand is to draw the wrong lesson from the 1970s, in my view  The right lesson for us today is   the importance of keeping inflation expectations anchored in the face of this shock  At our last   meeting, we noted the relative stability of longer-term inflation expectations as measured by the   TIPS inflation compensation numbers, even in the face of sustained oil price increases  But the   behavior of the fed funds futures prices and the TIPS curve since Hurricane Katrina suggest to   me that our credibility is seriously incomplete, in the sense that many market participants appear   to think that we might be willing to tolerate elevated inflation for some time in an attempt to ease   the real effects of the hurricane  Our action and statement today should provide the public with   greater certainty about our near-term intentions  Thank you    I support your recommendation    Yes  I apologize for even asking this  I may have become color-blind this   morning, but I can’t tell which firms are which at the bottom of page 3  There are two tiers, right?    Don’t tell me all of them, but which ones are at the bottom?     Thanks     Dave, I would like to ask a little more about the Greenbook baseline  First,   tell me more by way of characterizing the path of inflation expectations  And second, characterize   the forces and the relative weights that bring core inflation down in the second half for next year     How much of the acceleration that you describe in inflation expectations   occurs from here out?  You talked about a certain amount from ’03 to now    Yes  On this point, what President Poole is suggesting is well posed  It’s a   forecast conditioned on replicating sort of an arbitrage-free set of observable financial asset prices   going forward  I don’t want it, though, because I want a mixture of the information that is conveyed   by the market and the staff’s judgment  I want a combination of that  The approach you suggest is   a useful exercise to ponder  But as long as the staff is clear about how their assumptions differ from   those embodied in market prices, I’d rather see a combination, personally     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Recent data confirm that economic activity was   growing at a solid pace pre-Katrina, and we appear to have remained on track since then, at least on   an ex-hurricane basis  The direct effects of the storms appear to be limited to the disruption of   productive capacity along the Gulf Coast  Outside of the affected regions, real activity continues to   expand, as suggested by the September industrial production report and the third-quarter GDP   figures   In our District, there are few signs that this year’s hurricanes have directly affected real   economic activity In fact, we’ve seen a broad pickup in activity since August  Our October   manufacturing survey indicates that shipments, orders, and employment grew at or above the   previous month’s pace  Services firms also reported strengthening revenue growth in both                                      November 1, 2005 39 of 114  September and October, and retail sales increased moderately in both months, as broad sales   increases outweighed a drop in auto and light truck sales   Concerns about the macroeconomic effects of these hurricanes obviously center on the   significant bulge in energy prices  The continued growth in nominal consumer spending ex-autos   since Katrina is evidence that the effects of energy price increases have not yet dampened household   demand, and there seems to be little indication of a hurricane-induced downshift in investment   demand either  So the evidence is consistent with my hypothesis that the hurricanes are essentially   a supply disruption with little independent effect on demand, and thus, the real interest rate path   should be, if anything, higher than it otherwise would be   A second concern regarding the macroeconomic effects of the hurricanes is the potential for   energy prices to pass through to core inflation  Here the recent news on core prices has been   encouraging  Core PCE inflation came in at 13 percent for the third quarter and has averaged 15   percent since March, right where I think we would like it to be  One would expect most of the pass-  through to take a couple of months to materialize, however, and in that regard there are several   unsettling signs worth noting  Within the Fifth District, for example, our surveys show a surge in   prices paid for both manufacturing and services over the last two months  Moreover, the average   reported rate of increase in prices received in both surveys has accelerated significantly in   September and October   Consistent with these quantitative signals, a larger number of our contacts now say they’re   able to pass through part or all of their increasing costs to their customers  In addition, the average   rate of price increase our respondents see for six months ahead has also surged, and our index for   expected wage increases in manufacturing has skyrocketed to over 56 for October  This diffusion   index has a midpoint of zero, and it had been averaging below 30 recently  So a reading of 56 is                                         November 1, 2005 40 of 114  consistent with the anticipation of a fairly broad-based upswing in inflation, although obviously it   could just be a false alarm   Another unsettling sign is the recent behavior of TIPS inflation compensation measures    These have drifted up a couple of tenths since June and are now bouncing around in the   neighborhood of 26 So I think we were right to downgrade inflation expectations from “well   contained” to merely “contained” in our last statement, and I think we should view a further erosion   of inflation expectations as unwelcome   The extent to which energy price increases pass through to core inflation is fundamentally   determined by the public’s expectations regarding future monetary policy  My sense is that we have   just a brief window to head off such pass-through should it threaten  The Greenbook does foresee   significant pass-through, with the core PCE inflation rising to 24 percent in the first half of next   year and then gradually falling back down to under 2 percent  Inflation expectations appear to trace   out a similar hump-shaped path  In the face of this outcome, the Greenbook has us raising the funds   rate to 4¼ percent in December and then stopping there for a year, at least ¼ point short of where   markets expect us to go    I would question the plausibility of this joint outcome  First, I do not think we would or   should stand by while inflation prospects erode as noticeably as they do in the Greenbook  Nor do I   think we could count on inflation expectations to gently drift back down after surging as the   Greenbook expects—at least not without forceful action on our part   For today, I’m comfortable with the alternative B statement  But should more definite signs   of pass-through emerge in coming months, we should be prepared to communicate forcefully and   convincingly our intention not to accommodate a deterioration in core inflation of the magnitude   portrayed in the Greenbook                                              November 1, 2005 41 of 114    I support your recommendations, Mr Chairman, and I support the statement   I just want to register a thought or two about language  As we approach December, I recognize that   the change in language that everyone is anticipating is a change that would be associated with   stopping or at some point moderating the pace at which we increase the funds rate  I, like Don   Kohn, have always interpreted “accommodation” to mean the rate is less than what we think it’s   going to be after the next meeting  I can’t think of another coherent way to interpret that  I think   that is always what it has meant   In that regard, there are lots of words that people use that involve implicit counterfactuals    The word “neutral” is one, for example; the word “equilibrium” is another one I understand very                                                 November 1, 2005 96 of 114  well the mechanics of what the Bluebook does, but that to me doesn’t correspond to a path our   economy could conceivably get to from where we are now  So it has always troubled me for us to   make reference to these fairly complicated and elaborate counterfactual simulations in describing   interest rates And I’d be reluctant to go in the direction of the formulaic option that Vincent put   before us yet again—with compliments for his persistence—that makes reference to something   that’s clearly off the equilibrium path   Let me mention another thought about language  I recognize that some around this table don’t   share as heightened a sense of concern about an uptick in core inflation as I do  My fear is that that   has some positive probability  And if at some point we feel about a rise in core, if it should move   up, the way we felt about a fall in core in mid-2003, I think we would find it desirable to   communicate our dissatisfaction with that and our intention to prevent it  Obviously, our sequence   of communications in mid-2003 had some fits and starts, but it was ultimately the communication of   our intentions that stabilized expectations  That established sort of an effective floor to the level of   inflation that market participants thought we were willing to tolerate  And I worry about changing   the statement in a way that everyone associates with a pause when there’s still a likelihood out there   that we may have to engage in a communication exercise of another sort  I’ll leave it at that     I share President Poole’s longing for more understanding of the productivity   forecast My understanding is that what you call “structural” is essentially a moving average  I’m   interested for this forecast, since there is such a big markup in that, to know the extent to which the   markup in the structural productivity outlook is merely an arithmetical consequence of a moving                                          December 13, 2005 24 of 100  average that had some recent upside data come into it  And the description about how you’ve altered   your forecast included a reference to a technical factor that I think went over my head  Can you help   us with that?    If it’s too much, we could do it offline  And more broadly, I’m interested in   understanding the framework you have for forecasting this  It’s not clear how that works  If there is a   memo or paper that you could refer me to that laid out all the machinery, I’d really appreciate it     Okay  If I could just follow up for a second In the late ’90s, your forecast of   productivity growth seemed to display a cyclicality—almost a responsiveness to recent productivity   growth—that in hindsight took it up above where productivity growth came in and then down below   it Are you worried about the sensitivity of your forecast to recent data?    Okay I didn’t realize that  Thanks                                            December 13, 2005 26 of 100   Thank you, Mr Chairman  On balance, economic activity is growing at a   solid pace in the Fifth District, though auto sales are faltering and housing markets are cooling  On   the upside, employment conditions have been strengthening, with signs that the job numbers are   increasing even at District factories  Outside of autos and big-ticket items though, retail sales   strengthened substantially this month  Retailers indicate that holiday sales are solid, and they’ve   become more optimistic about prospects for the first half of ’06  Auto sales are weak, though, and   SUVs remain unpopular even after the season’s first snowfall  Services firms are also upbeat, with                                   December 13, 2005 41 of 100  revenues and employment growing over the last two months  Home sales remain at high levels but   we are receiving widespread reports that activity is decelerating, particularly in northern Virginia   where markets have been quite robust in recent years  A number of independent reports describe “a   return to normalcy” in residential real estate markets, with houses actually being on the market and   not getting multiple bids on the first day  Manufacturing continues to hold its own  Although   shipments and new orders were softer in early December, the hiring index was up for our District, and   firms have become notably more optimistic about their early ’06 prospects   District price pressures seem to have eased somewhat in December  Although retail prices   were reported to have advanced at the same strong pace as in November, outside the retail sector   services’ prices have decelerated from October to December  Manufacturing price gains peaked in   November in our series, and our preliminary numbers show that both prices paid and prices received   slowed sharply this month   Turning to the national economy, we’ve received a string of favorable data since our October   meeting, suggesting both that the economy had considerable momentum prior to this fall’s storms and   that the effects of the storms on economic activity outside the affected region and the energy sector   have not been as large as feared  I’m particularly encouraged by the continued strength in business   investment spending in the present quarter, as evidenced by capital goods orders and the ISM   numbers I’m also encouraged by anecdotal reports of a cooling in District and national housing   markets  These reports are consistent with a continuing handoff from residential to business   investment  That said, I’m tempted to paraphrase Solow, though, and say that the slowdown in   housing appears to be visible everywhere but in the housing activity data  [Laughter]   Consumer spending has held up quite well  My sense is that the most important source of this   stability and strength is households’ beliefs about their real income growth in the near future  For this                        December 13, 2005 42 of 100  reason, given the Greenbook forecast for income growth in the near term, I would not expect a   flattening of housing prices to seriously dampen consumer spending  Rather, I expect, consistent with   the Greenbook, consumer spending growth to come in on the strong side going forward, with the   saving rate rising only slowly   The inflation picture has also improved notably since our last meeting, in my mind  The   October core PCE number was heartening, and inflation expectations have been well behaved  Both   survey measures and TIPS compensation spreads have come down off the post-Katrina highs they   reached earlier this fall   While the inflation picture is somewhat better, it does leave some room for concern, in my   view  This Greenbook forecasts a 22 percent core inflation rate for the first half of ’06, less than the   last Greenbook, but it still makes me somewhat uncomfortable With oil prices appearing to have   found a stable range in the neighborhood of $60 a barrel and with natural gas prices remaining high   and volatile, I think it will be several months before the risk of pass-through can be completely put to   bed As for the econometric evidence about pass-through, I’d note that expectations regarding our   policy response represent a latent variable that of necessity is omitted in most econometric exercises    I take less comfort from the econometric evidence than you do, President Yellen  Our preemption   may be required for the pattern you found in the ’90s to actually continue to be confirmed in the data   In the meantime, I think we need to ensure that the public understands our resolve with regard   to inflation  And the real funds rate in the neighborhood of 2 percent is very likely too low for an   economy that’s in a sustained expansion with relatively full resource utilization  So I think it’s   appropriate to follow through today with a 25 basis point increase in the funds rate    I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman, and I support alternative B   We’ve been engaged in a very constructive dialogue over the last week or two—or several weeks—   about how to remove some of the elements of our statement that have been mainstays for some time    I think it’s important for the rationale paragraph to end with a reference to inflation pressures   remaining a concern  I think the risk statement the way it’s formulated in row 4 accomplishes its task   in the most sensible and straightforward way, by clearly just stating outright what we think is going to   be required to maintain balanced risks   With regard to the word “measured,” when it was originally deployed it clearly meant less   than or equal to 25 basis points  I’m not quite sure it retains that strong an association to that  I think   it’s unlikely in the current situation that dropping “measured” would be interpreted as opening the   door for a 50 basis point move, but I don’t have a strong opinion one way or another  So I’m happy   either way regarding the word “measured”   Looking ahead, I think that the challenge for us is going to be how to communicate a reaction   function, meaning how the pattern of incoming economic data is going to map into our choice of a   policy rate  In particular, the challenge for us is going to be how to communicate about that reaction   function when we get to a point where we want to rest for a meeting or two  That discussion is   obviously for another day, but I think it will be important to avoid language at that time that   encourages the public to place too high a probability on the rate remaining unchanged for an extended   period I say that because if the public thought we were locked in for a long time, it might undesirably                                               December 13, 2005 73 of 100  dampen the yield curve’s sensitivity to incoming data  That would be unfortunate  So, those are my   comments on the statement  Again, I support your recommendations     Very respectfully, Mr Chairman, I’d like to vote against the foreign   currency operation authorization  Those of you who were here when my predecessor registered a   similar dissent three years ago, and three years before that, should be familiar with the reasoning    For those of you who were not here then, the case is very simple  Sterilized intervention can’t   possibly be more than fleetingly effective unless it serves as a signal regarding future monetary   policy operations  To the extent that such interventions are seen as providing such a signal, we risk   confusing the public regarding future monetary policy and threaten to compromise our   independence  And to the extent that such interventions do not signal future policy support and thus   January 31, 2006 6 of 106    have no lasting effect, we risk compromising perceptions of our competence  And neither outcome   is desirable  So very, very respectfully, Mr Chairman, I will decline to support the authorization     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Fifth District economic activity continued to   advance broadly in December and January  Service-sector employment and revenue strengthened,   and retailers reported generally strong sales and a pickup in hiring  In manufacturing, the signals   are mixed  Shipments flattened out in December and turned down in January, and our new orders   index turned negative as well  At the same time, we’ve seen a very sharp rise in our index of   expected manufacturing shipments six months out  Major swings in this index do a pretty good job   of predicting subsequent upturns in orders and shipments  The last time we saw a rise nearly this   steep was at the beginning of 2002, and a sharp rebound in orders and shipments soon followed    While the figures for prices paid and prices received for both manufacturing and services have come   down off their November highs, they remain noticeably elevated, and measures of expected price   trends have moved up over the past two months   January 31, 2006 42 of 106    On the national economy, until I saw the fourth-quarter GDP report, I was thinking that   economic growth was on pretty solid footing  Friday’s report came in weaker than expected, of   course, but as Dave Stockton mentioned, it appears plausible that several temporary factors are at   work  So I continue to think that prospects for economic growth are pretty good this year  Both   employment and consumer spending are likely to continue expanding at a healthy pace, and the   fundamentals for business investment point toward fairly robust spending growth   At our last meeting, I, like many others, believed that the threat that energy-price increases   would pass through to core inflation and inflation expectations had diminished since the immediate   aftermath of Hurricane Katrina  However, I wasn’t convinced that the threat was entirely behind us,   and unfortunately, my concerns on that score remain  Oil prices have nearly returned to their   September highs  The fourth-quarter core PCE price index came in at 22 percent, 03 above the   Greenbook’s estimate, and the Greenbook has reversed course and marked up the ’06 inflation   forecast a bit  The staff is now expecting core PCE inflation to rise to 23 percent in the middle of   2006 and not to fall below 2 percent until 2007 and then only slightly below  This forecast   represents a bulge that is somewhat more extended than I would like to see  So, for today, I believe   we should strive not to move the near-term yield curve down   In the broader context of the historic nature of today’s meeting, however, it’s quite striking   that among the prominent subjects are a quarter-point bulge in inflation and the issue of whether   long-run and trend inflation should be 15 percent or 20 percent  Few now doubt whether the   Federal Reserve can or will keep inflation stable, a question that was seriously in play decades ago    Your leadership in the intervening years, Mr Chairman, completed the work begun by your   predecessor to restore the expectation of price stability that had been lost in the transition from the   prior commodity standard  Given the number of centuries that regime was in place, I believe future   January 31, 2006 43 of 106    monetary historians would be justified in marking the Volcker–Greenspan era as a millennial   transition  This achievement required altering public expectations about the trend rate of inflation   that we would tolerate  It also required substantially damping the association between strong real   growth and resurgent inflation  Moreover, it required demonstrating that there was no need for   adverse cost shocks to spawn higher trend inflation  The key to all of this, in my mind, was   establishing a pattern of predictable FOMC behavior that was well understood by the public    Leading this transition as you did, Mr Chairman, required tremendous acumen and tremendous   courage  Personally, Mr Chairman, I count serving with you, however briefly, as one of the   greatest privileges an economist could imagine     How do your inflation expectations evolve in your two simulations, and in   particular, how are they affected by policy?  Is it just through the effect of resource slack on actual   inflation?     Thanks     I support a ¼ point move today, Mr Chairman, and I support the language   in this statement  I’d be ready to support today moving to voting for the whole statement consistent   with the global march of democracy, but it’s hard to be against further deliberation, especially   within the Federal Reserve System  So I’ll defer to my colleagues and agree to that course of   action  [Laughter]     This suggests that the Bank of New York really paid a lot in opportunity   costs to hold those reserves early  Is that your sense?  And, if so, do you have a sense of why they   were interested in paying up to hold the reserves early?     Yes  But they could have lent them out later in the day at a lot more, right?       The opportunity cost at the end of the day was pretty high     Okay       Dave, I was struck by the alternative scenario in which productivity growth   is slower because, even with the Taylor rule in place, it makes inflation rise rather than nominal   compensation growth fall  So I was just wondering, does that result convey a lack of credibility in   the estimated Taylor rule, or what do you think is going on there?      Yes  I apologize  I haven’t learned the gestures yet  [Laughter]  I didn’t   practice them before the meeting  President Yellen, I wanted to ask you two things, and they’re   related in my mind  What’s your understanding of why the pass-through correlations declined in   the mid-1980s?  And second, if the interpretation has to do with policy, to what extent is that   empirical and natural rate relationship you were discussing earlier structural?  That is, to what extent   do different policy rules affect its slope and position?     I agree with everything you’ve said  That’s my hunch about why that pass-  through correlation fell as well  But then, in principle, shouldn’t an improvement in expectations   about policy have the capacity to make that relationship between resource utilization and nominal   inflation relatively flat?   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 43 of 167         Okay     Thank you, Mr Chairman  While we had some softer readings on our   District’s economic performance early in the year, recent measures have been noticeably stronger    Our survey results from March have come in since the Beige Book, and they show continued   strength in service-sector revenue growth, along with a sharp rebound in shipments, new orders, and   employment for the manufacturing sector  The retail sector, in contrast, has been weaker in   February and March  Some of the weakness is in furniture and may reflect cooling housing   markets  However, other retailers suggest that they are still experiencing givebacks following the   extraordinary sales growth they saw in January, and many remain optimistic about sales prospects   going forward   Several District businesses we talked to plan to increase investment in the months ahead    Their plans include not only computers and technology but also factory machinery  Labor markets   in our District seem to be getting tighter  In January, Districtwide unemployment stood at   41 percent, and we hear scattered reports of shortages of skilled workers, as you mentioned earlier,   along with some complaints that worker shortages are constraining production  I had heard   occasional references to worker shortages in past months, going back into last year, but this chatter   has picked up noticeably in recent weeks  Not only have the number of reports increased   somewhat, but some now come from outside the traditionally strong urban areas  We’re hearing it   now in the manufacturing-dependent Carolinas, for example   Price growth measures moderated in our March survey results  District businesses report   that input price increases slowed, but they continued to express concerns about future cost pressures    March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 65 of 167       Our respondents also reported slower growth in their output prices, and this was broadly based   across all sectors we survey  In addition, expected price increases for the next six months generally   lessened   Our regional economic indicators on production, employment, and price pressures seem   broadly consistent with the national picture  The data point to a strong rebound in GDP growth this   quarter, perhaps stronger than had been anticipated by the Greenbook and private forecasters    While household residential investment is slowing, business investment and spending appear to be   strong, suggesting that firms are adding to capacity in anticipation of healthy demand growth  The   prospects for income growth, driven by continued employment gains and respectable growth in   compensation, give me some confidence that overall consumer spending should hold up well, even   as housing market activity moderates   Inflation has come in a bit lower than expected, and I’m increasingly comfortable with the   idea that we’ve gotten beyond the risks to inflation presented by the shock associated with last   year’s hurricanes and run-up in energy prices  Core PCE inflation averaged 23 percent from   August through November but has averaged 18 percent from November through January    Although market-based measures of longer-run inflation expectations rose briefly last fall, they soon   subsided and have remained steady since  So while I’m not entirely sanguine about the inflation   outlook, I think the immediate risk of pass-through has probably passed us by   Looking back over this episode, and how we and many others feared that things might have   unfolded, I think it illustrates the challenges we face in trying to understand inflation dynamics  As   energy prices rose sharply last fall after the hurricanes, the fear was that a sustained increase in core   inflation and inflation expectations would work its way through the economy in the first half of   2006  This bulge now appears to have been small and short-lived   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 66 of 167       A common approach to forecasting the effect of energy-price shocks on core inflation is to   rely on relationships estimated over historical periods that include seemingly similar episodes  Such   an exercise implicitly treats the empirical relationship between energy prices and core inflation as   structural, as in models in which wages or prices are set in a backward-looking fashion  But as   President Yellen and others have emphasized, this relationship is not stable in the historical data  It   has largely disappeared since the late 1980s  This underscores the pitfalls of forecasting inflation   based on a backward-looking approach that relies on pass-through correlations or, for that matter,   Phillips curve correlations between measures of slack and inflation  In contrast, to the extent that   price-setting is forward looking, these correlations must embed expectations regarding our policy   behavior and so will not generally be stable across changing policy regimes   This perspective suggests that the limited magnitude of the pass-through from last fall’s   energy-price shocks was influenced by the public’s confidence that we would focus on preventing   broader inflationary spillovers  In other words, we may have gotten less pass-through than we   feared because we were more credible than we realized, and the public’s behavior was more   forward looking than we thought   Again, this is not to say that I’m complacent about inflation  The initial response to last   fall’s shocks embodied expectations of a lower path for the funds rate and a greater rise in inflation    Fortunately, the combination of communication by FOMC participants and the Committee’s steady   actions appears to have brought these expectations back in line   I bring all of this up because in the months ahead we are likely to see tighter resource   utilization if the Greenbook is correct, and we will be concerned about the extent to which that   would put upward pressure on inflation and inflation expectations  So the question of the extent to   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 67 of 167       which inflation dynamics are backward looking or forward looking is going to be front and center   for us     That’s right  It’s just that I’m always struck in episodes like this at the   difficulty of taking advantage of historical correlations without taking a strong stand on how the   public expects us to conduct policy     I am curious about the question Janet asked in a memo last week about   singling out slower productivity growth or—what was it?—productivity gains  Doesn’t that phrase   sort of convey some implicit theorizing?     Well, that seems be the point of the question  I was just wondering what   you thought about it     So it is consistent with the world in which the policy function we are   expected to follow has nominal compensation growth not responding to productivity growth   changes  Productivity growth changes, and it changes unit labor costs  It doesn’t change   compensation growth  So it has inflation responding to changes in productivity costs     Then it is a statement like these arithmetical contributions to GDP   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 105 of 167         Well, okay  It is a different statement     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’m reasonably comfortable with the   stability of inflation and inflation expectations right now  But, frankly, they’re a little on the   high side for my taste, and I say this with due appreciation of the calculation problems that   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 117 of 167       Governor Kohn alluded to  The expected CPI and the term spreads are running around   2½ percent  That seems high to me, but I’d be open to persuasion if the staff had information   that there was some inherent bias, that we shouldn’t take that as the center point estimate of the   distribution of the true rate of increase there    In thinking about the policy decision today, I judge that the public’s expectation of our   moving once after today and then taking a break, given the current state of the economy and the   near-term outlook, is pretty reasonable  But in thinking through the decision we are facing or are   going to face in the next couple of months about deciding where to stop, I find myself casting   about for ways to gauge what short-term real rates are going to need to be on a sustained basis   going forward  If you look back at the late ’90s—another period of sustained, fairly balanced   growth—two more ¼ point moves are going to put us at the lower end of the real rates we saw   back then  And taking that together with a sense that the world economy is strengthening now   and inflation is a touch on the high side suggests that further moves beyond 5 percent might be   necessary  On the other hand, forward short real rates are remarkably low, and that suggests that   price stability might require lower real rates than we otherwise would have thought  We might   have to come back down below 5 percent later on, as the market expects  But if I had to bet, I’d   bet on the first risk rather than the latter  In any event, I’d be happier moving market   expectations in the direction of the lower ultimate expected inflation rate, even if that meant   somewhat higher expected short real rates     I’ll repeat something I’ve said before and then comment on something Don said and   something Vince said  I agree with Governor Kohn that, when we do reach a resting point, we   should be careful to communicate in such a way that the public doesn’t place too much   probability on our staying fixed for a long period of time  Vince said that he is finding evidence   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 118 of 167       that the markets are looking to us rather than to the data, and perhaps it’s the case that   uncertainty about our intentions is distracting markets from reacting to the incoming data  I just   mention this in the context of row 4  The logic of the balance-of-risk assessment is not to   express our intentions or express what we’re going to do with policy, really, but to sort of ask the   public to reverse-engineer things from our signal about what we’re going to do with interest rates   a couple of months ahead    It strikes me that, when we get around to reconsidering the statement later this year, it   would be useful to step back from that whole logic and think it through on a more fundamental   basis  I think it would be preferable for the public to understand our intentions and for reactions   to the data to come in on that basis rather than for them to be hanging onto our words about our   intentions going forward  But that’s something that I’m sure we’ll work to clear up over time    So I’m fine with the statement as it is, theorizing and all, and I’m happy with the decision in   alternative B      Yes, I applaud the meeting format  I think it has gone really well  I   think you did a good job as interlocutor  Is that how you say it?  [Laughter]  I hope in upcoming   meetings that we can carve out a little time for understanding our different views about the   structure of economic relationships that underlie our policy views  And that would help take the   policy discussion deeper than the level of whether you think the yield curve is too hot or too   cold     My sense is that the broad conventional way of thinking about how we would   implement interest on reserves is to pay a rate of interest somewhat below the federal funds target rate    My sense is that the conventional view emerged at a time when we were less transparent about our   targeting of the funds rate  The Chairman asked you whether it would be an operational problem for   you  The natural thing, if you’re pegging the funds rate, is to use the rate of interest on deposits to do it,   so you don’t have to estimate where the demand curve for funds lies every day  Have you folks thought   about whether paying interest on reserves at the target rate would be a feasible mechanism?     I intend to vote “no” on this motion for the reasons related to those I gave in   January for voting against the foreign exchange authorization  a general sense of opposition to our   central bank’s being involved in foreign exchange operations, much less lending to foreign central   banks     David, I noted an alternative scenario in the Greenbook in which inflation   expectations are unanchored, and the description of the scenario says that inflation expectations end up   ½ percentage point higher than in the baseline  I looked around for the baseline time series for inflation   expectations, but I couldn’t find it  What are they?     I appreciate your answer  Let me tell you what motivated my question First   was the broad concern about inflation  But, second, in looking at the Greenbook and thinking through   May 10, 2006 18 of 120    the outlook, I see that inflation expectations held by market participants are a key conceptual anchor for   us  I note that you tell us quantitatively about other sorts of latent variables—for example, the NAIRU   and potential output  I thought perhaps inflation expectations deserved the same explicit quantitative   treatment in the Greenbook     I can appreciate that, but it comes up in our deliberations  Last fall, we were   talking about the reaction to Katrina, and you were showing us a scenario in which core inflation rose   and then fell in the first half of this year  I asked you what happened to inflation expectations along that   path, and they rose and then smoothly fell  For us to get a handle on whether that’s a reasonable   scenario, it helps to think through what would bring about a fall in inflation expectations like that and   whether they can vary at high frequency as they seem to have over the last month or two  But I don’t   want you guys penciling down numbers just to pencil down numbers  I appreciate the difficulties   involved     Yes  Just very briefly, I wanted to get a bit more of the benefit of your expertise   about how inflation expectations evolve  As you noted, they evolved slowly in the historical data  But   there are episodes, like the last couple of weeks, when I get the sense that they can move fairly rapidly     Does the baseline Greenbook forecast treat inflation expectations as evolving   relatively sluggishly, or are they capable of jumping?    May 10, 2006 24 of 120      Thank you, Mr Chairman  Our readings on the Fifth District’s economy very   much parallel those for the nation as a whole  I’ll be brief  Surveys show a marked pickup in   manufacturing shipments and orders in March and April and ongoing growth in services activities    Retail sales indicators edged higher in April  The real estate market showed signs that residential   activity is softening and commercial activity is firming   Our measures of District price pressures have stepped up significantly in recent weeks  In the   service sector, we ask about current price trends, and we get these quantitative measures and rates of   increase  In the service sector, the current inflation measure is back up to its post-Katrina peak and is   higher than at any time since 2003  We ask about expected six-month inflation  For the service sector,   that has drifted up since Katrina and is now at 32 percent, higher than at any point since our survey   began in the early ’90s  In the manufacturing sector, prices received rose 24 percent, also a record high,   and prices paid also surged in April  The vast majority of our contacts who have commented on this   believe that higher energy prices will persist throughout 2006, and about three-quarters of them say that   they will raise their prices in response   May 10, 2006 31 of 120    Turning to the national economy, on the real side the recent indicators have been generally   upbeat and point to continued healthy growth  I won’t enumerate them  Unfortunately, I think the   inflation picture has become substantially more troubling to me over the intermeeting period  The   March numbers, as others have noted, were certainly eye-catching  The core price index was up at an   annual rate of 39 percent, even restricting attention to the market-based components that Governor   Kohn prefers  [Laughter]   Of course, month-to-month numbers are noisy, as David indicated, but the core PCE index was   up at a rate of 25 percent over the past three months and 24 percent since August  In addition, the   outlook for inflation going forward has deteriorated as well, and we have had a fairly thorough   discussion in the Q&A, so I’ll skip my planned recitation of the indicators  My sense is that inflation   expectations have deteriorated markedly   I don’t want to be too alarmist  Inflation spreads are still a bit below where they were two years   ago, so I think it is possible to characterize inflation expectations as contained, although the size of the   requisite container keeps getting bigger and bigger as time goes on  [Laughter]  Right now it’s bigger   than I’d like to see  My concern is less about the current level of expected inflation than it is about how   those expectations have responded to incoming data  We saw an adverse move in inflation expectations   last fall after Katrina, accompanied by conjectures that we might pause  Inflation expectations seemed   to subside as retail gasoline prices fell, but I think it helped substantially that we stuck with our rate   increases and communicated pretty forcefully in the fall about our concerns about inflation   This time around, rising energy prices have led to upward revisions in market participants’   expectations about our policy path, along with upward revisions to their expectations regarding inflation    I would have been far happier, however, had they marked up their expected policy path by more and   marked up their inflation expectations by less, especially at longer horizons  I’m particularly distressed   May 10, 2006 32 of 120    by instances in the past several weeks in which the two moved in opposite directions  That is to say,   inflation expectations rose simultaneous with our expected policy path falling  President Yellen talked   about overreacting  Certainly no one wants to overreact, but I think in situations like this a distinct   reaction is warranted  Thank you     Yes, we do on the manufacturing side  We have prices paid and prices   received  In the service sector, we don’t distinguish; we just ask  And we have separate retail and   nonretail service sectors  On the manufacturing side, they are always pessimistic, so prices received   never seem as though they’re going up as fast as prices paid, especially in the last couple of years  But   over time, if you look at their movements from month to month, you can get a distinct sense  They   really moved up markedly in the fall, tapered off a little and softened in the winter, and now have moved   up markedly again and are at or above where they were before     As I said before, I think we are essentially okay on the real side, but my concerns   have risen about inflation  I recognize the potential for slowdown later this year, but my sense is that our   inflation problem is much more of an immediate issue for us  I think we have to take seriously the   possibility that inflation expectations might deteriorate further even though, as Vince said, they are within   the band that we have characterized as contained  My sense is that any statement today that moves the   market’s expected policy path down is going to cause inflation expectations to move up  That’s my bottom   line today, and I think we should strive to avoid that   Second, and here I will echo something I said and something the Vice Chair said, I am very   unhappy with the way in which markets have reacted over the past several weeks  As I said earlier, markets   marked up their expected policy path but also marked up expected inflation  It would have been better, in   my view, if they had marked up the policy path more and the inflation path less  I just do not see the utility   of the market’s believing in a reaction function for us that has oil price shocks pushing core inflation   materially higher when they occur   Our statement today is an important opportunity to influence the public’s understanding of our   reaction function, and that is the lens I am using to think about policy today  It is fine to say that policy is   going to be data dependent, but it is important how the public believes our policy is going to depend on the   May 10, 2006 76 of 120    incoming data  Unfortunately, we are at a difficult point here  The public is suspecting that a pause might   be imminent, and so increasing the statement’s emphasis on data dependence is likely to increase the   probability they assign to a pause and thus bring down the yield curve  As I said, I think that would be a   mistake  We need to strengthen the public sense of how strongly we intend to respond to increases in core   inflation  So this has to do with the slope of the reaction function  Ultimately the data dependence that the   market expects is going to be informed by the data dependence that the market actually sees  This is why I   proposed in my memo on Friday that we modify row 4 in alternative B to place more emphasis on inflation   risks  The way it is worded in the version that Vince just circulated does that very well—in fact, better than   I did  But in any event, whatever we do, we should strive to make sure our statement does not bring down   the expected policy     I can see that taking out “remain contained” would signal a change in our container   size that would probably confuse the markets, but I am broadly sympathetic to Michael’s point, and as   inflation expectations evolve further, I am going to be more sympathetic to that  With regard to five, taking   it out strikes me as likely to cause markets to view what is read in alternative B, part 4, as the rewording of   what is part 5 in the March statement, and so I do not think they are going to view it as a withdrawal of   substantive indication of the extent to which we are going to be outlook dependent  So I would be in favor   of taking it out     I have some more questions about latent variables  During my exchange   with David at the last meeting, I was asking about inflation expectations  I learned that you   didn’t have a single number for expected inflation but that there were multiple measures  You   offered to write a number down on an envelope for me but cautioned me against placing too   much reliance on it  You went on to say that there was something called “underlying inflation,”   and you spent a good deal of time talking about this  You even cited some numbers—said that it   was maybe 1 percent or 1½ percent in ’03 and that it had risen perhaps to 2 percent at the last   meeting  So I went and checked my New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics  I couldn’t find   “underlying inflation”  [Laughter]  I went to the BLS website and the BEA website; it wasn’t   there either  I asked some of my theoretical economists if they had seen any papers in the   literature that have models with underlying inflation, and I couldn’t find anything  So I’m   wondering what it is  I’m wondering what the number is now, how it has changed since May,   June 28-29, 2006 21 of 177    and whether it might be useful information for the Committee to contemplate when deliberating   about inflation policy      Thank you very much, David  I’m glad to hear that you’ve devoted so   much staff time to this, and I appreciate the effort  That number—expected inflation—isn’t the   objective  As you know, inflation dynamics are central to what we do  There is significant   scientific uncertainty about how policy interacts with those dynamics—in particular at times like   the past several months, when inflation expectations appeared to fluctuate substantially—and   there must be some interplay between our policy choices, communications, expected inflation,   and realized inflation  I was just looking for more insight into the staff’s accumulated wisdom   on these topics and was taking that expected inflation number as a thread to pull on to try to elicit   more visibility      Thank you very much  I appreciate that  I have one separate question   for David Wilcox  In exhibit 9, “Pass-Through of Energy Prices,” the middle panel reports on   some empirical work  When I try to find the counterpart in the model economy for the empirical   exercise you do, it’s hard to picture it not having embedded within it a policy reaction function    So I wonder, are you happy with our interpreting these numbers as measures of our credibility in   some sense, or do you have changes relating to this consideration over time?  I mean, isn’t that   what you’re measuring here?      Well, more broadly, if we’re not to take these as exogenous because   they reflect some public sense of our reaction function, we could strive to make them zero—that   is to say, to view these kinds of coefficients as something we’re going to influence over time      Thank you, Mr Chairman  Economic growth in the Fifth District eased off   the throttle a bit since our last meeting  Our June manufacturing survey released yesterday morning   continued to show nearly flat activity  Indexes for shipments and new orders were barely positive,   essentially unchanged from May, and down from strong readings for March and April  The service   sector, on the other hand, continues to display solid growth, with overall services revenues right on   their three-month average and retail sales rebounding after a dip in May  However, our big-ticket   index, which is dominated by car sales, remained weak  Employment indexes for both services and   manufacturing were positive in June, with a slight decline in the services sector but a substantial   gain in manufacturing  District housing markets remained reasonably strong  Sales and   construction activity have continued to slip from last year’s levels in many areas, but our contacts   June 28-29, 2006 39 of 177    do not seem surprised or panicked, and we continue to get reports of a pickup in commercial   construction activity  Price pressures remain elevated in the Fifth District, and expectations for   manufacturing price trends during the next six months remain about where they have been since last   fall, roughly 3 percent for prices paid and 2 percent for prices received  In the services sector,   expected price increases for the next six months exceeded 3½ percent for the second month in a   row, setting a new record high for this twelve-year-old index   Turning to the national economy, the Greenbook presents, as President Moskow noted, a   distinctly different picture from six weeks ago, perhaps most notably with regard to consumer   spending  Lower growth of household income since the middle of last year has led the staff to   reduce its estimate of the level of real disposable income this quarter 1 percent, and they have   reduced their estimate of consumption this quarter 04 percent  The Greenbook also marks down   consumption growth ½ percent in the second half of ’06 and ¼ percent in ’07    Now, it is certainly reasonable to expect lower current income to affect current consumption   expenditures, but I am inclined to revise my outlook for consumption growth by less than the   Greenbook  Growth in real disposable income is forecast to bounce back in the second half  So the   first-half decline looks more like a permanent reduction in the level of income than a permanent   reduction in the growth rate of income  I would have expected a corresponding effect on the path of   consumption, a one-time reduction in the level, with less of a reduction in forecast growth rates    The same reasoning for me applies to the downward revision that has been made to current   household wealth   This quibble aside, the outlook for the real side of the economy is softer than at the time of   our last meeting, but it still strikes me as broadly consistent with sustained growth fluctuating   around a trend near 3 percent  True, housing market activity has fallen more rapidly since the last   June 28-29, 2006 40 of 177    meeting than many, including the Greenbook authors, had expected, but the rate of decline has not   fallen outside a range that at the beginning of the year would have seemed plausible  While the   recent weaker-than-expected employment reports suggest slower job growth going forward, the   Greenbook employment forecast seems reasonably well aligned with demographic and labor force   participation trends  So on the whole, I would say that, despite the recent evolution of the economic   outlook as implied by incoming information, the real side of the forecast does not seem out of the   ordinary or terribly unsatisfactory to me   The inflation picture, on the other hand, does stand out and demand some attention  We   have just seen our worst three-month performance on the core CPI in more than eleven years,   38 percent, and the core PCE numbers are likely to be equally unfavorable  I agree with the   Greenbook’s assessment that special factors, such as owners’ equivalent rent, do not excuse recent   CPI behavior  Fortunately for us, inflation expectations have declined recently  The survey   measures and TIPS spreads have moderated somewhat since our last meeting  Still, inflation   expectations appear to be fluctuating around a level suggesting PCE inflation above 2 percent    Moreover, the Greenbook forecast now has year-over-year core PCE inflation remaining at   22 percent throughout the forecast period  To me this forecast is unacceptable   To forecast a bulge to 2½ percent followed by a return to below 2 percent, as the Greenbook   used to earlier this year, is one thing, but a plan for core inflation of more than 2 percent a year and a   half from now is another thing entirely  Surely in an eighteen-month period we can improve that   outcome, but I will leave until tomorrow a discussion of our policy options  For now I just want to   note that recent events provide some striking evidence that I think is likely to have an important   bearing on our strategy in the near term   June 28-29, 2006 41 of 177    Leading up to our last meeting, there were several instances in which markets had responded   to incoming news by marking up expected inflation and marking down the expected policy path,   which I took as evidence of instability in market participants’ views about our intentions regarding   inflation  Similar instability was evident in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Katrina as well    Since the last meeting, increases in the expected policy path have coincided with communications   by the Committee via statements, minutes, speeches, and interviews  This was documented in this   week’s Board briefings   The same appears to be true of reductions in expected inflation, I think  I take this recent   history as evidence that expectations regarding inflation and the conduct of monetary policy are to a   significant extent forward-looking and can be influenced by our communications  As I pointed out   earlier this year, the extent to which expectations are viewed as forward-looking or   backward-looking could well influence the desirability of various policy options, especially how   ambitious one wants to be about bringing inflation back in line  I also take the recent history as   suggesting the importance of clarifying the public’s understanding of how we intend to conduct   policy, even if we cannot provide definitive advance guidance about the numerical value of future   policy rate settings  Thank you     Bill, this isn’t the way people have been using “pass-through” around   here  I’ve taken “pass-through” to mean an increase in the overall core rate, and I think that’s the   way everyone else has used it  So the scenario you describe wouldn’t result in any pass-through,   the way for example President Yellen used the term  Am I right?        I understand that, Bill      As I said yesterday, although the outlook for real growth is noticeably   softer than it was at the last meeting, it doesn’t seem to me clearly inconsistent with growth   around trend going forward  I see the risk of slowing the economy overly much in the near term   by increasing real rates as relatively low   June 28-29, 2006 98 of 177     The way I look at the evidence, real short-term interest rates are still somewhat low by   historical standards  If you compare the periods of extended growth, such as the late 1990s, it   looks as though they come in between 3 and 5 percent and center near 4 percent or so, although I   know there are many ways to measure them  Right now it appears that, by the same sort of   measurement, the real funds rate is between 2½ and 3 percent  So I still sense that the real rate is   low by historical standards for a period of economic expansion like the one we seem to be in   now    My sense is that we may need to raise rates beyond today because it seems clear to me   that we’re not pleased with recent inflation or the inflation outlook  The rate of inflation has   been substantially higher over the past few months than we would like, and I think the level of   inflation expectations is too high as well, although I recognize some of the subtleties involved in   gauging inflation expectations accurately  Moreover, inflation expectations appear to be   unnecessarily fluctuating; we’ve been on something of a rollercoaster ride for the past few   months  Inflation expectations rose when the public wasn’t sure how we would respond to the   oil-price shocks, just as they did after Katrina, and inflation expectations came down as they did   last October and November only after we communicated our intentions  These ups and downs   really serve no useful purpose in my view    Last night at dinner, Rachel Lomax made a relevant remark about the extent to which   their regime anchors inflation expectations and causes firms to adjust to oil-price increases, not   by passing through but by cutting wages and costs elsewhere  I think that’s a relevant example   here  To say that some inflation currently is a consequence of oil-price increases is incomplete,   as we all know, because the extent to which oil-price increases pass through to overall inflation   June 28-29, 2006 99 of 177    is entirely a consequence of the policy reaction function that is either in place or is viewed as   being in place by the public    Now, I’m not going to claim that this is the end of the world  This isn’t the 1970s  I   think the credibility of our commitment to not let inflation rise to 10 percent is very secure  But   we ought to be able to improve upon a policy regime and an accompanying equilibrium in which   expectations for ten-year-ahead inflation fluctuate as much as they have over the past several   months  So I agree with Governor Kohn that we ought to raise rates at this meeting  We ought   to leave open the option in our statements that we could raise rates again  I think it’s very   important to use today’s statement to clarify our intentions regarding inflation; otherwise we’re   likely to be in for more rollercoaster rides in the months and quarters ahead    I have two concrete recommendations about the statement  First, note that on June 1 the   Chairman characterized recent inflation readings as “unwelcome”—a very important word that   harkens back to the word the Committee used in 2003 to communicate a lower bound on the   range of inflation rates the Committee considered consistent with price stability  We should use   that word again today in our statement to communicate that we do not view current inflation   readings as consistent with price stability  I’m afraid that failing to do so would be a glaring   omission and would unnecessarily perpetuate ambiguity about our intentions    My second recommendation about the statement has to do with the assessment of risk,   the first sentence in alternative B, row 4, that reads, “Although the moderation in the growth of   aggregate demand should help to limit inflation pressures over time, the Committee judges that   some inflation risks remain”  Placing anticipation of an aggregate demand slowdown front and   center in our assessment of inflation dynamics seems odd to me in light of all of the talk around   this table over the recent years about how flat the relationship is between aggregate demand and   June 28-29, 2006 100 of 177    inflation  Moreover, even with the sentence that follows it in that paragraph, it seems to imply   that we’re willing to simply wait for a moderation of inflation rather than take sufficient action   ourselves  Given the Greenbook’s forecast, it asks a relatively modest output gap to do a whole   lot of work  It also—but this is a sort of broader doctrinal issue—risks leaving the impression   that our methodology for controlling inflation is to manipulate aggregate demand, and I’m not   sure that’s entirely accurate    The assessment-of-risk sentence in alternative C would be much more appropriate than   the first sentence in alternative B  It states clearly what we would like to see happen with   inflation  “In order to foster price stability and a sustainable economic growth, the Committee   seeks a medium-term decline in core inflation from its recent elevated levels”  My sense is that   this is something that everyone around the table wants—a medium-term decline in core inflation;   if that’s the case, we ought to state it clearly to the public  These two changes would send a   much clearer message about our focus on inflation risks  Thank you, Mr Chairman       I don’t disagree with the importance of trying to assess the effect of our   statement on the immediate post-statement probability that the market places on our move in   August  But I’d just point out, by the time we get to August, the effect of intermeeting news on   that assessment will in some sense swamp this  How the markets react to that news and how   they view us as likely reacting to that incoming news are going to be important  I have   expressed some dismay at what has happened between the March meeting and now  I wasn’t   unhappy with the March-meeting post-statement assessment by the markets  I’m unhappy with   the way the markets reacted to the news, how they inferred that we’d react to the news that came   in  So I think that, although the focus on what the likelihood is of a move in August is important,   I don’t think we should lose sight of how we want markets to interpret incoming news and what   that means for our policy going forward      Just a couple of comments in response to a few things, if that’s all right,   Mr Chairman     First, the statement language that we’ve been using in row 4 to try to   influence the probability that we’d like to see immediately after the statement of the next move has   conflated two things  It has combined our assessment of the probability of various data coming in   and our intentions about how we’re likely to react to those data  As a result, when data come in,   they have a short shelf life, and not too far out into the intermeeting period the markets become   uncertain because we haven’t told them separately what our intentions are, what guides how we   respond to the data  That’s why I think alternative C, which says something about what we’re   about, is going to anchor inflation much better   President Stern, I take your comments to mean that you favor something that’s synonymous   with “unwelcome” but less coy, and I welcome that suggestion   June 28-29, 2006 132 of 177    We haven’t really given Vincent’s simulations, and the inferences that we can draw from   them about the feasible paths of inflation, a lot of discussion or scrutiny  I’d be interested to know   whether the way in which the evolution of inflation expectations is modeled in those simulations is   consistent with the possibility of more-sudden and faster changes in those expectations—as we saw,   for example, in the middle of 2003 and as seems to have taken place over the last two intermeeting   periods, though with small fluctuations  It strikes me that they leave out of the entire simulation the   possibility of our communications influencing those expectations in a more rapid way  This is a   debate that goes back three decades, and I don’t think we’re going to settle it here today  But my   reaction to those simulations is that it certainly seems plausible to me that we could establish more   rapidly in the public’s mind our intentions to aim for inflation at 1½ percent  And I don’t think we   should shy away from attempting to communicate in a way to help that process along   Stopping when core inflation is accelerating seems to me highly implausible  I doubt that   we would be willing to take that risk with the market  That’s exactly the problem we ran into in late   April with the JEC testimony  In the presence of declining inflation, the thing that people singled   out from that statement was the remark that we may pause even if inflation risks are on the high   side  That statement probably did more to call things into question in these last two intermeeting   periods than anything else  So, again, I think we need to focus on the way markets are going to   interpret news coming in and the way they’re going to understand how we’re going to react  That’s   why I’ve been harping on intentions     You could skip it  You could stay home     Actually I like missing my committee meeting  [Laughter]   June 28-29, 2006 143 of 177     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Fifth District’s economy remains   generally strong, though overall growth appears to have moderated in recent weeks  Retail sales   have been lackluster, especially for big-ticket items  Manufacturing shipments and new orders   picked up in July, however, and our early readings for August are even stronger in suggesting   additional momentum going forward  District labor markets remain tight, with workers in some   skill categories hard to find in urban areas and temporary workers in demand  The housing   market continues to slow generally, although markets differ significantly across our District    Current and expected price trend measures remain very elevated, according to our surveys, as   they have been for most of the year     August 8, 2006 41 of 158                         Turning to the national economy, I focused at our last two meetings on my concerns   about the deteriorating outlook for inflation, and the news over the intermeeting period has   heightened those concerns But today I think it is important that we also assess carefully the   outlook for output and employment  I’m pretty sure that I can safely do so without danger of   being viewed as an output nutter  [Laughter]   GDP growth has been choppy in recent quarters; but over the past year and a half, output   has been growing at about 3½ percent You get the same 3½ percent growth rate if you average   over the past three and a half years  We have substantially reduced the overhang of underutilized   resources over that period Employment has grown about 1½ percent a year, and the labor force   has grown at just a little over 1 percent  I think the evidence is now fairly persuasive that   resources are approximately fully utilized in the sense that significant amounts of idle labor or   capital do not seem to be awaiting the return of better times   What sorts of growth rates for output or employment are sustainable over the next two   years?  The labor force appears likely to grow at about 1 percent—that is, about 110,000 jobs per   month Labor productivity has been trending around 2½ percent over the past couple of years,   but I would be a bit more conservative going forward and expect about 2¼ percent per year,   closer to the long-run average  As a result, it seems reasonable to put the center point of an   estimate of a sustainable real growth rate at about 3¼ percent, with perhaps some extra above   that if you’re more optimistic about productivity growth   Is this trend our best near-term forecast?  Several factors could contribute to weaker real   growth Residential investment will contract in the coming quarters as the housing market cools,   and lower average housing-price appreciation will reduce household wealth gains and damp   consumption growth  The upward sweep in energy prices has taken a bite out of real disposable   August 8, 2006 42 of 158                            income as well, but I would expect real household spending to track real household income   going forward because both the housing-price adjustment and the energy-price run-up, so far at   least, look more like one-time reductions in household wealth and income and not like sources of   ongoing erosion extending out more than a year So I think it is reasonable to expect   consumption to grow at close to 3 percent, down a bit from the average of 3½ percent over the   past several years   Other factors seem likely to bolster growth  Business fixed investment spending has been   expanding quite strongly in this recovery  It is up at an annual rate of close to 7 percent since the   beginning of 2003, despite the sluggishness of structures until this year  In the second quarter,   BFI was up 68 percent year-over-year, and the most recent high-frequency indicators remain on   track BFI spending as a share of GDP is still quite low by historical standards; and as the   Greenbook points out, the fundamentals—business balance sheets and output growth—look   quite solid So it seems reasonable to expect business investment to continue to expand at a rate   close to 7 percent   Putting everything together, I expect growth over the next year and a half to be just under   3 percent, or just more than ¼ percentage point below potential  The Greenbook forecast is   weaker—GDP growth at about 2¼ percent for the next six quarters—mainly because the Board   staff sees lower business investment spending and a pronounced reversal in the household saving   rate   I think that a healthy respect for the uncertainty involved suggests that reasonable   confidence intervals around each of these forecasts—the Greenbook’s and my own and the   others I’ve heard today, for that matter—would include all the other point estimates and, more   important, would include the possibility that growth proceeds at potential over the forecast   August 8, 2006 43 of 158                   period and beyond So though it is reasonable to expect growth at or less than potential in the   near term, my sense is that it’s hard to be too certain that it will be much below for long   As I said at the outset, the inflation picture has only worsened  The surge in core   inflation that began in March has continued into June  The monthly pattern—37 percent in   March at an annual rate, 27 in April, 28 in May, and 29 in June—makes this episode look less   and less like a temporary bulge and more and more like a sustained increase  It is worth noting   that the current acceleration in core inflation is broadly based, as the Greenbook emphasizes and   President Poole ably articulated, and not attributable to any narrow set of special factors     The annual revisions to the national income and product accounts once again raised   inflation for past years, although not that much this time, as President Yellen noted  It now   appears that year-over-year core PCE inflation has exceeded 2 percent every month since April   2004 Perhaps the most striking change in the annual revisions, however, was in wages and   salaries The puzzle of compensation growth bulging in 2005 and slowing in 2006 is now gone,   and it is now clear that compensation is on a broad upswing  The Board staff estimates that   nonfarm business compensation per hour accelerated from a trend around 4 percent to something   over 5½ percent In fact, 54 percent was today’s release  Unit labor costs have deteriorated   accordingly and now show an annual rate of increase of 42 percent in the second quarter,   according to today’s release, and they are up 32 percent year over year  Before the NIPA   revisions, the behavior of unit labor costs suggested that the current increase in inflation was not   being incorporated into nominal wage compensation, but the labor cost data now show exactly   the opposite—that the acceleration of inflation in recent months has induced a broad acceleration   in nominal wages    August 8, 2006 44 of 158                      I find it hard to be confident that a surge in unit labor costs is likely to be absorbed by   falling markups  Measured markups have been trending up for some time, and I think they still   do after the revision Our economic understanding of the determination of markups, especially at   the macroeconomic level, is still quite limited  In many models, the markup is entirely a real   phenomenon and thus would be invariant with respect to purely nominal accelerations in costs    The main exceptions are the sticky-price models, but these don’t provide much comfort because   in them a high markup is a forecast of accelerating nominal marginal cost—that is to say, an   upswing in inflation So I don’t take much comfort from the high level of markups   Combining the growth and inflation outlooks, it is worth thinking carefully about the   extent to which we can expect slowing growth to bring inflation down  There have been a   number of skeptical comments about that hypothesis around the table today  The relationship   between output gaps and inflation is quite tenuous, as the staff rightly emphasizes whenever the   subject comes up Empirically, the ability to discover this relationship relies heavily on   recessions and, thus, is much less reliable as an indicator of the effects on inflation of a small   widening of the gap Indeed, at our last meeting and again today, David Wilcox characterized   the effect of the expected path of the output gap on inflation over the forecast period as tiny     The combination of uncertainty about the relationship between output gaps and inflation and the   uncertainty about the degree to which growth is likely to fall short of potential should, I think,   leave us deeply skeptical about whether we can rely on expected moderation in growth to bring   inflation down  It is unfortunate that so many commentators placed so much weight on that in   response to our last statement   Let me add a comment or two about President Yellen’s most excellent statement  I think   the insights she articulated about backward-looking inflation models breaking down and the   August 8, 2006 45 of 158                   different inflation dynamics in forward-looking models is very important for our policy   deliberations Her staff apparently has documented that inflation now looks more as though it’s   fluctuating around a sample average—I’ll say, a trend—and less as though it’s driven by output   gap measures  She concludes that we may see inflation fall faster than the Greenbook forecasts   do   I want to register a couple of observations  The first is that, with forward-looking   expectations, inflation behavior is far more sensitive to changes in the public’s beliefs about our   behavior than in models in which inflation expectations formation is backward looking  I’d   register just the possibility that the long-run expected inflation that the public believes applies   has been drifting around and may, in fact, account for some of the swings of measured inflation   around sample averages Finally, certainly taking the point of view that inflation expectations   are formed in a forward-looking manner makes more likely the possibility that inflation will   come down faster than the Greenbook states  But with inflation looking forward, it becomes our   responsibility to bring that about  So that happy outcome could require our action and our strong   communication, but I would welcome inspecting, if I could, the work of President Yellen’s staff,   and I welcome her contribution    As I outlined earlier, my sense is that, after having largely eliminated   resource underutilization, the economy is now fluctuating around potential  It’s attractive in   August 8, 2006 90 of 158                       circumstances like this to look back to similar periods for an independent gauge on the   appropriate level of real interest rates  From 1995 through 2000, another period of sustained real   growth around potential, the real federal funds rate relative to lagged core PCE inflation ranged   between 3¼ percent and 5 percent  Right now, the real federal funds rate measured the same   way is 29 percent This is handily illustrated, by the way, by the black line in the Bluebook’s   chart 8 You can do this calculation yourself using any number of alternative methods of   estimating inflation expectations, and you always get the same result  The real federal funds rate   was never this low between 1995 and 2000   As an aside, a deeper scientific analysis of the appropriate level of the real interest rate   would take into account the insight, dating back at least to Irving Fisher, that it ought to reflect   the relative balance of pressures on current versus future resources—intertemporal rates of   substitution, in other words Clearly, any gauge of that is going to relate real rates to current   demand relative to the potential for the economy to supply it  So in any statistical relationship   estimated over historical data, one is going to uncover a relationship between real rates and   output A monetary policy maker surely can’t ignore output, and I wouldn’t advocate doing that   One important difference between now and the late 1990s is that inflation was better   behaved then Inflation fell from just over 2 percent in 1995 to just below 2 percent in 1996, and   it stayed in the middle of the 1 to 2 percent range for the rest of that decade  Now, as many have   noted, inflation is going in the opposite direction  Briefly, it has been above 2 percent since early   ’04 and has stepped up significantly since the beginning of the year  The Greenbook is   projecting that it will remain above 2¼ percent for a year and a half  It now appears as if an   acceleration of wage inflation has begun  Although one might characterize—as many around the   August 8, 2006 91 of 158                      table have—inflation expectations as “well contained,” I think it’s worth questioning whether the   level at which expectation measures are contained is that reassuring   I’ll note that the TIPS inflation compensation figures taken from last Friday afternoon   show that, adjusted for the carry effect, the ten-year spread is 265, the five-year spread five   years ahead is 27, and the one-year forward rate ending in ten years is 289  Adjusting that to   get back to core PCE, the first thing you do is take overall to core; the expected value of that is   surely around zero going forward Then, there’s this CPI-to-PCE measurement error  If you   chart that, you see it has fluctuated a lot  Sure, the historical average is 03 percentage point, but   it has been negative for several quarters, and just now it has gotten back to 02 or 03 or so  So   let’s take 04, the Bluebook’s adjustment  If you expected long-run inflation expectations to   accord with the opinion of some around this table—that they would like to see inflation within a   comfort zone between 1 and 2 percent—you’d expect core inflation of 15 percent, and you’d   expect these inflation expectation measures to be 19 percent  If you look at the survey evidence,   they are at 25, 29, and 32 percent  So it’s not clear that inflation compensation and inflation   expectation measures are contained in a way that’s consistent with a long-run inflation objective   around 15 percent In short, if you sum up all the inflation evidence, take the whole picture   together, to my mind it looks a lot as though inflation has become entrenched above 2 percent    In my view, the longer we let it go on, as a previous Chairman and this Chairman have said, the   more difficult it will be to correct it   The worse inflation outlook now indicates that, if anything, the real short rate should be   higher than otherwise warranted by real growth considerations  On top of that, there is the Fisher   relationship to take into account, as President Moskow pointed out  Since the June meeting, the   August 8, 2006 92 of 158                         Greenbook’s one-year-ahead inflation forecast has risen 45 basis points, so a 5¼ percent fed   funds rate now corresponds to a 45 basis point lower real rate than it did in June   As I said earlier, I think a fair scientific appraisal of the evidence should make us deeply   skeptical of the notion that moderating growth is going to bring core inflation down without   further action on our part to better anchor inflation expectations  Yet a popular perception now   is that this hypothesis is the centerpiece of our inflation strategy  I believe we need to take action   today to correct that misapprehension   I do not believe we live in a world in which it is common knowledge that we follow a   fixed policy reaction function that includes among its arguments or determinants a single number   capturing a well-known long-run inflation objective for us—for example, the Taylor rule that has   a single number, π*, that captures where inflation returns and to which any impulse response   function you run is going to return in five or ten years  I believe, rather, that our recent   experience clearly demonstrates that there have been substantial swings in the public’s beliefs   about future inflation and monetary policy—in other words, about what kind of policymakers we   are Moreover, I believe that the public is confused about how monetary policy and inflation   should respond to energy-price shocks I think this confusion arose in the wake of Katrina, and I   think it has been exacerbated by our failure to explain that fact well enough to the public, even   though we have all tried More energy shocks are likely in the years ahead, and we need to   condition markets to expect us to protect core inflation in response rather than attempt to protect   the unemployment rate as we did in the 1970s   I think the first-order policy problem for us today is to influence the evolution of the   public’s beliefs in a way that helps bring inflation down more rapidly than the public and the   Greenbook are currently forecasting, rather than relying on subsiding special factors  In theory,   August 8, 2006 93 of 158                            a forceful enough communication about our intentions to act in the future could be an effective   substitute for action today, but I am skeptical about this hypothesis as well  We have been quite   careful to say that, if we pause, we could resume rates shortly thereafter  But every time we say   that, the market reaction seems to be, “Did you say ‘pause’?”  This has the market focused on the   possibility of our pausing and less focused on the possibility of our resuming afterward, and that   is clearly reflected in what the yield curve has done since the last meeting, as illustrated in the   Bluebook   In sum, I acknowledge the case for below-potential growth over the next few quarters, as   low as the staff believes If I expected significantly lower growth than I do, I would obviously   favor a lower real interest rate path than I otherwise would  But I think that the risk that the   housing contraction will have broader multiplier effects on personal consumption and other   sectors is still relatively small, and I do not think we should be satisfied with the path that   inflation is likely to take if we stay on the policy path that the market anticipates    Communication is important, as we’ll discuss later today, but there are times when actions speak   louder than words Therefore I favor a 25 basis point increase in the federal funds rate and a   statement something like alternative D, and I favor them enough to vote accordingly    The unit labor cost figures suggest leaving productivity gains out of this    That’s just my opinion    Thank you, Mr Chairman  The first set of questions from the   subcommittee had to do with goals and principles  The first principle I’d bring to this is that   money is intrinsically worthless and has value only because people expect it to have value in the   future So, to be a little provocative, I’ll say that monetary policy is about people’s expectations,   and everything else is just commentary  Therefore, I fully support the first goal—helping people   form expectations regarding our future policy actions is a reasonable goal for communication   policy The second goal seems clear, too—ensuring accountability to the people who have   granted us this monopoly on policy actions   It’s important to be clear about what’s meant by communication regarding future policy   actions It may mean saying something about the future path of interest rates—and we’ve done   that several times—but it doesn’t have to  An alternative approach is to articulate what   objectives will determine our interest rate choices in the future, and in principle, someone who   understands our objectives and the constraints we’re under will be able to figure out what we’ll   choose in any given circumstance  I think this offers really good prospects for overcoming some   August 8, 2006 128 of 158                            of the problems that the Committee has encountered with the forward-looking guidance   language, when we essentially tell the public what interest rate settings we think will likely be   required to achieve our objectives It seems as though communicating that would be enhanced   by telling them what our objectives are  In a sense, that would aid efficiency   The subcommittee asked what constraints affect our communications  The obvious one   that comes to mind is time consistency—essentially, the idea that our claims about our future   actions are credible  People have to think that our future selves, be they us or our successors,   will actually want to follow through on the actions that we’ve implied by our communications—   we are selecting what our future selves are going to select  The question of whether our   communications will constrain our future selves immediately arises  Now, one can make some   stark assumptions about this question  In the literature, you typically see just two polar cases   analyzed One is “yes, totally”—the perfect commitment case; the other is “no, not at all”—the   complete discretion case  But for the purposes of our discussion, I think it makes sense to adopt   the intermediate view that our future selves are likely to view it as costly to be perceived as   taking actions that contradict what we had previously communicated  So I’m happy to assume   that our statements are not cheap talk, to use game theory language  At the same time, I don’t   think the credibility of our communications is perfect or costless  At all junctures we need to   think through whether we will want to follow through on what we’re implying by our   communications   That idea is related to a separate issue that often arises in discussions of inflation   targeting and communications, and that is whether communication will reduce our future   flexibility  At this point, let me just say that to stabilize the value of money we have already   sacrificed a great deal of flexibility  I’d claim that we’ve given up the flexibility to inflate or   August 8, 2006 129 of 158                         deflate at 10 percent in any given year, in the near future  We’ve given up a lot of things to   convince people that money should have about the value it has now  So it really isn’t a question   of giving up flexibility; it’s a question of what flexibility we want to give up  Here I’d make   another point as well If communication is going to have any value at all, it’s going to persuade   some people to change their minds about what actions we would take in the future  Well, if   that’s true, then in some sense it has to involve our giving up some of the flexibility that the   public has perceived us to have So while there are flexibilities we would like to preserve, there   are flexibilities we’d like to give up  I don’t think flexibility per se is a trump card in this   situation   The subcommittee asked about what information should be communicated  I’ll just focus   on one thing that I talked about earlier today, and that’s our long-run inflation objective  Let me   be precise about what I mean here  Averaging across all possible futures, taking into account   how we are expected to react in each possible future, what is the inflation rate n periods from   now?  It may not be perfectly certain, but what is the average across all of those futures, taking   into account how we’re going to react?  Let me define that average as long-run expected   inflation, at least the long-run expected inflation associated with the public’s beliefs about our   reactions that are built into that thought experiment I just described  In most of the standard   models (except for those in which some learning about the policymaker is occurring)—models   with Taylor rules or some other fixed reaction function plopped in—if you take n out long   enough, like five years or so, long-run expected inflation is a single number that never varies  As   I mentioned earlier this year, I don’t think that’s the world we live in now  Personally, I think   that we ought to try to agree on a value for where we want inflation to be on average and   communicate it to the public I don’t see the benefit in terms of short-run flexibility of letting   August 8, 2006 130 of 158                               expected inflation n years ahead have a big, wide, and disperse probability distribution around it   or having the mean of that distribution fluctuate a lot  I can see the value of being flexible about   how fast—a couple of years or a couple of quarters—we return inflation to target or about how   far from target we let it drift; but I just don’t see the value of allowing fluctuation in our inflation   objective years out   Whenever I encounter one of those software programs for calculating your retirement   income and they ask for a lot of assumptions—such as your age, your salary, your age at   retirement, and how fast your wages will go up, and all—and they get to a box where they ask   what the inflation rate is going to be, I think to myself, I don’t know what to put in there    [Laughter] And I think—that’s exactly right  I know what I’d like to put in there, but at this   point that’s just wishful thinking on my part, and I’m hesitant to do that  I’m certainly not going   to do that for my brother-in-law when he asks  [Laughter]   I think it’s a real tragedy that we don’t have anything to tell the country for circumstances   like that It’s the one thing that we ought to be able to pin down in the long run; it’s the one   thing we know we can deliver We can’t deliver a predicted average real growth rate; we know   we can’t deliver a predicted average unemployment rate; but we all agree we have a fair amount   of latitude about the long-run inflation forecast  Anyway, that’s what I have to say about this   subject    About early returns, obviously what we care about as a Committee is the   24-hour rate Therefore, in calculating and targeting that effective rate, if that spread became   September 20, 2006 6 of 132                                  substantial, we’d want to adjust for that, I would take it  The spread between the early return and   the regular 24-hour return is so small that the implied intraday rate in some sense that you   calculate is not even close to our daylight overdraft charges—right?    From the economic standpoint, clearly we care about the 24-hour rate    But if the intraday rate rose, and so for a given 24-hour rate the effective overnight rate was   lower, that would really distort the relationship between the effective rate and the longer-term   real intertemporal rate of substitution    Even with the early returns?    I see But do you think of the difference as a risk premium?    When you say “the bank,” which side are you talking about?    Okay So they’re giving up something  I have a second question I want   to ask about inflation compensation  The chart you have in the front shows that inflation   compensation has fallen at the front end  Yet in the Bluebook box on page 4, there’s a   calculation done from the near-term maturing TIPS security showing that, from   October/November ’06 to October/November ’07, inflation compensation has not changed much   at all Do you have a more-detailed sense about at what part of the curve inflation compensation   has come down?    Right That shows up in the Bluebook as from now to    October/November ’06, and that you would think of as a sort of expected carry effect     I understand and appreciate that  Thanks  My impression, however, is   that you have something near term going on because of what is expected to happen to the   headline CPI over the next couple of months  Then something a couple of years out, not next   year but a year or two after that, is pulling down the compensation  Is that a fair characterization   of the market data?    Let me see if I can get Vince to be that bold  [Laughter]    That’s not very bold, Vince    But the near-term five-year looks as though it changed because of the   next couple of months and then after ’08 and not much in ’07  You’re okay with that   interpretation?    Okay Thank you    Well, the carry adjustment doesn’t affect the October ’06 calendar-year   spread, nor would it affect the two-year forward rate    May I just follow up?  Compared with the early return, the regular fed   funds loan is a 24-hour loan plus an option to extend it for a few hours  It’s an option—you   could use it or not, right?  So from that point of view, if what we wanted to get a bead on was the   risk-free 24-hour rate, then it looks as though the early return might be the one we’d want to   target rather than the other—assuming that the market is liquid enough to do that    I would like to compliment you, David Stockton, and your staff for   inclusion in this meeting’s Greenbook, Part 2, on page II-36, of an array of measures of inflation   expectations, apparently in response to needling from me  I can assure you that this will have no   moral hazard effect, and you will get neither no more nor no less needling in the future than you   would have  So this is not going to encourage more needling  I think that effort will help going   forward, and I look forward to more steps in this direction  You just mentioned in response to   President Moskow that close to 2 percent expected inflation underlies the Greenbook’s baseline   forecast, and that is useful information  I also want to compliment you on the documentation about   inflation dynamics  I think that will be useful groundwork for us on the Committee  What I hope   we do in the next year or so as part of the Kohn subcommittee deliberations on communications is   to come to some understanding of how the pattern that guides our conduct—call it a rule or   systematic component of monetary policy—relates to inflation dynamics and to discuss what   inflation dynamics we want to bring about    Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Fifth District’s economy has grown at a   somewhat faster pace in recent weeks, reflecting a solid uptick in manufacturing  Preliminary   results from our September survey are showing increases in all manufacturing measures, with a   September 20, 2006 48 of 132                     particularly strong performance of shipments and new orders  The six-months-ahead outlook   measures are also coming in broadly stronger  Growth in the District services sector continues at   a moderate pace  Retail sales remain somewhat sluggish, however, held down by soft big-ticket   sales, which we understand were mainly in auto and building materials  The residential real   estate market shows signs of further cooling, especially in Maryland and Northern Virginia  As   has been the case for several months, however, real estate activity varies widely across the   District, with the Carolinas, which were less affected by the boom, reporting continued strength    Labor market conditions remain taut, with job growth generally reported to be solid    Complaints that skilled workers are hard to find continue to be heard, and survey evidence   suggests continued wage pressures  Recent reports regarding District price pressures generally   tilt toward the firm side on balance  Early reports for September for the manufacturing sector   show a notable acceleration in both current prices paid and current prices received and large   increases in six-months-ahead expectations for both  Reports on service-sector prices are more   mixed  Our respondents from the retail sector report moderation in current price trends but see   more-rapid six-months-ahead price gains than they did last month  Our other service-sector   firms report no change in current price trends but expect some moderation in coming months   Regarding the national economy, since our last meeting we have received largely positive   news pertaining to the outlook for consumer spending  There was a sizable upward revision to   the current level of labor income, which improves the outlook for real disposable income growth    Lower energy prices should provide an additional, though one-time, boost to consumer spending    So on net I find myself, again, a bit more optimistic than the Greenbook on consumption   The housing data certainly have been weaker than anticipated, and I now expect a   somewhat steeper decline, as does the Greenbook  Forecasting this housing adjustment is   September 20, 2006 49 of 132               particularly difficult because, as President Minehan pointed out, we have only one or two   episodes for comparison in the post-Reg Q regime, and as David Wilcox pointed out, they don’t   seem to closely resemble our current situation  I find this Greenbook’s more pessimistic outlook   for housing itself plausible, but I’m still fairly skeptical of large indirect spillover effects on   employment or consumption  For overall activity, I expect real GDP growth to be somewhat   below trend, especially this quarter, but above the Greenbook through the end of next year   My views on the inflation situation have not changed much since our last meeting  The   lower reading on July’s core PCE was encouraging, and the easing of energy prices is clearly   providing some relief on headline inflation  However, July’s lower numbers were not   particularly broad based, and the August CPI report shows a significant rebound in core inflation,   as President Fisher noted   While labor compensation numbers have been hard to interpret, they   also appear to point in the direction of greater price pressures, which I take it to be the staff’s   view The downward movement in TIPS inflation compensation since the last meeting has been   quite striking—more than 30 basis points at the five-year horizon  I’ve made a lot of comments   on TIPS inflation compensation spreads in past meetings, and it’s not clear that this downward   movement signals much of an improvement in the outlook for core inflation in the near term  I   pointed out earlier that the Bluebook shows that the fall in near-term inflation compensation has   occurred mainly at a three-month or four-month horizon  Compensation for the period running   from October/November this year to the same period next year has hardly fallen at all, and this to   me suggests no significant change in the rate at which the public expects core inflation to   moderate over the next year or two  Moreover, one-year-forward expected inflation rates five   and ten years out have not fallen much, so I do not view the recent fall in TIPS inflation   compensation as terribly comforting  Overall, regarding inflation, I’m quite apprehensive about   September 20, 2006 50 of 132                        waiting for core inflation to decline as slowly as it does in the Greenbook or about letting a new   reduced-form model do our work for us    After looking closely at the new data since the last meeting, I do not see a   compelling reason to materially alter my assessment of policy  I still think that the fed funds rate   should be 5½ percent to bring core inflation down rapidly enough  My preference is based on an   assumption that we want to bring core inflation down to 1½  That is how I think things through   when I come into these meetings—I have not been told to do otherwise—and, without a firmer   policy path, I think that core inflation is likely to decline no more rapidly than the glacial pace of the   Greenbook   I acknowledge that there are risks to real growth in the outlook and that raising rates may   add to those risks  But the risks strike me as tolerably small partly because my baseline forecast   stays a little further away than the Greenbook from your point-of-no-return thresholds, which I think   are legitimate concerns  But since you have put that on the table and President Poole has echoed   this, let me add to his statement that tolerating a rise in inflation to avoid a point of no return and   September 20, 2006 105 of 132                        recession is, I think, a grave error, and I think that the experience of the ’70s is strong evidence of   that Besides that, I think these risks can be significantly lowered to the extent that tighter policy   shifts the public’s expectations regarding our future conduct  A lot of comments around the table   just now have indicated that the public has substantial uncertainty about whether 1½, 2, or   2½ percent is where we are really interested in bringing inflation to   I am not as concerned about a rise in inflation right now  We have experienced increases in   core inflation in response to energy price shocks, and I am concerned about the possible effects on   core inflation from the next round of fluctuations in the oil market  The process is repeatable, and   just like the inflation dynamics that the Greenbook staff analyzed, the response to energy price   shocks is a reduced form, and it embodies what people expect about how we are going to react to   those shocks  I think the major danger is that we allow core inflation to persist above 2¼ percent   for a substantial time The longer we allow that, the more likely it is that the public’s expectations   will collapse around a high rate of inflation and the harder it will be to bring core inflation down to   1½ percent, if that is what we settle on wanting to do     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Fifth District survey for October just   released today shows manufacturing flattening out after a run-up last month, though expectations   remain upbeat  Services firms note solid increases in revenues, and overall District job growth   remains strong  Among retailers, big-ticket sales were softer, and housing-related sales slowed   further; but with other retailers, the picture brightened, with sales and traffic notably stronger    The housing sector continues to slow, with sales weakening further in the DC area and modest   price reductions occurring in other large markets  Some cities in the Carolinas, however,   continue to report modest increases in home sales prices and even permits, and in many   locations, activity varies significantly across different price ranges  District labor markets   remain tight, and our surveys indicate that expectations are for some additional wage pressures in   the next six months  This commentary includes the now-usual reports of shortages of particular   skills  Our price measures moderated some, but they remain elevated     The national outlook has changed only marginally in the past five weeks  At our last few   meetings, we have seen the staff mark down their forecast for second-half growth as the pace of   the contraction in housing activity has become clear  The information that has come in over the   past several weeks does not suggest any steepening in the rate of decline, and if anything, there   are scattered signs suggesting that we might be getting close to the bottom  Except for housing,   the economy still appears to be in good shape  Consumer spending is holding up well    Employment is tracking labor force growth  Commercial construction is fairly robust, and   business investment spending continues to grow  So we’re still not seeing any major spillovers   October 24-25, 2006 54 of 203    from the housing market to other economic sectors  Housing is certainly going to subtract from   headline growth over the next couple of quarters, but I expect GDP growth to return to close to   potential at some point next year, and I remain more optimistic than the staff about when that   will occur  There is a risk that output growth will come in lower than I anticipate because of a   more severe deterioration of the housing markets or more substantial spillover effects on other   spending categories  Although it’s certainly too early to rule this out, I think the probability of   such an outcome has receded in recent weeks  So my outlook for real growth is about the same   as it was in September with, if anything, a tad less downside risk   The inflation outlook has not improved since our last meeting  The September core CPI   reading was 29 at an annual rate, identical to the August reading, and core PCE inflation for   September is estimated at an annual rate of about 21 percent, I think  I grant that three-month   core PCE inflation has come down off its May peak of close to 3 percent  I do take some   comfort in the fact that core inflation did not remain so high, but that measure of inflation has   been right about 2¼ percent for three straight months  The Greenbook forecast has it stepping up   to 24 percent for the next six months and falling below 22 percent only in the second quarter of   2008  So three-month core PCE inflation is now as low as it gets for the next year and a half in   the Greenbook forecast, and at the end of 2008, core inflation will have been above 2 percent for   five straight years   I have my doubts about the prospects for even the modest decline described in the   Greenbook  The notion that slowing real growth will bring inflation down much has already   been heavily discounted around this table—and rightly so, in my view, given the tenuous status   of the relationship between real gaps and inflation  The recent fall in energy prices may help, but   relying on tame energy prices is problematic, I think  It would encourage the public to believe   October 24-25, 2006 55 of 203    that we will allow core inflation to rise whenever energy prices surge  That belief is, for me, the   leading hypothesis explaining the run-ups in core inflation that we saw last fall and earlier this   year  We are likely to see some significant swings in energy prices in the years ahead  So help   from this direction is by no means certain  More broadly, I believe we should be leery of letting   a relative price move core inflation around   There was a lot of discussion at our last meeting about the state of inflation expectations,   and a number of people pointed to evidence that market participants did not seem to believe we   intend to bring inflation down to the center of the 1 to 2 percent range  This is confirmed by the   Bluebook, which provides a very useful compilation this time from various sources of market   expectations for core PCE inflation, and they are all clustered around 2¼ percent  If the   Greenbook forecast is realized and core inflation gradually comes down to 21 percent over the   next two years, it’s hard to believe these expectations would fall much  So with core inflation   running around 2¼ percent and not likely to come down much soon and with expectations   apparently settled at about the same rate, I’m deeply concerned about inflation  Thank you     Let’s adjourn now     Nothing personal, Vince     Governor Kohn, concerning the assessment of risk, I think I heard you   say about alternative B+ that you weren’t sure what effect it would have  I’m interested in what   underlies that uncertainty     I understand those rationales for retaining language, but you expressed   uncertainty about what the effect of B+ was  It struck me—and I think was intended by Vince—  as adding a dollop of hawkishness to the statement  Do you doubt that the markets would   interpret it that way?   October 24-25, 2006 98 of 203      Many of us have said that inflation is too high  Many of us have said it   recently in public, and I haven’t heard any of us say that we’re satisfied with inflation being   2¼ percent indefinitely  But public expectations clearly seem inconsistent with core inflation   returning to below 2 percent in a reasonable amount of time  We’ve tried to communicate our   October 24-25, 2006 112 of 203    concerns about inflation, but that effort has fallen short  We intended the August decision to be a   hawkish pause, but I think it’s fair to say that the markets overlooked the hawkish part  Markets   subsequently came to believe that a set of rate cuts were in store early next year  In recent weeks   the policy path has moved up a bit, but I don’t see any evidence that people expect us to bring core   inflation down below 2 percent anytime soon  I think communicating collectively and more   explicitly about our intentions would surely help the situation  We’re going to discuss that later   today, but in the meantime, we have to make policy the old-fashioned way, based on our own   implicit or explicit individual targets and our own sense of the appropriate way to achieve them   My own assessment at this meeting, as it was at the last two meetings, is that a further   tightening is needed to help ensure that core inflation declines to an acceptable rate in coming   quarters and that the real economy can withstand a further increase in the fed funds rate  Discussion   with staff yesterday made it quite clear that, in their view, inflation will not come down below   2 percent anytime soon without our doing something about it, and that’s a view with which I   concur   Now, reflecting on the results of the last two meetings and the discussion I’ve heard so far,   my sense is that there’s a decent probability that I’m going to be outvoted again today  [Laughter]  I   understand and respect the arguments for pausing now  The housing slowdown is weakening   demand growth, and at times weaker demand growth warrants a lower real interest rate, all else   being equal  I could put that into the output gap or the Phillips curve language, if you want  I   recognize that under flexible inflation targeting, if that were our agreed-upon strategy, it would take   time to bring inflation back down to target, and the speed at which one did so would depend on the   state of the economy  But in my view, the rate of convergence embodied in the Greenbook forecast   and the Bluebook extended simulations is too slow and risks that inflation will become even more   October 24-25, 2006 113 of 203    entrenched than it is now  I think bringing inflation down more rapidly than that would be both   feasible and appropriate, and I hope you can appreciate that, given the limited data we’ve seen since   our last meeting, I’m reluctant to signal that my concern about the trajectory of core inflation has in   any way diminished  Accordingly, I favor alternative C   For those of you supporting alternative B, it’s hard for me to see that market policy   expectations, even after the adjustment of the past few weeks, are consistent with the views I’ve   heard you express around this table  So I would think you would want to enhance the alignment of   market expectations with your views by tweaking the statement in a more hawkish direction     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Vince Reinhart did a good job of organizing   the issues in his three fundamental questions, but I’d reverse the order  The last of his three   questions asks whether adopting a numerical objective would constrain or influence subsequent   policymaking  I think we should start by asking the question what constraints we want to impose on   ourselves and then work backward to what kind of inflation target would provide constraints that we   view as useful  In other words, what discretion do we want to convince people we will not use, or   to put it yet another way, what monetary policies do we want to rule out for ourselves?  It’s fairly   self-evident that giving up at least some monetary policy discretion is useful, and in fact we’ve done   this  After all, our success in bringing down inflation under Chairmen Volcker and Greenspan was   achieved by giving up the discretion to follow pre-1980 style policies in which trend inflation   drifted upward and by giving up the discretion not to respond forcefully enough to inflation scares   Regarding an explicit inflation objective, let me again start by considering the expected   value of one-year inflation beginning n years ahead, where n is, say, ten years or more  This   number can be taken to represent expected long-run inflation, and we can make it anything we   like—take that as a kind of postulate  I don’t know of any economic reason for expected one-year   inflation beginning ten years from now to vary materially over time  In fact, fluctuations in   expected long-run inflation impede the effectiveness of financial markets and reduce economic   welfare  Moreover, as a matter of public accountability in a constitutional democracy, we owe it to   October 24-25, 2006 127 of 203    the citizens of the United States to tell them this simple and yet very important implication of how   we conduct monetary policy, if only to make the use of retirement-planning software easier    [Laughter]  So I presume we’ll be able to agree that we want to give up the discretion to pursue   monetary policies in which expected long-run inflation varies over time  Ultimately we need to   choose a number for what measured inflation rate corresponds to price stability   Beyond choosing a specific number, however, I think the more challenging choice comes   when we talk about time periods  Over what time period should we say that we intend to have   inflation return on average to our long-run objective?  In other words, how fast should that   convergence take place?  This question is critical and substantive, and it’s going to require careful   analysis and consideration  On the one hand, the time frame should not be too short  Obviously,   saying that inflation should return to target next month would have us giving up too much   discretion  On the other hand, setting too long a time frame will not do enough to stabilize inflation   expectations  Moreover, the longer the time frame that we set for returning inflation to target, the   harder it’s going to be for the public to verify our adherence to an announced target and, thus, the   longer it may take for us to establish the credibility of our announced intentions   The approach I’ve outlined here by starting at the back and inverting Vince’s question 3 has   some implication for Vince’s question 2  How should the FOMC choose an inflation objective?  In   general, since the economic benefits of numerical objectives stem from reducing unnecessary   uncertainty, we maximize those benefits when we make the choice of objective more permanent and   less subject to reconsideration by our future selves  This suggests making a numerical objective as   close as possible to a once-and-for-all choice or decision, for example, by having the inflation target   explicitly voted on once by the Committee when adopted and not reconsidered annually  Related to   that, an explicit Committee decision, it seems to me, would be preferable to amalgamating   October 24-25, 2006 128 of 203    members’ forecasts and preferences as in the relatively opaque Humphrey-Hawkins process  The   latter would have the potential for generating objectives that vary over time with Committee   membership   Let me briefly make just a few other observations that I think are related to this  First, after   we initially announce our adoption of an inflation objective, assuming that’s what we do, we will   need to act and speak in a way that’s consistent with our announcement  That’s sort of obvious, but   our announcement by itself is not going to convey instant credibility  It will be essential that we   follow through  Second, while our announcement will no doubt convey a general sense of what it   will mean for conducting monetary policy, how we actually make monetary policy immediately   following the announcement is going to demonstrate to people what we think it means—in other   words, how it’s going to constrain us in practice  So we should think about adopting an inflation   objective as consisting of two sets of things—an initial statement and the way we subsequently act   and communicate—and I think we should discuss those both  Third, I’m in the camp that believes   that adopting an explicit inflation objective could improve interactions between the staff and the   Committee by providing guidance as to what analysis is most useful to us  For example, the staff   might routinely report alternative simulations of more or less aggressive approaches to returning   inflation to target over time, as in the Bluebook  Finally, regarding the question of whether   unilateral adoption is consistent with our legislative framework, I was not privy to your private   conversations last November, Mr Chairman, but your nomination hearings appeared to provide the   Congress with an opportunity to object, if they were so inclined, to unilateral adoption of an   inflation target by the Federal Open Market Committee  I take the fact that they did not do so, at   least publicly, as evidence that they would view a numerical inflation objective as broadly   consistent with the wide latitude accorded to us by our existing legislative mandate   October 24-25, 2006 129 of 203    I recognize that some cite the so-called dual mandate as a reason to question whether we can   adopt an inflation target without a more-formal mandate to do so from the Congress  But in the past   we have made a great deal of effort to communicate; to educate the public about the relationship   between inflation and output, the two of our three mandates that enter in here; and to convince   people that we contribute best to keeping output growing at a maximal rate by keeping inflation low   and stable  Moreover, we can make the average inflation rate, long-run expected inflation, anything   we want  That doesn’t hold for employment growth or output growth or the unemployment rate    Those are my remarks, Mr Chairman     With your indulgence, Mr Chairman, I’d like to comment on the role of   the dual mandate and sketch out how I’d like to see this discussion evolve  I feel motivated to do   this because this consideration has played a greater role in today’s discussion than I had   anticipated—this is just a byproduct of my own lack of foresight and intelligence, I think—and   also because I took swipes at the dual mandate earlier in my career on the Committee and was   batted back by previous Vice Chairmen and others  [Laughter]  What I want to say first is that I   sense a substantial convergence of views  As demonstrated by Governor Kohn’s use of the   best-contribute formulation, I think there’s convergence of the sense of what it means around   here  (Governor Kohn’s statement, by the way, was outstanding, and I’d associate myself with   October 24-25, 2006 183 of 203    all of it, top to bottom)  But I sense that some of our policy disagreements are on occasion   interpreted as differences in views on the appropriate weights to place on employment and   inflation in a policymaker welfare function or loss-minimization function  Casting it that way   tempts one to view those weights as reflecting value judgments analogous, for example, to my   preference for grits over eggs at this morning’s breakfast   I realize that what I’m about to say runs a great risk of seeming pedantic and academic,   but I think it’s important  I’ll start provocatively by saying that I don’t care about output per se,   and I don’t think any one of us does, and I don’t think any one of us cares about inflation per se    We care about the welfare of the citizens of our country  That’s an obvious point to make, but   I’ll just remind you that the practice of viewing policymaking through the lens of the analytical   device of a mathematical policymaker facing a loss function with weights on employment and   inflation arose during the 1960s  In contrast, policy analysis everywhere else in economics was   grounded in models in which the consumer was actually mathematically present—that is to say,   the models treated explicitly the preferences of consumers and then crafted policies to maximize   those in a framework in which you could explicitly calculate what consumer preferences were    At the time, the state-of-the-art monetary policy framework did not include consumers explicitly;   these were reduced-form models—you know, the Patinkin generation of models  Today, the   state-of-the-art monetary models capture a rich array of inflation and output dynamics and do   treat preferences of our citizens explicitly  These models are capable of deriving optimal policy,   and optimal policy so derived can be represented as the solution to a maximization problem by a   policymaker with given weights  But that, of course, is very different from thinking of those   weights as stemming from non-economic value judgments about the utility value of employment   and inflation  So, in principle, the weights that are most appropriate to use to represent   October 24-25, 2006 184 of 203    policymaking can be scientifically investigated  They can be analyzed through models at this   level and through the data and can be compared regarding goodness of fit and other measures as   well  The congressional mandate in the ’70s codified existing practice and encapsulated the   notion that we’ve got weights and that we view ourselves as having a loss function regarding   these two things when we really just have one loss function and that relates to our citizens’   welfare     I’d point out that surely we have heavily influenced the interpretation of those mandates    You look at the act, and three objectives are there  I think that we’ve helped induce people to   call it a dual mandate by encouraging them to drop the moderate interest rate objective  So, in   principle, we could influence the evolution of popular interpretation and understanding of these   other objectives as well  I’d also point out that the way the Congress codified the objectives was   without weights, and so the act is not at all inconsistent with the state-of-the-art approach to   monetary economics  I say this because I’d like to move us beyond the relatively sterile debates   over whether my weight is higher or lower on inflation or output, and I hope that we can evolve   in both our discussions about the dual mandate and our analytical approach to the use of it in   meetings ahead  Thank you       Would a natural interpretation be that the growth in the credit-derivative   market in the past few years has made credit exposures via banks’ loan sales to other entities   more liquid relative to the liquidity that has always been there in the high-yield area?      Thank you, Mr Chairman  Economic activity continued to expand   moderately in our District in November  Manufacturing shipments and new orders bucked the   national trend and rebounded last month following an October dip  Revenues and hiring slowed a   bit in the service sector but continued to expand moderately  Retail was a bright spot  Stores   reported an uptick in sales and customer traffic for November, including the Thanksgiving   weekend  Our store contacts were generally optimistic about sales prospects for the coming holiday   season  Fifth District housing activity continues to soften on the whole, although there are areas that   have seen much less, if any, of a slowdown  We’re not hearing any reports of cutbacks in capital   expenditures, and commercial real estate markets appear to remain fairly strong in our District    Reports on price pressures were mixed in November but remained at elevated levels     At the national level, an essential question seems to be how long the current weakness will   persist  To a large extent this question centers on the housing market, and it’s still hard to pin down   the outlook with much certainty  The special survey on homebuilders paints a picture that varies   widely across the country  Construction activity is falling at a rapid clip in many regions, but many   housing markets are still fairly stable  Nationally, there are some indicators suggesting that housing   demand has stabilized at a low level  Sales of new homes have been fluctuating around an annual   rate of 1 million since July, and purchase mortgage applications have been fairly flat since then as   well  But the national data also show a sizable overhang of housing inventory that will continue to   depress new building activity going forward  If—and, like David, I recognize this is a big “if”—the   demand for housing holds up at current levels—and favorable fundamentals such as moderate   December 12, 2006 37 of 134         mortgage rates and continued real income gains should help—then the adjustment process is simply   a matter of working inventories down  This is consistent with the Greenbook’s estimate that   residential investment will no longer subtract from real GDP growth after the first half of next year   The strength in nonresidential construction has until recently offset the decline in residential    Most recent reports show nonresidential construction spending and employment falling in recent   months, although I’m struck by the fact that there are hardly any references in the Beige Book to   deterioration in commercial construction and we aren’t hearing such reports from our contacts   either  So I’m not sure how much to mark down the nonresidential outlook just now   As David said, consumer spending keeps chugging along at about 3 percent despite   weakening auto sales  This is notable because one way the housing downturn could spread to the   remainder of the economy is through a wealth effect  So far I’m not persuaded by this gloomy   view, and I think there are good reasons to doubt it  Household net worth looks pretty strong, and   equities continue to advance  The other leading candidate for a spillover channel is the labor   market, but so far the weakness in construction and real-estate-related employment has not been   large enough to offset the broader strength in employment  I remain skeptical of a housing-induced   step-down in consumption growth  Business investment continues to be a source of strength  The   Greenbook notes the possibility of negative accelerator effects, but the other fundamentals still look   good  Profitability is high, and cost of capital is low  Moreover, financial markets are not showing   signs of impending business weakness or investment slowdown  In sum, it looks as though the   current weakness is likely to be relatively transitory, and after the housing market correction plays   out, we should return to near-trend growth  There are risks to this outlook, to be sure, but this is   what looks most likely to me right now   December 12, 2006 38 of 134         The recent news on inflation has been disappointing yet again  It is now quite difficult to   discern any moderating trend in core PCE inflation over the past several months  You have to be   really careful in selecting how many periods you average over, and I have serious doubts about the   forces that are described as slowing inflation over the forecast period  First, the recent fall in energy   prices is now behind us by a couple of months, and prices are beginning to rise again  If the   Greenbook forecast is correct and in 2007 crude oil prices rise somewhat above their current level   of $62 per barrel, then we have seen all we are going to see of the abatement of the effects of higher   energy prices on core inflation, speaking to President Plosser’s point  Second, since the odds seem   to favor a further depreciation of the dollar, I think import prices are unlikely to help ease inflation   much  Third, as we’ve discussed at previous meetings, the projected increase in unemployment is   not likely to have much of an effect on inflation, over the forecast period at least  On top of all this,   inflation expectations appear to be anchored between 2 and 2¼ percent right now, and they’re likely   to exert a gravitational pull counteracting any moderation of inflation  Thank you     Mr Chairman     Bill, you talked about reconciling bond and equity markets based on a view   that inflation pressures will ease and growth will be good  When you say “inflation pressures will   ease,” do you mean that inflation will come down or that we will not be motivated to raise real   rates?     Brian, you reported the decline in measured term premiums, and yet in   the panel next to that you noted that measures of volatility don’t seem to have fallen  The term   premium is, of course, a combination of volatility in the securities return and covariance with—   let’s call it “marginal utility” just for the sake of argument  Do your estimates give you   information on whether that correlation with the expected variance of real outcomes has   changed?      My second question is about the statement  Many market participants,   as you noted, expect very little change in the tenor of the statement’s characterization of the real   economy  Do you believe that the markets would view the way alternative B was originally   December 12, 2006 86 of 134         crafted as expressing more concern than the median analyst about real weakness, and do you   view exhibit 5 as expressing less concern—as a more moderated signal?      My recollection of the time series plots of these term-premium estimates   from the original research is that they were fairly choppy on a short-term basis  So this doesn’t   seem wild and crazy      In past meetings I have expressed my misgivings about whether our   strategy is going to bring inflation down fast enough  So I won’t belabor those again today  As I   said earlier today, the inflation picture has, if anything, eroded a bit  So my misgivings remain  The   December 12, 2006 104 of 134         outlook for real growth could conceivably weaken enough to alter my perspective on the fed funds   rate, but that hasn’t happened yet  The data on manufacturing and nonresidential construction were   marginally worse than expected, but they haven’t fundamentally altered my assessment nor, I take   it, the assessment of many others that the current weakness is transitory rather than highly persistent    I still think the economy could theoretically handle a marginally higher fed funds rate  I’m also   mindful of the apparently wide gap between the assessment of the market and what I believe to be   the consensus around the table  In that context, I’m unwilling to signal that my concern about the   trajectory of core inflation has diminished or to alter the general cast of the announcement regarding   inflation  Thus, I favor alternative C  However, on the off chance that the Committee prefers   alternative B, [laughter] I’d suggest that exhibit 5 is better than exhibit 4 on alternative B, section 2    I’d also associate myself with the views of Presidents Yellen and Minehan that alternative C,   section 2, would be preferable to either  But I don’t even know if I have a say on that kind of thing    [Laughter]     Ex post subprime mortgage-backed securities seem to have been   overvalued in the sense that they underestimated default risk for some market segments  So the   presumption would be that such information gets taken on board and reflected in the prices of   new mortgage-backed securities and that it would translate into higher credit spreads at the retail   January 30-31, 2007 10 of 255    level  In your remarks you seemed to suggest that there is a chance that this process of   adjustment might cause markets not to work  I’m wondering what you meant by that      So quantities would go down      I’ll follow up on the question of Vice Chairman Geithner and President   Moskow about the gravitational point of 20 percent  I remember asking you about the NAIRU and   getting a response that suggested I should think of a cloud of probabilities surrounding that estimate    I’m essentially asking you for your characterization of the cloud you have in your mind around the   idea that 2 percent is the number to which core inflation is going to have some gravitational pull    What comes to mind here is that Vince told us several meetings ago that 2 to 2½ on core PCE   inflation was the range that he thought expectations were lying in, and TIPS numbers and survey   numbers haven’t come down much since then as I recall  I am also interested in your commentary   on the kind of technical adjustment factor that traverses the CPI, which the TIPS are based on, and   the core  When you plot that, it moves around a lot  So I’m wondering whether you have sharp   views about that going forward or how you’d characterize your uncertainty about that factor in   helping us understand what the TIPS spreads imply about gravitational points     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Economic activity in our District lost a bit of   momentum in January  Retail sales contracted in recent weeks as automobile dealers noted waning   interest and buyers of big-ticket electronic goods stayed home, perhaps to watch the big screens   they purchased during the holidays  [Laughter]  Another source of slowing was a further pullback   January 30-31, 2007 53 of 255    in the factory sector  I should mention new orders in our District slipped in recent weeks, on top of   December’s modest contraction, and factory hiring edged lower for the second straight month  On   the plus side, services firms continued to report moderate growth in revenues and employment    Despite this mixed picture, however, a wide variety of firms remained optimistic about their   prospects six months out  District labor market conditions remained tight, and skilled workers   continued to be in strong demand in large metropolitan areas  Businesses tell us that they are   pushing up wages as a result   Real estate activity is, on balance, hanging in there  Anecdotal reports indicate fairly firm   home sales across many areas in December, and we’re hearing more reports of pockets of strength   in some suburban housing markets around DC, though assessments from other areas continue to be   somewhat downbeat  We have also heard that homebuilding activity rose somewhat in a number of   District metropolitan areas in recent weeks  Commercial real estate prospects remained relatively   bright, with leasing activity firm and a solid number of projects on the books for ’07  Price   pressures at District firms seem to have moderated somewhat, confirming the national trends   The national data flow since our last meeting has been encouraging  The Greenbook now   predicts a higher trajectory for real GDP  I agree with the Greenbook’s short-term outlook    Declining housing construction is still depressing the real growth rate now, but demand has   stabilized, I think, and inventories may be topping out  Each batch of housing data has bolstered my   confidence in the trajectory we sketched out last fall—namely, that the drag from housing will   mostly disappear by midyear with spillover having been relatively limited     Consumer spending has been quite resilient  Evidently, favorable income prospects have   trumped weakening housing prices  The fundamentals for business investment remain favorable   with the cost of capital low and profitability high; and the latest news—that unfilled orders for   January 30-31, 2007 54 of 255    capital goods are continuing to increase—fits in well with the view that equipment investment is   likely to be a source of strength going forward  The Greenbook has real growth later this year and   into next year returning to trend, driven by strength in business investment and solid consumer   spending  I agree with that outlook with the caveat that my estimate of trend growth is higher than   the Greenbook’s   The inflation news since the last meeting has been encouraging as well  Core CPI inflation   was 18 in the fourth quarter, and core PCE inflation was estimated to have been 21 percent  It’s   tempting to extrapolate this favorable news forward as the Greenbook does and forecast a gradual   downward drift without further overt action by the Committee  That outcome is certainly plausible,   especially if oil prices cooperate and remain contained within recent trading ranges  But I remain   apprehensive  First, core inflation has exhibited fairly substantial high-frequency swings over the   past couple of years  So it will take many more months for me to be very confident that inflation is   trending down  Second, and related, over the past three years large swings in energy prices have   been followed by swings in core inflation with a short lag  Indeed, the cross-correlation between   core and energy components of the PCE price index seems to have increased in the past few years    The recent dip in core inflation may therefore be the transitory effect of last summer’s decline in   energy prices, and the December uptick in core CPI may signal that it’s behind us now  A   downward drift in inflation thus is likely to depend critically on the absence of upward movements   in energy prices  Note that the staff follows the futures market in assuming, as I calculated it, a   13 percent rise in oil prices by the end of 2008, which suggests continuing upward pressure on core   inflation  Third, expectations could well exert a gravitational pull in an upward direction rather than   the downward direction as claimed recently in a popular newsletter and also as the staff indicated   underlies their forecast  Personally, I place the center of gravity a little higher, above 2 percent    January 30-31, 2007 55 of 255    The twelve-month change in core PCE inflation has been above 2 percent, as we all know, since   March 2004, and none of the usual measures of expectations either from surveys or TIPS markets   are much below 2½ percent for the CPI  So even though the recent inflation news has been   comforting, I think there’s a good reason to continue to worry about it     Mr Chairman?      Do you think that’s because they have changed their minds about our   reaction function or about how the shocks are likely to come in between now and then?      So what about our statement in October?  Did they miss that?      I think he’s right  He is suggesting that his belief is that the reaction   function they hold to hasn’t changed much in the past month or two but that the shocks have   come in more consistent with our assessment of how they were going to come in  Is that fair?      Thank you, Mr Chairman  By way of preface—I didn’t mention this   yesterday, but my semiannual forecast projects core PCE inflation falling to 16 for ’08, and   growth rising from 26 to 29 in ’08  This represents both a more-rapid return to price stability   and a higher rate of trend growth than provided in the Greenbook  My forecast takes seriously   the instruction to assume appropriate monetary policy, perhaps more seriously than I have taken   it in the past  I think it is likely to require that the policy be more aggressive than assumed in the   Greenbook and that communications be forceful about our intentions to bring inflation down  I   think the forecast that I have submitted is both feasible and desirable because I think we don’t   need to use the output gap as our sole means of hammering inflation expectations and we don’t   need to wait nearly a decade, as in the Bluebook simulations    Although I believe that the appropriate policy is likely to require a higher funds rate path   at some point this year, I’m not too uncomfortable leaving it unchanged today  I welcome the   January 30-31, 2007 108 of 255    recent good news on core inflation, and like President Stern, I’m willing to wait and see whether   the good news continues  However, I have been disturbed over the past year and a half, as I have   told you, about the extent to which short-run core inflation and longer-run inflation expectations   appear to be sensitive to energy price movements  We appear to have conditioned people to   expect core inflation to rise whenever energy prices surge  This will pose a problem for us if   energy prices rise substantially or if the current lull in core inflation proves to be only the   transitory effect from the recent fall in energy prices  Both hypotheses seem reasonably   plausible to me for the coming year or two  So I believe, as President Moskow and others have   said, that we’re likely to face another inflation challenge later this year  I think it would help our   cause if our policy moves were coupled with better communications, but that is a discussion for   later today  For now, I’m prepared to support standing pat    I agree with President Plosser and others around the table who prefer the language in   alternative C for sections 2 and 3  I also agree with President Minehan about the language in   alternative C for section 4  I think that I read “predominant concern” as a little stronger and   better calibrated to our views—or at least my views—than the language in B  I also agree   strongly with Vice Chairman Geithner that standing pat today doesn’t imply a 2 percent target       President Minehan’s suggestion      It’s a fair point  I’d agree with that      I withdraw my support for your previous suggestion  [Laughter]       Yes, indeed  But if you just plot the two for the past year and a half, you   see a kind of two-month or three-month echo into the core  You calculate the cross correlations    They were pretty high before 1984; they were low from 1984 to 2001  They’ve been high again   since  My reading of the financial press coverage of macroeconomic conditions following the   hurricanes in late ’05 is that we saw a sudden burst of references to the macroeconomic   conditions of the 1970s  I suspect—it is hard to disprove this one way or another—that rhetoric   harkening back to slowing growth and energy prices causing higher inflation induced, in the   public’s mind, a sense that, when energy prices surge, growth is going to be lower  You saw the   policy path come down in September of ’05, and you’re going to see higher core inflation, and   January 30-31, 2007 110 of 255    that’s what we saw that fall  To some extent, we tried to speak strongly of our desire to hold   inflation down, but in hindsight we left that association in the public’s mind  So I just think this   is a conditionality that appears now to have been built into expectations      I think several of us have used the “predominant concern” language, so I   don’t see it as likely to induce a dramatic change in assessment about our views      Alternative C, section 3 does the same thing     There are differences of views about this around the table  A couple of   people have said that they think it’s likely that sometime this year we will think hard about raising   rates  I would trust that such views would be reflected in the minutes  Is it your understanding,   January 30-31, 2007 126 of 255    Vice Chairman Geithner, that our convention regarding the minutes is that we expunge from them   any comments within the Committee conveying a sense of how we think policy is likely to evolve at   longer horizons?     I think this is really clear, common sense, and very constructive     This isn’t a question     I don’t have any questions [Laughter]     I thought the documentation distributed by the staff did a good job of   identifying the purposes that publishing forecasts ought to serve  They’re consistent with what I   described in past meetings as guiding principles—namely, that communication is useful to the   extent that it helps the public form better expectations about future policy and inflation and that it   will help in that regard to the extent that it provides benchmarks against which people can assess   their future actions  For me the purposes of communicating a forecast are, first, to reduce   uncertainty in the public’s mind about future macroeconomic outcomes; second, to enhance our   credibility and accountability; third, to improve the coherence and internal consistency of our   discussions  It’s useful to stack up different questions and approaches against these purposes and to   January 30-31, 2007 141 of 255    see how they do  In any case—and this is a theme to which I will return—in achieving these   objectives, I think it’s really important that published forecasts be clear and understandable to the   public  Now, the cardinal rule of communication is to understand your audience  It’s one thing to   explain our forecast and procedure to Larry Meyer or Goldman Sachs economists; it’s another to   explain it to President Plosser’s $2 million business head, the Helena Rotary Club, or wherever we   find ourselves from time to time   Before addressing Vince’s questions, I just want to note that I think the value of publishing a   forecast would be greatest if it were paired with an internal agreement about our long-run objective   for inflation  I think having a prior consensus on that would simplify the process of obtaining a   consensus on the outlook and about policy  My own preference is that we state that publicly  To   the extent that an inflation objective represents a commitment regarding future policy, you can view   it as representing an implied forecast of the long-run average value of inflation, and so publicizing   that would help reduce the public’s uncertainty along a very important dimension   Regarding Vince’s first question, I believe a single Committee forecast is most desirable    This relates to the accountability objective  We are jointly responsible for the outcomes of   monetary policy, so I think we should strive for an outlook that we can fairly agree represents a   collective sense of the Committee  The value of accountability is that it enhances credibility, and   it’s the credibility of the Committee rather than of individual members that’s really important  I   recognize that crafting a consensus on a forecast among nineteen or even twelve members, even as   collegial a group as this is, could be a daunting task  One approach would be to allow the   expression of dissenting views  This runs the risk, however, of making a Committee forecast   nothing more than a compilation of members’ forecasts, and I think it needs to be more than that    The message that the release of a Committee forecast should convey is that we came to a process   January 30-31, 2007 142 of 255    with diverse views, we talked things over, our views perhaps moved closer together, and we   ultimately came to agreement on a single forecast that most of us saw as not too different from our   own  That meaning would be watered down if there were a lot of dissenting views—if they were   too frequent or too numerous  So I think there should be sort of a high threshold of disagreement   before any of us insists on differences being separately articulated  I would envision a process—I   think one of Vince’s options sketched this—in which the staff produces an initial forecast along the   lines of the Greenbook (they have a great forecasting record) and members would send in their own   forecasts, commentaries, or disagreements  Then there would be some iterative communication   process on the basis of which a new forecast would be developed for a Committee vote   Regarding the question of conditioning assumptions, I strongly believe that what we publish   should reflect our best sense of what is actually going to happen  My preference, accordingly,   would be to condition forecasts on how we think we are actually going to set policy as events   unfold  Conditioning on any other assumption—a market’s policy path or an unchanged policy—  means having to explain that our forecast may be counterfactual  It means that, in order to figure   out our real forecast, people have to figure out how our policy choices are going to differ from our   assumed policy and then guess how we think the differences in policy are going to affect the   forecast  It means that the extent to which our published forecast reduces the public’s uncertainty   about future macroeconomic outcomes is going to be limited  It means that our accountability will   be limited because we will be saying up front that this forecast might not be our actual one  It also   means that we will be chewing up valuable staff and Committee time constructing a forecast we   don’t necessarily believe in  Here I think it’s instructive to imagine explaining a counterfactual   forecast to President Plosser’s $2 million business head or to the Helena Rotary Club   January 30-31, 2007 143 of 255    I realize that some members of the Committee may be uncomfortable articulating an   expected path for the federal funds rate, but what we publish about the nature of future policy   settings is a separate question from whether we condition on a cohesive view about them  Our   discussion of the forecast is going to be much more coherent if we reach a consensus on future   policy  Telling the public that our forecast assumes appropriate policy obviously makes more sense,   I think, if we have stated what inflation rate that policy is designed to achieve  If, instead, we adopt   some counterfactual policy assumption, then not stating an inflation objective makes a published   forecast even less informative since people would have to know how the forecast differs from our   desired outcomes before figuring out what to make of it   As for Vince’s other questions, on questions 3 and 4, I think the accompanying narrative   should be handled pretty much the same way the minutes are—drafted by the staff and approved by   the Committee  On questions 5 and 6, I see greater value in publishing forecasts at longer horizons    In the event that we adopt an explicit objective, we would want the period to be long enough to   show the forecast path for inflation returning near to the objective  Again, if we condition it on   market assumptions, the period needs to be long enough to determine whether the forecast appears   to be moving toward our objective at an acceptable pace  Question 7 asks how many variables we   should forecast  I think the optimal number is four  [Laughter]  In case you want to know which   ones I’d choose, I’d say real GDP, inflation, the unemployment rate, and the fed funds rate  On   question 8, yes, we absolutely should convey the uncertainties surrounding the forecast  I think it’s   important for accountability that we articulate our sense of the range of likely future outcomes  This   points to the importance of not simply assuming a path for the fed funds rate but allowing policy to   vary across different draws of the shocks that are going to affect our future economic conditions    Otherwise our published fan charts for economic variables are not going to correspond to the   January 30-31, 2007 144 of 255    probability distribution that we believe will actually govern future outcomes, and again, we’ll have   to explain the difference to the public  Also, I think that agreeing on a fan chart around outcomes is   likely to be conducive to achieving a consensus within the Committee on the outlook   In closing, let me reiterate the importance that I place on clarity  Our communication goals   of reducing the public’s uncertainty about macroeconomic outcomes, particularly inflation, and   enhancing our accountability strongly imply that we should adopt only a procedure that we can   easily explain to the public, that the public will find useful, and that avoids the confusion of   complex and subtle counterfactual assumptions     I’m not suggesting that we reduce the public’s uncertainty to less than our   uncertainty about future outcomes  But the econometric evidence is that Greenbook forecasts are   superior to the private sector’s forecasts  So if the public knew them, their uncertainty would be   lower  I think there’s reason to suspect that more information, more communication, from us about   our outlook is likely to reduce the public’s uncertainty     You can ask a question if you’d like  [Laughter]     Not the Committee?     Yes  I just wanted to ask about the 70 percent interval  Does that reflect   everyone’s uncertainty?      What institutional or quantitative constraints are there on traders who   would be positioned to take the other side of the movement into Eurodollar futures for the hedging   March 20-21, 2007 10 of 196    operation?  You paint a picture of everyone knowing that the fed funds rate path is above what’s   implied by Eurodollar futures and of no one being able to pan that out of the market     Let me just follow up  I look at Eurodollar futures every day  You’re an   experienced, savvy market guy and I want to learn how to understand these markets  My   presumption would be that, if that takes place, there’s something limiting the capital of people who   could take the offsetting position  How could markets be so out of whack for so long?     I thought that was clearly what he said     No, he said that people told him not to take the Eurodollar price as   indicative of the expected value of the Eurodollar rate at that date  Is that what you were saying?    You said “disequilibrium”  I’m trying to understand how financial markets work here   March 20-21, 2007 11 of 196      This isn’t about the green dots  This is about the Eurodollar     That’s helpful  But, still, apart from the green dots, he’s telling us there’s   some mispricing that’s systematic     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Overall, economic activity in the Fifth   District expanded modestly in recent weeks, though performance across sectors remains uneven    Growth is centered in the services sector, where moderately positive readings continue  Real   activity has recovered somewhat in recent weeks, and big-ticket sales have posted modest gains   after two months of quite weak readings  In manufacturing, our survey respondents continue to   report a downward drift in activity  They remain optimistic about their future prospects,   however, though many comment on generally weak current demand  Labor markets remain tight   in most jurisdictions, with the standard reports of spot shortages of skilled workers, but wage   pressures are reported to be moderate  We continue to hear of some reasonably firm housing   March 20-21, 2007 40 of 196    activity in a number of District localities  Home prices remain generally flat, though builders are   offering more incentives to buyers  Inflation pressures appear to have moderated in March   according to our latest survey, but manufacturers and service providers expect price pressures to   increase modestly over the next six months   On the national level, risks seem to have risen lately, but my sense is that prospects are   still reasonably sound  Subprime mortgages, obviously, have dominated the financial news in   recent weeks  Concerns about the welfare of families suffering foreclosure are quite natural, and   anecdotes about outright fraud suggest some criminality  But my overall sense of what’s going   on is that an industry of originators and investors simply misjudged subprime mortgage default   frequencies  Realization of that risk seems to be playing out in a fairly orderly way so far    Mortgage-backed securities have lost value as risk spreads have widened, and there have been   insolvencies among firms that specialized in this sector  The updating of risk estimates in light   of recent experience will lead to higher borrowing costs in the affected market segments, and at   the margin this increase could shift some households from homeownership to renting  But in my   judgment, that isn’t likely to affect the net demand for housing units  Notably, we have not seen   broader risks to credit availability in other markets or to the financial safety net  Perhaps the   greatest economic risk posed by recent subprime developments is legislation that impedes the   availability of credit or that provides financial support ex-post that was unanticipated ex-ante but   affects private decisionmaking henceforth, somewhat like ad hoc disaster relief   Housing construction continues to contract, of course, and inventories remain elevated    The choppy winter data make it hard to gauge the descent, but overall home sales seem to be   holding steady, and we haven’t heard anything locally that suggests a renewed contraction in   demand  So the housing outlook hasn’t changed much for me  However, the recent weakness in   March 20-21, 2007 41 of 196    business investment has been disappointing  One would expect soft patches related to housing,   autos, and the new truck regulations, but the broader sluggishness is a bit at odds with the   generally favorable fundamentals  I still expect this investment to pick up ultimately, although I   have to admit that the recent data have left me a bit less certain, especially about when  The   outlook for consumer spending remains fairly healthy, though  Real disposable income growth   has been powered by continuing gains in employment and firmer wage growth  So all in all, I   still think the current episode of below-trend growth is fundamentally a transitory phenomenon   that will most likely be behind us by the end of the year, although the recent weakness in   business investment suggests more downside risk than before   Core inflation continues to firm, and it now seems clear that the fourth quarter’s energy-  induced lull is over  We have yet to see much sign of the long-awaited easing in resource   utilization  It’s not obvious that we will be getting any help from labor costs any time soon, and   inflation expectations remain centered at or above 2 percent  So to me, the prospects for   moderation in inflation remain tenuous  I continue to believe that, by summer, growth concerns   are likely to be behind us, and we will want to act to reduce inflation, which we recognize is   higher than we want  Thank you     I’m sorry  What are you looking for examples of—mortgages we   foreclosed on?  [Laughter]     That’s totally immaterial to whether this is going to affect what the rate   is at the next meeting  I mean, lots of changes to rates could occur between now and the next   meeting, or the effect of this statement on rates after this meeting could persist until the next   meeting  So I don’t see how it’s relevant, Bill     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’m okay leaving the fed funds rate unchanged   today  I say that despite the fact that inflation readings have been less favorable lately  Core   inflation is clearly higher than we want  I see little reason to expect moderation anytime soon   without action on our part  If the truth about the forecast is that, as the Greenbook says, we expect   moderation at the rate of 1 basis point a month or less, it would take a statistician quite a while to   discern statistically between that and no moderation at all  Concerns about growth continue to keep   us on the sidelines, and recent jitters about subprime mortgages and business investments have   added to ongoing concern since the last meeting  These concerns have given me the jitters as well   both because I would prefer stronger growth to less and because at times in the past such concerns   have deterred needed action on inflation  So to repeat, I’m okay leaving the fed funds rate   unchanged  As I said, I do believe we will need to tighten this year to reduce inflation, but this   doesn’t seem like a propitious time to do so   With regard to the statement, I very much agree with President Hoenig  I’m not sure I   understand what the language in section 4 is supposed to convey  On the one hand, it seems to   retain and even strengthen our anti-inflation tilt by labeling inflation our principal policy concern    On the other hand, the move to symmetric language in the second sentence would seem to remove a   tightening bias  Thus these sentences seem to work in opposite directions  So more broadly, I agree   March 20-21, 2007 94 of 196    with President Hoenig  We should not be loosening the sense of our tightening bias in this   statement  I also agree with President Plosser  I’ll just register agreement with his concern about   the capacity utilization language  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Yes  I’m really sympathetic to Randy’s view about financial conditions    I’m sympathetic about “financial conditions” because I think there’s real potential for confusion in   markets about how the phrase relates to policy and whether we might ease if things got too chaotic   or volatile  But I agree with President Stern that a little more texture on what we’re doing is fine  I   share Governor Kohn’s view that appealing to endogenous variables as if they’re an exogenous   cause for belief in support is a little confusing, but in the context I think the reference would be   taken to signal that we expect consumption growth to support the expansion  I just wanted to   register that     Thank you, Mr Chairman  It won’t surprise anyone that I believe the   Committee should adopt a numerical objective for inflation for reasons that we have discussed at   great length over the past several meetings—namely, to clarify our internal deliberations, to   clarify the public’s understanding of our objectives, and to enhance our accountability for   achieving those objectives  I just do not see how any useful purpose is served by retaining the   discretion to vary our objective from medium-term and longer-term inflation trends   Following Vincent’s outline, I believe our objective should be stated in terms of the   broadest available measure of the purchasing power of money  The best measure we have of the   true consumption value of the dollar is the price index for personal consumption expenditures  I   believe that the overall index would be preferable to the core as an objective  I know I’ve argued   in the past for focusing on core PCE; but on reconsideration, I’ve changed my mind  The   various arguments for excluding food and energy are narrow, they’re somewhat technical, and   they’re difficult to explain to the public—I should know, I’ve tried  [Laughter]  The arguments   are incomplete as well in the sense of the range of considerations that one has regarding choosing   the inflation rate—only some of them tell you to stabilize the core inflation rate  Reducing   uncertainty about the rate of return on the purchasing power of money suggests a broader index   and one that is much easier for the public to understand  Moreover, I don’t think arguments for   the core, the way it is constructed now, are likely to be robust to structural changes in the   economy, shifts in what prices are sticky, what prices are not, what are market determined and   what not, and stochastic properties of various components of inflation  Granted, the overall   index is more variable than the core right now, but fluctuations in the overall index are more   transitory than the core as well  We’re naturally going to factor that variability into our   forecasts, our actions, and our communications  In explaining the transitory influences on the   March 20-21, 2007 117 of 196    overall index, we can easily refer to the core, if that makes sense, as aiding our judgment about   where the overall index is going to go  The fact that various payment programs like Social   Security are indexed to the CPI is, in my mind, of no consequence for this choice  If we target   the PCE price index, it will naturally rise in prominence over time  No matter which index we   use to stabilize, people with income indexed to the CPI are going to be exposed to the risk   associated with the measurement error in the CPI  It doesn’t matter what we target; they still   bear that risk   Although I and others have discussed a range of comfort zones in the past, I’m   uncomfortable with the ambiguity of presenting only a target range for inflation  When inflation   is above the target range, for example, the public would be unclear about whether we intend to   bring inflation back to the center of the zone or whether getting just inside the top of the range   would constitute success in our eyes  I think it makes most sense to specify our objective as a   single number but also to provide a range around the objective within which we would generally   expect inflation to remain and to provide a sense of how close to our objective we expect to be   on average; that would help enhance our accountability   What number should we choose as an objective?  Our inflation mandate specifies price   stability  The biases in our measures of inflation imply that price stability corresponds to   something a bit below 1 percent for the overall PCE right now  The main consideration usually   advanced for choosing a number appreciably above price stability is the notion of building in a   buffer to reduce the probability of encountering the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates    There seems to be substantial popular confusion about the zero bound and its implications for   monetary policy  But I agree with you, Mr Chairman, that we have all the tools necessary to   deal with this problem  Now, granted, the effectiveness of some of those tools would depend   March 20-21, 2007 118 of 196    critically on communicating credibly to the public, so the zero bound might present us with some   unique communication challenges, should we encounter it  I can imagine giving such potential   challenges some small weight in choosing a target value, but I emphasize small because, as I   said, I believe we would have all the tools we need at our disposal, and we ought to be able to   communicate that fact   Taking all of this on board, I believe 1 percent would be our best choice for a numerical   inflation objective  I believe 1½ percent would be tolerably close to price stability, but I view   2 percent as incompatible with our price stability mandate  Should we adopt an objective above   1 percent, however, we should not emphasize the zero bound because doing so would only   reinforce the public’s sense of anxiety should the situation ever arise  I think we should provide   the guidance that we expect overall inflation to generally remain within plus or minus 1 percent   of our objective  We should view our choice of objective as close to permanent—this is   important  That is, we should be extremely reluctant to alter our numerical target  We are   inviting people to make long-run plans on the basis of our commitment, and they should be able   to count on us over the long haul   A corollary of viewing our choice as permanent is that we should not place any weight at   all on current initial conditions and the associated transition costs when choosing what to target    A universal property of monetary models, and many other models as well, is that initial   conditions have no bearing on the long-run inflation rate under optimal policy  It doesn’t matter   where you start; you get to the same optimal inflation rate in the end  Furthermore, choosing a   target closer than otherwise to where we are now in an effort to avoid transition costs would   delay and dilute the contribution to our credibility—delay because eventually the inflation rate   will change and we will need to take action to return inflation to target, and dilute because   March 20-21, 2007 119 of 196    choosing a target to match current inflation will encourage the public to believe that if inflation   drifts away we might change the target again to avoid short-run transition costs  After all, a fear   of transition costs is exactly what discouraged us from taking sufficient action to stem inflation   before 1979  Moreover, the staff memo by Reifschneider and Tetlow shows how the transition   costs can be minimal if we successfully communicate our intentions     Question 4 is, What’s the time horizon by which the goal should typically be achieved—  that is, how long would we expect it to take to get to the target at any point in time and from any   state of the world?  Well, this may vary  I believe that most of the time we should be able to   conduct policy so that inflation is expected to return to the objective within two years, assuming   that the public understands how we are conducting policy  An important consideration here is   that the credibility of an objective will depend on the public’s ability to assess our adherence to   it  The longer the time that we allow for expected returns to target, the more often shocks will   interfere and the public’s inference problem will be that much harder   Question 5 has been reworded  Should the Committee participants jointly decide on its   goal, either through a formal vote or an informal consensus?  You know, if that means striving   for broad agreement, yes  If that means an individual participant should be able to veto an   agreement, my answer is no, especially if it’s President Geithner  [Laughter]  Question 7 is,   Should participants’ views be made public in the minutes?  I guess this question has been   reworded, too  How should the public be informed?  If I’m reading this correctly, it refers to   how the various views of participants that are expressed during deliberations on establishing a   numerical objective be revealed or not  I see no reason that dissenting views should not be   faithfully reflected in the minutes  But I’m assuming that, once a decision is made, participants   March 20-21, 2007 120 of 196    are going to accept the agreed-upon goal as the Committee’s objective and the basis for   policymaking     Regarding the trial run, I support doing one in May  I only have a couple of minor   comments  The first is that I would take the instruction to base projections on “an appropriate   path of monetary policy” to mean an appropriate reaction function because I think conditioning   on a fixed, time-invariant path for the policy rate doesn’t make much sense and makes it harder   to explain what the fan charts are all about  I would also note that the way in which the   simulations underlying the confidence intervals in the fan charts are presented, at least as I   interpret them, did not appear to capture parameter uncertainty  Perhaps other sources of   uncertainty as well are omitted  We should strive to construct those so that they do convey all   the sources of uncertainty that we’re capable of incorporating, so they should be comprehensive   in that regard  That concludes my remarks  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Mr Chairman?     I’d like to respectfully just ask a question     To try to clarify your views, Governor Mishkin—if inflation were now 4   percent and we began conducting optimal policy, do you think the inflation rate under that   optimal policy from now on—ten or twenty years from now—would be 4 percent?     So your view about the steady-state optimal inflation rate is what?      This is sort of obvious, but the further out you go, the more uncertainty   there is about the purchasing power of the euro  What would you tell someone to assume for twenty   years’ worth of euro inflation?  If you can’t give them a number, that’s intensifying the uncertainty   in a seemingly needless way     That’s great  I’m not surprised that there is some mean to the financial   markets’ estimate of long-run inflation there  That’s consistent with the ECB’s view about how   they conduct policy—I mean, this is more of an optics and communication issue  If that’s how   they’re conducting policy, why not say 19?   March 20-21, 2007 172 of 196      Thank you, Mr Chairman  Fifth District economic activity continues to   be mixed  Our manufacturing indicators continued to drift lower in the past few weeks,   apparently diverging from the national trend  This may be because furniture and textiles are   particularly weak, and these industries are a significantly greater share of our activity than of   activity elsewhere  Respondents’ expectations regarding future manufacturing activity remained   upbeat but had drifted a bit lower  After two bad months, readings on the District’s retail sector   have returned to neutral, helped by a sharp turnaround in big ticket sales  Retail employment and   wage indexes rose significantly as well, and expectations for future demand increased sharply    For services firms outside the retail sector, our index has moderated a bit over the past three   months, though it remains positive, and measures of expected demand have held up quite well    Housing markets in our District are typically busiest this time of year, as elsewhere, and contacts   are reporting softer overall sales this year, as you might expect  Having said that, I continue,   however, to hear reports that homes priced below $250,000 or above $700,000 are selling well    We hear reports of a lack of inventory close to DC, although President Lockhart has a property   for sale you might be interested in  [Laughter]     Commercial real estate activity generally remains solid, although some   observers expressed concern about the sustainability of the quite strong pace of office   construction in Northern Virginia  Our survey measures of manufacturing-price trends seem to   have moderated since the beginning of the year, consistent with sluggish demand in that sector    May 9, 2007 37 of 130    On the services side, price trends seem to have declined somewhat since the first half of last   year, although measures of services prices have been choppy and trendless over the past few   months as a whole   Turning to the national economy, housing news has been disappointing, but news about   business investment and manufacturing has been encouraging  However, the overall outlook   hasn’t changed terribly much since our last meeting  Housing begins to stabilize in the second   half of this year, business investment in equipment and software picks up, and consumer   spending remains relatively healthy  As a result, I expect real growth to return to trend in ’08    Although my outlook broadly agrees with that of the Greenbook, there are some minor   differences—but I should emphasize that they are minor  First, I remain a tad more optimistic   about trend growth  I’m expecting something closer to 2¾ than to 2½  Second, I still think that   residential investment will bottom out in the middle of the year rather than continue to slide into   ’08  Of course, it is quite difficult to have a lot of confidence in any one scenario for the housing   market, in part because the recent data have been fairly choppy  The figures for homes sales,   which late last year suggested that housing demand had stabilized, now suggest that demand may   be taking another step downward  If so, this would increase the size of the cumulative reduction   in starts relative to new-home sales that will be needed to work off the inventory overhang  It’s   very hard to know, however, just how far housing activity needs to fall before it comes back into   stable alignment with income and preferences  But my hunch is that the drag on growth will not   last quite as long as the Greenbook says, and I still see reasonably good prospects for stability in   the housing sector in the second half of this year  I also think that the housing correction will   have only limited effects on spending outside residential investment  In particular, I’m a bit   more optimistic than the Greenbook about household spending     May 9, 2007 38 of 130    As for inflation, the Greenbook now has us waiting until the third quarter of ’08 before   we see a moderation in core inflation  Even then, we get only 01 percent  I would view this   outcome as fairly disappointing  But if I had been asked for an unconditional forecast, I   probably would have submitted something a lot like that  Instead, we were asked for a projection   conditional on what, in our judgment, would be an appropriate monetary policy  So the   projection I submitted has core PCE inflation at 18 percent next year and 16 percent in 2009    Under what, in my judgment, would be an appropriate monetary policy, we use the Chairman’s   July testimony to announce that the FOMC’s objective is for PCE inflation to average   1½ percent and that the Committee intends to reduce inflation to that level within two years    While such an announcement would not necessarily shift inflation expectations immediately   downward, I project that consistent communications from Committee members accompanied by   further rate increases when downside growth risks abate later this year would bring expectations   into line with our objective by early next year  Although growth would be weaker this year than   in my unconditional forecast, it would ultimately return to trend in 2008, and the properly   measured sacrifice ratio would turn out to be significantly smaller than is often assumed or   inferred from standard Phillips curve estimates  I mention this scenario simply to reiterate that I   believe that there’s a feasible alternative to the hypothesis that inflation will settle in around   2 percent or higher unless we engineer a substantial output gap     Policy should be straightforward today  We’re waiting out a lull in growth   while inflation is unacceptably high, at least to most of us  When the downside risks have   sufficiently diminished, I’m presuming we’re going to want to take action to bring inflation down;   but in the meantime, we are on the sidelines obviously with regard to rates     Coming into this I had thought the statement was going to be a pretty straightforward matter   as well  Evidently not  Markets finally figured out what we meant in the last statement  I think you   are right, Mr Chairman, in your autoregressive model of the statement language  The markets do a   May 9, 2007 92 of 130    Kalman filter on whatever we issue and attach great importance to whatever we change  I do not   think much has changed about the outlook to warrant significant changes in language, although I’d   be sympathetic to taking out “on balance” on the theory that it is a hawkish move in general    [Laughter]  About what Gary said, I am really sympathetic to the notion of changing the way we   refer to the relationship between resource utilization and inflation in our statements  I say that   because the best mainstream understanding is that resource utilization and inflation are the joint   outcome of economic decisions given our actions and given what we’re expected to do  One can   talk about resource utilization affecting inflation  One can just as well talk about moderating   inflation keeping resource utilization high  There is really no superiority to one characterization or   the other  So the idea that a sort of independent thing is wagging around there driving inflation,   rather than both of them being the result of our actions, is an area in which we could improve the   public’s understanding of our understanding of how monetary policy affects the economy   I would also like to endorse the spirit of President Poole’s remarks about inflation and what   we want  You know, about this notion of opportunism or the idea of an interim target, I think again   about my brother-in-law sitting down in front of retirement planning software  I guess I would be   left telling him, “Well, you should put in between 1 and 2,” depending on when we decide to take   the opportunity to reduce inflation below 2 percent  I do not think that’s satisfactory  I think we can   do better  When we choose an objective, we should view it as a once-and-for-all thing  Part of that   reflects a sense that, well, if transition costs are something we are going to describe as keeping us   from going to where we now think we ought to be ultimately, what if shocks bump us up to 2¾ or   3 percent?  Are we going to say the same thing then?  I mean, it is inviting people to think that, and   it is just sort of painting ourselves into a corner  Governor Kohn, you referred to the net welfare   costs of 2 versus 1½ percent inflation  If you do the optimal-policy calculation, the only thing that   May 9, 2007 93 of 130    governs where you get in the long run, no matter how long it takes, is that net welfare calculation    So that’s what should govern where we choose to set our objective, not whether we think transition   costs are going to be high now or not  That concludes my remarks, Mr Chairman     I’m against it     No  Against “on balance”     I’d second being a little more transparent within the Committee about   the fed funds rate  Compared with other elements of the sausage factory that get revealed in the   transcript five years from now, I don’t see why that should be so sensitive  More broadly,   though, looking at these charts, I was really struck by the dispersion of inflation forecasts for   2009  I would think we would be quite uncomfortable releasing that  The natural interpretation   of one’s forecast for inflation at that horizon is going to be what one’s objective for inflation is,   May 9, 2007 107 of 130    and this portrays a Committee that has not come to agreement on its objective for the central   thing that it’s responsible for controlling  Given that, I think that we want to come to closure on   this issue before we go live  Indeed, we’re doing a dry run without having gone through that  I   think the dry run after we go through that is arguably going to be different, and to my mind this   argues for coming to closure sooner rather than later     I am always in favor of more understanding, but for this   Committee, what I know about this now suggests that there isn’t any reason for us to be   involved  I compliment Vice Chairman Geithner on not serving sandwiches in this case    [Laughter]  I agree with Vice Chairman Geithner—there’s a certain danger of our   commenting on stuff like this and leading people to believe that we feel some responsibility   for damping or otherwise minimizing the effects of changes in market prices on the changes   in other market prices     I want to take David back to exhibit 5 and try to pin him down,   although I am not very hopeful  [Laughter]  You took us back to the period from 1996 to   mid-2004, in which inflation, by the core PCE measure, was between 1 and 2 almost all   the time—I think the only exception was basically the last few months of 2001  Core   inflation averaged something like 16 percent  You take these three survey measures   there and look at them  What I took away from your assessment was that you view these   as roughly consistent with that period  Is that fair?     I am wholly on board with you there  What I was most curious   about was what you took away from this for your core inflation outlook, which you have   going to 20 real soon and staying there, and whether you view current expectations as   broadly similar to this period and your forecast as consistent with that period?  Or do you   view expectations and your forecast as potentially at variance with that period, or some   combination of the two?     Okay  A question I had—and maybe Vince can help with this—  is that the TIPS measures obviously don’t go back that far; and going back only as far as   they go, my sense is that most analysts don’t view them in the earliest period in which we   have quotations as representing prices and markets liquid enough to give us a sense  I   guess 2003 is around the borderline of the reliability period  In 2003, those TIPS spreads   for the next five years were down well into the 1 to 2 percent range, very close to   June 27-28, 2007 26 of 261    1½ percent  Do you folks view the TIPS spreads in the year or two leading to 2003 as   something out of which we should take any information about inflation expectations?     It goes back only to ’04, doesn’t it?     Well, I was looking at Greenbook Part 2, page II-35, and it goes   back to ’01     So there is some informational content there  Are you giving me   some comfort in that regard?     The TIPS spread measure?      June 27-28, 2007 27 of 261      Right  So the longer-run expectations maybe weren’t so   anchored or weren’t tied to the middle of this period  But we had a period in which there   was an indication that expectations over the near term were around 1½  I guess the thing   I would be curious about, and maybe Vince’s presentation is a more appropriate time to   address this question—I would be happy to defer it until then—is that viewing 1996 to   2003 as sort of a distinct period in which we nailed things between 1 and 2 for a while   suggests thinking about the transition from ’03 forward a couple of years as a transition   out of price stability defined that way and whether we can take any lessons from that for   the potential costs of a transition back to a period like that     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Fifth District’s economy has   picked up since the last meeting  Retail sales rose briskly in June following several   months of flatness, and shopper traffic increased more broadly as well  Of particular   interest, building supply and furniture retailers report better sales  Big-ticket sales remain   generally weak, however, with domestic brand automobile dealers continuing to note soft   sales  Activity at District services firms added to an already healthy pace of growth, with   revenues and employment expanding somewhat faster in June  In May, our   manufacturing sector finally joined in the general manufacturing pickup that began a few   months back in other regions  Our indexes for shipments and new orders swung well into   positive territory after having spent the entire year well down in the negative region  This   rebound appears to be broadly based, with most industries posting stronger readings    Housing sales and construction remain weak in most parts of the District, though home   prices have been more resilient, with very modest gains reported in most areas and lower   prices in only a few  In contrast, the commercial real estate sector appears to be fairly   strong, with both leasing and construction looking solid   Regarding inflation, our survey measures suggest that price trends in the services   sector remain moderate  Our manufacturing numbers, however, consistent with President   June 27-28, 2007 42 of 261    Moskow’s report of anecdotal information, indicate significant price acceleration, on both   the product and the input sides   At the national level, the new information on the real economy we have received   since the last meeting has been fairly positive  In particular, I’m heartened by the recent   reports on business investment and manufacturing, which appear to confirm our   expectations that the softness we were seeing a few months ago would prove to be   transitory  Consumer spending also continues to expand, although not as rapidly as   earlier in the year  Housing, of course, continues to be the main drag on spending, and   the most prominent source of uncertainty about the real outlook  My sense is that the   uncertainty is receding, however  Construction numbers have more or less moved   sideways since the beginning of the year, in contrast to the sharp fall we saw in the first   three quarters of last year  So it looks to me as though we’re nearing a bottom in housing   activity, albeit a bottom that may slope gently away from the steep cliff we descended   last year  At this point, I think the risk of encountering another cliff has become   relatively small   We have also received favorable readings on core inflation for the past three   months  This has brought the twelve-month core PCE number down to 20 percent    While this news is good, we should react cautiously, of course  We have seen several   months of favorable data before only to see several months of unfavorable numbers    Moreover, the Greenbook points to a number of special factors suggesting that the second   quarter’s better inflation performance is likely to be transitory  I am inclined to agree   with that assessment, and so I think we could well see core inflation rise again   June 27-28, 2007 43 of 261    Measures of near-term inflation expectations have not moved much in recent   months They all still point to PCE inflation expectations of 2 percent or so  Moreover,   five-year, five-year-ahead inflation compensation has moved up ¼ percentage point, for   whatever reason, since just before our last meeting  All this makes it hard to be confident   that we are going to see a sustained decline of inflation below 2 percent anytime soon    The good news on the real side, however, suggests that we are making progress toward   seeing downside risks diminish enough for us to do something about inflation  Thank   you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Before I talk about policy, let me just   note that it has been a tremendous pleasure being a colleague of President Minehan over   the years and being an immediate neighbor of hers—[laughter]—at Federal Open Market   Committee meetings  For one thing, she has done a great job as buffer between me and   the President of the New York Bank  [Laughter]     For another, I have gotten an up-close view of some really   dazzling jewelry  [Laughter]     Core inflation has come down recently  But as I mentioned   earlier, my sense is that it could well rise again  In any event, it doesn’t seem likely to   fall much further  So I think we have to position ourselves to do something about   inflation when we are more certain that the soft patch is behind us  I support the actions   in alternative B  I support Vince Reinhart’s language from yesterday  I am sure there   will be more amendments put on the table  I don’t want to start now by commenting on   everything that has been put on the table  I will just say that, as we recognized at our last   meeting, if inflation fell, we would have a problem characterizing inflation, and core PCE   inflation has indeed fallen and could well go below that number on Friday, according to   the staff  So it seems appropriate to recognize that improvement     The difficulty, of course, is how to do so in a way that respects the fact that we   haven’t yet decided whether our objective for inflation is 1½ or 2 percent  This is what   motivated my letter to the Committee last week  I didn’t think the first draft of   alternative B was sufficiently agnostic on the question  My advisers and I put our heads   together, and we couldn’t figure out a way to rewrite the statement to acknowledge the   decline but not tip our hand toward preferring one objective or another  So that is why in   my letter I proposed that we go ahead and make a decision by choosing between   language consistent with 1½ and language consistent with 2  After all, we are widely   seen to want an inflation rate between 1 and 2, and we communicated that via language in   our statement expressing displeasure with inflation below 1 and, more recently,   expressing displeasure with inflation above 2   Sure enough, however, some people with far more expertise in the mysterious art   of drafting FOMC statements seem to have found a way around this, and the revised   June 27-28, 2007 103 of 261    statement seems to finesse this pretty well—the language “moderation in inflation has yet   to be convincingly demonstrated”  In other words, we don’t have to say how we feel   about 2 percent inflation because we are not really sure that inflation is 2 percent yet    Now, I think this will finesse the problem for the time being  Assuming that it does   finesse the issue—and that is sort of a big “if”—I don’t think we are likely to be able to   finesse this issue forever  If core inflation does spend some time near 2 percent, as the   Greenbook forecasts, then eventually it will become convincingly demonstrated that   inflation is indeed 2 percent  More broadly, the lack of a decision about our objective   will continue to pose difficulties both for our statement and our deliberations, and I think   it is going to be increasingly unsatisfactory to say we are still thinking about it  So I hope   we can make progress on that soon  Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  We were asked to comment on a long   list of questions concerning economic projections, the minutes, and the statement  In   addition, Governor Kohn has put out the broader question of the general thrust of the   direction we’re going in, and I’d like to focus my remarks on the latter  Frankly, right now I   think the most important question regarding the release of our projections concerns the   relationship of these communication devices to our inflation objective  Everything else is   more or less small potatoes right now  I believe it would be a mistake to release our   projections without agreeing on it and communicating a Committee inflation objective  It’s   inevitable; in fact, it’s intended the way you described it, Mr Chairman, that participants’   third-year inflation projections will be interpreted as the equivalent of an objective  I think   this would be problematic without an explicit statement of an objective for a number of   reasons   June 27-28, 2007 152 of 261    First, our projections display a nontrivial dispersion, admittedly a narrow range, but   market participants are going to have a keen interest in whether we believe a 19 percent   inflation rate, say, is too high or just about right  Financial market participants already   believe that there’s a dispersion of the Committee members’ preferred inflation rate and that   it lies between 1½ and 2 percent  I note that showing that every individual preferred   inflation rate spans a range of 1½ to 2 percent is not equivalent to the Committee’s deciding   that its collective preferred inflation rate is for anything within a band of 1½ to 2 percent    So I don’t think this is going to enhance the clarity of the public’s understanding of our   intentions much at all   Second, communicating our inflation objective via three-year-out projections would   accomplish little by way of enhancing any commitment since we’d release the projections   anew three or four times a year with the implication that our implied objective could change   over time  I’ll remind you again about my brother-in-law doing retirement benefit   projections, just to make the important point that a significant part of the value of an   announced objective is to reduce long-run uncertainty about inflation    Third, our inflation projections would be displayed alongside exactly analogous   projections for unemployment and GDP growth in an exactly analogous way  This would   confuse people about the economics of monetary policy  In that context, how do we convey   that we do not have numerical targets for unemployment or growth?  How do we convey   that inflation is a variable that we control in the medium and long run, but we cannot peg   growth or unemployment at any one number in a sustained way?  In other words, how do   we remind people that the long-run Phillips curve is virtually vertical?  A related   consideration is that, if we present our projections this way and do not clearly state our   June 27-28, 2007 153 of 261    inflation objectives, it’s not hard to imagine someone in the Congress trying to hold us as   accountable for our unemployment projection as for our inflation projections  This would   be a dramatic step backward for us, I think   Fourth, and probably the most pressing and immediate problem in my view,   publishing our projections this way will do nothing to improve the clarity of our internal   deliberations or to alleviate the problems we have and will continue to have in writing   statements in the absence of an agreed-upon objective    For these reasons, I believe that the release of economic projections containing   participants’ forecasts for inflation three years out would be a poor and ineffective substitute   for an explicitly articulated objective and would be problematic without such an objective    Now, let me be clear  I do think we should move ahead in this direction, and I applaud your   leadership, Mr Chairman, for putting something on the table today at the outset of the   discussion  I just think we should do this in conjunction with the inevitable other step of   agreeing on what we’re about here in the Committee  I can appreciate the sensitivity to the   likelihood that various politicians may react to our communication of an explicit numerical   objective; but over the past thirty years, politicians have reacted to many of our actions that   were integral to our successes over that period  We should decide honestly what we believe   is best for the country and communicate it clearly and with confidence  Thank you, Mr   Chairman     Yes     If I could just add to that  I had a similar reaction to Vice   Chairman Geithner  When we targeted money supply growth, markets reacted to money   June 27-28, 2007 187 of 261    supply growth figures because they thought we were going to react to money supply   growth  If Red Sox victories influence a fed funds rate setting, the market would react to   the Red Sox  Obviously, we are going to manipulate the fed funds rate in response to   inflation  I don’t think that is going to drop off the table anytime soon  So it sort of   sounds great to say that they don’t care about inflation, that they care about the fed funds   rate  Well, they are going to care about inflation if they care about the fed funds rate     I thank Vice Chairman Geithner for clarifying his views  I   couldn’t agree more that there is a vast range of uncertainty out there about which we   can’t help markets and they can’t help us  We would all like to know more about the   future  That is why it is imperative, to me at least, that we focus on resolving the   uncertainty we can resolve  Foremost on that list would be our coming to terms with   decisions that we eventually will have to make about our intentions  Just leave it at that   June 27-28, 2007 189 of 261      I like the statement as is  I was one of those who, when we   considered accelerating the release of the minutes, thought that it would take some weight   off crafting the statement, which we could shorten  Alas, I was incorrect, and that was sort   of hopeless  So I’m giving up  I sort of like the length the statement is now  It does a   June 27-28, 2007 204 of 261    reasonable job with what it does, with one exception—the last section, the so-called   balance-of-risk assessment  I’ve argued this many times when we’ve talked about this  The   intention is to convey the likely next direction of interest rate changes  Our general practice   has been—there have been some exceptions—to describe the risks to the things we care   about, and we invite people to deduce what we think of as the likely next direction of   interest rate moves by inverting our policy reaction function somehow  I always thought   that was problematic, needlessly obscure, and I liked the times when we crafted that   statement fairly directly and explicitly with phrases like “policy firming”   About the balance-of-risk assessments, I hesitate to put something else on the table,   but we ought to think about the directive, too, because the balance-of-risk assessment came   into the statement because it was in the directive and there was a tilt statement in the   directive that originated in the ’80s as a way of providing the Committee’s sense of   constraint on the Chairman’s discretion to make intermeeting moves  That’s my   understanding of how it arose  Then it came to be about the next meeting when we did   intermeeting moves, and now it’s just sitting there in the directive, and I don’t know what   good it does in the directive really  You know, we don’t make intermeeting moves   I don’t   know what our understanding is about discretion about intermeeting moves  I think that   we’re supposed to have a conference call with everybody  So I don’t know why we need   this little directive in there, and it seems to me you could just take it out of the directive   About governance, I’m in favor of voting on the whole thing  I remember talking at   one point with I think it was you, Mr Chairman, and others about how it is backward for us   to talk about the statement—to do negotiations about the statement—a week before we even   talk to each other or read the Greenbook  But I don’t think that’s so problematic  It doesn’t   June 27-28, 2007 205 of 261    end up putting our feet in cement really, and I think we’ve been able to have sufficient   flexibility during the meeting despite what we said the week before  So I don’t view that as   terribly problematic     I’m not sure I heard you clearly, Mike, but I want to clarify  I was   advocating eliminating the risk assessment from the directive, but I would keep that section   in the statement     David, when you were describing the implications of the GDP revisions for   your assessment of the output gap, you said that you essentially marked down potential by the same   amount as realized growth recently based on your assessment of pressures in product markets  In   case we wanted to try it at home, I was wondering if you could say a little more about what data that   assessment of pressures in product markets relies on?     I guess my question was motivated by my sense that estimates of the   current output gap tend to play an important role in your outlook for near-term inflation trends  To   the extent that the current estimate of the output gap is derived from current inflation, I am   wondering if it provides less independent information than current inflation about future inflation   than one might otherwise have thought     Thank you, Mr Chairman  In the Fifth District we continue to see   moderate economic growth, though it has been uneven across sectors in recent weeks    Manufacturing activity rebounded somewhat in June and July after several months of weakness,   with our indexes showing increases in new orders and shipments  Activity at District services firms   advanced at a steady pace, with solid revenue growth and a broader pickup in hiring  The retail   sector, however, has lost much of the momentum reported last month, as softness in big-ticket   categories continues to constrain revenue growth  On the employment front, District labor markets   are increasingly taut, given steady hiring activity and slower labor force growth  In addition, in   contrast to the Eighth Federal Reserve District, contacts continue to report rising wage pressures and   difficulty finding qualified workers  Housing markets remain weak across much of the District    However, commercial real estate activity remains healthy, with steady demand reported for office   and industrial space  Some contacts, however, have expressed concern about slower activity in the   retail segment of that market  Turning to prices, our July surveys indicate increased inflation   August 7, 2007 57 of 136    pressures  The average current rate of increase of manufacturers’ prices has moved up for both raw   materials and finished goods over the past few months, reversing the decline seen earlier this year    Price pressures on the services side have picked up as well, though expectations for future prices   eased somewhat in the July report   At the national level, we continued to receive fairly good news on inflation  After   annualized rates of monthly core PCE inflation above 2 percent at the beginning of the year, we’ve   now had four months of readings below 2  But there are still abundant reasons for caution, as   President Moskow, for example, noted  I’ll mention the Greenbook, which cites transitory   factors—apparel and owners’ equivalent rent, for instance—that have contributed to the recent   moderation  The passing of these damping forces could well push core inflation back up in the near   term  So although I think we have reason to take some comfort from recent inflation numbers, and I   do, I want to wait to see more evidence, especially as growth moves back toward trend   I still think the prospects for a return to trend growth are reasonably good, and my   assessment of trend is still a bit higher than the Greenbook’s, in part because I’ve not revised my   estimate of productivity growth much in response to the GDP revisions  Obviously, there are   downside risks to be concerned about, and financial market activity since the last meeting obviously   raises some concerns  As far as we can tell at this point, the heightened turbulence of the past   month is all pretty closely related to subprime and nontraditional mortgages and the leveraged   financing of private equity buyouts in the corporate sector  These two market segments are   relatively new, and they represent the latest manifestation of the broad, ongoing wave of financial   innovation that we’ve been seeing over the past few decades  Because these two markets are so   young, one would expect participants’ risk assessments to be more uncertain and thus be more   sensitive to what is learned from market events and incoming news  That said, developments in the   August 7, 2007 58 of 136    past month have certainly been quite dramatic, and it looks less like rapid learning than it does rapid   unlearning of what was previously viewed as known—although that, too, is of course a form of   learning     The implication of these revised risk assessments for the economic outlook and for policy   depend on whether they affect business investment or household spending on consumption or new   housing  At this point the answer to that question is not yet clear, but it’s worth noting that, by   many measures, corporate credit quality seems to remain pretty good by historical standards, and   the buyout movement, as President Poole just noted, seems to have been more about restructuring   liabilities and governance arrangements and less about funding capital spending  So it’s not obvious   why there should be dramatic effects on business investment  What about consumption?  PCE was   fairly soft last quarter, and this softness could be a harbinger of more-sustained weakness  The   second-quarter softness may well be a one-time phenomenon, however, reflecting both the sharp   rise in gasoline prices in the first five months of the year and some payback from the strong   spending growth in Q4 and Q1  Moreover, the outlook for household income looks pretty good,   with labor market conditions fairly firm and consumption gains showing no sign of slowing down    In addition, household net worth is coming off a relatively high base  Neither of these fundamentals   seems likely to be seriously threatened by the repricing that’s in train     Housing, on the other hand, continues to be the predominant area of concern regarding real   spending, and financial market developments have only heightened that concern  The Greenbook   paints a fairly pessimistic picture  The decline in residential investment accelerates over the   remainder of year and continues into next, and the inclusion of three “greater housing correction”   alternative scenarios suggests that the staff is especially concerned, justifiably so in my view, with   the downside risk to their outlook  But even though the housing market has definitely deteriorated,   August 7, 2007 59 of 136    the outlook for housing is quite uncertain in my mind, and I continue to think that a more moderate   decline is also possible and that housing could be somewhat less of a drag on growth than the   Greenbook forecasts  At this point, however, the reassessment under way in secondary markets   regarding housing-related credits still has a way to go, and until that process plays out, it’s going to   be hard to gauge the resulting magnitude of repricing at the retail level  About all I conclude at this   point is that the outlook for housing is still awfully uncertain right now  Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I think we have a couple of issues in front of   us today  First, do we react to the recent inflation numbers?  I have been pleased by the recent   reports, as I said, coming in better than expected, but there seems to be a substantial chance that   the improvement we have seen is temporary and that we will get some higher figures later this   year  Moreover, inflation expectations remain above where I’d like them to be, so I don’t think   we should relax our characterization of inflation in this statement  A second question we face is   how to react to the recent turmoil in financial markets  I think we need to be careful to maintain   our focus on the implications of market developments for the anticipated paths of inflation and   real spending  At this point, I don’t see those implications being substantial enough to warrant a   policy response on our part or a change in our sense of the likely near-term policy path, though   August 7, 2007 92 of 136    obviously this assessment may change as events unfold  Absent evidence of such implications,   our financial stability responsibilities can be met quite adequately through the automatic supply   of reserves under the Desk’s operating procedures for targeting the overnight federal funds rate   or through the supply of reserves to solvent institutions at the discount window  Unfortunately,   the recent behavior of the fed funds futures market and recent financial press commentary   suggest that some market participants, perhaps thinking back to 1987 or 1998, believe that   financial market turbulence per se will induce us to respond with interest rate cuts  Even if we   did cut rates to counter financial market volatility, financial market jitters might take some time   to dissipate  We may be reluctant to undo such rate cuts in the meantime, and we would run the   risk that policy then becomes too easy and we get behind the curve  My main concern is the risk   that our communication today might mislead markets into thinking that we may cut rates in   response to asset-price volatility per se, absent any expectation of sustained effects on the real   economy or inflation  Accordingly, I believe the statement language should acknowledge the   recent developments as in the second part of alternative B but not go any further  I’m concerned   about paragraph 4 and adding the passage about downside risks to growth increasing  I’m   concerned that it may go a bit too far in that direction  I think that the minutes should   acknowledge the problems in subprime and private equity markets, and I also think the minutes   should educate financial markets that the mitigation of volatility in asset prices is not an FOMC   objective  Thank you     About classic lender-of-last-resort operations, we asked people at the Open   Market Desk how much additional reserves it takes to lower the federal funds rate ¼ percentage   point  It is on the order of a couple of ten million—so 75 basis points added maybe $100, maybe   $150 million in that instance  You know, I’d venture that that was probably trivial in terms of   adding liquidity to the market after LTCM  The real effect it had was altering the then-current and   expected path of the real overnight federal funds rate  As you know, Rick, the classic lender-of-last-  resort option had to do with the 1900s and preventing interest rates from spiking above current rates,   not from adding reserves or driving down interest rates  So I think it is a confusion to link things   like what we did in ’87 or ’98 to the classic lender-of-last-resort operation     It is not clear whether probability distributions over the fundamentals have   shifted or whether the probability distribution over marginal utility has shifted  Do you see what I   mean?     It is not clear whether their attitudes to a given risk have changed or their   assessments of the magnitude of the risks have changed     But that says one of them  That says the latter       But that’s not clear  It is not clear that it isn’t just a widening of the   probability distribution over the relevant outcomes      No, it encompasses both of what I was referring to, and so that would be a   way to do it      One factor for me is that “volatility” is a very broad term, and “risk   premiums” refers to a narrow set of markets, and this way shifts the focus off equity markets     Bill, I have a couple of things  There are asset-backed commercial paper   programs that are backed by mortgage-backed securities  How much of those are showing up in our   mortgage-backed tranches in recent RPs, in recent interventions like yesterday’s?  I guess you don’t   find out until later in the day how much of that shows up in today’s intervention  Another question I   have would be how late in the day you feel that you can do another RP operation     The other one is, How late in the day do you think you can do an RP   operation?  Then a third question I have has to do with the RP market in general  I’ve heard about   asset-backed paper going into RP programs instead of outrights, and I’m wondering whether that’s   affecting trading in the RP market and whether there are RP spreads for different collateral  What   are you hearing about that?     Just in response to you, Richard, I agree with Tim that the last thing we   want to do is to be sending a message behind the scenes as we did in ’87, encouraging anybody to   lend to anybody they wouldn’t otherwise be interested in lending to under their current operating   risk-management standards  What I like about the statement that the Chairman read to us is the   focus on keeping the federal funds rate near its target  I think that’s what we should remain focused   on  Credit spreads are beyond our ability to peg or influence, and I don’t think we should go down   the road of trying to do so  I agree with President Geithner that the statement takes its power from   that  It’s important for us in our deliberations to remain clinical about this and very specific in our   diagnosis of symptoms and what’s going on  I think markets are working fine  The quantities just   happen to be zero right now in some of them, [laughter] and things are going to hell in a handbasket     Bill, do we still sterilize discount window loans?     I have a question for anyone from the New York Bank or Governor Kohn    What do people expect banks to do in response to this?  In particular, do we have an expectation or   have we gotten information in New York or in Washington that any banks will make a particular   announcement about the types of interventions they intend to undertake in these markets?  If so, are   those announcements going to say anything about us?     If I could just follow up on that, Mr Chairman     Vice Chairman Geithner, did you say that they are unaware of what we’re   considering or what we might be doing with the discount rate?     Vice Chairman Geithner, I spoke with Ken Lewis, President and CEO of   Bank of America, this afternoon, and he said that he appreciated what Tim Geithner was arranging   by way of changes in the discount facility  So my information is different from that     About this proposal, this is a highly unusual action for the Committee and   the Board to take, and I think we should consider it very carefully  We should continue to try to be   as clinically precise in our diagnosis and our articulation of our understanding of what’s going on  I   continue to see this as driven fundamentally by the revision in beliefs about the probability   distributions governing the returns on assets backing certain other assets—asset-backed commercial   paper in the non-agency space, for example  Buyers have obviously revised down their   assessments  Sellers may or may not have revised down their assessments as well  If they haven’t,   then it’s a difference of opinion that’s leading markets to lock up at zero quantities  But we’ve   heard reports of issuers who are subject to contractual provisions that are strong disincentives for   selling at prices that will clear markets so that buyers are willing to buy—things like clauses   stipulating that too high a spread will lead to liquidation or require liquidation of a conduit facility   or that drawing on a backup line of credit would require liquidation of a conduit facility  Those   August 16, 2007 21 of 37    provisions are contractual mechanisms that they agreed to earlier to solve some time-consistency   problem  So what they’re up against would be some ex post regret, but something that stymies the   market  For whatever reason, they’re unwilling to sell at prices that will clear the market, and they   seem to be willing to bear the consequences by taking it on their balance sheets for a time or by   drawing down lines of credit  This looks like a price-discovery process in the sense that information   is emerging and being digested and market participants are groping toward a mutually consistent   view  It may take some time to resolve  It may involve substantial re-intermediation of some sort   or another  It’s very attractive to interpret what’s going on in terms of coordination problems or   multiple equilibriums   I’ll take the liberty of mentioning some models here because I don’t think we can avoid   using, either implicitly or explicitly, some theory in interpreting the data we’re seeing and   understanding how our actions might affect what’s going on  The models we have in which   financial markets are subject to these multiple-equilibrium problems are fragile, tenuous, and often   implausible, and they’re indistinguishable from an understanding based on information   accumulating and expectations being revised  For evidence in support of models like that, I’d point   out that credit-default swap spreads are fairly dispersed and they seem to distinguish very   particularly among individual institutions  So it doesn’t look like a broad-brush retreat or a lot of   confusion about who is in good shape or who is in bad shape; it looks more like people coming to   the conclusion that several people are in bad shape   In this setting, what would limit individual actions to overcome a coordination problem of   this sort?  Well, in the asset-backed commercial paper market, there are plenty of actors, plenty of   capital on the sidelines, and plenty of opportunities to buy paper if they think it’s at a price that   makes it an advantageous opportunity  There are plenty of opportunities and incentives to   August 16, 2007 22 of 37    coordinate  I’m sure that Vice Chairman Geithner is aware of conversations among large players in   New York and probably small players as well  They have plenty of opportunities to coordinate an   intervention if they view it as in their self-interest  Discount window stigma, is that a coordination   problem?  I’m highly skeptical  In the past we heard reports from the Manager of the System Open   Market Account that banks in New York were borrowing money to lend to banks in the Fifth   District when the fed funds rate spiked above the discount rate  That suggests that the price for   overcoming stigma might be relatively low  Besides, it’s hard to believe that banks are that illiquid   or that constrained by the lack of access to funding if they really want to buy something in the asset-  backed commercial paper market  It’s hard for me to believe that they couldn’t do it without our   help  Their analysis of their liquidity needs is ongoing  It’s daily  It’s extensive  Our information   is that they view themselves as well positioned in terms of liquidity  If they really wanted more   money in their reserve accounts and that’s what it took, why wouldn’t they bid the funds rate up,   and why wouldn’t we be able to satisfy that at the window?   That brings me to my main point  It’s worth pointing out that this is going to be sterilized,   just like a sterilized foreign exchange operation  The classic lender-of-last-resort doctrine—  Bagehot, you know, and what you read about that—those operations were all unsterilized  That was   how the Bank of England increased the amount of bank reserves in the system  I don’t think we’re   in that situation right now  Their insight was that it was a way to prevent an increase in demand for   liquid assets from driving up interest rates  What we’re seeing now is that the Desk is able quite   well to keep the funds rate at 5¼ or even less  Confidence—are there multiple equilibriums in   confidence?  Well, confidence is just another word for expectations about where interest rates are   going  So I don’t see that as a liquidity problem either  To some extent this looks to me like sort of   a sham  I mean, it’s a way of increasing reserves  Anyone who follows central banking is going to   August 16, 2007 23 of 37    see right through it and see what we’re doing  In the context of the likelihood that some large banks   will, on the heels of this statement, announce—or even without announcement but the word would   get out—begin intervening in the asset-backed commercial paper market, even if they don’t   reference our provision of liquidity, my guess is that word of consultations between the Federal   Reserve Bank of New York and these large institutions will get out and their operations will   inevitably be linked in subsequent commentary to our actions here today  This action is not   monetary policy  It is credit policy, and it’s risky just as foreign exchange intervention that’s   sterilized is risky  If it works, it will make money for these banks  We’ve been plastered for the   past several months about this subprime mess and not doing anything for little people, and here   what do we do?  We could easily be portrayed as helping large banks make a bunch of money on   this  If it doesn’t work, I’m a little concerned that we’re going to be forced to follow through with a   fed funds rate cut, whether or not the macroeconomic situation warrants it  I think this will look like   a bailout  To me there isn’t that much question about it  To me, this isn’t about liquidity  If it were   about liquidity, they could get it in the funds market  It must be about collateral margins and the   terms of credit     I’ll just point out about the statement that I take it that the Board of Governors is considering   adopting temporary changes to the primary credit program  Collateral margins are set by the   Reserve Banks, and I’m not so confident that our collateral margins are terribly conservative right   now  For example, on home equity lines of credit and second liens, the margin is 15 percent,   115 percent  In the marketplace now, banks are discounting that stuff at more like 35 and   40 percent  I’m not sure I’m comfortable with existing collateral margins if we’re going to get a lot   of borrowing at the discount window on paper like this  Moreover, I think that Reserve Banks are   going to be interested in taking a look at those margins  So I don’t see how the Board of Governors,   August 16, 2007 24 of 37    as a matter of clean and careful corporate governance here within the System, can make a statement   about what’s going to happen to the collateral margins  Finally, I’d note about this proposed FOMC   statement that it makes no mention of inflation  It’s not going to be missed?  Did I miss something?    Is it in there?  I don’t see it     It doesn’t say anything about inflation  It drops that dramatically, and I   think it would be a much better statement if it made some reference to inflation  If it made some   reference about where inflation is now, some observation just so that people know we’re still paying   attention to inflation and we haven’t lost track of it, as this suggests we’re about to, I’d be   supportive of issuing this statement  I think that it conveys the right tone of watchful waiting   I do think that downside risks to growth have appreciated considerably  I do think we’re   going to have to think about a rate cut  Frankly, I’ll say that, if given the choice between a rate cut   and this discount window program change, I’d rather have a rate cut right now  I think that it would   be preferable to our going down the path of credit policy  I recognize that this turbulence in   financial markets makes everybody apprehensive and that this is a time when everybody in the   System gets phone calls  You know, everyone in a position of responsibility gets phone calls and   gets suggestions about doing something to help out, and I realize that the urge to act—to do   something or at least to be seen doing something—can be irresistible  But I think that we need to   avoid the urge to play Mr Fix-It  We need to think carefully about our actions and how they will be   perceived and what types of risk they run  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Noticeably?     I want to ask about the term funding market, and I want you to help us   understand what we know about that  In typical times, like before this, do we know how much   lending was done at term in the fed funds market?  Do we know what names were typically   involved—is there a flow across the banking system of some particular structure—and what kind of   spreads are typical?  Then, what have we been observing now, in contrast?  Related to this, do we   know what names are borrowing at term now?  Do we have a sense of the extent to which the   elevated spread is a risk premium or some other effect?  Are people who are borrowing at term   tapped out at the Home Loan Bank?  Does that have some significance in the term market?  Is there   an interaction between options at the Home Loan Bank and the term market?     If I could just follow up, I know the Desk tracks overnight fed funds trades,   and you get from the dealers the quantities at different rates in order to calculate the effective rate    Are you inferring term volume from that, or do we have any other independent quantitative sources   on the volume of term funding?     Both large banks in our District have gone from being net borrowers to   being large net lenders  One, in fact, says it’s the largest in the market and lends $10 billion to   $15 billion every night overnight, and they used to borrow a couple of billion dollars every day    Could something like that account for the volume in the funds market?      Okay     Right  I was asking about the demand  I was curious about what we know   about the domestic part     Just one tiny thing—in the overnight market, from the brokers, we have   volumes traded at different rates  For the term fed funds rate, which is showing up in a graph or   September 18, 2007 17 of 188    two—I can’t remember where—does that come off broker screens?  We don’t have trades on that,   do we?     All right  Thanks     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Recent information from the Fifth District,   both from contacts and from our survey responses, suggests that growth in economic activity in   our District has slowed in recent weeks  The survey indicates that retail sales have weakened,   with big-ticket categories such as automobiles and building materials leading the way  Shopper   traffic has trailed off somewhat as well  Services firms report slower revenue growth and less   optimism about demand going forward     Activity in some District housing markets has slowed markedly in the past two to three   weeks, and some formerly healthy markets are now showing signs of weakness  One contact in   Charlotte, for example, says that sales agents there are saying the same things they were saying   in Atlanta several months ago  Residential foreclosures are more widespread, though they   appear to be concentrated or overrepresented among investors rather than owner-occupants    Mortgage activity has fallen off in the past several weeks, according to our contacts  While   September 18, 2007 62 of 188    standards have tightened for marginally qualified applicants, it is reported that mortgages remain   readily available for creditworthy borrowers  The CEO of a nationwide title insurance company   reports that their open orders have been trending down in recent weeks  He also says that they   are seeing an increase in cancellations of title insurance orders because people are applying for   more than one mortgage in the current climate     In contrast, commercial real estate conditions appear generally healthy, although recent   reports suggest that closer scrutiny is being given to marginal project proposals  Conditions in   manufacturing also look positive, shipments and new orders continue to expand, and hiring   indicators for this sector have edged higher  District price pressures remain at about the same   level they have been in recent months   Let me say that, broadly speaking across our contacts, we have heard in the past week or   two more reports mentioning a sense of gloom  This echoes what Presidents Pianalto and   Lockhart said  On the other hand, one contact in Charlotte, who has had a lot of successful   experience in real estate markets, said that compared with past crises this is a walk in the park    Maybe that is just because he has made his  It may be particular to this situation, so I don’t want   to make too much of that     The national economic data that we have received since our last meeting point pretty   clearly to a weaker economic outlook for real growth  The employment report is a prominent   example  Slower growth in the months ahead would weigh on income growth and consumption,   although the Greenbook’s outlook for income remains pretty healthy  Recent reports on housing   activity have also been quite disappointing  I think the key question is the effect on the housing   market and broader economic activity of the recent financial market turmoil  I won’t survey   what has happened; Presidents Yellen and Rosengren and Mr Dudley did an excellent job on   September 18, 2007 63 of 188    that  I will just comment that it seems, broadly speaking, as if we are on a traverse from a   configuration of intermediation that placed a fairly heavy reliance on fairly complicated and   structured products and rating agencies’ assessments of those  It is a traverse that is obviously   going more rapidly and is fraught with more peril than the path that took us to the configuration   we are coming from  So it is hard to know how much of an effect this turmoil will have on   housing  I suspect that a lot of the slowdown was already in train before the middle of August  I   base that thought on the fact that many mortgage rates rose earlier in the summer than August,   though the jumbo market is an obvious exception to that   Beyond housing, any projections of real effects from events in financial markets seem   like guesswork at this point  My sense is that, while we may see some marginal slowing in   business investment, the effects are likely to be small because I don’t think the marginal cost of   funding for most businesses has gone up much and we aren’t hearing reports of wholesale   tightening of lending standards in the corporate sector  I haven’t heard that from around the   country either  I expect consumer spending to grow more slowly than in recent years, but not too   dramatically so  I think that there is a fair amount of uncertainty about the size of the housing   wealth effect and that household net worth overall remains fairly high relative to income at this   point  As I noted earlier, the Greenbook’s projection for disposable income isn’t too bad, so that   would support consumption growth at least at a moderate pace going forward  Overall, then, I   come out a touch above the Greenbook, with real growth about 2 percent in the second half and   then gradually returning to trend  Of course, I have been expecting less of a slowdown than the   Greenbook for about a year now  It turns out that, although we have both been too optimistic,   the Greenbook has been closer to reality, so my confidence in my forecasting ability is waning   here   September 18, 2007 64 of 188    The inflation numbers have been encouraging  Core PCE inflation averaged under   14 percent for the past five months, and overall PCE inflation was under 2 percent for both June   and July  I am particularly pleased that TIPS inflation compensation has not increased even as   market participants have marked down their expected funds rate path in the midst of the recent   turmoil  That said, it still looks as though market participants expect inflation to settle near   2 percent rather than lower, as I would prefer  That concludes my remarks     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I think the actual signs of softness we’ve seen   are significant enough to warrant a 25 basis point cut in the fed funds rate  I expect that the   September 18, 2007 107 of 188    slowdown is going to be a little less severe than that in the Greenbook, and I’m concerned about the   likelihood of inflation’s remaining above my objective  Arguments for a larger cut appear to rest on   the possibility that financial turbulence since last month could cause significant further reductions in   real activity  I think that’s certainly a plausible possibility, and we can’t rule it out at this point  But   I don’t see it as extremely likely, and so my preference is for a cut of 25 basis points  I would   describe that preference as a mild one, and I could support a 50 basis point cut  I just have this   hunch that a 50 basis point cut might make it easier for us to resist a further cut two meetings down   the road   Whichever we choose, though, I’m very concerned about how we justify our actions, and I   share the concerns of Presidents Plosser and Pianalto about paragraph 2  That language motivates   the cut as a way of taking out insurance against the possible effects of financial market turmoil  I   worry that, if we tie our actions too closely to the expected effects of financial market conditions, as   much as we are concerned about this, we may make it harder to respond appropriately down the   road if the data indicate that we should take back some rate reductions  The sense of fragility in   financial markets could well persist, and as long as it does, so will the possibility that financial   market volatility could create a drag on spending and growth  The persistence of that fragility could   hold us back from reversing course if we find that real indicators and inflation data indicate that we   ought to  If we do reduce the target rate by 50 basis points, I think we should remove the tilt  I   liked the original version of alternative B that was circulated in the Bluebook  As drafted now, it   talks about uncertainty, and one could argue that’s a mean-preserving spread, but I think in the   context it’s going to be read as the equivalent of a downward tilt  Thank you     I’m sorry  I’m confused about that  This is an agenda item at this   meeting     We could just say that this is our sense at this meeting of what we’re   going to do now and just leave it at that     I don’t attach much substance to this  I don’t think very many people   even know or care or would view this as a change     Another question about governance  Maybe this isn’t the appropriate   time, but do you envision that approval by Reserve Bank boards of directors would be required   for this facility?  Is that part of the governance, or is that maybe a question for later?     All right  So they would have to act to make the rate they set   determined by this process     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ve been thinking a lot about this since I heard   about it last week  I want to start by complimenting the staff at New York and the Board who wrote   the summary memo  I think it does a very good and balanced job of articulating the costs and   benefits of this proposed facility  I was going to say that they undoubtedly did it in a compressed   timeframe, but then I heard you guys have been working on it for weeks  [Laughter]  But in any   event, my hat is off to them     I very much agree with the staff that weighing the costs and benefits to reach an assessment   about the desirability of this is inherently a difficult judgment  For me the critical question concerns   the normative implications of what we’re seeing in the marketplace for term funding and the   normative implications of this proposed intervention  Banks that are borrowing at term now are   paying up for insurance against the eventuality that their funding costs rise—for example, because   of a deterioration in their perceived creditworthiness  Banks that have viewed themselves as more   at risk are naturally willing to pay more for such insurance, and some reports suggest, as Mr   Dudley did this morning, the presence of an adverse-selection problem in the sense that borrowing   at term reveals oneself to be a borrower of high risk, and so only high-risk borrowers are willing to   September 18, 2007 143 of 188    pay more  Banks that are reluctant to lend at term are placing a high value on being able to use their   liquidity to accommodate assets that may come on their balance sheet soon  We had a lot of   discussion about this in the morning  Balance sheet capacity appears genuinely to be a scarce   valuable commodity these days  That’s consistent with the notion that raising bank capital is   expensive in the current environment  I think the adverse-selection story is worth considering   seriously in this context because it’s the interpretation of what we’re seeing that provides the best   hope for this being an intervention that improves market functioning in the microeconomic sense of   the term   But if adverse selection is what has impaired the functioning of the term market in this   normative sense, then there must be lower-risk banks that are unwilling to borrow at the same high   rates as high-risk banks but that are rationed because they’re unable to distinguish themselves from   high-risk banks  Now, if this is the case, the only way to improve market efficiency by lending is to   lend more than the current volume of term lending because otherwise we’re just going to lend it to   the current term-lending borrowers and none of these rationed-out, lower-risk banks are going to get   access to it  In other words, if we do lend through an auction facility to draw in disadvantaged   borrowers to try to reach them with credit, we can do so only by subsidizing the high-risk borrowers   as well  Now, I’ll mention that, from the discussion this morning, my understanding is that we have   very little idea what the volume of that term lending is  So I don’t see how we chose this number   and how we can be confident that it’s going to do this and reach through the high-risk borrowers to   pick up the low-risk borrowers   More broadly, I’m not sure I see how this facility could improve the normative functioning   in the market  We’re going to auction off only the same contracts that market participants are   capable of offering now, only we’re also going to subject ourselves to the additional constraints   September 18, 2007 144 of 188    imposed by our single-price auction format  So we’re not improving on any contract out there  The   only unique attribute we would appear to bring is our ability to subsidize lending terms  We could   conceivably improve market functioning if adverse selection is the right story here by doing   something that market participants are incapable of doing, and that would be compelling borrowing   by everybody or by a set of people to achieve a superior pooling allocation  But I don’t think we   want to do that  Or we could conceivably improve market functioning by acting on information   that’s superior to that of market participants—a knowledge of the creditworthiness of institutions,   for example  But it isn’t clear that this is a key part of the proposal either, because institutions have   to be rated 3 or above to get access and I think virtually all the currently affected institutions in these   sorts of high-risk and low-risk categories are in the 3 or above categories already  A related point   here is that, if we really think information constraints are at the heart of the problem, it might be   better to address this problem by addressing those constraints directly by using our supervisory   authority to encourage and facilitate greater transparency  So my sense is that this facility would   just subsidize borrowing banks without doing anything to mitigate underlying informational   asymmetries or any other type of market friction that I can think of  That means to me that this   proposal raises the usual moral hazard concerns  The staff memo was very clear and articulate   about those  I think there’s a danger with this facility of raising expectations that, in the future,   significant increases in interbank funding spreads are going to be ameliorated by central bank   intervention  If we raise that expectation, we’re going to undermine to some extent market   mechanisms for assessing the relative risk of institutions     I’m a little worried that if this does not produce a demonstrable effect on relevant market   conditions, it could erode confidence in us, and I feel so especially in light of our previous change in   discount window policy, which I think is widely viewed as having had little substantive effect so   September 18, 2007 145 of 188    far  I think that’s the view out there  I also worry that this could complicate the resolution of failing   institutions whose condition, as Vice Chairman Geithner suggested, deteriorates while they’re   borrowing from this auction facility  It would put us in a very awkward place  As Governor Kohn   said, this isn’t like a one-day emergency kind of thing—it takes some time  But some institutions in   questionable situations, some problem institutions, look for term funding and are willing to wait   four days to get it and know enough about their condition to line it up ahead of time  I worry about   this sounding like a cloak for the ECB, for us to give money to the ECB, and I worry about   President Rosengren’s issues as well, and I’d be more comfortable with the swap line than I am with   the domestic facility  If those foreign authorities want to extend credit and have the knowledge and   capacity to do so, and it’s on their dime and they’re bearing the credit risk and they want to borrow   the dollars from us, I see that as a reasonable step for a central bank to take  I also worry about   valuing collateral  I don’t think that our mechanisms for doing that are robust and strong, especially   in the current environment with at least standard haircuts   Now, I can appreciate the broader problem articulated by the staff and others that banks that   are constrained in the term funding market might tighten borrowing terms for consumers and   businesses and that might have real economic consequences  But if that’s the problem, I think it   would be better for us to just cut the funds rate rather than alter the relative funding costs of   different banks  This is essentially what we did today  We cut the funds rate to offset the   macroeconomic effects of higher credit spreads    Just a final set of comments  More broadly, I’ve been hoping for some time that banking   policy in our country was moving slowly but surely toward greater reliance on market discipline   and away from forbearance and subsidization  I’ve been hoping that we as a central bank would   gradually move away from things that are tainted with credit allocation  Times like these don’t   September 18, 2007 146 of 188    come around very often—you know, once a decade—and my sense is that the precedent we set here   is going to be remembered for a long time and it’s going to affect market behavior for a long time to   come as well  In my opinion, we ought to look at these episodes of market stress as an opportunity   to make some reputational progress on the time-consistency problem that is at the heart of moral   hazard  So for me the balance of considerations weighs heavily against this proposal, Mr   Chairman     Let the transcript say “groan”  [Laughter]      Thank you, Mr Chairman  Conditions in the Fifth District’s housing   sector continue to deteriorate  Sales have weakened further across most areas, and starts have   pulled back sharply  Inventories are rising in part, we hear, because some residential investors have   run short on patience and are listing their properties  The housing correction has been particularly   acute on the outer edges of the Washington, DC, metro area, and contacts from the area anticipate   that additional slowing in more-central markets is likely  In addition, reports of home-price   reductions are becoming more common around my District  Until recently the weakness looked to   be mostly contained in housing, but spillovers into other sectors are beginning to appear  For   October 30-31, 2007 42 of 162    example, our survey of the Fifth District manufacturing sector—which, by the way, is larger than   the Philadelphia and New York manufacturing sectors combined—[laughter]    —and we don’t appear in Part 2 of the Greenbook—posted notably weaker   readings for October  Drilling down into the details, much of the softness can be traced to housing     Conditioning on the Philadelphia index, we actually have marginal   predictive value for the national ISMs  But I continue  A modest housing spillover into business   investment plans seems to be unfolding as well  In the recent Board-commissioned survey of   capital investment plans, our District was among those in which more businesses plan to trim rather   than boost spending in the months ahead  Again, a more detailed look reveals that most firms   planning reductions have ties to housing  Reports on retail sales in the District remain soft, with   sales of automobiles and building materials notably weak  In addition, an executive from a major   transportation firm headquartered in the District told us that freight volumes, both rail and trucking,   are now at the lowest level since the 2001 recession  Although in a number of District markets   commercial real estate activity remains healthy, we are hearing scattered reports of commercial   construction projects being shelved  One director from DC said that commercial development   there “doesn’t have the pulse it had six weeks ago”  The turmoil in financial markets has not   appreciably constrained business lending in our District, however  Contacts generally describe   credit as readily available to creditworthy borrowers, but some say spreads have widened a bit  On   October 30-31, 2007 43 of 162    the price front, our monthly measures suggest some moderation in growth despite ongoing   complaints of higher input costs   At our last meeting, I was more optimistic than the Greenbook on the national economy  A   significant part of the difference was related to housing, where I saw greater probability of the drag   receding sooner  Longer term, I had a somewhat higher estimate of trend productivity growth,   which supported a somewhat stronger outlook for household consumption  The main shift in my   perspective since the last meeting is that I am now at least as pessimistic as the Greenbook about   prospects for housing bottoming out anytime soon  The 10 percent fall in housing starts in   September was certainly eye catching, and it indicates that the weak summer housing market tailed   off further toward the end  In our District, and this seems to be true elsewhere as well, the housing   downturn appears to have spread into many formerly unaffected markets  It is hard for me to   believe that any discernible stabilization is likely before the spring, when the seasonal pickup in   housing activity typically takes place  Even then a prolonged period of depressed activity seems   more likely than any noticeable bounceback  Other recent news suggests a bit more demand-side   fallout from the housing market than I had been expecting  Manufacturing production was sluggish   in August and September, and durable goods orders have shown only modest growth, especially   outside the aircraft industry  I mentioned a minute ago that our survey of the Fifth District   manufacturing sector—which, by the way, is larger than the Philadelphia and New York   manufacturing sector—[laughter] is showing a significant slowdown for October, particularly in   housing-related industries   Consumer spending has been a source of stability during this housing correction, and I   expect that to remain true over the forecast period  I think household spending will generally   expand in line with disposable income, but even though consumption advanced broadly in the third   October 30-31, 2007 44 of 162    quarter, it now seems we’re in for a bit of a slowdown this quarter  In that regard, I’m feeling   sympathy for what President Yellen said  So I’m less sanguine overall about the near-term outlook   for growth at this meeting, although that may just represent catching up on my part to the   Greenbook’s past level of gloominess   Having said all that, I do believe that the effects of this summer’s financial market   adjustments are likely to be limited; and out beyond the middle of the next year, I’m, again, more   optimistic than the Greenbook and for the usual reasons  I think that productivity growth and, thus,   real income growth will be somewhat higher than in the Greenbook forecast, and my outlook for the   personal saving rate is centered on its current value rather than a steady increase   Inflation appears to have ticked up a bit in September, at least according to the CPI  Still,   year-over-year core PCE inflation remained reasonably contained, and I’ve been struck by the   extent to which TIPS inflation compensation has held relatively steady in recent months, especially   given our easing move last month and the run-up in oil prices  While I would like to see inflation   come down further, I’m somewhat more comfortable about inflation than I was at the beginning of   the year  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  While the intermeeting period has seen a   mix of good news and bad news, a substantial amount of good news, the net effect on my near-  term outlook, as I said yesterday, has been negative, stemming largely from the continued slide   in housing  I have come around to the view that the slump in housing activity is going to be   deeper and more prolonged than I had thought  Many of you have read the intermeeting news as   positive on the outlook  My sense of my shift in views is that I have come closer to the median   view of my colleagues around the table about the second-half outlook  Taking all of this on   board, my assessment would be that, even given the 50 basis point reduction in the fed funds rate   at the September meeting, the current funds rate is probably somewhat more restrictive than is   desirable  So I would favor a 25 basis point reduction in the fed funds rate at this meeting, along   with a statement that contains no tilt, as in alternative A; and I endorse the passages in blue that   highlight the inflation risks   Let me first comment on market expectations  You know, they have to influence our   decision, but we need to be careful about that, obviously  I don’t think we should ever be afraid   of disappointing expectations or putting a new outlier in Brian’s chart  At the same time, those   October 30-31, 2007 89 of 162    expectations are a fact, and we have to take into account the likely effect of our action on   markets  As I think Governor Kohn said yesterday, they do contain within them some market   assessment, some information, that we can’t ignore or that we ignore at our peril  So that had   some influence on my decision as well  I’m thinking that there may be a need for an increase   sometime next year if the economy strengthens more than in the staff forecast  In addition, I   have not lost sight of the risk of inflation increasing  In particular, I’d take this opportunity to   endorse the public statement of Governor Kohn that an increase in inflation would not be in the   public interest  [Laughter]     Well, I’m hoping that inflation drifts down enough so that pessimists   about adjustment costs will swing around to endorsing a lower numerical objective for inflation    If we see signs of firming inflation or firming growth early next year, I would hope for a firmer   policy stance accompanied by appropriate communications  So my preference today is a   component of a preferred policy rule that has us responding with alacrity should things firm next   year  That concludes my statement, Mr Chairman     If the language in alternative A, section 4—the assessment of risk—were   simply about the likelihood of rate changes in either direction and didn’t say anything about growth   and inflation, would you view that as inconsistent with the assessments in our projection?     I asked this, Mr Chairman, because I’ve said this before on a couple of   occasions  The awkwardness about the assessment of risk statement is that it talks about rates but it   talks about them using a code about growth and inflation rather than talking about the rates   themselves     And the press release?     No comment       At the risk of introducing further moments of the probability distribution   into the discussion, have we been instructed as to whether our projection is a mean or a   maximum-likelihood estimate?     A maximum-likelihood estimate     I have strong reservations about this term auction facility  I oppose   proceeding at this time  I expressed many of my concerns in a letter that I circulated yesterday    The gist of it is that I questioned the need for this  I don’t think our willingness to keep the   overnight fed funds rate low and near the target, especially over year-end, is in question  If it   were in question, I think something more like what we did about the millennium change would   be appropriate  It’s not obvious that there’s an apparent inefficiency in markets  Banks are   paying a lot for insurance against term funding costs to them going up, and a lot of banks are   forgoing large spreads in order to marshal their resources  It seems as though they have   potentially very legitimate reasons to do so  Now LIBOR is 50 basis points over the discount   rate, so it’s not obvious that the rate we charge for discount window lending is a significant   factor and is germane here  The Europeans and the British markets have the same problem, and   they have very different ways of injecting reserves that suggest that maybe this isn’t something   that our discount window really needs to address  I pointed out in my letter that the Federal   Home Loan Banks are a very significant source of liquidity to banks, and some of the largest   banks are some of the largest borrowers at the Federal Home Loan Banks  They’ve increased   their lending tremendously  The lending is on virtually the same terms as the lending we   propose here  So it’s not obvious to me that banks have any inability to obtain term funding   from a government-subsidized entity  I don’t think this lending is going to alleviate balance   sheet pressure, and I think balance sheet pressure is at the heart of what’s going on here   More broadly, this sets an unfortunate precedent, I think  It is targeting credit to a narrow   segment of the market—it will be subsidized credit to the riskiest borrowers, who are obviously   going to be willing to pay the most for this  It harkens back to Operation Twist in the early   1960s, which I don’t think was a well-thought-out policy initiative  I understand that the urge to   December 6, 2007 28 of 51    act is strong at times like this, but I think we might need to recognize that the financial system is   coping with genuinely serious and difficult issues, and this might be the normal way a financial   system copes with very serious difficulties such as they are coping with now  So while we’d like   to see financial systems exhibit the behavior they exhibit in normal times, I’m not sure the   fundamentals are normal right now, and I’m not sure this isn’t the way financial markets   normally ought to be expected to behave at a time like this  So I oppose this facility at this time     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Economic conditions in the Fifth District   appear to be generally sound but with some notable areas of weakness  Our survey readings on   the services firms indicate continued moderate growth in November, and our index of   manufacturing activity gained a few points following a sharp decline in October, though it   remains in neutral territory  A number of our contacts reported that the weaker dollar is   providing a boost to manufacturing exports, and I have noticed a definite increase in the number   of coal trains rumbling by my office on their way from West Virginia to port  On the other hand,   our merchant contacts were much less optimistic about their sales prospects going into the   holiday season  Our retail sales survey indicator slid another 8 points, pulled down by   significant declines in big ticket sales and shopper traffic components  District housing markets   continue to weaken overall, with distinctly more-pessimistic tones in some markets, particularly   around the DC area, although there are a couple of areas that are still reporting decent activity   to the south   In commercial real estate, reports from the retail and industrial markets are generally   upbeat  One former director, whose firm owns a sizable portfolio of retail properties throughout   the East Coast, described the sector as in the best shape he has seen in his lifetime, and he is by   no means a young man  Industrial leasing appears to be in good shape, even tight in some   markets  In the office market, however, contacts in Maryland and the Carolinas report slower   office leasing activity in October and early November   The community bankers I have talked with say that portfolios are still quite clean but that   they are scrutinizing deals much more carefully in the current environment  They also complain   that large banks are raising deposit rates and competing more intensely for deposits  At large   banks, the cost of capital has increased, and they are responding accordingly by reevaluating the   December 11, 2007 40 of 138    profitability of various lines of business  This does not appear to have resulted in any wholesale   cutback in lending but more in a tightening of terms in selected market segments   I view the information from our District as fairly consistent with my economic outlook at   the national level  Housing investment continues to contract, and the overhang of unsold homes   and general tightening of credit terms suggest a quite prolonged period of relatively depressed   activity  Consumer spending clearly has slowed  For the months of September and October, real   consumption showed almost no growth  While early reports on the holiday shopping season are   notoriously slippery, it seems clear that shoppers are far from ebullient, perhaps with the   exception of these GPS toys  This seems consistent with the virtual absence of growth in real   disposable income over the past two months and the flattening-out of household net worth in the   third quarter  Job growth has shifted down to a more modest pace over this year, and revisions to   the payroll series, when we finally get them, seem likely to make the slowdown look bigger  So   it wouldn’t surprise me if consumer spending came in fairly tame next year  I am expecting a   slowdown in consumer spending growth, however, not a sharp pullback  Labor markets are still   fairly tight  Household net worth is still at fairly elevated levels  So while the increase in the   saving rate projected by the Greenbook for next year is plausible, I think consumer spending   could come out on the high side of that forecast   A key factor in the outlook and a key source of uncertainty is the continuing drama in   credit markets  Large banks are bringing impaired assets onto their balance sheets and are facing   a higher cost of capital and increased funding costs  It would seem reasonable to expect them to   respond by tightening terms of credit for households and business borrowers, implying a further   drag on spending  The magnitude of this sort of fallout is still quite uncertain  Reduced credit   flows appear so far to be less a reduction in credit supply than in demand  That is, they appear to   December 11, 2007 41 of 138    reflect a genuine deterioration in borrower creditworthiness in some segments  Residential real   estate fits this description as does some, though not all, commercial real estate  Beyond these   sectors, we have seen some evidence of yield spreads widening, but the cost of credit to   investment-grade nonfinancial firms is low and has been falling along with the risk-free rate, at   least until very recently  The flow of credit to such firms seems to have been holding up well, as   has the nonmortgage consumer credit flow  So at this point, it does not look as though an   indiscriminate, across-the-board credit crunch is taking place, although marginally higher credit   costs may exert some additional drag on spending growth  Overall, then, I do see a weaker   outlook for growth in the near term, and the timing of the return to trend is going to depend   somewhat on the bottoming-out of the housing cycle, which unfortunately appears to be getting   even more remote each time we meet   If we have a more protracted slowdown ahead of us, as seems likely now, we need to be   careful not to lose sight of inflation  Core PCE inflation has edged up over the past two months,   and it now appears likely to move above 2 percent for a time  Overall inflation, of course, has   been higher on average over the last year, and we have seen a slight upward trend in five-year-  forward inflation compensation since earlier in the year  In fact, the behavior of energy and food   prices over the past several years calls into question the standard presumption we make that   overall inflation is going to return to the core inflation trend in a reasonable period of time  That   points to the possibility that inflation may give us more trouble ahead     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I favor a ¼ point reduction in the funds rate   and the language of alternative B  Perhaps more than usual I think it is important to preserve   some flexibility now to respond to incoming information  I would not be surprised if we want to   reduce the funds rate another ¼ point at the end of January, but I don’t want to send a signal that   would encourage market participants to presume another cut then  So I guess I am in the   “grudgingly” camp to which President Yellen referred  Besides, I would welcome a permanent   move away from the balance-of-risk-assessment machinery  I do believe we face a good-sized   risk of things unraveling and substantially weaker growth in the near term  But my sense is that   the risk just isn’t large enough to make me want to support 50 basis points now  While I   wouldn’t be surprised with a January rate cut, I don’t think it should be a foregone conclusion  I   think we need to be more deliberate about such actions as we go forward  The magnitude of the   December 11, 2007 98 of 138    fallout from our mortgage problems could be substantially clearer in the first half of next year  If   the fallout turns out to be smaller and more manageable than we fear, the downside risks to   growth prospects could dissipate, even though we still would be working through a bulge of   mortgage resets and defaults     Some of us have given a warning that we may need to reverse course promptly and raise   rates should conditions improve  You know, it is always attractive to comfort ourselves as we   cut interest rates and to promise ourselves that we are willing to do so, but there always seems to   be a reluctance to start a sequence of funds rate increases after a series of rate cuts  The usual   thing is a fear of sort of an exaggerated reaction in the yield curve  These pressures are likely to   be especially acute if, when the time comes, we are still in the midst of significant distress   among subprime mortgage borrowers and the housing market  That seems likely  So I think we   need to be realistic about prospects for reversing field  To the extent that such pressures would   be hard to resist—and I think they would be—we should be very cautious, more cautious than   we otherwise would be, about lowering rates     Another reason to be cautious is that overall inflation is well above our targets  As David   Stockton pointed out, we have a record of forecasts for food and energy prices based on futures   market prices coming in too optimistic over the past several years  I think we need to be   concerned about that  I am concerned that market participants might have come to believe that   we have placed our concerns about inflation entirely on hold for the duration of the housing   market difficulties we face  Such a lexicographic reaction function is what led to the stop-go   policy pattern in the pre-1979 era  So I believe it would be a mistake to take our eyes entirely off   inflation right now  I am doubtful that a forceful restatement of our assessment of upside   inflation risk will be very effective in that regard  We have been doing that, and I think it is   December 11, 2007 99 of 138    falling on increasingly deaf ears  I think that we may come to believe that action is required to   back up that sentiment  If inflation drifts up or overall inflation doesn’t come down, I think we   need to be prepared to respond to real weakness less than we otherwise would have before    Thank you     For the loans made at the facility     Yes, Dave  So there is a lot written about nonlinearity and   macroeconomic dynamics  There are these regime-switching econometric models characterizing   real data  There is the 03 thing—I think it is 03— that people talk about regarding the   January 9, 2008 11 of 60    unemployment rate  It doesn’t go up by more than 03 without going up by a ton  You guys are   surely aware of those econometric properties or those methods of characterizing the data, and   while your econometric models may be strictly linear in some sense, what you give us is your   best judgment, right?  Am I to take your forecast as reflecting the probabilities of nonlinear   dynamics or not?  If it doesn’t, are nonlinear dynamics something you believe in, that you think   we should internally adjust your forecast with, or not?     Thank you, Mr Chairman  On the threshold question about acting   today, I don’t think we should act today  Intermeeting moves are relatively rare, they tend to be   headline-grabbing, and in retrospect they turn out to mark—and are usually intended to signal—  dramatic breaks from previous practice or reaction functions  From that point of view, I think in   January 9, 2008 19 of 60    the current context a move at this call would inevitably be interpreted as a reaction to the   increase in the unemployment rate, just given the timing of when the data have come out and   when the move is  I don’t think that would be a good idea   I share the sense that recession is a definite risk now and that the risk has gone up  I   think that is persuasive  We have gotten real growth numbers that are weaker now  I think the   outlook has to be weaker now than it was several weeks ago  But I am worried about inflation,   too, and I wonder what a more proactive approach means for our strategy for inflation  The staff   forecast that David presented marked down the real GDP forecast for ’08 by 03 and marked up   the overall inflation forecast by 04  The usual Taylor rule puts a bigger weight on the inflation   part than on the GDP part, and it doesn’t suggest a knee-jerk aggressive move down  I’m not   saying that’s not what is required now, but it suggests some questions  Would a more proactive   approach bring our expectations about our reaction closer to the market’s view?  Is that how you   interpret what you are advocating here?  Or is this to move us beyond what the market expects?   Related to this, are you asking for some shift in our strategy on inflation?  I mean, are you   asking that we be willing to tolerate an increase in inflation or an increase in inflation   expectations?  In the current circumstances, and what looks likely for the next several months, it   is hard to picture reversing course really rapidly  If things play out the way the staff forecasts, it   is just hard to imagine us turning around and raising rates 50 or 100 basis points if inflation rises   1 or 2 percentage points  It is heartening that inflation expectations numbers haven’t risen more   than they have, and I take comfort from that  But they are around 2½ percent on the CPI  It is   not clear that what they reflect isn’t that occasionally we get it down to 2 but most of the time it   bounces around above that  Without our having a clear sense of what our strategy is about where   we want to bring inflation, I just question what you are advocating means for inflation strategy   January 9, 2008 20 of 60      Yes  At the outset, in your discussion you said you were doing this in   part to seek our views before you made a speech and testified and wanted our views before you   engaged in overt signaling to the market  Someone else mentioned this, but I wanted to support   this as a practice  I don’t expect you to consult us before every public utterance you make but I   would just compliment you on this innovation in Federal Open Market Committee practice  So   thank you very much     Can you explain that third consequence of monoline downgrades?  I   didn’t quite get that   January 21, 2008 4 of 32      I can support a 75 basis point cut in the funds rate this month, Mr   Chairman  I had been thinking of something less  The data last week were clearly negative,   clearly disappointing, so I could support 75 at our meeting  Like President Poole, I have real   reservations about moving now rather than waiting until our meeting  I think that in the situation   this is inevitably going to be viewed as a reaction to the falloff in equity markets  Interpreters   are going to take into account that we could have moved last week, after the slew of real data—  Thursday afternoon, for example, after the housing report—or we could have waited until our   meeting ten days from now  I worry about the message that this tactical choice sends about our   strategy  I worry about what it says about what drives our reaction function and what we believe   January 21, 2008 15 of 32    that we can control or offset  I share President Poole’s concern that what we gain isn’t clear  I   can appreciate the possibility of financial market fragility, but I don’t see the level of the funds   rate as real closely tied to conditions of fragility  I don’t think a funds rate change is going to   save the monolines  I don’t think it is going to save financial institutions from the monolines    So I have reservations and would rather wait until our meeting  But I can support moving 75     Yes, I have a couple of questions  I want to start with the issue about   foreign banks, though  Why are we sensitive about talking about foreign banks—I mean, is this a   public stance, or is this in the Committee?  The information about the identity of the winning   bidders was sent to every Reserve Bank     Well, these are confidential proceedings—this is a consequential policy   matter   January 29–30, 2008 11 of 249      Just the winning bidders?     I thought that every Bank, all the discount officers, received the identity of   the winning bidders, and the other information about all the bids went only to those who requested   it     I wanted to ask a couple of questions about the term auction facility  First,   I’d like to hear more from you about what your understanding is of the effects the term auction   facility had on the funding market  The first question under that would be, To your knowledge,   were these completely sterilized or just partially sterilized?  Another question would be, For the   recipients, were these additional funds that they wouldn’t have otherwise borrowed, or did they   displace some other borrowing?  The next question would be, This crowded out something, and if it   didn’t change materially the total amount of reserves in the system, some lending ought to be shifted   from the recipients to someone else—so what do we know about other spillover effects in the   markets?  The focus of our attention probably for data reasons was the LIBOR market, but there   was also discussion in December of the term fed funds market  What do we know about the   January 29–30, 2008 12 of 249    behavior of that since then?  I’d be interested in your sense of whether bidders were riskier than   nonbidders and whether riskier institutions bid more than nonrisky institutions  We’ve done a bit of   empirical analysis—it’s preliminary—but I’d be interested in your folks’ sense of that  About the   foreign institutions, I’m interested in learning about what the advantage was of our lending dollar   balances via this mechanism to foreign banks versus the alternative of having them borrow dollar   balances from their central bank, perhaps funded by a swap or out of the foreign central bank’s own   dollar balances  Finally—and this is sort of the most important question—how should we evaluate   whether this has been a success or not?  To what sort of objective evidence should we look to decide   whether we achieved our objectives?  Related to that, can a case be made for ending this facility   soon in light of the fact that the LIBOR–OIS spread is now half of what it was in September, when   we decided that it had come down enough to shelve the plan?     If I could just follow up     Well, on the last point, that’s a matter of the ECB’s willingness to lend to   those institutions  You’re saying that they would be willing to lend themselves to those institutions   only if we did this  It’s not about the economics of their borrowing from their central bank versus   borrowing from us—nothing about the market functioning     Do market participants view foreign banking organizations as broadly   riskier than comparable-sized institutions based in the United States?     Absolutely     Thanks  Going back to the LIBOR–OIS spread—that was what motivated   this  It has fallen a lot  The bid-to-cover ratio is falling  If we try to lend $30 billion three more   times, we could get to a point at which we satiate the market in term funds     Yes, but the bid-to-cover ratio keeps falling     It’s decreasing     Mr Chairman     Foreign banks were $19 billion out of $20 billion at the first auction;   $18 billion out of $20 billion at the second auction; and a declining fraction thereafter, President   Fisher     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Fifth District economy has shown   additional signs of softness in recent weeks  According to our surveys, manufacturing activity   drifted lower in the past few months, although we also heard reports of stronger overseas demand   for US goods  Revenue growth in the District’s services firms also weakened in January, and   our index for that sector dipped into negative territory for only the second time in the past four   years  Our retail index, which in December had blipped up to neutral after three negative   months, dived again in January  Our retail respondents say that the holiday sale season finished   up weaker than expected and that big ticket categories continue to slump, especially furniture   and appliances  Business spending seems to have softened as well in recent weeks, as an   January 29–30, 2008 56 of 249    increasing number of firms reported that they were delaying capital spending projects such as IT   upgrades   At our December meeting, I reported on a former director who headed a firm that owned   a large portfolio of retail properties and said that he described the sector as in the best shape he   had ever seen in his life  Well, he is singing a different tune  Although his portfolio is in good   shape so far, he is hearing a lot about cancelled projects as a result of financial constraints from   lenders or equity interests, and he says that the environment that he is operating in is completely   different from what it was when he talked to me sixty days ago  We are hearing very similar   comments from a wide range of contacts in commercial real estate and community bankers    Residential real estate markets in the District remain generally weak  Home sales and   construction remain dormant in many markets  Several Realtors reported seeing more   prospective buyers, but they seem interested only in kicking the tires, in part because of   difficulties in selling their current homes   Turning to prices, concerns about rising input costs were more widespread among our   contacts in recent weeks  Our survey measure of manufacturing raw material prices was up   sharply in January at 43 percent, the second highest reading in the fourteen-year history of the   survey  The prices-paid measure in manufacturing was a touch lower but still in an elevated   range  Expected price trends in manufacturing were off sharply, however, perhaps reflecting the   softening in demand that many respondents said they expected  In the service sector, both   current and future price trends picked up outside of retail  Labor market conditions in the Fifth   District have deteriorated in the last month  In a noticeable shift from previous surveys,   numerous contacts told us they had begun to trim payrolls  The job cuts were concentrated in   machinery and building material manufacturers, financial services firms, and general contractors    January 29–30, 2008 57 of 249    In some regions, however—Northern Virginia, for example—some labor markets remain tight,   and we continue to hear of difficulty finding highly skilled workers   I spent a bit more time than usual on our regional picture because right now I am placing   a bit more weight than usual on our District reports and what I read in the Beige Book  One can   be skeptical about the incremental value of anecdotal reports in typical times, but at times like   these, I believe they can and do provide a more timely read on what is going on  These regional   reports have shaded my outlook to the downside relative to the picture painted by the national   data, which is itself a somewhat discouraging picture  Home construction has continued to   decline, and the fall in permits last month suggests that further declines are in store  Consumer   spending appears to have slowed somewhat at the end of last year and seems to be carrying less   momentum into this quarter, as the Greenbook likes to put it  The December employment report   certainly was weak and has added considerably to fears of a recession  The Greenbook forecast   just skirts the border of an outright recession  My own projection is fairly similar but a bit   weaker in the first half and with the weakness stretching out a bit longer this year  I am inclined   to see the bottom in housing as occurring later than in the Greenbook, which has housing starts   flattening out relatively soon, and I am a bit less hopeful about business investment, particularly   structures  I agree with the Greenbook that the main effect of a stimulus package will be to shift   consumption growth from ’09 to late ’08 but that the effects are uncertain  I think the risks are   on the side of a smaller boost to spending, though  But there is a chance that many rule-of-  thumb consumers will find that their rule is telling them to pay down debt  In sum, I expect very   weak growth in the first half of this year with only gradual recovery to trend  While I think weak   growth is the most likely scenario, similar to President Yellen, I do think that a recession is a   January 29–30, 2008 58 of 249    quite distinct possibility this year  If that happens, I think it will be due to a more sizable   pullback in nonresidential construction than we are expecting right now   Turning to inflation, it is hard to put a good face on the recent numbers  The Greenbook   describes the recent upside surprise as transitory and expects inflation to diminish this year    Indeed, we have been getting some relief on retail gasoline prices in recent weeks  But I don’t   think our problems with inflation are transitory, and I don’t want to lose sight of them in the   midst of the current weakness  If you look back over the past four years, the overall PCE price   index has averaged 2¾ percent  On a 12-month basis, the index has been below 2 percent only   four months in that span  Now, one could interpret this as a regime of 2 percent inflation with a   series of misses that happen to be virtually all on the plus side  Alternatively, you could view   this as a regime in which inflation fluctuates around a mean of 2¾ percent  Market measures of   inflation expectations seem more consistent with the former right now  But the longer that   inflation averages well above 2 percent, the more risk we run of seeing expectations rising to   match actual inflation rather than the other way around  Another way to see this is that the   fragility we need to focus on now is our credibility  I mention all of this because it is why, in my   economic projections this round, I wrote down a relatively sluggish recovery after the first half   of this year  I am skeptical that we have seen nothing but positive inflation misses around a 2   percent trend for four years because of chance alone, and I am not optimistic about inflation   coming down in a sustained way on its own  As a result, I believe that, in order to keep   expectations from drifting up and to bring inflation down, we will need to raise rates later this   year, even if that means a longer and slower recovery  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Brian, I want to compliment you and the   staff for presenting these risk-management strategies  I think it is really useful for the   January 29–30, 2008 108 of 249    Committee to see and think about these in terms of strategies rather than sort of one-off policy   choices, and thinking through a sequence of actions like this is very, very helpful  Governor   Mishkin asked about expectations and noted that they were backward-looking, and I wanted to   ask about that  You guys have described to us before that there are firms and wage setters and   then there are financial markets  Is there a forward-looking part in the financial markets, or is   that backward-looking as well?     As you know, in applied macroeconomics, there is a range of   approaches to handling expectations, and the rest of the range is filled out with more forward-  looking approaches  In this instance—in the instance of a recession—you hear and read a lot   about recession  In fact, there was a story in the paper today about businesses preparing for a   recession  So you get the sense that market participants might be understanding that this is a   special episode of economic dynamics called a recession and look back to past recessions and   think of it in sort of a forward-looking way  That to me, more than in the usual circumstances,   heightens the value of thinking through or at least exploring the implications of a forward-  looking approach to expectations  I say that in particular thinking about these strategies because   we get only a few trials on recessions  They are pretty rare, and so the inferences a set of market   participants are going to make about recessions is going to be influenced by their past recessions    This is going to be the last chance to influence their perceptions about how we behave in the next   recession  So I am really interested in thinking through our strategy for this recession from the   point of view of, well, what if from now on market participants expect us to adopt the strategy   that we do adopt in this  That is why I would like to see some analysis that says, “Well, all right,   if this is the strategy and it is understood by agents that this is our strategy, how does the   January 29–30, 2008 109 of 249    economy behave?”  So we adopt a strategy, and it is one that we think we can sustain and one   that we would like to choose again in the future if it is understood   Related to that, Governor Mishkin mentioned inflation and inflation expectations, and I   was a little confused about the discussion yesterday because I always thought of us as wanting to   minimize the distortion in the rate of return on money, and that suggests minimizing the raw-  return gap between nominal and real securities  So I am not quite sure that we don’t care nearly   as much about the variance in inflation or the risk premiums due to inflation as we do about   expected inflation  Is that your understanding when you guys think through optimal monetary   policy?  I know you do scenarios like that  I mean, how do the fluctuations and the variance in   inflation fit in?     One thought I had in that discussion about expected inflation, you noted   that the one-to-five-year rise in inflation hadn’t been affected much, but the five-to-ten-year rise   had  If it is well understood by agents when going through something like a recession, which   comes around only every once in a while, maybe it is ratifying current inflation and not bringing   it down  You might expect that the inference would change about how inflation behaves in the   next recession, which would come five to ten years from now  Wouldn’t it?   January 29–30, 2008 110 of 249      Okay  So in the case where we are doing the risk-management   approach, do they understand that we are more likely to reverse course, or do they just mark   down their whole expected path for policy?     We are trying to model the real world      Like what?     Oh, interesting     If I could just continue the dialogue with Governor Kohn  It has been   observed by some that the past two recessions differ from previous post-war recessions in some   key dimensions, and some have drawn the conclusion that it is the changing nature of the   business cycle after the Great Moderation  Both have been characterized as shallow and longer   lasting  I take the point that one’s inferences about a third instance are going to be very tenuous,   naturally  But it is also natural to look back to those episodes and see what we can draw out of   January 29–30, 2008 116 of 249    them  You mentioned headwinds in 1990, and we had some special stuff that kept us from   raising rates with nimbleness in 2003 and 2004  To what extent do you think that is likely   coming out of this episode, that the types of things that kept us from raising rates in the 1990s   and in both of these episodes are likely to recur?     Well, I asked Governor Kohn, but if he gets to respond     For follow-up before President Geithner responds, to the extent that we   place greater likelihood on that, should these simulations suggest that we should take that into   account in how rapidly we cut now?       Thank you, Mr Chairman  Our Vice Chairman urges humility  I strongly   support that  I agree with President Evans that it’s not obvious that the greater one’s humility, the   greater one should favor ease  I think we should be humble about the path of inflation going   forward, whether it’s likely to fall on its own  I think we should be humble about our understanding   of the output gap  I think we should be humble about whether that’s even a sensible way to think   about how real and monetary phenomena interact  The Phillips curve itself embodies a relationship    It is uncertain, but it embodies expectations of our future behavior  I think we should be humble   about what those expectations are in the present circumstance  Times in the past when we’ve gotten   in trouble on inflation have often been when we were oversolicitous about weak economic growth,   and I think we should be humble about whether we’ve completely gotten past those inflation   dynamics or not  I think we should be humble about the willingness of our future selves to reverse   course, and a lot has been said about that  For some it seems to counsel greater ease now, but I   think the opposite argument can be made that the extent to which we think we may be hindered or   feel impeded in raising rates, even if we think it’s warranted in the future, should cause us to be   more cautious about lowering rates now  It always seems in recoveries that there’s always   January 29–30, 2008 135 of 249    something that looks fragile, that looks likely to threaten economic growth  You know, one month   it will be the commercial paper market and CDO writedowns, and this month it’s monolines  There   will be headwinds  I predict we’ll be talking about headwinds a fair amount in the next couple of   years  But if those are genuinely going to impede us, we need to be realistic about that, and I think   we need to take it on board now  I agree with President Poole  We need to be humble about our   ability to prevent a recession  I think we should also be humble about the extent to which what we   see in terms of both growth and financial markets is presumptively inefficient and needs remedial   action on our part  You spoke several meetings ago, I think a year or two ago, Mr Chairman, about   our need to retain a concern about inflation but not be seen as inflation nutters  I think we need to   care about financial fragility but not be fragility nutters     If left to my own devices, I could have chosen a 25 basis point cut today  I recognize that   would surprise markets, but judging from the policy paths that you all have submitted for your   projections, a whole lot of us think that we’re going to have to surprise markets some time in the   year ahead  Having said that, I can support a 50 basis point cut now  But more broadly I think   inflation is just going to have to keep influencing our policy path  I don’t think that episodes of   weakness in real growth mean that we put part of our mandate aside  I think it has to temper the   extent to which we lower rates and temper our behavior on the other side as well  As for semantic   tactics, I support President Plosser’s suggestion, seconded by President Yellen, and I support   President Poole’s suggestion as well     You characterized underwriting as weak, and I guess the document   circulated had some heavy criticism for the credit rating agencies  I want to understand more what   the nature of that assessment involves  Basically is it ex post regret, or do we have objective   evidence about the quality of the decisionmaking ex ante?  That evidence, of course, would involve   assessments of the probability they should have placed on things we saw     Okay     I am still confused  How much of these weaknesses would have been   identified by an impartial observer in January 2006, say, without knowledge of what has   happened since then?     Yes     My memory of Finance 101 is that you don’t buy long-term, risky assets   funded by short debt without sufficient compensation  So the neglected aspect of the whole episode   we went through was how people would have been compensated in other circumstances, but that’s a   different discussion  I think these recommendations make sense, and confirmation of that is that the   market is moving in that direction anyway  I don’t know how many of these recommendations   were put forward by those market participants you cited who two years ago were not trusting these   ratings—I think that’s a key question  But the broader thing here is that the world of finance now is   a world of competing econometric analysis, and we’re never going to rate the model risk if you ask   the question, What would you expect the behavior of a market like that to display?  You’d expect   occasional big misses from erring assumptions  You’d expect those misses to be corrected by   people reflecting and improving practices going forward  A sort of Schumpeterian process in this is   going to generate model risk and big model misses, and so I think it’s being careful to keep track of   whether the insights we’ve gleaned are hindsight or should have been known ahead of time     Thank you, Mr Chairman  As all of you know, throughout this episode   I have opposed measures using our balance sheet to attempt to arrest credit market   developments, and so it will come as no surprise that I oppose, respectfully, this measure as   well—and for similar reasons  These measures are all aimed, one way or another, at altering the   March 10, 2008 20 of 39    relative prices of some financial claims  I think the burden of proof ought to be on those who are   advocating such measures to provide evidence of some sort of market failure  I have yet to see a   plausible case for market failure that would warrant such intervention by a central bank here  In   this case, I don’t think the concerns raised by the New York staff memo really come close, and it   strikes me that they could equally well rationalize buying tech stocks in late 2000  More   broadly, our efforts to ameliorate credit market conditions appear to be motivated by the notion   that exogenous malfunctions internal to credit markets endanger the real economy  But it seems   much more plausible to me now that the credit market phenomena we have been seeing over the   past year are driven entirely by the evolution of expectations regarding the fundamental real   return on mortgages and other primitives   I have a deep concern that is particular to this proposal  This proposal crosses a bright   line that we drew for ourselves in the 1970s in order to limit our involvement in housing finance    Legislators at that time were proposing various schemes that would involve using our balance   sheet to fund various housing initiatives of one sort or another  In the current climate, legislators   seem to be casting about for funds to bail out mortgage borrowers  Given the extent to which we   have been singled out far more than any other federal regulators as scapegoats for this episode, it   would be natural for them to contemplate raiding our portfolio—not to mention, in fact, that our   portfolio is larger than other regulators’ portfolios   Whatever one feels about the advisability of fiscal policy of that sort, I think the legal   memo did a creative job of interpreting the Federal Reserve Act as allowing direct ownership of   this form  But I think we should view opening up this sort of expansive interpretation of the act   as a relatively irreversible step because it will be next to impossible to put this interpretation   back in the bottle and argue that the act prevents us from holding particular mortgage-backed   March 10, 2008 21 of 39    securities outright  Setting this precedent is going to measurably weaken our ability to resist   congressional proposals to use us and our balance sheet for off-budget fiscal policy  So, again,   Mr Chairman, I respectfully oppose this term securities lending facility     Scott, I’d like you to elaborate a bit on this last part  This was a little   confusing  This lending apparently is by the New York Bank  How does it relate to the System   Open Market Account?  Is it by the New York Bank out of the System Open Market Account?     So while these securities we take in are on our books, they’re on the   System Open Market Account’s books     Okay  Thanks     I hope your wife is doing well     First, just about breakevens  Breakevens came down a lot yesterday, but   my understanding is the five-year, five-year forwards did not come down nearly as much  I think   the figures I have are 3 basis points on the Board’s measure and just 11 on New York’s measure  Is   that right?   March 18, 2008 8 of 127      I am concerned about this late-day softening problem with the Primary   Dealer Credit Facility  Everything else we have done has been fairly straightforward to sterilize, but   because with this the quantity is activated late in the day, the funds are just going to flow into the   market  You know, you’re in the position of predicting something with a huge variance, the take-up   on that  Now, this could unravel  If late-day softness becomes the norm, because of the arbitrage   that’s available to banks within the maintenance period for holding reserves, this could erode our   ability to hold the target  Now, you people have been really creative about lending money, so I was   wondering if maybe you could turn your creative talents toward this problem  The thing that comes   to mind is some mechanism for sucking up funds at the end of the day on an automated basis  The   natural thing would be for us to do sort of the opposite of repos late in the day for return the next   morning  Have you given that some thought?  Are you working on that?     Yes, I just want to emphasize that what we have done so far has had this   separability about it, and except for the brief period in late August last year, it has not threatened our   ability to manage the federal funds rate in a way we thought appropriate for the whole economy  If   we don’t cure this problem soon, it will become visible; it will become well known; it will get   priced in, and to some extent it will overtake this Committee’s deliberations in the sense that it   rather than our target rate will run the fed funds rate  I think that would be a fairly dangerous   outcome, and it just strikes me that this is incredibly urgent     Thank you, Mr Chairman  We’ve seen two striking macroeconomic   developments since our last meeting  We now have compelling evidence that a recession is in train    We now have compelling evidence of erosion in our inflation credibility  Information from our   District corroborates a recession call  Various survey indicators and reports from contacts point to   March 18, 2008 41 of 127    weakness in manufacturing, commercial real estate, and consumer spending  No signs have yet   emerged of a bottom in housing  The national reports on employment and retail sales for February   have sealed the case for recession  It now appears that payroll employment peaked at the end of ’07   along with real income and household spending, and to make matters worse, anecdotal reports   suggest that the January fall in nonresidential construction is only the beginning of a sustained   deterioration  I’m now expecting a period of declining employment, declining nonresidential   construction, and flat-to-sluggish consumption  Equipment and software spending may decline as   well  Past contractions suggest a trough later this year  More severe scenarios seem unlikely to me,   however  The Great Depression, for example, involved us keeping real rates well above 5 percent   for several years as activity slowed and the price level declined 30 percent   It will take some time before the ultimate size of mortgage foreclosure losses is known well   enough to substantially reduce the uncertainty attached to mortgage-backed security returns, and it   is not clear that interest rate changes will affect that timetable much  In the meantime, I would   expect to see repeated bouts of financial turmoil  When particular markets or entities come under   stress, I would also expect to see even wider speculation about and calls for new Fed lending  It’s   even possible that fluctuations in the perceived prospects for such intervention add to financial   market volatility, much the way conjectures about IMF programs seemed to add to market volatility   in the 1990s   After a string of adverse inflation reports, the CPI came in virtually flat for February  While   this certainly helps for many reasons, including those Mr Stockton cited, I’m not inclined to make   much of one month’s report  The overall CPI is still up over 4 percent year over year, and given the   recent behavior of oil and gasoline prices, inflation is likely to be high again in the March report  In   any event, I think there is no comforting way to rationalize the substantial rise in the five-year, five-  March 18, 2008 42 of 127    year-ahead inflation compensation we’ve seen since the beginning of the year  This measure of   inflation was previously ratcheted upward by similar amounts in early 1999, early 2001, mid-2003,   and early 2004  In each of these episodes, our actions and statements communicated an increase in   our concern about growth prospects, and market participants seem to have inferred a corresponding   reduction in our commitment to price stability  The net result over that period is that five-year, five-  year-ahead inflation compensation has drifted up significantly over the past ten years, from below   2 percent to now above 3 percent  This expectational drift is likely to overwhelm, in my view, any   transitory effect of increasing slack   I believe inflation expectations no longer qualify as well anchored  Moreover, they no   longer seem consistent with the credibility of even a 2 percent inflation objective  I believe that this   substantial erosion in our credibility is occurring because of our aggressive policy moves and the   perception that the hierarchy of our macroeconomic priorities has changed  It wouldn’t surprise me   if our recent credit market interventions are bleeding over into a skepticism about our general   approach to time-consistency problems  It cannot help to allow our credibility to drift around  I do   not think we want a regime in which long-run inflation expectations ratchet up whenever growth   slows significantly  Ultimately we will be forced to act to restore credibility  This just adds   needless volatility to financial markets and the economy   I believe we need to adopt a strategy of easing much less aggressively going forward than   we have to date and than markets expect  President Stern cited the 1990-91 recession and the fact   that both the federal funds rate and inflation came down during that recession  But surely the pace   of easing then had something to do with the fact that inflation came down  Unless we’re willing to   let inflation expectations continue to drift, we have to disappoint markets sometimes  Thank you,   Mr Chairman   March 18, 2008 43 of 127      Thank you, Mr Chairman  We’ve spoken a lot about inflation   expectations here today  Let me at the outset emphasize that what I’m referring to in the measures   we have are the expectations of the public  They’re not necessarily my expectations or Governor   Mishkin’s, Vice Chairman Geithner’s, or the Committee’s, and they don’t necessarily correspond to   the reality of the distribution of inflation realized five years, five years hence, if each of us had our   druthers or if the Committee as a whole lasted that long together and conducted policy the way it   best saw fit  I trust that no member would deliberately encourage continued discrepancy between   what they viewed as objective reality and the public’s expectations  But that said, that discrepancy   is not the same as less commitment on our part  It’s certainly the same as less credibility about   commitment on our part  I think and trust that most members when speaking in public about   inflation expectations would endeavor to reduce that discrepancy  Presumably, each of us has a   threshold for acceptable inflation expectations that, if it were crossed, would induce us to be willing   to disappoint market expectations  Personally, my threshold has been crossed, so I think that, if we   ease, we should ease much less aggressively than markets expect     More broadly, I think of this in terms of the following question  What strategy would we   want people to believe we will follow in future episodes like this?  As I pointed out in my letter to   the Committee last week, thinking in terms of our strategy is different from a meeting-by-meeting   approach that takes the public’s current expectations, wherever they are, as given  We should ask, I   believe, what expectations we would have wanted them to have had about our behavior during   March 18, 2008 90 of 127    episodes like this  Do we want people to believe that we will follow a policy that allows inflation   and inflation expectations to ratchet up permanently whenever growth slows?  I don’t think so, but   that seems to be what the market believes we’re doing  Conceivably, we could try to use our   statements and minutes to communicate our intention to bring inflation down, but at this point, my   sense is that our statements about inflation appear to be taken as much less revealing than our   actions   This is a uniquely challenging episode in the history of our economy and our institution  I   have found it useful to remind myself from time to time about the limits of central banking  We   cannot prevent this recession, and it’s doubtful to me that we could have or should have even if we   had had perfect foresight  We are unlikely, as I said, to have much effect on the ultimate magnitude   of mortgage losses at this point, and I don’t think we can do much to accelerate the resolution of   uncertainty about those losses  We cannot resolve uncertainty about the fundamentals underlying   the creditworthiness of financial market counterparties, and we cannot enhance the liquidity of any   financial instrument without altering its relative price  What can we do?  We can control inflation,   and we can limit the extent to which uncertainty about our inflation intentions adds to market   volatility  To do this, I like the idea of being clear about our strategy  I take that as consistent with   what President Plosser was advocating, that we concern ourselves with what level we see as   appropriate now and see as likely to be appropriate later this year  Thank you, Mr Chairman     About consumer-loan-backed securities, spreads have widened and   delinquencies and defaults have increased, but not out of line with past experience  You seem to   have inferred that spreads have widened more than is warranted by the return on those securities    I would be interested in what computational exercises or what other analytics you and your staff   have undertaken to document the hypothesis that these spreads are not warranted by the   fundamentals     I think the political concern you raised and described is a very, very   serious one for this institution  Even if we thought of this ourselves before Senator Dodd and   others wrote to us—and apparently it is true that we did—we are never going to be able to   convince a broad array of observers that this was not a direct response to a senatorial request    Given that, I think the perception that we included this and maybe added some other securities as   a fig leaf sets just a disastrous precedent  It would be the use of our balance sheet to circumvent   the checks and balances of the constitutional process for legislating about fiscal matters  I think   that the integrity of our independence as an institution relies, to a substantial degree, on our lack   of entanglement or our distance from the political fray   I would also question the value of this on the substance  What we are doing with the   TSLF, as Bill’s chart showed, looks as though it has had a big effect on the GC repo rate  It is   hard to see how some additional amount of Treasuries in the market, given the size of the   Treasury market, is going to have a gigantic effect  It is also hard to see that there is much strain   or dislocation caused by the most recent observation in his graph on the gap between the funds   rate and the GC repo rate—which is actually, what, like 10 or 20 basis points or about what it has   historically been  So I would question whether we really need this on the substance as well   On the other measures, the TAF is dominated by European institutions  Term funding   spreads seem dominated by the term funding demands of European institutions  I don’t see why   we don’t try to shift to European institutions the public policy responsibility for managing those   situations  We already have an apparently well-functioning mechanism for supplying dollar   balances to foreign official institutions to allow them to do that  I don’t see why we don’t limit   our expansion of funding in that direction—to the swap lines—rather than expanding the TAF    Thank you   April 29–30, 2008 13 of 266      Yes  Mr Chairman, you motivated the expansion of the term securities   lending facility by the effect it would have by increasing the amount of Treasuries in the market    Vice Chairman Geithner, you appealed to the effect it would have on the asset-backed securities   that would be offered on the market  We didn’t discuss the asset-backed securities market,   except that I had this exchange with our Manager  I am not aware of any evidence that there is   something wrong with the fundamentals of those markets  Now, admittedly, it is not clear that   many of our arguments for some of these facilities have been based on some careful diagnosis of   April 29–30, 2008 16 of 266    fundamentals  If this is about those asset-backed securities markets, that is another thing   entirely  I was a little confused about that and wondered about the rationale     If the payoff for those securities is unexpectedly low, it is likely to   happen in a circumstance in which the economy is doing awfully poorly  Risk premiums are   about variances and risk aversion, but they are also about correlation with aggregate states    Arguably, that would rationalize a widening of the risk premiums attached to a wide range of   securities, mortgage-backed included  We have yet to see any evidence from our staff refuting   that interpretation of the widening spreads we have seen  Mr Chairman, with all due respect,   what you describe is a lack of demand  I am not sure how that squares with viewing the market   as somehow malfunctioning   April 29–30, 2008 17 of 266      Thank you, Mr Chairman  Fifth District economic conditions softened   further in recent weeks  Following a pop-up in March, our manufacturing contacts said that factory   activity lost momentum in April  Services firms that we surveyed again reported tepid growth in   their revenues, and retail sales continued to be very weak  In real estate, the story is mixed  Our   housing markets continue to post generally slow sales, but recent anecdotes suggest some scattered   firming  Realtors and others indicate that Northern Virginia and Maryland have seen a spring   bounce in sales in recent weeks  One Realtor said that a factor supporting sales is that sellers now   seem more willing to come off 2006 prices  The Charlotte market has also seen a spring bounce    Coastal areas in the Carolinas, hard hit until recently, are said to be more active lately  Of course, it   is hard to know what these anecdotes mean on a seasonally adjusted basis, and contacts caution that   it is too soon to call the bottom  In contrast, home sales are weakening in many other areas of the   Carolinas, where markets had posted sales and price gains well after the national market had turned   down  Residential construction in nearly all areas continues to weaken  On the commercial real   estate front, conditions have softened somewhat, although in DC proper, commercial rents are firm   and vacancies are low  Commercial construction activity is broadly softening   My reading of the national report since the last FOMC meeting is that the real outlook has   not changed much  In particular, we still appear to be in a recession  Payroll employment has   continued to decline, falling an average of 77,000 per month in the first quarter  Unemployment is   rising, although it is still relatively low  Nonresidential construction is weakening, and the falloff in   April 29–30, 2008 66 of 266    architectural billings is particularly discouraging  Other business investment has been soft as well    Consumer spending, like business spending, appears to have slowed to a crawl  The length and   depth of the recession are likely to depend on stabilization in the housing market  The sharp decline   in home construction has continued unabated, and outside of the one-month tick-up in the brand   new, as yet untested, monthly home-price index from OFHEO, there’s no sign of any bottoming in   any of the national data on housing  Having said that, I noted earlier some scattered reports of a   seasonable pickup in home sales  So there’s a chance, perhaps only a slim one, that we’ll see some   stability in markets this summer   Concerns are often voiced about the possibility of broad spillovers from financial market   conditions in the form of sharply tightening credit conditions for households and businesses  But if   we look past the drama in wholesale markets and the end-user credit markets that gave rise to it (in   housing and buyout financing), evidence of such spillover is hard to come by, at least so far  It is   true that delinquencies have risen across a broad class of credits—commercial real estate, C&I   loans, and auto and credit card portfolios, for example—and lenders are reporting tightening terms   across many of these borrower classes  But that is generally what happens in recessions  Spreads   widen and credit flows fall because many consumers and firms become genuinely riskier  So far,   delinquency rates and credit spreads faced by consumers and firms appear to be well within the   bounds of what happened in past credit cycles   More broadly, recent experiences have revealed important new information about the   efficacy of some prominent financial market mechanisms—information that is, in turn, affecting the   current behavior of financial market participants  Auction-rate securities, for example, seem to have   worked well for decades because investors attached relatively low probability to contractual clauses   that reset their rates and prevented their exit  Reaching those clauses has naturally caused investors   April 29–30, 2008 67 of 266    to update their estimates of the probability of reaching those clauses, and the result has been much   less—in fact, virtually nil—demand for those securities  Similarly, recent experience has brought   dramatic revelations about the informativeness or lack thereof of credit agencies’ ratings of asset-  backed securities  Its revelations would seem to warrant fairly dramatic shifts in investor portfolios,   just as a matter of Bayesian updating  These changing expectations in light of recent information   revelation are just as much a change in fundamentals as the invention of the light bulb   Spreads in interbank markets certainly are elevated, of course, but one fundamental factor   here is the continuing uncertainty about the severity of looming losses on mortgage-backed   securities  Another fundamental factor is the demand for term funding by European banks about   which uncertainty remains regarding mortgage-related losses that may be imminent  Those sources   of uncertainty will persist as long as uncertainty about the bottom of the housing cycle persists   At our March meeting I had strong concerns about inflation, particularly the increase in five-  year, five-year-ahead inflation compensation and the rising trend in overall inflation  Since then we   received more-moderate inflation numbers for February, and five-year, five-year-ahead inflation   compensation has backed off as well  Although I still believe that these TIPS spreads are too high   to be consistent with stable, long-run inflation below 2 percent, it’s heartening to see them come   down following our March meeting  It seems reasonable to infer that the improvement in inflation   expectations occurred because of the unanticipated emphasis on inflation risks in our statement and   the 25 basis point surprise on the funds rate  That response, however, confirms for me the   hypothesis that the previous erosion in expectations was caused largely by the aggressiveness of our   January policy actions  I believe that substantial risks for inflation and our credibility remain  The   Michigan survey number for 12-month-ahead inflation expectations popped up to 48 percent, a   relatively large number  The March CPI was again too high, and further increases in food and   April 29–30, 2008 68 of 266    energy prices in recent weeks will continue to press headline inflation upward  Persistently high   headline numbers could become ingrained in household and business decisionmaking  I believe the   risk remains that cutting the funds rate again will have undesirable effects on inflation expectations    The real federal funds rate using the Greenbook’s forecast of overall PCE inflation is now between   minus ½ and minus ¾ percent  That seems like plenty of stimulus for now  Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I find myself agreeing with my colleagues who   have advocated alternative C  One way to think about our approach to the policy decision today is   to look ahead and think about the probabilities associated with two bad outcomes  Will the   economy go into a substantially deeper recession than we expect?  Or coming out of this recession,   will the trailing inflation rate be higher than it was when we went in?  Although I hope neither of   these occurs, my sense right now is that the chance of an increase in trend inflation is more likely   than a much deeper recession, and I think we should alter our policy path accordingly   The incoming data since the beginning of the year have resulted in a more adverse outlook,   and that change in the outlook is already, in my view, reflected in the current stance of policy  I   noted yesterday that the real federal funds rate using the Greenbook’s inflation forecast rather than   four-quarter lagged core inflation is now between minus ½ and minus ¾ percent  I think it makes   sense to take advantage of information about foreseeable gaps between overall inflation and core,   April 29–30, 2008 124 of 266    and the stance of policy strikes me as very stimulative, certainly plenty for the recession we now   expect, when we look at back historical recessions  As I noted yesterday, at the retail level for firms   and consumers, spreads aren’t out of line with where they’ve been in past recessions  It is true that   jumbo mortgage rates and some other rates have not come down as much as they’ve come down in   past recessions, but I just remind people of the secular technology shift  There’s a sort of level shift   in intermediation technology that we’re going through right now that really constitutes a change in   the relative prices of different financial assets     Now, I can’t think clearly about the stance of policy without talking first about the risk-free   rate and then thinking about various spreads as really having to do with the relative prices of   different financial claims  So in looking at and through retail rates, that’s informative  But the risk-  free rate is the risk-free rate, and an array of factors affects how those relative financial prices   evolve  The securitization channel that seemed to work very well for a while is now exposed as   more costly and less efficacious than once was thought  Some of these securitization vehicles didn’t   exist in past recessions or expansions, and only a couple of decades ago these spreads were as high   as or higher than they are now  So I stick to thinking about the stance of monetary policy in terms   of the real risk-free rate   I think our experience between the January and the March meetings with inflation   expectations is pretty good evidence of their fragility in the current environment without our having   articulated what our long-run objective is for inflation  I don’t think that the level of inflation   expectations is aligned with our objectives; I think it is too high relative to our objectives  Market   participants see a good chance of our dropping the rate ¼ point today and reversing field later in this   year and raising rates again  I suspect they don’t fully grasp how difficult it’s going to be to reverse   course while we negotiate the murky waters of the recovering economy later this year  Indeed, I   April 29–30, 2008 125 of 266    think that the fiscal stimulus that we’re going to get will make those waters even murkier  It will be   even harder to divine the underlying, ex-fiscal-policy strength of the economy   So for these reasons, I believe that we should leave the fed funds rate alone today  The   upward surprise at our last meeting did not appear to affect financial markets adversely  Coupled   with that statement’s emphasis on inflation risks, it did seem to have the beneficial effect of   reversing the run-up in inflation expectations  I would expect that leaving the funds rate alone today   would have a similar beneficial effect in stabilizing inflation expectations  So I favor alternative C,   Mr Chairman     Thank you  This represents a once-in-a-generation opportunity to   reengineer our monetary policy operational framework, and I think it’s important that we do our   best to get it right  I want to start by applauding the staff for taking a very deliberate, very   thoughtful approach to this project  I was able to attend the workshop on foreign central banks’   operations  I found it very illuminating, instructive, well organized, and well thought out  So far   April 29–30, 2008 161 of 266    the work has been well organized, and the broad-based involvement has been very good  I want to   compliment you on sifting down  The combinatorics must have been mind-boggling given the   number of free parameters in the design of one of these schemes  I want to applaud you for boiling   it down to a good, representative set that spans everything that I think we’d want to consider  What   you produced—with one slight exception that I’ll talk about in a bit—is a very thorough and careful   analysis   In Richmond, we have thought about the issue of interest on reserves for many, many   years—even before the Congress considered it  Toward the end, I’m going to argue that option 4   deserves serious consideration, and I’d like to see you focus on that as well as the other options   going forward  Before I do, though, I want to comment briefly on the objectives  You asked for   feedback on this  In particular, I think objective 3 needs to be interpreted very carefully  The report   often seems to interpret objective 3 as implying that anything that reduces the amount of lending in   the fed funds market must reduce financial market efficiency  I just don’t think that’s right   The prohibition of interest on reserves is obviously a tax on reserve holdings  You have   focused on the tax that it implies on reservable liabilities, but the fact that we also don’t pay interest   on excess reserves is a tax on excess reserve holdings  If we eliminate reserve requirements and we   still don’t pay interest on reserves, we’ll still be taxing reserve holdings  That gives rise to   inefficiencies for the same reason that the lack of interest on currency gives rise to inefficiencies,   and so in this setting, obviously banks do a lot of things to avoid the reserve tax  Some of the   measures involve a lot of monitoring of the reserve account, monitoring of the prospective payment   flow, and making sure that they can predict where they’re going to be at the end of the day    But some of the measures undoubtedly involve some transactions—such as fed funds loans,   purchases of Treasury securities, repo lending, and the like—that are aimed at minimizing their non-  April 29–30, 2008 162 of 266    interest-earning balances  Such transactions are exactly analogous to the classic shoe-leather costs   of inflation  Additional transactions that are induced by the tax on currency are a waste  Reducing   the inflation tax results in fewer trips to the bank or to the ATM to get money out, and that reduction   is a good thing, not a bad thing  It would be a benefit, and that is exactly what it means to reduce   the dead weight burden of inflation  Similarly, I think that paying interest on excess reserves will   reduce transaction volumes in the fed funds market, but we should count that as a benefit, not a cost    Put more generally, the effectiveness of a market isn’t the same as the quantity of transactions    I bring this up because one of the main objections to option 4, at least in the report—it didn’t   appear in the slides—is that it could reduce fed funds market lending  I think it should be obvious at   this point why that wouldn’t necessarily be a bad thing  It’s sort of like saying that reducing   inflation would be a bad thing because people would make fewer trips to the bank  I don’t think   you’d say that     Even if we believed that fed funds volume is important, I think a quick look at the numbers   would suggest that it’s not likely to be that big a problem  The staff estimates that the fed funds   market is about $225 billion, on average  So how much by way of reserves will we need to add to   ensure a negligible chance that our autonomous reserve factor drains reserves enough to drive the   funds rate up?  You showed a graph, and there was a flat spot, and you had supply way, way, way   out on the curve  But it doesn’t need to go out that far  It just needs to go out so that you’d know   that you’re not going to accidentally go in on the upward part  My reading of your intermeeting   report is that reserve misses are typically on the order of $1 billion or $2 billion  I think the average   absolute value is about $990 million  Two is pretty rare  It happens every now and then  So it   seems as though $5 billion would do plenty  The report says that $35 billion would be how much   reserves you’d need to add  I’m a little curious about where that number came from  It’s hard for   April 29–30, 2008 163 of 266    me to believe we’d need that much  But certainly more broadly than that, if you think about the   market, is that right now $225 billion in lending is going on  If you do the thought experiments   about current equilibriums and you are a bank that just walks into the market and needs some   reserves, will it be hard to get reserves?  Well, you’re going to run into $225 billion worth from   banks that are already lending their reserves with interest  So if you’re going to get your loan,   you’re going to have to pay a competitive rate and shake loose some money from one of them  If   we are paying interest on $35 billion in reserves, will that change that calculus much?  I don’t think   so  I think that your markets are still going to work the same way  If you want reserves, you’re   going to have to pay a competitive rate for them  If you’re not getting reserves at that rate, you’re   going to bid up until you get them  So I just don’t quite get this concern about the volume of   transactions in the funds market   A related objection is the issue of hoarding—the idea that one bank might decide to hold a   whole bunch of reserves  The staff cited the example of New Zealand  I thought that was a really   interesting discussion at the workshop  One bank accumulated $8 billion or $9 billion in reserves, I   think it was, which was large for them, and they had to add a large amount of reserves to   accommodate that demand plus the demand of other banks in the system  Now, the problem for the   Bank of New Zealand is, as I understand it, that the government doesn’t issue debt  When they   have to issue deposits, they have to acquire foreign exchange reserves, and that involves a fiscal risk   that they’re reluctant to take on  My sense of the conversation is that they don’t like to accumulate   foreign exchange reserves  We seem to be quite willing to expand our balance sheet  Plus, there are   plenty of government securities around  So I just don’t see why it would be a problem for us if   reserve demand was unexpectedly high or some bank decided to hold $50 billion in reserves   April 29–30, 2008 164 of 266    I want to talk about one more thing, which is the issue of the rate  The way you have written   it up is that what we target now is the average rate of brokered deposits  You said it was $80 billion   to $100 billion out of $225 billion, on average—so less than half the market—just the weighted   average of trades during the day that go through brokered channels  That doesn’t include direct   credit funds  The approach you envisioned is that we try to set a remuneration rate so that the   effective rate, that average, comes out at the target rate that the Committee sets  A very natural   alternative, it seems to me—and I think this is the way the Bank of England does it—is that our   policy rate is now the deposit rate  When we issue a press release, we say we’re changing the policy   rate—I don’t know whether or not we would rename it     Now, you folks estimate that the risk premium that would, on average, be the gap between   this deposit rate and this effective fed funds rate you measure might be 10 basis points  We now set   the funds rate target in ¼ point increments  In theory, we could set our policy rate 10 basis points   below ¼ point increments  That seems a little bizarre  I’m not sure that we have such precise   confidence in the optimal funds rate that we’d know that it should be on the ¼ point and not   10 basis points below or above  It strikes me that a natural version of option 4 or any of these   options would be to set the remuneration rate at ¼ point increments and have that be the policy rate,   and just make that the reference point for how we do  Admittedly, econometricians would have to   do a lot of work in the future to splice these series together, but I think that’s a workable alternative   we ought to think about   I think that option 4 has some obvious benefits over the other options  Intuitively, if you   were given a limited budget and were asked to peg the price of a commodity—minimize the   variance of a commodity price around a given target—your natural inclination would be to stand   ready to buy and sell that commodity at the target price  That would be, right out of the box, the   April 29–30, 2008 165 of 266    first thing every economist would say  Option 4 is the closest practical analogue to that  It’s clean    It’s simple  I think it’s eminently workable  I just don’t see the force of the objections  In   comparison, option 5, which is the one that comes closest to option 4, involves the monitoring of   voluntary targets  You have to monitor these bands  You have to check the balances every night   against the bands  It just seems like a lot of superfluous machinery   Option 4 would go furthest toward reducing our dependence on forecasting uncertain   autonomous factors  It would also go furthest toward solving the problem that the primary dealer   credit facility has given rise to, which has been particularly acute in the last intermeeting period,   which is that rates are firm  You’ve done a pretty good job with the average daily rate, but it   crashes at the end of every day  More than half the time you look at the low for the day and it’s   under 1 percent  It’s like ½ percent  So we have a chronic intraday problem of rates being firm and   then crashing because you don’t know  Primary dealers come in, that stuff goes on the market, and   the rate crashes   I think option 4 would also be the most transparent approach  It would be the easiest to   explain to people  It would go furthest toward eliminating the risk of the downside target misses   and concerns about stealth easing  Option 4 would also facilitate long-run moves toward lesser   lines of daylight central bank credit, and I think that’s an important consideration  It shouldn’t be   the deciding consideration, but it is important  In terms of the timeline, you have yourselves   focusing on two options before the results of the public comment come in  To some extent that’s   prejudging where the public comment is going to come in  So, in short, option 4 strikes me as the   most straightforward and practical way to do it, and I’d urge that we direct the group, which has   done great work so far, to focus on option 4 and to keep it as a live option  Thank you, Mr   Chairman   April 29–30, 2008 166 of 266      A comment about stigma  Every financial transaction that a substantive   firm engages in that becomes known is relied upon by market participants to make inferences    There’s a huge literature on the effect on equity values of the announcement of a bank line of credit;   and like through this last crisis, if you talk to funding-desk guys, they’re very aware at the tactical   level about what counterparties are revealing by their actions in funding markets  They take that on   board, and they’re very strategic about what they reveal with their market transactions  We can try   to keep it secret, but there’s a broad ability in the market to infer when somebody goes to the   window by their behavior before that  I’m saying that I don’t think we should get our hopes up   about ever eliminating stigma     Presumably, the rate we pay would be viewed as a risk-free rate    Presumably, any market rate would be priced relative to that to include a credit premium in the   usual way  If any other dynamics are anticipated by the staff, it would be useful to know that    But the usual presumption we have is that observed market rates would have our rate plus a   credit premium booked into it, or transaction costs, or whatever  I’d just make that comment     Yes  I notice that in chart 18, in your TIPS-implied average inflationary   plot to the ten-year horizon, you omit the Markets Group’s estimate  Is that because of   skepticism on your part that leads you to judge it as inferior or an overabundance of humility?    [Laughter]   June 24–25, 2008 8 of 253      It does, of course, show a slightly different trend, right?     I want to make sure I understand what you just said  Your response   suggests that there’s a third state that’s even worse than we are in now, that one could possibly go   into, and that what you’ve tempered is the probability that we’re in that worst state?     I don’t want to belabor this too much  I was curious about what you   tempered  I think President Bullard was looking for whether you tempered the probability on   state 2  I’m with you in not wanting to place a lot of probability on n states, but it sounds as though   the growth trajectory—you know, the magnitude of the add-factors you were thinking of—has been   drawn back a little  Is that a fair characterization?     Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Economic activity in the Fifth District has   remained soft in recent weeks  Our retailers report declining activity in June, especially in autos    We are still hearing scattered reports of delayed or canceled new construction projects, either   because of a lack of financing or because demand is expected to decline  Our survey measure of   manufacturing activity, which by the way covers a manufacturing sector bigger than the   Philadelphia and the Empire indexes combined, [laughter] has edged lower in the last two   months; but exports continue to be a bright spot with reports of robust outbound activity at area   ports  Manufacturing contacts report some success in passing on rising energy and transportation   costs to their customers, and their indexes of expected six-month-ahead manufacturing price   trends, both for prices paid and prices received, reached new record highs for the 14-year history   of those series  I, too, have heard scattered reports in the last couple of weeks of employers   contemplating providing extra compensation boosts to their employees to make up for rising   energy costs     On the whole, I think the risk of the national economy sinking into a serious recession   has receded, and the growth outlook has edged up a bit  I was relieved by the strength in retail   sales in May as well as the upward revisions for April and March  The ISM indexes have   steadied at right around 50 over the past four months; and although the labor market has been   weak, it has not yet shown the accelerating declines that I feared  The Greenbook projection for   June 24–25, 2008 56 of 253    Q2 real GDP has been revised from minus 14 to plus 17, and we have made a similar   adjustment in our own projection     There remain plenty of reasons for concern on the real side of the economy, of course    Real disposable income has suffered with the fall in employment over the last half-year, and the   rising cost of gasoline is taking its toll as well  The continued fall in housing prices has cut into   household net worth and could contribute to a rise in consumer saving  Stimulus checks might   be playing an important role in supporting consumer spending right now; it is not clear how   much  But I am concerned that, when the stimulus effects wear off later this year, we may find   that the underlying trend in consumer spending is fairly soft  Commercial construction also   remains a potential risk, I believe  There is a bit of a disconnect between the surprisingly strong   data on nonresidential construction and the reports of slowing that we keep hearing from regional   contacts  This suggests that the numbers reflect projects initiated before the beginning of the   year and that commercial construction is likely to soften later this year and to be a drag next   year  Despite all of these elements that could depress growth, I think the economic situation has   undoubtedly turned out better than we expected at the April meeting because of the better-than-  expected consumer and business-investment numbers  Greenbook now forecasts a period of low   but positive real growth, significantly better than the experiences of the last two fairly mild   recessions, and I think that is about right   Inflation is a growing problem, though  CPI came in at an annual rate of 8 percent in   May and has averaged 49 percent over the last three months  The core intermediate goods PPI   is increasing at double-digit rates  Oil prices have risen 16 percent by my calculation since the   last meeting  Retail gas prices are up 13 percent  Changes in inflation expectations since the last   meeting vary with the measure that you choose  But my reading is that they continue to   June 24–25, 2008 57 of 253    deteriorate  In any event, they are above levels consistent with price stability  The Michigan   survey numbers for inflation expectations have risen notably, especially for the one-year horizon    The TIPS-based measure of expected one-year inflation five years forward has increased   30 basis points since the April meeting, and although the five-year, five-year-forward figure has   been stable since then, it is still quite close to the highest value it reached at any point last year    It is popular, as many have noted around the table, to cite the stability of compensation gains as   evidence that we are not seeing a wage–price spiral  I have done it myself recently  But I share   the concerns expressed by President Evans and others around the table about that being a lagging   indicator  I am concerned that, if we wait until we see rising inflation expectations showing up   as wage pressures, we will have waited too long  I noted in just a casual glance at the data from   the 1970s that, although wage acceleration was a prominent component of the acceleration of   inflation in the late 1960s, it was largely absent in the accelerations that occurred in ’74 and ’79   I think monetary policy is quite stimulative right now  Using the Bluebook’s standard   approach of subtracting four-quarter lagged core inflation, the real funds rate now stands just   below zero, about where it bottomed out in the ’91 recession and a good deal above its trough in   2004  But I don’t think lagged core inflation is the best estimate of overall inflation now  I am   drawn to the Bluebook’s real rate estimate, new in this edition, that uses the Greenbook’s   projection for headline inflation  Using that measure and going back and reconstructing it for the   past, the real funds rate is now minus 13 percent, and that is substantially lower than its troughs   in the last two recessions, which were right around zero  This is a lot of stimulus, arguably way   too much given the improvement in the growth outlook, the reduction in downside risks, and the   continuation of inflation pressures  I think withdrawing the stimulus is going to be challenging,   however   June 24–25, 2008 58 of 253    About the extended projections, I am not convinced that the benefits exceed the cost  I   don’t think it is going to provide much help on communicating an inflation objective  I think it   will show about as much dispersion as our third-year forecasts show now  In any event, I   haven’t noticed much of a decline in the volatility of inflation expectations since we began   releasing projections on an accelerated calendar late last year  Moreover, I think those steady-  state or longer-run projections are just going to tempt people to think that we have an   unemployment rate target and a growth target  That some politicians have suggested that we   actually adopt such makes it dangerous to engage in any exercise that seems to comply with that   suggestion  Besides, I am not sure who cares about our steady-state growth forecasts besides   maybe some business-cycle-model calibrators  But we are likely to get our steady-state growth   forecasts from those people in any event, so I am not sure that is going to be very helpful  I   don’t think we should bother with these extended forecasts  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thanks, Brian, for including these two new lines of the real federal funds   rate  As I remarked yesterday, one use of the figures is to look back and judge the degree of   accommodation relative to other historical episodes  My understanding is that the Greenbook   forecast of headline inflation four quarters ahead is higher now than it was in 2004, when the black   line in your exhibit 3 last hit its lowest point  My understanding is that, if you drew that black line   using the equivalent of line 12, the Greenbook’s forecast for overall inflation, the trough in 2004   would lie around zero, and we would now be at minus 13     Okay  Just a comment then     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The growth outlook has improved over the last   two months, but the inflation picture has not  If anything, it has deteriorated  I think it’s clear, as   President Hoenig argued, that we should be tightening policy soon  The extent to which we brought   the funds rate down was predicated on downside risks and the notion that we could reverse course   June 24–25, 2008 109 of 253    rapidly  As downside risks now look much less likely, I just don’t see how an argument that   2 percent was the appropriate funds rate in April does not also imply that a higher funds rate would   be appropriate now  Taking back some of that stimulus at this meeting, however, is probably   inconsistent with the commitment implied by the Committee’s traditional interest rate smoothing   behavior  So I’m willing to stand pat today with the funds rate   The timing of such moves is going to present us with some trouble going forward, though    Even if we avoid outright recession, as now seems probable, the unemployment rate is likely to   keep rising for a time  But waiting isn’t going to make it easier for us, in any event, because there’s   a likelihood of the fourth quarter’s showing a slowdown when the stimulus wears off  But inflation   is going to increase in the near term as well  At least that seems likely, and holding rates down   while that happens and while inflation expectations are already fairly elevated seems awfully risky   to me   I can understand the need for some conviction when we raise rates  When we began cutting   rates aggressively in January, there were some significant uncertainties in the inflation outlook,   though  I hope we don’t set any higher a threshold of conviction for rate increases than we set for   rate cuts  Looking back at 2003-04, and this is strictly in hindsight, one can argue that we erred by   waiting too long to reverse course, and I’ve heard you yourself make that argument, Mr Chairman    So the logic of risk management works in both directions  I think we need to keep that in mind     Just a brief observation  Spreads always rise in recessions  We always   lower real rates in recessions  So to say that the fact that spreads have risen by itself doesn’t make   this an exceptional circumstance     For some; not for others  Corporate bond spreads aren’t as high     I thought Vice Chairman Geithner’s characterization of markets was   pretty good, but it is compatible with your suggestion     Thank you  Thank you, Art, Scott, and Patrick, for a very forthcoming   presentation  Two things for you, Art  First, on page 8 you presented some information about the   details of the stress test that you’re applying, and the table lists various unsecured funding and   secured funding from other sources, and you have numerical assumptions for the severity of stress    I take it that you apply those to the balance sheet numbers and do some calculations to calculate the   stress test     I was going to say that you essentially asked the question, What does   “severe” mean in your stress system?     Then you had some iteration to get to an agreed-upon set of numbers for   these     Okay  Now, you also said that you started your first iteration by asking   them to give you the results of a Bear Stearns failure scenario  What numbers does that correspond   to on this table?     Well, wait  I’m sorry  I lost you there     So the severity, that’s how much of the money goes away     Okay  So do you have those numbers for Bear—what they actually   experienced?   June 24–25, 2008 147 of 253      You didn’t have the exact numbers     But you knew roughly what they were     I see  Well, I was just interested in information on exactly how that   transpired  If there’s a chance that you could share with us that information when you get it, that   would be very useful  A second question for you  You noted reputational risk from being in on the   supervisory basis, and I want just to probe as to how you think about that  What eventualities would   be risky for us?     So it’s essentially the risk that, after the fact, marks are questioned, and   they ask, “You guys were in there—why didn’t you   ?”  I understand that  Thanks     The third question is for Pat  You talked about the repo market  My understanding is that   some supervisory work under the LFI (large financial institution) umbrella is aimed at conditions in   the repo market and mitigating some risk there  You mentioned that it was obviously an important   factor in Bear  To what extent do you think paying interest on demand deposits would obviate the   need for the huge volume of transactions in the repo market and the extent to which that legislative   prohibition could have contributed to the market structures and fragility that gave rise to what   happened in Bear     I mention that because it sounds as though it would be worthwhile   knowing if it’s important  Since we’ve asked the Congress twice now for permission to pay interest   and they’ve declined, and if this was a factor in the recent crisis, we might want to point that out to   them as part of our legislative dialogue with them over the next couple of months to try to get them   to do something     Yes  About the general topic of stigma and lending at our facilities, I think   it would be a useful agenda item for future research, and it would be useful for us to work at   thinking carefully about this  Stigma represents some information revelation to market participants   attending on some act, whether it’s borrowing from us or from someone else  The usual   presumption is that more information is better  We talk as if stigma is a bad thing  So I’d want to   see a model that lays out how the sense in which it’s a bad thing counteracts the sense in which   information is usually a good thing  I’m really curious about that  I think it’s something we ought   to think more carefully about     That Thursday?       It hadn’t run off that week?     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The issues around the liquidity facility and   what supervisory apparatus we have wrapped around primary dealers have to do with our having   extended our lending reach  I think there’s now a substantial gap between our implied lending   commitment and the scope of our supervisory authority  Vice Chairman Geithner spoke very   eloquently about that earlier this month  I think it’s paramount that we close that gap in order to   keep borrowers from exploiting the obvious lending commitment and choosing to leave themselves   vulnerable to runs and run-like behavior  But this leaves open the question of the extent of our   lending reach and how we close that gap, and I think that that’s the most critical challenge for us in   the year ahead, particularly as we approach negotiations with the Congress   I’d like to share a couple of thoughts on that broader question because the questions posed to   us sort of get at those  It’s important to start this from a peacetime perspective, sort of a timeless   perspective, and ask the question as if you were choosing afresh a lending and regulatory policy that   was going to last a long time  If you imagine for the moment that whatever we announce and adopt   would be perfectly credible and immediately viewed as credible, I think you’d obviously choose to   not have this gap  You’d obviously choose to have lending and regulatory policies that are mutually   incentive compatible  So you’d want an adequate supervisory regime in place for any institution   that market participants believe we’ll lend to  Conversely, it means that you would want market   June 24–25, 2008 163 of 253    participants to believe that we will constrain our lending to those institutions for which we have an   adequate supervisory regime in place   So then the question comes up  How do you choose the boundaries of our lending   commitment?  I take it as self-evident that our lending commitment shouldn’t be open-ended and   unlimited  We don’t want to supervise every financial intermediary in the world or in the United   States, much less all individuals, partnerships, and corporations  But even limiting ourselves to   what’s called systemically important financial institutions is going to be problematic as well  I take   that phrase to mean any institution whose failure could be costly or disruptive to many other market   participants  Any institution that chooses to engage in maturity transformation to some extent faces   the potential for run-like behavior by the creditors  Unless we impose draconian regulations, market   participants will always have a virtually unlimited capacity for creating financial arrangements that   run the risk of disruptive failures  So extending our lending reach to whatever institution that makes   itself systemically important just leads us down a path of ever more financial regulation of an ever   larger portion of the financial system  I think we’re going to have to set some boundaries  I’d like   to see them tighter rather than looser, and making them credible is going to be the hard problem for   us going forward   In doing that, we’re going to face a classic time-consistency problem  I take that as given    I’m not sure everyone else shares that view, but I take it as obvious  Inevitably the exigencies of   crisis management are excruciating, but I think there are times when they conflict with our long-run   interest in the type of financial system that we would design from a peacetime, timeless perspective,   just the way short-run concerns about growth sometimes conflict with our long-run interest in price   stability  But just as sustaining monetary policy credibility sometimes requires resisting the   temptation to ease policy to stimulate growth, sustaining credible lending limits is going to   June 24–25, 2008 164 of 253    sometimes require not preventing a disruptive failure of an institution and not ameliorating the cost   of financial distress  To put it another way, I think it would be a mistake to adapt our supervisory   reach to a purely discretionary lending policy  We’re going to have to choose a policy and commit   to it and then take hard actions to make that credible   From this point of view, I have a deep question about the questions posed by the staff  They   focus entirely on primary dealers, and it doesn’t strike me that the fact that Bear Stearns was a   primary dealer was what made us lend  It was the fact that it was more disruptive  I think it’s likely   that any other institution that presents the same threat of a disorderly resolution is going to be   perceived as benefiting from our implicit lending support, whether or not they’re a primary dealer,   unless we say something otherwise, unless we draw a boundary, and unless we make that credible    So, for example, other large broker-dealers, hedge funds, private equity firms, or insurance   companies could easily fail in a disruptive way  We need to think through whether we’re going to   let that happen or whether we’re going to be forced to step in  At some point we’re going to have to   choose to let something disruptive happen   I think that ambiguity about our lending limits would be a bad choice  Market participants   are going to form their own views about the likelihood of us lending  Any lack of clarity about the   boundaries is just going to lead some firms to test the boundaries, and it’s not going to help us resist   the temptation to lend beyond the boundaries we want to establish  Besides, Mr Chairman, you’ve   emphasized the value of de-personalizing and institutionalizing the conduct of monetary policy  It’s   important that we strive for lending policy that isn’t critically dependent on particular officeholders    As I said, I’d favor fairly tight limits on our lending commitments, and you are probably not   surprised about that  I think we really ought to maintain this section 13(3) hurdle at a fairly high   level, but the exit strategy makes me nervous  Crafting this MOU, a permanent shift in our visibility   June 24–25, 2008 165 of 253    into and in our ability to protect the system from primary dealers, is just going to sustain the   expectations that have arisen since Bear—which have been described and referenced a couple of   times and which you see in the fall in CDS spreads for those institutions—and it is just really hard   to see how to put that genie back in the bottle and limit the extent to which we’re viewed as   backstopping them  But I think we ought to strive to make that somehow be viewed as unusual as   possible   More broadly, my reading of the history of economics and financial intermediation is just   my reading  But I’m motivated broadly by the sense that we’d be better served in the long run with   as small an extent of central bank lending commitment as possible  Central bank credit is fiscal   policy  It entangles us in politics  It risks compromising the independence of our monetary policy    You’ve heard me say this before  Expanding our lending forces us to extend our regulatory reach,   and that can’t be good for the financial system even though I trust our staff to do a very good job of   being as efficient and effective as they can be  I’ve argued this before  It’s not obvious on the   evidence that our financial system is terribly fragile apart from the volatility induced by   uncertainties about government and central bank policies  Besides, I think that we should take   seriously the notion that some amount of financial instability is undoubtedly optimal, as work by   economists such as Allen and Gale has demonstrated  Those are the kinds of considerations that I   think ought to guide our policy     Finally, Mr Chairman, a word about process  At our last meeting we discussed interest on   reserves, a historic and consequential decision for us  We had a briefing package of 100-plus pages   reflecting substantial staff work  The Committee very much benefited from that  At an upcoming   meeting we’re going to talk about inflation dynamics, another consequential topic  We’ve received   somewhat less material, even going back several months, about financial markets, their character,   June 24–25, 2008 166 of 253    and the welfare economics of our interventions  I’d urge you to consider a special topic at some   future meeting at which we explore the economics of financial stability, since it is becoming such a   consequential part of what we do  Related to that, I was happy to learn from Art that an after-action   review by the SEC was under way  Because our role is different from the SEC’s, I’d like to suggest   that maybe building on that or maybe in parallel to that we conduct our own after-action review of   the factors that went into how that event played out  Thank you very much, Mr Chairman     I agree, and those are mechanisms for legislatively tying our hands, and   that ought to be high on the agenda     Yes  I support Governor Warsh’s suggestion for raising the price  It is   hard for me to believe that confidence in any of these institutions depends materially on   100 basis points of the price  It is the access, the funding, that they would be able to use to fund   withdrawal or flight by somebody  I think it sends the right signal that we view this as   exceptional  Conditions are certainly different than they were in March, when we designed and   implemented it, and I think they are unlikely in the fall to be anywhere close to where they were   on March 16  You might disagree, and we could always change things between now and then    But I like the signal of withdrawing the generosity just a tad      But this would also place less weight on moral suasion to discourage   and would use the price system a bit     With the way that we currently operate the Term Securities Lending   Facility now in place, is there any upper limit on the fee that some participant can bid?     So they can wait and virtually guarantee themselves a vanishing   probability of not getting their bid hit by just bidding an arbitrarily large amount, right?   July 24, 2008 9 of 50      No  But this is what single-price auction theory is about, figuring out   what the equilibrium bid function is  Presumably they make some inference and act on it, and   presumably they are doing that calculation now in deciding how much to bid to guarantee them a   certain probability  Right?  So this auction would provide insurance, as I interpret it, against the   TSLF fee being higher than they would otherwise think it would be or being unanticipatedly   high—equivalently, the spread between agency MBS and Treasury GC (general collateral) repo   rates being unanticipatedly high  Is that a good interpretation of what this option would provide   in economic terms to the participants?     Right  So you’re paying for insurance     Right  It is reducing the upper tail  So what sort of evidence or reports   have you had from the dealer community that the upper tail of the probability distribution of   TSLF bids is causing financial strain for them?     Let me ask you about the margin spiral you talked about, that this could   help prevent  I would be interested in hearing your comparison of this option proposal with   simply expanding the size of the TSLF offer by an equivalent amount  In just my simple, basic   sort of thinking through this, I can’t see any difference in the degree to which those two   alternatives would prevent the kind of margin spiral you are talking about  Presumably you’d   have a margin spiral under this option plan if some big demand for dumping securities occurs,   once they tap out both the regular TSLF and draws on these options  That’s the extra securities   that we are absorbing off the market  If the TSLF is the same amount, we’d provide the same   amount of insurance against a margin spiral  Is there some reason to prefer this as a way of   ensuring against margin spiral versus just expanding the TSLF amount?      Has that risk been a particular problem for dealers?    July 24, 2008 11 of 50      Was it unpredictable?  It seems pretty predictable at this point that we’re   going to get stress over the quarter-ends  I mean, this is addressed at the uncertainty around that   not at the stress per se     There also isn’t any maximum bid in the Term Auction Facility, right?     So there is no maximum on the rate—     Now, if I want funds from six to nine months from now, I can just wait   and virtually guarantee that I am going to get those funds by planning to bid just exorbitant   amounts for them, right?   July 24, 2008 12 of 50      Right  So?     We would flood the market with reserves  We wouldn’t let it get to that,   would we?  We would have other tools for addressing a huge spike in the demand for funds at   that point  Presumably it wouldn’t go far above the primary credit facility rate  I am just   probing here about the amount of insurance we are providing  This seems like a very specific   piece of insurance that we are providing in both of these cases, and I am having trouble seeing   the link between these and the overall financial strains you are characterizing or seeing in the   market  That is what all of this is about  That is why I am asking this     Yes  I want to, first, just express appreciation to President Yellen for the   full account of their experience  I think it is useful for us to share notes on experiences like that    We had an experience with the OTS, and we found that their rating plus 1 was the rating we   usually came to  We had the luxury of having someone on our staff who had experience with   Countrywide, and we essentially treated them like an institution that we supervised and insisted   on the full panoply of information, such as reports and financial reporting, to be able to make our   own independent assessment  Our guys did a great job  I have to commend them—they did a lot   of work  But it was a strain on our staff  I do think, if lending is going to play such a large role   for us going forward, that we should build up the capability of developing our own independent   assessment of institutions whose primary regulator is not us   In this instance, I think it is outrageous that the OTS downgraded them and didn’t inform   the San Francisco Fed  I hope, Mr Chairman, that the unacceptability of that sort of behavior is   communicated at the highest levels to the OTS  This instance demonstrates the principle that   July 24, 2008 28 of 50    lending on which we incur no loss doesn’t necessarily equal lending that is appropriate  I think it   is a good thing, President Yellen, that you folks insisted on comfort from the FDIC that they   were pursuing a least-cost strategy  But it will not necessarily be the case that lending to allow   the chartering institution to delay closure will be the least-cost resolution  I am curious,   President Yellen, whether there were uninsured claimants that were able to withdraw funds in the   interim during your lending     So you don’t think refusing to lend would have forced the FDIC to   accelerate closure?     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I share President Stern’s intuition that the value   of these at the margin, given what we already have in place, seems questionable  Even with some   July 24, 2008 33 of 50    generosity to the theories of financial strain that seem to motivate the mechanisms we have in place,   the additional contribution to alleviating stress seems just trivial, just incredibly minor, to me  I also   very deeply share President Hoenig’s concern  There is an endless stream of improvements we   could potentially make to our intermediation efforts here, our lending facilities  Continuing to   invest in more and more improvements just sends the signal, it seems to me, that we’re settling in   for the long haul and envision and expect to be offering these for quite some time  As you all know,   I have deep reservations about all of these facilities  But I would think that the broad consensus of   the Committee was that these are temporary, transitory facilities, and in that light I think we ought to   be thinking of ways that we are going to wean the banking system off these  Adding features like   this is just going to further entwine the institutions with us and develop further dependency on us   and these facilities  I also think Mr Dudley said that this was the number 1 desired improvement   articulated by dealers  I think that cannot possibly be a standalone rationale for something like this    Market participants are bound to think of stuff that they would like us to do, and we can’t let that   guide us  We have to have a sense that we are actually doing something of broader significance    Finally, I will say that I do strongly support the collateral policy change of making the   overcollateralization apply every day that the credit is outstanding  I questioned the one-day-only   part when we first brought it up with the TAF, and I think that would be a step in the right direction    Thank you     Yes  I don’t think we should do the 84  If we have to, I’d rather have the   28-day option  I have a procedural question  The original Term Auction Facility authorizations   required action by all the Reserve Bank boards of directors  Would this modification also require   their consent?     I thought that part of President Evans’s question was whether markets   are back to normal for a period in which they are adjusting to hundreds of billions of dollars of   losses on mortgage loans  So I would be interested in your characterization of how markets are   working relative to how well they ought to work in that circumstance     If I could follow up, the reactions you described sound warranted by the   information coming in  The market is digesting information about the location and magnitude of   losses and the extent to which housing is going to recover     But when you use “normal” in that sentence, you mean a time period   without hundreds of millions of dollars of losses that we don’t know quite the magnitude of,   right?     So if I could just follow up—in these graphs, what would you point to as   the effects of our actions or our lending?     I would be interested in seeing a model, Mr Chairman  Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Just to point out that it must be the case that   lower house prices have a positive effect on the homeownership rate  So there must be some   mitigation, some good effect  We’re obviously getting to where we need to get eventually  The   question I have for the staff about this is, Have you thought about the sequence?  I mean, it strikes   me that we’re likely to get to a point of stability in prices and construction activity before we get   months’ supply back down to some historical norm  Because it’s sort of a stop variable, are you   guys expecting it to converge smoothly, and have you thought about what measures of activity you   expect to see stabilize first?     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Before I begin, let me add my words of   welcome to Betsy Duke, welcoming Governor Duke back to the Federal Reserve System  I say   “back” because she has served excellently on our board of directors beginning almost 1 years ago    She’s a fast friend and strong supporter of the Federal Reserve System  I’m delighted that the long   wait for her installation is over, and I look forward to working with her; but I don’t want any of my   compliments to her to be detrimental to her effectiveness  [Laughter]   The Fifth District economy has remained weak in recent weeks  Manufacturing and service   sector activity fell  Real estate conditions remain sluggish  Labor markets remain soft  Export   activity remains the bright spot, with reports of sustained growth in outbound cargo at District ports    In a new development, however, manufacturers’ expectations for the very near future turned   negative in our most recent survey  This is very unusual  Respondents are typically relatively   optimistic about things six months from now  Retail contacts indicate that the decline in sales   broadened in July in our survey, and there aren’t many reports mentioning the effect of tax stimulus   checks  Price expectations for both raw materials and final goods rose in our July survey, and some   of those measures are at record highs   August 5, 2008 66 of 145    At the national level, my outlook for real growth is broadly consistent with the Greenbook’s   this time  I expect sluggish growth to continue through the remainder of the year, with a pickup   beginning sometime next year  Housing is likely to continue to be a drag, though a diminishing   one, until then  Consumer spending is likely to remain subdued, and business investment is likely to   moderate somewhat  I expect payroll employment to continue to decline for a while at about the   current pace—a pace that, as others have noted, is quite modest relative to what we typically see in a   recession  I think the most likely outcome is for us to continue to skirt an outright recession  I think   there is some risk of a broader and sharper contraction  I believe the magnitude of that risk is   modest, but it’s not negligible to me  Business investment could deteriorate, a risk that’s most   prominent in the nonresidential construction sector that we discussed earlier  But this is a small   component of aggregate demand, smaller than housing; and given the nature of gestation lags in this   sector, I think a downturn is likely to be gradual rather than abrupt  Household spending probably   poses the greatest risk to growth at this point  Consumer spending has flattened out in real terms,   although that’s what one would expect given the increase in food and energy prices that we’ve seen    Given the difficulty of assessing the extent to which tax rebates are propping up consumer spending   right now, we do not know how much Q4 consumption is going to be affected by the stimulus   rolling off   Potential growth effects of credit constraints or financial headwinds have gotten a lot of   attention these days  I remain skeptical about the magnitude of the drag on consumption and   investment spending that credit market conditions are likely to create  We have, of course, seen   reports in the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey of tightened credit terms, but through June both   C&I and consumer loans have continued to grow  I would note that we are hearing in the Fifth   District concerns from some of our smaller institutions that some large banks are bidding   August 5, 2008 67 of 145    aggressively for deposits—this has been going on for several months now, of course—and as a   result, the smaller banks are paying more to fund their loans  We’re also hearing now—and this is a   new report—of larger banks cutting back on fed funds lending to smaller institutions, no doubt out   of a concern about possible bank failures   What I think we’re seeing in banking markets is more of a reallocation of activity among   banks  Different institutions have been affected very differently by recent events depending on the   strategies they chose to pursue in the years preceding this episode  As a consequence,   intermediation is just shifting from some institutions to others  In fact, we’ve heard of banks   picking up business that other banks are shedding  Anecdotes about particular banks cutting back   on lending thus need to be taken with a grain of salt, and I don’t think they’re necessarily   representative of the banking sector as a whole  In fact, there was a really egregious case in the New   York Times of people not getting credit from banks because of this credit crunch  In paragraph 6,   one is introduced to their lead anecdote  a borrower at Wachovia who was denied credit  In   paragraph 22, we find out that he actually got credit two weeks later at this same institution  So I’m   a little skeptical about all of this anecdotal evidence about credit constraints  It’s undoubtedly the   case that credit standards have tightened, but the environment is such that a lot of borrowers have   gotten genuinely weaker     I mention all of this just because it influences how I feel about arguments that credit market   conditions make the current level of the real funds rate any less meaningful as an indicator of the   stance of monetary policy  I just don’t find those arguments convincing right now  The real funds   rate using the Greenbook’s forecast of overall inflation four quarters ahead is lower than it has been   at any time since the 1970s  In fact, this measure is about 1½ percentage points lower than the lows   August 5, 2008 68 of 145    it reached in 2003 or 1994, and I think this is to my mind a better way to measure the actual real   federal funds rate than what’s plotted in the Bluebook   The Greenbook forecast is that core PCE inflation will rise to 26 percent for the second half   of this year and then gradually subside to 1¾ percent a year or so after that  This forecast is a very   risky path, I believe, because at any point along that hump, higher inflation could well become   embedded in expectations  I think getting back to price stability after this episode is going to   depend critically on the stability of inflation expectations, as many of you have noted  It is true that   TIPS compensation measures have been reasonably steady for a few months and that wage rates   show no sign of accelerating as yet  But if we wait to raise rates until wage rates accelerate or TIPS   measures spike, we will have waited too long  I think that’s very clear, and it will cost us too much   to recover our credibility   Accordingly, I believe that the biggest policy risk we’re going to be facing in the months   ahead is the risk of waiting too long  In past episodes of economic or financial weakness, we’ve   been unwilling at times to raise the funds rate until we were almost completely certain that   economic recovery would be sustained  I do not think that we can afford that luxury at the present   time  The risk is too great that inflation expectations will ratchet up again  We need to be prepared   to raise rates even if growth is not back to potential and even if financial markets are not yet   tranquil, and we need to be prepared to raise rates even if we think that we might have to reverse   course  After all, we cut rates aggressively even though we were not certain that a recession was in   store for us and, in part, on the grounds that we could reverse course if it proved that we cut too far    To insist on more certainty to raise rates than to reduce them would introduce a fatal asymmetry in   our reaction function     August 5, 2008 69 of 145    Let me add a comment or two inspired by some of the discussion around the table  I want to   commend President Bullard’s discussion of systemic risk  You mentioned this earlier in your Q&A   session, Mr Chairman  This is a notoriously slippery concept  In popular usage, it seems to mean   an episode in which one bad thing happens followed by a lot of other seemingly related bad things   happening, and as such, it’s a purely empirical notion without any content or usefulness by itself as   a guide to policy  It doesn’t say whether those other bad things are efficient—things that ought to   happen—or inefficient and preventable by suitable policy intervention  To invoke the notion of   systemic risk to support a particular policy course requires theory  I spoke about theory last night,   but it requires some theory, some coherent understanding of the way you think the world works    The theoretical literature related to systemic risk is relatively young, and this isn’t the place to go   into it  I’ve said before that I think it would be useful for this Committee to learn more about this    The Committee might be surprised that the literature provides only relatively tenuous rationales—I   think is a fair judgment—for policy intervention  I hope, Mr Chairman, that the group you’ve   commissioned to study the meaning of unusual and exigent circumstances can explore this terrain in   a little more depth  Going forward, I think our deliberations would be aided if we were to strive to   put our theoretical frameworks on the table when discussing how financial markets work and what   we ought to do about them   In case there’s any suspense, for my own money—and this is just one man’s view—I   haven’t seen a convincing case for the existence of policy-relevant market failures in the financial   markets in which we’ve intervened, apart from the usual distortions owing to the federal financial   safety net  We systematically expanded that safety net  I believe what we’ve done has been to   subsidize selected borrower classes and prop up prices of various financial assets, and I think the   August 5, 2008 70 of 145    problem we face now is the tremendous dependency of financial institutions and markets on our   credit  Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  For my part, our exchanges have in the past   been predicated on nothing but the utmost respect  I expect that to continue  If I have done   anything or said anything to contribute to any other impression, I regret it, and I apologize     In the interest of avoiding talking past each other, let me say a bit about   why I view real rates as low  I recognize what you and Governor Kohn said about other interest   rates  But when I look at the low real rate now and at times in the past when it has been low and I   look at things like corporate borrowing rates then, they didn’t fall nearly as much as the fed funds   rate  If you plot them by lining up the NBER dates, it doesn’t look as though what’s happened now   with those borrowing rates is out of line with past experiences  So if we think now that real rates   were low in ’03, I’m led to conclude that I ought to think that they are low currently    Another way of saying this is that spreads always go up in recessions  We drive real rates   down in recessions  If consumers and businesses were spending with frenzy now because of low   rates, to me that would be a reason that we have to raise them, get them up right away  You know,   my sense of the economics of why we push real rates low in recessions is that the state of aggregate   demand needs it  It’s exactly when consumer and business spending is sort of moribund that we   have real rates low  I’m not sure that the fact that it’s moribund tells me whether they’re low or not   relative to where they ought to be  That’s how I think about that evidence, but I look forward to   being enlightened further in the future on this     I’ll dispense with the rest of my prepared remarks and just say that I   recognize the real risks ahead of us  We’ve experienced sluggish growth, and all the downside risks   to growth that have been enumerated are very tangible and very plausible right now  I think we   should hold off raising rates at this meeting, but I’m very concerned about the inflation risks  I find   myself leaning toward a tightening campaign earlier rather than later, and I’d like to see the   August 5, 2008 115 of 145    statement do what it can to prepare markets for that  I liked the first version of alternative B, the one   without the word “also”  I think “also” damps the concern about inflation  It kind of makes it a   little too balanced for my taste  I’m also concerned—I should say “broadly”— that we seem to   have left the impression over the past several months, since the beginning of the year, that our   concerns about inflation fluctuate  I agree with President Bullard  What we ought to view as ideal   is an equilibrium where inflation expectations are rock solid and don’t change and, moreover, that   people don’t perceive our concerns and worry about inflation or the weight we’re giving in policy   deliberations as shifting from time to time  So that’s an aspect of our communications that concerns   me  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The higher collateral requirement, is that   just Lehman?     Okay  I know there was a lot of concern going in yesterday about the   tri-party repo market, and I envisioned two scenarios and anything in between them  One is tri-  party lenders pulling away from particular names and moving their funds to other names    Another, at the other extreme, would be tri-party repo lenders pulling away from the market as a   whole  If you look at the tri-party repo market from the point of view of the borrowers, that is a   frightening scenario  Then the lenders are going to do something with that money  I have been   curious about what they would do  My understanding is that cash balances, in essentially deposit   accounts, piled up at State Street and BONY yesterday and that they were able to do tri-party   repos with some institutions that had been pulled away from  Is that a valid observation?  What   are the prospects for that providing some kind of resilience for the tri-party market?     So, if I can just follow up, my understanding is that tri-party repos are   exempt from the automatic stay, so it is not filing per se that is the risk  It’s the risk that they   don’t have the cash, right?     All right  Then a question about the TSLF  Is it this program in which   we provide Treasuries?     Remind me again how big the European system of central banks’ own   outright holdings of dollar balances are     Yes     Central banks     Right  The ECB—they all have their own dollar reserves     These are held at individual national central banks, so our swap lines to   them aren’t approaching that level yet, right?      Note here a sense of discomfort with our lending them dollars that they   already have and so our serving as a substitute for their mobilizing their own dollar reserves for   this purpose  Obviously, the demand could swamp their own reserves, and at that point I would   feel differently about this  But my understanding is that the distribution within the European   system of central banks is uneven, and in some sense this just provides them with a way to   circumvent negotiating how those dollars would be distributed from different central banks to   different private-sector banks within their own system  Broadly, I’m uncomfortable with our   playing that role   September 16, 2008 12 of 108      Could I hear a little more about the benefits of an open-ended   commitment?  All of our programs have been capped at a certain size  You said something about   “test the limits,” and it makes me think of foreign exchange regimes  What kind of scenario do you   have in mind?       September 16, 2008 16 of 108      So you will set a definite amount?     But we will communicate a program size?     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be brief  The Fifth District hasn’t changed   much; it pretty well aligns with the national outlook  On the national outlook, I find myself, all   except for the policy path, aligned well with the staff  There have been a lot of economic reports   since the last meeting about particular categories of spending or particular sectors of the economy,   September 16, 2008 46 of 108    but they net out to only a small change, if any, in the broad contour of the outlook for me for overall   growth  I expect it to be sluggish for the remainder of the year with recovery beginning at some   point in the first half of next year  I’ll commit the sin of saying that uncertainty is especially high   now  There seem to be reasonably plausible risks in the outlook in virtually every spending   category and, in many cases, on both sides of the outlook   About inflation, so far our credibility has helped to prevent a pickup in compensation   growth  In fact, it’s heartening that compensation growth is coming in a little below expected in   response to the energy price shock this year  This has allowed us to accomplish the inevitable   decline in real wages without setting off an inflationary acceleration in wage rates  But we’re still in   the midst of an upsurge in core inflation, which the Greenbook expects is going to tick up near   3 percent this quarter  As I said before, I think it’s critically important for us to emerge from this   episode without trend inflation ratcheting upward, and I’m not sure we can take the forecasted   moderation for granted  Inflation compensation has been well contained, and that has been   heartening  But I have also said this before—I think the current level of five-year, five-year-  forward inflation compensation seems more consistent with a trend above 2½ percent than it does   with a 2 percent trend  So I’m not convinced that there’s going to be much gravitational pull down   from an elevated rate once core rises  At the very least, I think there’s some uncertainty about that   For financial markets, this is yet another historic week, as President Rosengren remarked  I   think the questions facing financial market participants, the uncertainty they face, can be usefully   partitioned into three broad categories  One is the aggregate magnitude of fundamental losses that   the financial sector faces  Another is the location of those losses—where they are going to pop up   within financial intermediary sectors  The third is the likelihood and the magnitude of fiscal   transfers in the form of governmental support for particular firms  I think the weekend’s events   September 16, 2008 47 of 108    have caused financial market participants to revise their assessments of the future  It seems to me at   this early date in the process that the revision in the outlook has had more to do with the latter two   categories than with the aggregate size of fundamental losses we have coming down the pipeline    That is to say, it’s about where they’re popping up, which firms are affected and are going to be hit,   and about the likelihood of government support   What we did with Lehman I obviously think is good  It has had an effect on market   participants’ assessment of the likelihood of other firms getting support, and I think you would have   to attribute at least some of changes in equity prices to that  We’re likely to see a lot more   disruption this week and in the days going forward than we’ve seen so far  I don’t want to be   sanguine about it, but the silver lining to all the disruption that’s ahead of us is that it will enhance   the credibility of any commitment that we make in the future to be willing to let an institution fail   and to risk such disruption again  On the other hand, if the disruption proves less severe than we   expect, the silver lining is that that will strengthen our hand in the future as well  However, I would   note that I don’t think that what we did with Lehman has set a clear and firm boundary on the   circumstances under which government support is likely to be forthcoming  All the language   around not supporting Lehman was of a one-off nature  So I’m not sure about the extent to which   we’ve diminished uncertainty about the likelihood of support going forward, and I think that such   uncertainty is likely to exacerbate financial volatility in the months ahead until we can make more   progress on articulating a reasonably principled policy on when we’re going to intervene and when   we’re not, or at least enhancing clarity about that   Overall, I don’t take what’s happened in the last few days as changing much  It’s not   obvious to me what the implications are for the outlook for inflation and growth, at least at this   point  So I don’t see a reason to deflect from our policy path at this point  I can support standing   September 16, 2008 48 of 108    pat with the funds rate today  I think that’s a good idea  I think, looking forward, that we will want   to raise rates sooner rather than later if core inflation doesn’t moderate  I think we’re more likely to   require a path more like the August Greenbook than the current one  Thank you, Mr Chairman     We have a legislated program of fiscal intervention—deposit insurance—  and the boundaries around that are very clear  Which liabilities are insured and which ones are not   are very clear  Around the edges there’s some lack of clarity about what least-cost resolution means   and the extent to which deviations from that can be verified, and that provides some room for the   Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to deviate from that and implicitly to forbear to some extent    But even that is sort of a well-contained and well-defined government support  That’s what the   Congress has enacted, and it’s not clear to me whether we should go beyond that  Japan got down   to deposit insurance  Scandinavia did, too  That seems like a natural benchmark     Sure  Those were fiscal actions     And the FDIC does exactly that when it resolves a failed institution     Yes  I echo President Evans’s concern  My recollection is—and I   haven’t consulted the record recently—under your predecessor there was some phrasing like   “watch market developments closely” that came to be widely understood as a signal of an   intermeeting move     “Monitor closely” or some language like that     Yes, and that gives me pause  Then, about “market”—like a lot of   economists, I am willing to construe the word “market” very broadly to include intermediation   mechanisms of all types and the market for commercial credit in, you know, Dillon, South   Carolina  [Laughter]  But I am not sure that market participants are going to take it that broadly    They are going to take it in the sense of markets in traded financial instruments and organized   exchanges and such  I just wonder if they are going to interpret it too closely as Wall Street     Mr Chairman?     Including “closely,” what does that imply about the opposite?  I mean,   are we going to be able to take that out?       Yes, but this is an adjective       There goes my credibility  [Laughter]  If we take it out, can we use the   phrase without it?     So that means we have to throw this phrase out     Yes  What do we know about the time line for the implementation of the   Treasury’s program of insuring money market mutual funds and how that would work?     Now, Vice Chairman Geithner, does the recommendation likely to come   forward involve expanding or contracting the coverage?     But any change in the space of qualified commercial paper?     Yes  Wachovia was losing about $1 billion in deposits a day on average   over the past couple of weeks  They have liquidity to last under a calm scenario this week only until   maybe Thursday or Friday  They probably would have needed discount window borrowing in the   middle of the week; but given the news, they were affected by the WaMu closure because of what   that did to senior debt holders, and they began experiencing companies pulling away from them in   the middle of the day on Friday  So they were sort of caught up in the wake after WaMu  They   didn’t think they could survive without a lot of support today  So they were very committed to   doing something over the weekend  They have $64 billion plus in collateral, lendable value pledged   at the discount window  They have $125 billion outstanding at the TAF, some of that 28-day, some   of that in the two 84-day auctions, and we will leave them on primary credit, and they’ll retain that   TAF credit  We intend issuing an announcement later this morning that says something like, “In   support of this transition, the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond stands ready to provide liquidity   as needed”   So they have $52 billion in lendable value net of the TAF money  They have $150 billion in   uninsured deposits, and as for other numbers, the market cap at the end of the day Friday was a little   over $21 billion  Evergreen Investments, Wachovia Securities, and AG Edwards have a value of   about $12 billion  This leaves shareholders of the holding company with about $14 billion in value    Wachovia was trading at about $1 this morning after trading at about $10 per share last Friday  I’m   not sure people understand the Edwards and Evergreen part, but we’re monitoring the situation very   closely and have people on their desk right now     Yes, Brian  So at 50 basis points under the target rate for excess, it sounds   as though your philosophy here is just to limit the tails of the intraday funds rate distribution rather   than to attract a lot of funds and replace the Treasury program  Is that accurate?  I mean, how do   you intend to approach that question?     Bill, you said you were struck by the feeble reaction of markets to   expanding our credit programs?     So what would it have looked like for them to have taken much solace?  I   mean, what prices and quantities would change?   October 7, 2008 5 of 30      Could it be that some fundamentals are going on there that market   participants don’t view it as addressing?     I want to ask you about the LIBOR spread  It’s pretty striking, but I’m   wondering, Do you have data on the quantity of borrowing that’s going on in that market and what   that LIBOR figure really represents?  We have a bank in our District that reports on the LIBOR   panel but reports borrowing at 100 to 150 basis points below it     In that LIBOR panel, there are places where you can get individual banks’   reports  I haven’t looked in a week, but the last time I looked, the spread between the bottom bank   and the top bank was over 150 basis points   October 7, 2008 6 of 30      Okay  So the LIBOR–OIS spread may be misleading—not that sensitive   an indicator  If it goes up or down 50 basis points, we maybe shouldn’t read a lot into that     That is what I was getting at     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Economic growth has undoubtedly weakened   in the past two months, and that was getting me comfortable with a 2 percent funds rate  I don’t   have any objection to the cut in interest rates at this time  I am sympathetic to President Plosser’s   suggestion about the language about inflation  It is quite a swing from our previous language to   what we have in the draft here, although actually part of me likes the joint statement better  But I   can see the need for our own statement   About use of our balance sheet, it’s hard for me to see why it’s absolutely necessary for a   recovery  A lot of what we’ve done has been sold to us as insurance against the possibility of runs,   fire sales, margin spirals, or various theoretical possibilities that involve some inefficient devolution   October 7, 2008 23 of 30    of activity separate from fundamentals  If the fundamentals improve, it seems to me likely that   lending is going to return whether or not these facilities are in place  More broadly, I’m worried   about unwinding these  I’m afraid that it might be as difficult as it would be for the FDIC to reduce   their deposit insurance premium back from $250,000 to $100,000 after this  I think it would be   worthwhile, as we go on with financial markets in such turmoil, to reflect on whether what we’re   seeing is genuine fundamental uncertainty about counterparties and whether our lending is the   equivalent of pushing on a string, to use another metaphor from the Great Depression     Yes  President Geithner, you described the EMEs as motivated by a   desire to transform their reserves from illiquid Treasuries or from Treasuries to some more   fungible and more convenient form of dollars  That strongly suggests collateralizing their swap   October 28–29, 2008 21 of 206    line with the Treasuries rather than their own currency  What would be the disadvantage of   doing that?     But the point that President Evans made is that we’re not constraining   them to not withdraw the reserves       Or we could lend to them, collateralized by the Treasuries rather than by   their own currency     I have a question for the staff  You noted that the countries believed that   this would help market confidence  So the choice of extending a line is potentially consequential   here  I have a two-part question  First, what do you think the risk is of the uncertainty surrounding   whether particular other countries will or will not in the future be able to obtain a swap line from the   Federal Reserve?  Second, what would you suggest that we say if asked by the public or if the   Chairman is asked in the Congress about what criteria or principles we used to draw the line   between the countries that have swap lines and those that don’t?  I know that you posed the question   to us, but what would you suggest that we say?   October 28–29, 2008 32 of 206      And the first part of my question?     What sort of uncertainty might this engender about the likelihood of other   countries qualifying?  My recollection is that many economists have claimed that the IMF had this   trouble in the 1990s, when interventions would give rise to uncertainty about subsequent   interventions in other cases     I’m just wondering about the uncertainty that might be created about the   lack of clarity about who’s in, whether this is the final list, and so on     Mr Chairman     Do we have time for a brief question for the Manager about the funds   market?  It has behaved a little unusually in the last period     Thank you, Mr Chairman—I appreciate this  I have a three-part question    As you said in your presentation, the effective funds rate (the average of brokered transactions) has   been below the interest rate on reserves, and there are all of these institutions that apparently aren’t   eligible to earn interest on reserves  One, what’s the policy reason for excluding them from   eligibility for interest on reserves?  I understand the policy reason for excluding them from credit,   but this is the opposite, and so I’m not quite sure why we screen them out  Second, as I read the   data on your operations, it seems to me as though we have added enough reserves to drive the funds   rate virtually down to the interest rate on reserves  I want to know if that’s a fair characterization of   the state of open market operations and the funds rate  Third, I’m interested in knowing, especially   if that’s true, why don’t we just give up and say that the interest rate on reserves is our target rate?     Excuse me  Without interest rates on reserves, there’s that spread plus a   scarcity factor, and we’ve essentially driven that scarcity factor down to zero—that’s how I meant   the question     I understand that     In the forecast, the federal funds rate goes to 50 basis points, and I take it   that’s essentially as low as you think it can go  You treat that as sort of the lower bound on nominal   interest rates  Is that right?     Well, whatever that lower bound is, I have a question that’s kind of   hypothetical  I wasn’t a member of the Committee five years ago  My understanding, though, is   that much thought was given to how we would conduct monetary policy if we needed to reduce the   nominal federal funds rate to zero or its effective equivalent  My understanding is that the general   October 28–29, 2008 57 of 206    conclusion—and my understanding is that this is mainstream economists’ general view as well—is   that the way we would do that would be to expand the monetary base, perhaps by buying assets   outside the normal range of assets that we would buy  Now, the first question is, Is that correct?    Then I have a follow-up     The reason I ask is that my understanding is that the strategy of expanding   the monetary base would work through increasing inflation or reducing deflation     My understanding is that economists such as Woodford and others who   have studied this believe that, by using monetary assets to purchase other assets, we can make the   price level and thus the inflation rate higher than it otherwise would be  Is that a fair understanding?     The mechanism Friedman sketched ultimately produces a proportionate   increase in the price level, doesn’t it?     Right     Well, the reason I ask all of this is that, with an interest rate on reserves   above zero, that’s effectively equivalent to a zero lower bound on nominal interest rates  So we are   effectively doing this quantitative easing      Right  So the thought that sparks is that, if the mechanism involves   creating inflation, then I’d wonder what checks we have on the scale of open market operations now   to ensure that we’re not, by expanding our balance sheet as much as we have, risking an increase in   inflation     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Business and consumer sentiment in the   Fifth District has deteriorated markedly  Even though economic conditions were already   decelerating heading into our September meeting, a discrete shift in outlook seems to have   occurred  It seems to me to have originated during the week of September 15 or shortly   thereafter  Our business contacts express anxiety about the national economy, and they express   uncertainty about the meaning for their firms’ prospects of the astonishing sequence of events   that began unfolding that week  Both consumers and firms have been increasingly unwilling to   make long-term commitments and engage in discretionary expenditures  Consumers are   delaying large and discretionary expenditures  Firms have adopted a wait-and-see attitude on   investments   October 28–29, 2008 75 of 206    Our regional survey released this morning shows a substantial drop in business conditions   as well  Our business survey respondents report that obtaining business loans is more difficult   than three months ago, and there are widespread reports of lenders tightening credit terms and   seeking to reduce exposures  Most respondents, however, also indicated that they would still be   able to satisfy their borrowing needs  When you listen to bankers, they will tell you that they are   tightening standards, but they also report that they are still extending credit to solid borrowers   with high-quality deals   I find it difficult right now to pin down the real effects of the financial market turmoil of   the last few weeks  As the Greenbook notes, assessing such effects “poses significant   identification challenges”  Specifically, it is hard to disentangle the effects of the increased cost   of bank capital from those of the deterioration in the economic environment facing borrowers    Personally, I suspect the latter are playing the more prominent role in the tightening of credit   terms right now   Looking on the bright side, the near-term inflation picture has eased noticeably since our   September meeting, mainly because of the decline in oil and other commodity prices  The   Greenbook carries this moderation into its long-term forecast, where PCE inflation now   converges to 1 percent in 2013  I did a double-take when I saw that—it had me wondering   whether the Greenbook was ghost-written this month by President Plosser  [Laughter]    Whoever’s forecast it is, the longer-term projected moderation in inflation relies heavily on the   opening-up of a large and persistent output gap  In the current circumstances, I am not sure how   plausible that story is  In particular, I have been struggling with how to think about the effect of   credit market disruptions on the concept of potential output  To the extent that we think of these   disruptions as analogous to shocks to intermediation technology—and that is what the models of   October 28–29, 2008 76 of 206    these kinds of credit channel effects generally tell you to do—it seems to me that we should see   them as pulling down potential as well as actual output  I believe this point has been made at   previous meetings  We have also talked before about the tenuous nature of the Phillips curve   relationship, and it is difficult to forecast  The slope is sort of flat  We had been scheduled to   discuss inflation dynamics, and we postponed that, for good reasons I believe  I hope we can get   back to it soon because I think it’s going to be relevant to how we see our way through this  In   any event, I think we should be careful not to be overly optimistic about the forecast of an   inflation decline driven by a large output gap  The shift in the Greenbook’s long-term inflation   projection is noteworthy for another reason, I believe  We are getting closer to a 1 percent target   federal funds rate, and we may actually reach 1 percent at some meeting soon  The last time this   happened it sparked a widespread discussion of and concern about the zero lower bound on   nominal interest rates   I want to make a couple of related observations  First, a key to conducting monetary   policy at the zero bound is being able to keep inflation expectations from falling and thereby   increasing real interest rates  From this perspective, the revision of the Greenbook’s forecast   from 17 percent one meeting ago to 10 percent for five-year-ahead inflation implies that we run   a monetary policy regime in which five-year-ahead expected inflation varies pretty significantly   in response to contemporaneous shocks  I don’t think that variability in long-run inflation   projections can help our ability to manage inflation expectations at the zero bound  We’d be   better if we ran a policy in which long-run expected inflation was more anchored, more stable    You can tell where I’m going with this, I’m sure  This highlights the value of an explicit   inflation objective as well as the value of being able to communicate clearly about how we view   the functioning of monetary policy at the zero bound  Second, I will just note briefly that the   October 28–29, 2008 77 of 206    economics of monetary policy at the zero bound are closely related to the economics of paying   interest on reserves at close to the target rate  In fact, if I’m not mistaken, they are virtually   identical  I think progress on both fronts would be useful right now   Finally, let me just comment on financial market conditions  My sense is that what the   public has seen—the large failures, the variety of resolution techniques, the deliberations leading   up to the Congress’s adoption of the bill it adopted—taken together have added up to significant   pessimism on people’s parts and have altered optimal strategy for a lot of financial institutions    So I think that is altering how people allocate portfolios and has led to further volatility in certain   markets  It has led some institutions to adopt a wait-and-see attitude, to see how particular   programs are going to be implemented  I think that we are seeing at least some dead-weight loss   associated with the burdens of shifting financial flows between things that are covered and things   that aren’t and we are seeing a good deal of rent-seeking behavior as well  What we are seeing is   going to have the effect of masking the evolution of underlying fundamentals  It is going to   make it harder to see our way through this and understand just what is happening  I think that is   going to be a thicket that we will need to cut through in the months ahead  That concludes my   comments, Mr Chairman     If I could, Mr Chairman, in the dynamic stochastic general equilibrium   models, one of which I understand has been adopted by the staff for use in forecasting, employment   fluctuates with shocks to productivity, and it’s the natural correspondent to that  So in some sense   the unemployment rate rises because the natural rate rises, but that’s a way of saying that the natural   rate goes up in recessions  I’m not sure if proponents of the natural rate view that as consistent with   that old model, but that’s what happens in these models     Right  You need some matching model, and you get intersectoral flows    You get the same thing     Mr Chairman?     I would just echo that  I have heard the same thing from bankers in our   District—just vociferous complaints about lowering rates because their loan rates go down but   their cost of funds doesn’t     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The economic outlook has definitely   deteriorated  On top of the slowing at the beginning of the third quarter, a sequence of policy   actions and statements has spread an inchoate fear  In response to that, a wide variety of   economic agents have delayed outlays  The breathtaking credit market interventions that we   have undertaken in the last several weeks are going to make it hard to judge whether those   markets are stabilized  It is going to make it even harder to judge how and when to withdraw     Governor Duke asked rhetorically what it would take for recovery to begin  I think it is   not going to be a very healthy recovery unless we have made substantial progress toward   withdrawing these interventions  I know it’s probably premature in the midst of a crisis to be   talking about the recovery, but a number of people did, and I think it makes sense on the grounds   that President Plosser advanced for us to be thinking ahead  President Geithner talked about the   October 28–29, 2008 137 of 206    will and the desire and that it amounts to a matter of will to reverse course later on  I think that   in withdrawing these subsidies and these credit market interventions is where we are going to   need the will  It is going to be really hard to disenfranchise somebody who now has access to   one of these programs   The inflation outlook has improved  Expected inflation has come down  A couple of   people have noted that  That brings the real rate where the interest rate is now—to about zero    So I can favor a 50 point reduction in the federal funds rate target at this meeting  I think a funds   rate that is, in real terms as best as we can measure it, about minus 1 percent is how we should   see our way through here, at least in the near term  Like President Evans, I will mention the   1930s  What I take from my reading of the Great Depression is that this is what central banks   should do in times like this—keep real interest rates low   Let me make a couple of brief observations  As I mentioned yesterday, I think we are   going to face a challenge communicating about our strategy  If we need to reduce interest rates   to the lowest practical level to which we feel we can reduce them, I think yesterday’s discussion   suggests that the Committee could use a refresher course on the monetary economics of the zero   bound  I applaud President Bullard for his breaking new ground by providing a figure from the   Journal of Economic Theory  [Laughter]     I want to put something on the table about the federal funds rate  We are voting today on   the target for the federal funds rate  The way our operations are conducted now, we are leaving   so many excess reserves in the system that we are driving the federal funds rate down to the   interest rate on reserves  The interbank risk premium is likely to become small as the FDIC   guarantee becomes well understood and more broadly effective  The GSEs are likely to catch on   that they deserve more on their funds  Small banks, as Governor Duke says, that haven’t really   October 28–29, 2008 138 of 206    paid attention to what this new regime is about are going to find that brokers are going to be able   to find them placements at closer to the interest rate on reserves  So I think that the sloppy   trading below the interest rate on reserves is going to fade over time  As long as we have excess   reserves at the scale that we do, as long as the Desk has added that many reserves, we are going   to have the effective federal funds rate at the interest rate on reserves  Because we are voting on   the federal funds target rate, I think that the Committee ought to have some understanding from   the staff that either excess reserves are going to be drawn down to the point that the effective rate   is lifted off the interest rate on the reserves floor or—and this would be my preferable course of   action—we raise the interest rate on reserves to equal the target rate  Otherwise, we are voting   on something, but we are actually doing something else  I can understand the desire to err on the   side of soft rates  This is what we did in August 2007  But as rates go down, we need to be   more and more careful about what the Committee is actually voting on     Yes, I also strongly support your charge and direction to the staff to   assemble with all due haste updated information for the Committee about what the effective lower   bound on nominal interest rates is  But I’d urge you, along the lines of what President Plosser   suggested, to include in that charge what we would do once we got there, what we could do, and   what would be open to us  I emphasize again the relevance even if we don’t get there because   analytically we’re effectively doing that right now with interest on reserves  The classic economics   of this is that, when you get down to effective equivalence between a monetary asset and a   government bond of one-day duration or whatever, to be effective monetary policy needs to be   fiscal policy  It needs to acquire other assets that we wouldn’t normally otherwise acquire  We’re   doing that right now  So I’d emphasize the importance and relevance of that     That’s a calculation that embeds risk neutrality into the extrapolation?     Doesn’t that depend on the assumption about the correlation between—     First, about the risk premium, it’s either a lot of pessimism or a lot of   correlation between defaults and bad states of the world and essentially low growth  The second   thing, I took a look at the student-loan-asset-backed securities that you talked about—FFELP  I   think you have a chart here  It turns out that the trusts are guaranteed a rate of return equal to the   commercial paper rate, and any excess over that they have to return to the Department of Education    They get a payment if the return is below that  Your coupon is 200 points above LIBOR, and   LIBOR is trading a bit above commercial paper rates, right?  So there’s a negative spread built into   the trust documents  They’re paying 300 basis points more than they’re earning on the trust  So a   little extra premium seems pretty reasonable  Is my understanding of that security correct, Bill?     Well, wouldn’t investors want to discount or take into account the fact that   the trust, which is their only source of payment, is earning about 300 basis points less than the   coupon?  Wouldn’t that show up in a higher premium on what the investor is willing to pay?     Okay     But the Department of Education doesn’t guarantee LIBOR plus a 200   basis point coupon  It guarantees the commercial paper rate     That still doesn’t seem that irrationally priced  Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Let me echo your comments about the   staff’s work  They have provided us with a very comprehensive compendium of research and   experiences relevant to the policy problems that we are facing now  And they have presented it   in a surprisingly digestible form, all things considered  [Laughter]  This was no small feat, as   you and Brian noted, given the other demands on the staff’s time over the past few months   Clearly, as you said, Mr Chairman, this is a critical moment for the Fed and the   economy  Whatever we do and say at this meeting is going to mark a discrete change in the way   we have conducted policy and communicated about it to the public in recent years  Some of this   change, as has been noted, is already under way  We exhausted our ability to sterilize the   additional reserves created through credit expansion at about the same time we implemented   interest on excess reserves  Beginning with this meeting, we have to articulate how we would   December 15–16, 2008 30 of 284    intend to conduct monetary policy and pursue the goals of our dual mandate with the funds rate   at a very, very low level, perhaps zero, and perhaps for a very extended period of time   Before addressing specifically the questions that Brian has laid out for us, I want to make   clear what I think is one of the central issues at hand, and that is the Committee’s control over   the monetary base and its conduct of monetary policy  When we target the fed funds rate at any   rate above zero, we instruct the Desk to manage reserves or, equivalently, the monetary base so   as to keep the effective funds rate at our target  Monetary policy has always been about   controlling the base, and this continues to be true at the zero lower bound on interest rates  In   fact, the path of the monetary base is even more critical at the zero bound because that is how we   prevent deflation  By managing the public’s expectations about future base growth and future   inflation, we manage current real rates and influence real activity  In essence, we prevent   deflation by convincing the public that future base growth will be inconsistent with a falling   price level   Just as a thought experiment, imagine that we commit to keeping interest rates at the zero   bound for an extremely long time period, say infinitely  If we do that—this is a clear result from   the literature—it does not prevent a deflationary equilibrium  But if we can commit to keeping   the monetary base at a finite level, not falling, then that does rule out a deflationary equilibrium    So it is key that expectations about the base, not just nominal interest rates, are vital for our   ability to prevent a deflationary equilibrium   I think that focusing on the monetary base is going to help communication, and the   reason is that a lot of people out there might not understand the relationship between credit   spreads and growth or inflation or various other things that we are doing  But in almost   everyone’s mind is the phrase “too much money chasing too few goods”  It provides, for a lot of   December 15–16, 2008 31 of 284    people, an intuitive link between money and inflation, and I think we—for all the warts of our   policy in the early 1980s under Chairman Volcker—exploited that well, to convey to the public   that we were committed to bringing inflation down in a simple, intuitive way  I think that can   help us now, analogously, in convincing the public that we are going to be able to prevent   deflation because we control money     The Committee’s management of the base or bank reserves is distinct, in my view—as   you noted, Mr Chairman—from the initiatives that use our balance sheet to target specific   financial market spreads  Credit market programs may have macroeconomic effects  Indeed,   that is their intended effect—to have beneficial macroeconomic effects on growth and inflation    It is the same as other fiscal policy initiatives that also may have macroeconomic effects  But   they are not monetary policy, and I think that is fairly clear   This Committee, I take it as given, is responsible for monetary policy  At the end of the   day, monetary policy is about controlling the monetary base or bank reserves  From the point of   view of FOMC policy, what is important about the nonstandard tools and credit market programs   is their effect on the monetary base  Again, to make this contrast stark, a policymaker   controlling spreads cannot prevent deflation  A monetary policy maker controlling the base can    I should note that the ability to pay interest on reserves means that we face this issue generically,   whether or not the funds rate is zero, because now, with interest on reserves, we can vary the   monetary base independently of how we vary the federal funds rate  This makes it even more   important that we make this transition in a way that clarifies the Committee’s role   Turning now to Brian’s questions, I think the most important one is number 7, the one   about the directive to the Desk  I believe that, if the directive is not going to specify a numerical   target for the funds rate, then we need to find a way to specify some numerical target or range for   December 15–16, 2008 32 of 284    the growth in the monetary base or the growth in bank reserves  Now, I realize that the directive   is to the Desk, which has control over the SOMA account, and under a strict constructionist   interpretation, that doesn’t necessarily equal the quantity of the monetary base  In fact, the   discrepancy has gotten fairly large now with all of these credit programs  But if the Committee   doesn’t provide direction about the interest rate, that is fixed at a floor, and if the Committee   doesn’t provide direction about a monetary aggregate, the Committee really isn’t doing monetary   policy, in my view  The Committee can also choose specific asset categories for the Desk to buy   for the System Open Market Account, but that shouldn’t be confused with monetary policy as   long as the monetary base is being determined at the margin by our credit programs  To put it   slightly differently, individual Reserve Banks can propose their own credit programs, subject to   the Board of Governors’ approval  But if they want to monetize those assets, then I would   expect that the Committee’s prior approval would be required if an alteration in the base target   were needed  That is what I would propose for the directives   Question 8 flows directly from question 7  What we should communicate is that we are   targeting a quantity of the monetary base or bank reserves, and this communication should be   made in a way that is broadly similar to the way we talk about interest rate policy, stating that   our goals are for growth in the monetary base that supports the achievement of sustainable real   growth and our medium-term goal for inflation   Question 3 also deals with communication, but more from the point of view of the funds   rate path  I think in the present environment we should communicate that we anticipate that it   will be near zero for some time—or something to that effect  Regarding part B of question 3,   instead of citing the risk of deflation, I think we should presume some measure of success and   communicate that we intend to use the growth of reserves to minimize the risk of inflation   December 15–16, 2008 33 of 284    running below our medium-term inflation goal  Regarding part C, I think we should stick to   communicating our goals for inflation   Questions 4 and 5 are about the means by which we grow our balance sheet and the   monetary base, and I think the Committee should strive to maintain as much distance as possible   from credit allocation  To me that means trying to have as little effect as possible on relative   prices among nonmonetary assets, and I say that because I don’t think we really know enough to   second-guess those outcomes  So I would like to see us focus on long-term Treasuries   Let me close with a few remarks about the Committee  In the 1920s, each individual   Reserve Bank made open market operation decisions on its own, in an uncoordinated way  That   proved ineffective, and at times we were operating at cross-purposes, one Reserve Bank selling   while another was buying  In response, the Conference of Presidents formed the Open Market   Investment Committee to coordinate our decisions and make all the purchases through the good   offices of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York  But the role of the Board of Governors in that   Committee was unclear  In fact, the Board at times tried to order the Open Market Investment   Committee to do things that the presidents didn’t want it to do, and they came to an impasse    This was remedied with the legislation of the 1930s that created the Federal Open Market   Committee     Now we do things that weren’t envisioned then, that’s for sure  But, surely, the guiding   principle there was that they wanted one single governance body in the Federal Reserve System   to be responsible for the monetary conditions in our country, and I take that to be the guiding   spirit of the FOMC as well  This is the only body in the Federal Reserve System in which we all   come together as one and subject ourselves to the discipline of listening to each other’s different   views and forming a workable consensus on the way forward  I agree, Mr Chairman, that we   December 15–16, 2008 34 of 284    shouldn’t be splitting hairs about legal niceties about who is responsible for what  I agree   wholeheartedly that we should work toward consensus for that, and that is why I think the   Committee has to have a serious role in monetary policy  I don’t think that focusing the   Committee’s decisions on just what the System Open Market Account does and leaving all these   other programs to have whatever affect they might on the base is the right way forward  Thank   you     First, let me say that there are models and sets of policy rules under   which in the short run there is an irrelevance proposition, a kind of Modigliani–Miller theorem,   about exchanges of monetary assets for short-term liquid securities that are virtually perfect   substitutes and at the zero lower bound are definitely perfect substitutes  So that is definitely   true  The point I made about the base in the long run is true as well  It has to do with   eliminating certain possible conjectures that the public might make about our willingness to   tolerate deflation  In the Japanese case, they were widely known to be quite eager to lift interest   rates  It was known that they viewed the problems in the banking sector as exacerbated by low   interest rates  They thought that raising real interest rates would provide more discipline and   force more restructuring in the banking system  So they continually had to fight to keep the long   end of the yield curve down  I don’t view that experience as providing the best evidence about   what a firm commitment to preventing deflation could be     That is a very good question  We don’t have any models to draw on   because we don’t have any data that would allow us to uncover a structural relationship between   spreads and the quantity of the base  In any event, even were we to focus solely on our primary   objectives for growth and inflation, I think we would have trouble there  I think we would have   a great deal of difficulty figuring out a quantitative relationship between the monetary base at the   zero bound and our objectives  But we started the way we usually do things—without a serious   quantitative understanding of the relationship between the funds rate and growth and inflation,   and we groped and groped and found our way  We are going to grope and try to find our way in   this new regime, and we are going to have to think hard about it and make some guesses—by   trial and error—just the way we learned how to do funds rate targeting      Thank you, Mr Chairman  Our staff does such a fine job  Maybe my   hearing is going, but I missed the names of our staff presenters  Can we get them introduced to   us?       Great  Thank you very much  I have a question for Stephanie  You   know, they do such a great job       Maybe it is a southern thing, I don’t know  [Laughter]  The sectoral   reallocation is really intriguing, and it is something that I have been curious about in this whole   episode  The measure is not one I am familiar with  It is one for which you count each industry   as a unit, right?     And housing always goes down in a recession     Yes  So it is sort of a bummer that these go up in the recession if you   are trying to measure what is happening to the NAIRU  But I always thought of the phrase   “sectoral reallocation” as having to do with the theories of the business cycle in which cyclical   downturns are caused by an unexpected decline in a given industry that causes resources to shift   out of that industry and that it takes time for them to be absorbed into some other industry  From   that point of view—if you are trying to measure that component as opposed to policy-induced,   widespread declines in activity—I would think you would want not to take out the cyclical part    I am thinking about housing  We devoted a lot of resources to housing in 2005, much less now    Those resources thrown on the market, in fact, are the proximal cause of the initial downturn in   employment growth  A lot of ancillary industries are related, so I would think that, if we didn’t   take out the usual housing cyclical thing, which is really sharp in the early periods, you would   see a bigger rise here       Yes, yes  I guess it is also related to how you think about the NAIRU    To some extent, if unemployment goes up in recessions, then what unemployment is supposed to   be goes up in recessions as well, it seems  I have a question about the first exhibit  It is the first   set of exhibits  It is also about commercial paper  Would you folks encourage us to view the   improvement that has taken place in the A2/P2 market as a measure of how the A1/P1 market   might have improved had we not intervened?  It is sort of a baseline, right?  It is like the control   group     What sort of spillovers from our intervention in A1/P1 do we expect   perhaps to have influenced or to have led to an improvement in A2/P2?     So their willingness to buy A2/P2 may have been affected by another   program, not the CP one  You are saying the money market fund program—     So we can’t separate the individual programs     Well, you wouldn’t expect speculation about imminent extension of the   program to A2/P2 to support the overnight rate for A2/P2 unless they expect it to be implemented   overnight  A question about strains  To what extent are we able to disentangle whether the market   is strained or the issuers are strained?     But you don’t observe investors’ expected defaults themselves     So you are saying that this paper is underpriced  Is that how you measure   strains?  I am always curious as to what strains mean     Thanks  Great job     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The economic news since the last meeting has   certainly been grim, and our presentation today bore that out  Our directors and other District   contacts are quite gloomy, and their reports are also consistent with a broad-based pullback in   discretionary outlays by consumers and firms   In these circumstances with the funds rate around 1/8 percent, it is hard to see a benefit of   prolonging any further reduction  I agree with the staff analysis that any potential dislocation in   money market institutions is likely to be minor, and I observe that, to the extent that money market   institutions provide value to the economy in the form of circumvention of prohibitions on interest   and other legal restrictions on financial arrangements, the traditional welfare analysis would count   their demise as a benefit rather than a cost  But I have to admit I haven’t tried explaining that to a   money market fund manager  [Laughter]   The hard question now, I think, concerns the possibility of deflation  We have seen negative   overall inflation since energy prices peaked in July—it was 18 percent for the PCE at an annual rate   since then and 4½ percent before today’s release for the CPI—and the core indexes have softened   notably as well  I still think we are going to be able to avoid this fairly easily, but I do not think the   risk is negligible  It is one of the most dangerous prospects we face right now, and we have to pay   very close attention to it  The reason I think it is going to be easy to avoid is that we have seen   declines in core inflation before when energy prices fell—mid-2005 and late 2006 are recent   December 15–16, 2008 130 of 284    examples  Further, compensation growth does not yet appear to be slowing rapidly, although those   data are fairly dated and so it is hard to sense what the last couple of months are going to look like    The key to avoiding deflation, of course, is our ability to shape expectations about the future course   of monetary policy  I had a spirited discussion about this last night over salad with Governor Kohn   and Mr Eggertsson  This is essentially what all the models tell you—that staying out of a   deflationary equilibrium requires commitment to paths for the monetary base that are inconsistent   with a steadily falling price level and that commitment to keeping the nominal interest rate low is   not sufficient   Now, it is sort of hard to get a handle on this  It took me a while, but the key to thinking   about this is that models with Taylor-type rules embed within them the perfect credibility of   inflation returning in the long run or over a medium term to the targeted rate that is built into the   Taylor reaction function  If instead you take those models and just allow arbitrary fiscal and   monetary policy rules, that is when you are forced to face the result that committing to an infinite   series of zero nominal rates is not sufficient and that you have to keep a monetary aggregate from   declining along with the price level   One way to think about this is that it is just like preventing inflation  To prevent inflation,   we have to prevent expectations that the value of money will fall in the future  To rule that out, we   have to rule out expectations that the quantity of money is going to rise continually, and we do that   with interest rates  This line of reasoning is different from the reasoning you get in a Phillips curve   with purely backward-looking expectations, where you have a recursive relationship between real   growth and inflation  Instead, in any model with a little forward-looking stuff, you have   expectations driving things  Preventing deflation is the same thing—preventing expectations that   the value of money will rise indefinitely  To do that you need to prevent expectations that the   December 15–16, 2008 131 of 284    quantity of money will fall indefinitely, and you would like to do that with low interest rates, but   you cannot at the zero bound  So you have to influence expectations about the future course of the   base  This to me is the simple intuition for that  All of this is just to suggest that our ability to   communicate is going to be crucial     “Time-inconsistent” is another way to say that they require commitment       Right  You could target the inflation rate not falling  I mean, we don’t   have to go all the way  This is the subtle thing about this  I think the pure Taylor rule overstates our   credibility, but people do not think that we are going to follow it perfectly  They don’t have very   diffuse priors over what policies  We are somewhere in-between, and I think bolstering that   credibility is important  Something I was going to say in the policy round—given that we haven’t   announced a target, we ought to try that first  That comes first, before saying that we are going to   move our target up for a little while     No, I do not think so  The point I was making about the base is that none   of those is sufficient to rule out deflation without specifying what the base is     You said “has been”?  [Laughter]     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Brian, the first sentence in alternative B   says, “The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to establish a target range for the   federal funds rate of 0 to ¼ percent”  In the staff analysis of various options for implementing   interest on excess reserves, I think option 4 was the one that is closest to the reality of what we   are implementing now—just a straight interest rate on excess reserves and an overprovision of   reserves to drive it down to the floor  In that analysis, the staff anticipated that it would be a   floor, which it turned out not to be  But it anticipated that, with that floor in place, the effective   funds rate would generally be above the floor, and it envisioned choosing a rate on excess   reserves ¼ point below our target rate  So do you envision in this that we would have to take any   measures if suddenly the downward forces on the effective rate would bring the funds rate   above ¼?  Or is this just under the supposition that it would take a while and that it is unlikely to   get above ¼?  You see, back in the early analysis there were forces that you believed would lead   it above ¼, so I am wondering how you are thinking about it     Okay  Well, the reason I ask is that I am a little hesitant to set an upper   bound on a range without understanding what sort of mechanism we would have for making that   credible  That is why I asked about that  Two more questions  One, the word “zero”—can you   help me understand the thinking about why we should be a little averse to using that word?     Okay  One final question  We, in the late 1970s, adopted a set of   guidelines regarding agency debt and modified that in the late 1990s  I don’t have a copy with   me  I think the latest adoption of that was January 2003, and I believe it is permanent  I think it   is still in effect  I think it states that our purchases are not intended to channel funds to any   specific sector  I am wondering about the staff’s interpretation of the consistency between our   GSE debt and agency-guaranteed MBS purchases, and that guidance     They do seem inconsistent, though, and I think it is something, Mr   Chairman, that we ought to consider     Thanks  It would be good to have that public  It is a public document,   is it not?  Or it is not a public document yet  It is on the Committee records, right?     Okay  It would be nice to have that in conformance with what we are   actually doing  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I appreciate that     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Given the dismal state of the economy, and   with the funds rate averaging around 1/8 percent anyway, I don’t see any reason to wait to bring   the fed funds rate down to effectively zero  I agree with the staff analysis that any dislocation of   the money funds is likely to be minor  My board put in for a 75 basis point cut in the discount   rate  When I looked over at my small bankers, I was afraid one of them was going to throw a   shoe at me  [Laughter]  I escaped that     So I support alternative A  I think it makes sense to deemphasize the   funds rate target  For reasons that were illuminated by Brian earlier and reasons that Governor   Duke alluded to as well, I don’t think a target range is useful  We don’t want to discourage hope   among our community bankers that we might get above ¼ percent should conditions normalize   to some degree  We do set an interest rate on excess reserve balances, or more precisely, the   Committee’s reduction in the federal funds rate target reduces the rate on excess reserves, given   the Board’s adopted formula for setting the excess reserves rate  We have a similar sort of   governance disconnect between the discount rate approval decisions of the Board of Governors   and the federal funds rate decisions taken by the Federal Open Market Committee  We have   managed to coordinate those very effectively, with cohesion and with consensus  It seems to me   to make sense to take the same approach to the excess reserves rate   I like the language in alternative A, paragraph 3, where we abandon the target and   indicate that the funds rate is likely to be near zero for a while  The conditionality, the way it is   expressed there or in B4, is fine with me  I like the idea of shifting attention to the interest rate   on reserves by including the statement in the related actions sentence of A5; that further cements   the governance coordination that we have in mind there   December 15–16, 2008 174 of 284    I think it makes eminent sense to be very explicit very soon about our numerical   objective for inflation  Monetary policy at the zero bound is all about discouraging expectations   of deflation  If we haven’t tried first announcing an explicit objective for inflation, we don’t   have any excuses if we fail to prevent a fall into a deflationary equilibrium  But I am   sympathetic to the notion that it might not be best to slip it in the statement in the dead of night   without any fanfare  It might encourage the view that it is a temporary expedient and that we   might abandon this language in some future statement, should we find it convenient  I think it   would be better to do this and issue a separate statement very clearly articulating that the   Committee has adopted a numerical inflation objective, here is what it means, here is how we   interpret it, and here is why we do it  Perhaps January would be the right time to do that, and we   could, between now and then, lay the groundwork for a clearer and more forceful   communication  I think it is likely to have a bigger effect on financial market participants and   the public should we do so  Without that statement about an objective, the sentence that   precedes it—specifically the phrase that is in brackets in A2—is a little scary  So I would prefer   to leave that bracketed thing out if we are not going to include the inflation objective   The fourth paragraph in alternative A and the corresponding paragraphs in B and C   discuss how we are going to conduct monetary policy while the funds rate is at zero  I think they   are intended to signal a shift toward quantitative measures, but I found the language ambiguous   and confusing  None says anything about the monetary base  None says anything about the size   of our balance sheet  In other words, they don’t indicate that the credit programs wouldn’t be   sterilized  I think the phrase “use our balance sheet” is ambiguous  It doesn’t necessarily mean   expand the size; it could mean put some stuff on it  So I would like to see us find a way to   December 15–16, 2008 175 of 284    improve the clarity of the language in paragraph 4 regarding the quantitative measures that I   think it is intended to communicate   That paragraph also mentions two programs  the agency debt purchases, which we talked   about earlier—let me set that aside—and the TALF, which the Committee has not been asked to   formally consider and approve  Now, I can appreciate the strict constructionist governance view   of who gets to approve them; it is not important that we vote on them  But I have been thinking   about this in terms of the ideal—the vision you portrayed and described for us yesterday of a   cohesive consensus-building decisionmaking process  I compared the TALF and what the   Committee has heard about it  Contrast that with the deliberations we gave to the extension of   foreign exchange swap lines to emerging-market countries  There were fairly extensive briefing   memorandums provided to the Committee, and there was a fairly lengthy discussion of that step    In contrast, we were basically informed about the TALF rather than consulted in any meaningful   sense   Part of the problem here is that this paragraph conflates the use of our balance sheet with   expansions of the base, and these are two distinct policy actions  In the current circumstance,   unsterilized lending does increase the base  But we have been doing these programs since before   that was true, and the distinction doesn’t come through clearly in the language here  There is a   tension here because a couple of different plausible theories are floating around about how this   stuff affects the economy and our objectives and how things are going to work at the zero bound    I am not sure that we are going to settle on a single theory  In fact, I am sure that we are not   going to settle on a single theory  But we should strive, in the interest of consensus, for a   statement that encompasses a range of plausible views  We have done that in the past in   December 15–16, 2008 176 of 284    finessing things like different views of the Phillips curve and the like, and I would urge us to try   to do that here rather than take a monolithic approach   Finally, let me say something about the directive  The new drafts of A, B, and C add a   sentence, the operative words of which are “keep the Committee informed,” and it is that the   Secretary and the System Open Market Account Manager would keep the Committee informed    This is somewhat short of the language you used yesterday, which admittedly might not be   appropriate for the directive  But I wrote the language down, and it is that the Board would bring   programs to the FOMC for review and discussion  I like the sentence that is added in the sense   that it is a step in the right direction toward your vision of a collaborative body seeking   consensus on these issues  But I am afraid that this language won’t do much to dispel questions   that have arisen in the press about our governance cohesion and decisionmaking  So I personally   would prefer to go as far as we could in that direction  Thank you very much, Mr Chairman       Other things pull it down     Excellent  Thank you   December 15–16, 2008 177 of 284      Thank you  Mr Chairman, I do like the “increase” statement, and I   think we could easily explain that we are looking at a partial differential effect     The statement doesn’t have to stand for the whole first quarter, does it?     Well, each facility makes the balance sheet bigger than it otherwise   would be   December 15–16, 2008 178 of 284      Well, I have in mind here the confusion that some around this table have   reported hearing from the public about what we are doing with our balance sheet  I think   acknowledging that it is expanding in size would be an important feature     Mr Chairman?     Just a thought in response to Governor Kohn’s comments  Would the   phrase “add to” do a better job than “increase the size of” in conveying the sense that these   programs are going to make the balance sheet bigger than it otherwise would be, rather than lead   to an absolute increase in the size of the balance sheet?   December 15–16, 2008 183 of 284      Other things held constant     In light of our discussion of “use of” in this balance sheet quantitative, I   was going to point out that President Plosser’s suggestion about a specific number for an upper   bound on the size of our balance sheet would remedy the problem that we were discussing there  In   addition, it would greatly alleviate the deep discomfort I and perhaps others may have about our   governance practices and the extent to which they’re publicly known  I would also emphasize that   there are two theories about the effect of our balance sheet and that this is written from the credit-  spreads point of view, and it would be useful to encompass both     Because the word “size” is a quantitative word, it does a lot better than   “use of,” which is ambiguous about sterilization  So to that extent I view First Vice President   Cumming’s suggestion as very positive     I’m sorry  Say that again     “Of between”?     So the target is between     Target range is between     So the target range is to be between those two numbers     But it’s the same issue  “Range” is the noun, and you’re saying that the   range lies between those things, and you’re not telling everyone what the range is     I think the subcommittee ought to consider whether, if the Committee   adopts a 2 percent or whatever inflation objective, it might be more confusing than clarifying for   us to also be issuing these long-range convergence projections  My first cut at thinking this   through—I haven’t given this a lot of thought—is that, if we are going to say our target is X, I   don’t see why we would even need these     Yes, I think they are substitutes      What for?  We don’t control—well, you know that—sorry     You said that investors who bought this and put this and got the lending   would have the haircut at risk, right?     They would get all of the upside?     So if spreads close in the marketplace, then they get the upside—so we   are essentially lending to them to make a leveraged bet on the securities      I understand  Now, why are spreads high?      When I think about leverage and the demand for a given security, if I, as   an investor, am going to make a leveraged purchase, then whoever is giving me a loan to make   that is also taking a risk position in the security  So the demand that leveraged investors make is   really a joint demand by them and the lenders  Everything you have said sounds as if demand is   low  Am I missing something here?     In other words, I’m saying that people who would provide funding also   have a low demand or a low evaluation of the value of those securities  This all amounts to a   bunch of people out there putting a low value on these securities     Do you mean they are not making purchases?  They still exist—right?—  you said buyers vanished     What evidence do you have that their absence from the market doesn’t   reflect just adverse views about the value of the securities that we should treat the way we treat   all other security evaluation decisions that market participants make?     Well, wait  These are the ones who would be aided by this program,   right?     Over the cycle or in a recession?     What would a security like that have sold for in 1974 or 1981?     Well, they didn’t exist them, so we can’t look it up, for one  So how do   we know these are out of bounds with what they would have traded at?     Yes, I know  But you are not giving us any evidence about this, Bill    You are not bringing anything coherent that is—   December 15–16, 2008 224 of 284      So are there any other constraints of a legal or regulatory nature on   participants in this market?  Is there anything that keeps any hedge fund in the world from buying   these things?     No, no, no, not the program—the underlying securities   December 15–16, 2008 229 of 284      In general  Anyone could buy them, right?     No, no, no  Even not participating in the program  There are no   limitations on the investors who can participate, for example, in the market for asset-backed student   loans     Excuse me  The program doesn’t exist yet  Right now, today, is there   anything that restricts a hedge fund in London from buying an asset-backed security     The reason I ask—the point that I’m making—is that you can reference   theories but, at the end of the day, it’s not just those predictions  It’s the whole range of things   about the theory  We haven’t, in this, seen many theories put on the table, and the ones that have   been—things like cash-in-the-market pricing—just don’t seem to match up well with the facts    There’s a gigantic, billions of dollars worth of investors out there who have the capability of buying   any of this stuff  In Treasuries, people are capable of arbitraging that on-the-run and off-the-run   thing  To explain this by appealing to some market segmentation seems really weak in this   environment  You know, I welcome discussing theories under which these are Pareto improving   programs, but I haven’t seen one that’s convincing yet   December 15–16, 2008 230 of 284      Are we preventing equilibration?  I mean, what are we doing?  We’re in   the middle of an adjustment process, it takes some time     I look forward to seeing the model     I’m familiar with those models  We don’t have time to discuss them now     I just want to raise two things that worry me  One is that, when these   programs are small, you subsidize X percent of the credit market  The other 1 minus X percent, the   effect on their rate of return, their borrowing costs, probably is small  But when X gets near—I   don’t know where it is now—⅓ or ½, then our subsidization is raising borrowing costs for everyone   who doesn’t get money     There are some models in which that is the case  It’s not obvious how we   rule them out  The second thing is—I don’t know how you evaluate this—you must be thinking   whether this means that in every moderate-sized recession henceforth we’ll view the Federal   Reserve’s best policy as extending—     Right  Every recession of the size we’ve now seen 3 of in the last 50 years    So every recession of that size?     So you’re saying that you’re not concerned about setting up expectations   for the next recession   December 15–16, 2008 236 of 284      Okay    In putting this together, our staff benefited tremendously from what has   been learned over the past two months in New York from trying to put pencil to paper and   negotiate the details of the legal agreement pursuant to the term sheet for Citi  We were able, at   the margin, to improve in several respects on a couple of the provisions of this ring-fencing   arrangement  In our case, actually, the collateral isn’t going to be the underlying securities  It is   going to be just Treasuries But the loan agreement stipulates that the repayment amount is the   amount of the outstanding balance of the loan minus the amount of credit losses they incur on the   underlying assets  In addition, we have a trigger point for advancing the credit that is a bit   tighter than before and a couple of other minor things   But I want to thank the New York staff and the Board staff as well for doing a great job   in helping us put this together This obviously is an uncomfortable thing for any central bank to   do The terms of this deal are very consistent with the Citibank terms, so it seems like a   consistent follow-through in terms of the conditions involved for the institution that triggered   this intervention and the terms and structure of the intervention  So we were happy to cooperate   with the System in carrying this out           January 16, 2009 6 of 69   I just wanted to follow up on a couple of things that President Fisher   asked about and add a bit of color to your response about earnings  There are press reports today   coming out of the Bank of America earnings call that suggest that they learned about these losses   only in the days following their shareholder vote on December 5 or something like that  These   were actually accumulating from just early November, and the erosion of earnings took place   over a five-week period at Merrill, so they accreted within the organization  They knew about it   to some extent, as it was happening in late November and early December   In response to Richard’s question about a decision tree, the way this played out over the   Lehman weekend is notable  This initiative of the two firms was a direct response to hearing a              January 16, 2009 11 of 69  conclusive, definitive statement from the Secretary about his unwillingness to provide   government support for Lehman  So for all that has been said about the handling of the Lehman   case, the difference between the orderly resolution of Merrill, given this merger, and what would   have transpired had they tried to take a chance on going it alone has to be counted as a beneficial   side effect of Lehman—a kind of rare, direct evidence of some incentive effects here   One thing I am concerned about with these ring-fencing aspects—this is a comment to   you, Eric—is that they leave a substantial part of the risk, both upside and some downside, on the   books of the institution So they have the inconvenient property that defraying some of the costs   of that risk is part of the calculus of anyone considering injecting new equity in the firm  Some   prospective equity investor that takes them a bit out of the hole of this thing is going to be   benefiting existing debt holders as well  This debt-overhang problem ought to be the subject of   some attention here because ultimately we want to get away from dependence on government   support To some extent, these preferred injections, because they are dilutive, have us in a   tipping point kind of thing in which equity holders are scared off by the prospects of future   dilutive injections So we are sort of stuck with just the government as the potential equity   source until they come far enough out of it that the tail risk for debt holders is large enough     I think that deserves some thought  Initially we took a look at an SPV (special purpose   vehicle) approach, more like Bear, specifically for this reason—that it would lift the assets out of   the institution and help us get more rapidly to a point where we didn’t have this debt-overhang   problem  My understanding is that there was a concern at Treasury that this should resemble, as   closely as possible, the Citi deal, so that it was patterned after that and could be sold as kind of a   continuation of the Citi-like structure  This issue about common versus preferred was a surprise   in this—in December we learned that there was a real concern about the appearance of B of A’s     January 16, 2009 12 of 69  tangible common equity ratio, which is below that of some top-tier banks like JPMorgan but   above that of Citi  They were concerned about the erosion of that, and that was their chief   investor-confidence issue that motivated this  Understanding that a little better and what   motivates that on the part of the investor community would be useful as well    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Also in the interest of time, I’ll be brief  We   have said a lot about this subject—it is hard to picture much that hasn’t been said  Yes, I do believe   that we should adopt a specific numerical objective for inflation  We should be clear why and what   we’re doing  I just can’t help but start thinking about this question from the point of view of our   taking actions over time in a repeatable process that generates a consistent pattern of behavior  That   point of view leads you to certain answers to some of these questions  From that point of view,                                January 16, 2009 35 of 69  whatever we do and whatever we imagine for that policy rule, surely it generates an average rate of   inflation  So the question before us is, Why not reveal that?  Why not state that?  Why not figure   out what that is and state that to people?   Now, contrast that with some suggestions and some discussions that seem to have the flavor   of let’s state now what we think, on a one-shot basis, that inflation is going to be from 2010 to 2015    I think of this as announcing a consistent pattern of behavior that we think we’re sticking to  That   approach has a real advantage over the long-term projections approach  If we’re going to be doing   long-term projections every quarter, I don’t see how we avoid the problem we’ve had with the third­  year-of-the-projection approach to signaling our inflation intentions  Every quarter that projection   could come out differently, and that’s going to be an acute problem in the coming months when the   composition of the Committee changes, obviously  How does it relate to our dual mandate?  I agree   with Jim  It’s no problem  Let’s imagine that we’re following a pattern of behavior that we view as   optimal with respect to our dual mandate  Surely that generates an average rate of inflation  Why   not announce that?  If we announce that, it does not have any implications for our pursuit of our   dual mandate   The time frame is sort of a separate question, I think  This is a question for what we say in   any given meeting or in any given quarter about how we view the economy evolving over the next   couple of years—what we view as our outlook  How we view inflation is likely to come back to   what we view as its long-run average, and, gosh, that could change  It could be quick in some   instances; it could be longer in some instances  I don’t see any reason to pin ourselves down to a   particular time horizon   How would this change the way the Committee does its work?  Well, I think it would   inevitably change how it communicates  I think we’d pay a little more attention to inflation  In                 January 16, 2009 36 of 69  particular, we’d tend to underemphasize language that treats inflation as an autonomous   development in the economy (which we tend to use too much now), and we’d use more often   language that implies our responsibility for the path inflation is likely to take  I think we would   serve ourselves best by not changing our inflation target very much at all and communicating about   it in a way that conveys that we intend to revisit this only very, very rarely  I do not think this   would interfere with our ability to deal with financial stability  It is hard to picture how allowing   uncertainty about our inflation objectives would help with financial stability  If anything, it seems   as though the opposite would be true, especially given the experience in the 1970s  About these   other questions, a single number to me seems obviously preferable  Total PCE and 1½ percent   would be my choices  That concludes my remarks, Mr Chairman    We will go easy on you  [Laughter]    Thank you, Mr Chairman  First of all, I applaud the changes in item 5   to the domestic authorization  I will note here that it has been a triennial tradition for the Federal   Reserve Bank of Richmond President to dissent on the foreign-currency-related directives  I am        January 27–28, 2009 12 of 267  going to break with tradition and support them Our opposition in the past had to do with their   use and the implications in foreign exchange operations that struck us as off-balance-sheet fiscal   policy that was more properly done by the Treasury   However, I would like to share a couple of comments on the Guidelines for the Conduct   of System Operations in Federal Agency Issues  Let me just state at the outset that, in my view,   they conflict with what we are doing now with agencies  “Credit allocation” is a term of art, and   I think there is room for reasonable people, in good faith, to take different positions on what that   means, as is the case with terms like “normal market functioning” as well  I think of the term in   this context by comparing purchasing agency securities with some broader-based purchase of a   similar quantity  I think we will have an opportunity to discuss this later in agenda item 8, but   that thought experiment leads me to believe that these operations must, compared with a broader-  based purchase of Treasuries, lower particular market sectors’ interest rates relative to others and   leave others higher than they otherwise would be  I recognize that there are members—in fact,   the broad majority here—who probably want to continue with the program and not suspend the   guidelines If I had my choice, I would not suspend the guidelines; I would suspend the   program  So what I would like to do is respectfully register a negative vote on this  Thank you,   Mr Chairman     You may have mentioned this, but who bears the foreign exchange risk   in this?    Right So the other central bank bears it  So in this case, who would   bear it?    So we would bear the foreign exchange risk of the swap    Wait, wait, wait  When you say it would be the same, it depends on   whose point of view it is The way Trish described it, we would bear the foreign exchange risk   vis-à-vis the other central banks  Is that what you are saying?    Obviously, it is a lending risk  But before you do the loan, you swap   with the foreign central bank The way we do it now, the foreign central bank bears the currency   risk, and in this one, we would                     January 27–28, 2009 31 of 267   To make them bear it?    Thank you I’m happy to kick off our first go-round in this format    Obviously, we established a new interest rate regime at the last meeting and have some knotty        January 27–28, 2009 39 of 267  issues—a lot of challenges—ahead of us  I want to borrow a bit of time from my remarks later   in the meeting and use them here, if I could  I respect your appeal for disorganized interaction,   but I have organized my thoughts  [Laughter] I am happy to give a disorganized version, if you   would like, but—   PARTICIPANT How do we tell?  [Laughter]    Good question There is an observational equivalence here, I am sure    First, let me applaud the discussions you have initiated with the Treasury  I want to comment a   bit on that I think they are very important right now  What I would like to talk a bit about, first,   is just the two schools of thought that we have been contending with here about how to use our   tools—how we should conduct policy in this new framework  One, obviously, is using our   balance sheet to influence the size of our monetary liabilities in an attempt to influence the   growth of the public’s nominal expenditures, and the other is to use our balance sheet to   intervene in market segments that seem particularly strained and where consequences for the   broader economy appear to be particularly significant   I think that the term asset-backed securities loan facility, which is our next program to be   implemented, is illuminating here and raises significant questions about these two schools of   thought So I want to explore it for just a couple of minutes  It is aimed at improving conditions   in the market for securitizations of credit card, auto, and small business loans, with the hope of   improving the securitization markets’ functioning and thus increasing the flow of credit to   consumers and small businesses  Quarterly interest rates on such securitizations have been   exorbitantly high of late—I think Ms Mosser’s presentation had them up about 500 to 600 basis   points over LIBOR—and new issuance fell to virtually zero in the last quarter, as I understand it    Expected loss rates on the underlying loan portfolios have risen significantly since September,        January 27–28, 2009 40 of 267  but there are some who argue that the spreads on AAA tranches are far too high to be explained   by increasing loss rates alone Another relevant factor is that there has been a widespread   pullback from structured finance Investors have lost confidence in some of the inputs into the   securitization process—rating agency assessments would be an obvious one—so investors are   not willing to pay nearly as much now for consumer loan securitizations as they once were  In   addition, one hears other reports that some investors in this class of securitization are more   reluctant to hold these securities now because of mark-to-market volatility, which for this class   of investors passes through their income statement, in contrast with some of the issuers who, if   they hold the same securitizations on their own balance sheet, don’t have to run mark-to-market   changes through their balance sheets  So there is a certain comparative advantage in accounting   treatment to the issuers holding these   This leads me to the next thing I think the other side of these securitization markets   bears a careful look  We happen to have two of the largest credit card ABS issuers in our   District Both of these firms have simply declined to issue securitizations because it is cheaper   to use their balance sheet  Their funding costs—there was one issue, 2¼ percent, year and a half   money—some of them quote 1½ percent for brokered deposits  In comparison with that, the   spreads in the secondary market that Ms Mosser quoted are something like 5 or 6 percent  So   there is no way in which it makes sense for them to actually do the securitization  Instead, they   just hold it on the balance sheet In essence, their demand for securitization funding is very   elastic because the closest substitute is not much more costly  As a result, the increase in   funding costs hasn’t been nearly as much for them as the increase in these spreads would   indicate        January 27–28, 2009 41 of 267  Now, you might think that the pressure this puts on these banks’ balance sheets would   lead them to cut back credit extension at the margin as a result of this  But both of these   institutions report quite clearly and emphatically that their lending terms—that is to say, the   decision algorithms for what to grant an individual consumer—have not changed as a result of   this They are still chasing consumers who are creditworthy  These are getting harder to find   because consumers are generally riskier now  But these banks’ policies have not changed   because of what has happened in the securitization markets  This suggests that the disruption in   securitization markets has had little effect on consumer credit availability  This is consistent   with evidence that I found in the back of the Greenbook that interest rates on credit cards and   auto loans have fallen, not risen, over the past several months despite the increase in the ABS   spreads, which would make you think that they would be rising   More broadly, securitization is a mechanism for reallocating risk  But more   fundamentally, it is a mechanism for arbitraging capital requirements and getting a more   favorable regulatory treatment, capital treatment, by moving things off balance sheets  So the   question is, Do we have a policy interest in further subsidizing regulatory capital arbitrage?  I   don’t think the answer is “yes,” and I don’t think we have a broader interest in subsidizing   securitization markets compared with on-balance-sheet lending  Moreover, at the end of the   year, banks are going to have to consolidate these securitizations on their balance sheets anyway,   under FAS 140 So I am led to wonder  Do we have a policy interest in reversing the steps they   have taken already to adjust to this new accounting regime?  Again, I don’t think the answer is   “yes” So the bottom line about the TALF is that I don’t think it addresses a demonstrable   market failure  As I will speak about in a minute, I think doing this would channel credit away           January 27–28, 2009 42 of 267  from other worthy borrowers  I think it exacerbates moral hazard, and I think it sets bad fiscal   precedence   If we are going to expand our balance sheet—and I do think it makes sense to do so right   now—I believe we should do so in a way that is as neutral as possible across market segments  I   think the best way to do this is to purchase US Treasuries  What effect would this have?  Well,   the natural benchmark, the simplest model you would write down—and there are more-  complicated models in which something else would happen—is one in which the presumption   would be that risky financial assets are priced off risk-free Treasuries based on the standard risk   considerations, the standard asset-pricing considerations  I don’t see any particular reason to   believe that those spreads would move one way or another in response to a change in medium-   and long-term Treasury yields  The staff memo on purchasing long-term securities gives a   number of reasons that they recommend against the idea, and frankly, I don’t find them very   compelling because most of them apply with equal force to a targeted credit program like the   TALF The risk of increasing inflation by monetizing debt applies to both public and private   debt, I think The risk of taxpayer loss would seem to be even more of an issue if we take on   credit risk in addition to interest rate risk   We heard earlier about our purchases of 30-year mortgage-backed securities and agency   bonds The deleterious effects of distorting relationships among various interest rates would   seem to be more of a problem for targeted credit programs than buying US Treasuries  On this   last point, the thought experiment I carry around in my head about this is to compare a targeted   credit program such as TALF with a same dollar amount purchase of US Treasuries  The effect   on the monetary base is going to be the same, by assumption  But buying Treasuries is likely to   lower rates across the board in the private sector, whereas the credit program is just going to     January 27–28, 2009 43 of 267  lower the target rates, leaving rates in non-targeted market segments higher than they would be if   we bought Treasuries In other words, choosing a targeted credit program over buying   Treasuries is like deciding to lower rates for borrowers in the targeted segment by drawing away   funds from other sectors and raising rates in other sectors, compared with a program of buying a   risk-free security like Treasuries  I don’t see a compelling reason to raise some borrowers’   interest rates in order to lower some other borrowers’ interest rates  In particular, it is hard for   me to see how we know this would have a positive effect on aggregate demand, on net   Now, obviously, we have a collection of credit programs on our books already, and we   have been discussing the fundamental problem that these are likely to pose when the time comes   for us to withdraw monetary stimulus  The solution that I think you are right to pursue with the   Treasury—and I would like to propose and I would advocate—is that we transfer financing of   our credit programs wholesale to the US Treasury and that we work to establish a new   understanding—call it a Treasury–Fed credit accord, if you want—under which we would agree   that, henceforth, intervention in credit markets, apart from our usual peacetime-like discount   window functioning, will be the responsibility of the US Treasury   This would give us back control of the monetary liabilities on our balance sheet and   would make it much simpler to find an exit strategy  It would reduce the risk of loss to our   capital accounts and the attendant reputational risk  It would reduce the risk perceived by market   participants that we might abruptly terminate some credit programs in order to reduce the   monetary base It would reduce the risk perceived by market participants that we might   compromise inflation in order to sustain credit programs  It would also reduce our vulnerability   to the charge that we are using federal monies outside the constitutional appropriations process   and that we have abused our powers by disguising asset purchases and credit guarantees, for     January 27–28, 2009 44 of 267  which we do not have explicit authority, as loans  This is what we have done in the Citigroup   and Bank of America case, and it is one thing that makes me very uncomfortable about those   programs and would lead me to favor proposing that the Treasury take on those guarantees as   well, because there is nothing in principle that limits their ability or the FDIC’s ability to have   taken on all of the risk in both of those cases   In short, my view is that, no matter how you feel about our credit programs—whether   you are for them or “agin” them—it would be better for the Treasury to finance them  I don’t see   any operational impediment to transferring our credit programs to the Treasury  Our expertise is   very critical to them, of course, but we have been lending our expertise to the Treasury for   decades by performing fiscal functions for them and helping them run their debt auctions, and we   have recently lent our people to staff the TARP, and I don’t see any reason that our people   couldn’t continue to be involved in the administration of programs  The Treasury would,   obviously, have to issue additional debt to finance the programs, but the Fed would, in the first   instance, have an equal demand for US Treasury debt  From the public’s point of view, the   initial implementation would leave their balance sheets unaffected  Then, over time, we could   vary the size of our balance sheet, independently of the size of the credit programs   I think you are right, Mr Chairman, that this would be an uphill climb  It would require   broad agreement with the Administration and the Congress and perhaps even legislation  But I   think you are also right to note that this is an excellent opportunity in this regard  We are on the   cusp of sweeping revisions of decades-old laws governing financial regulation  Consideration is   being given, as you noted, to forming a so-called aggregator bank  So I think it is a very good   time to initiate a new understanding of the appropriate roles of the central bank and the fiscal   authority So I applaud your efforts to pursue those discussions  There may be an aversion to        January 27–28, 2009 45 of 267  spending our political capital—and I know we marshal that very carefully here in the System—   on such a request But we were willing to spend political capital in 1951 to gain control of the   liability side of our balance sheet  That is what the original Treasury–Fed accord did, and that   has been essential to the independent conduct of monetary policy since then  So I think we are   entitled to exert ourselves politically on this one  Thank you very much, Mr Chairman  I   appreciate your indulgence    I don’t want to go deeply into technical details either, but a certain   presumption with regard to credit risk is that there are potentially adverse consequences of   distorting relative credit risks across markets  I don’t see why the same thing shouldn’t apply to   liquidity risk    In the interest of your interest in informal exchange, I was interested in   responding to our new Vice Chairman    I don’t understand in what sense the observation that prices are low and   that quantities are very low constitutes a demonstration that the consumer-backed ABS market is   broken down Can you think of a model in which that results?  Yes, demand is low, and supply   is elastic I sketched out one What we are talking about, it is important to remember here, is the   interaction, the rivalry, between the balance sheet channel of credit flows and the securitization   channel A broad array of contractual features are important to the relative attractiveness for   market participants of those two channels—covenants, risk allocation, regulatory and accounting   treatments, and the like  On balance sheet constraints—would some firms prefer that the demand   for securitization be higher, high enough that securitization was less costly for them than holding   it on balance sheet?  Yes, I am sure that is true  But if that is the criterion for whether or not a   market is broken down, then it is hard to see the difference between a market being broken down   and just regulatory capture in some broad sense   You talked about markets being distorted already  I can picture information constraints,   verification costs, asymmetries, and the like that would lead market outcomes to be less   felicitous for all concerned than they otherwise would be  But, yes, information constraints   constrain achievable outcomes, but so do technology constraints  Would we be better off if we   could get more output with the same amount of labor and capital?  Yes, we would  But I don’t   think you would call the market distorted because that is the case   The question is why it is distorted  If you come to me with a model—with some story,   not even a model—that sketches out the interaction of information with technologies and with           January 27–28, 2009 56 of 267  market participants’ incentives that convinces me that markets are distorted in a way that   government intervention can remedy, I am all ears, and I would be happy to talk about it  I have   been asking for that for a year and a half I have been even doing the work for you  I have been   even bringing models to the table  I haven’t gotten any information or any market observations   that seem consistent with one story or another  I am not sure that this request has been taken   seriously So, yes, if markets are distorted by something or other, fine, but that is hardly an   answer for justifying the TALF in my view    Probably    Roughly speaking All constraints taken on board   PARTICIPANT What was the question again?    One of them    I am fine with that, but—    That is a government intervention  Are we intervening to make   securitization just as subsidized as bank balance sheets?    If we are in a world of second best, I understand that     Well, then, what is it that unfairly tilts the playing field toward bank   balance sheets?  I mean, you have this regulatory tax, and it tilts in the other direction    Just real quickly  Disequilibrium, in this context, is a non sequitur  It is   a conversation stopper It is like appealing to astrology—it is the equivalent of that  If we are   out of equilibrium, what happens out of equilibrium?  What is determining what happens?    People make choices on their way to making adjustments  They were in equilibrium when they   made the choices that resulted in the losses, and now that equilibrium is playing out, obviously    Would these leveraged borrowers like there to be a greater demand for their liabilities?  Yes   This all looks as though demand is low  I will ask you a question  The buggy whip industry—is   that sector broken?    If I may just comment on that, the important thing is to keep track of   what sort of thought experiment you have in mind A sterilized intervention, or an intervention   in which you are intervening in a market and comparing that with intervening more broadly in   Treasuries, is one thing Another thing is an intervention that is unsterilized and that does not   pull some other assets out of the market  I would just point to Ms Mosser’s presentation, which   she opened with characterizing markets as that rates in markets in which we have intervened   have broadly improved and rates in markets in which we have not intervened have broadly   deteriorated To me that has the flavor of consistency with the notion that our issue of liabilities   and sale of Treasuries is pulling funds out of other markets and increasing rates    We have to fund it somehow, and the funding is going to pull money   from somebody, right?    I will say “yes,” [laughter] with the additional note that with that answer   alone you might wonder why I get so exercised, but it is that withdrawing that friction does not   seem to be what any of our programs have been designed to accomplish    Mr Chairman, thank you  That was a very clear and lucid description of   what the core crystallized issues are regarding frictions—regarding the thing that in my fogged   state I was not able to articulate to Vice Chairman Dudley a minute ago  This is what I think we   have been struggling to get our hands around, and so I appreciate your clear articulation of that   As you know, these are sort of classic problems in banking economics  About liquidity, I   am struck by the hedge funds  To date as far as I know—maybe New York knows about one that   is about to blow up—we have not been challenged by them  Here is a set of participants not   viewed as likely to benefit from the safety net that, over the past couple of years, have structured   their liabilities in a way that makes them relatively insulated from run-like phenomena  That   illustrates the broader point about models of panic-stricken runs—the extent to which you issue a   contract that makes you vulnerable to that is endogenous and leads me toward wondering if the   safety net has really been what is driving the instances of run-like behavior not only in the   banking system   On informational capital, I think you are right on target there Obviously, it was the   subject of your very seminal research, inspiring to all of us  There I think about a lot of the   pulling away—people taking their loan accounts—from Wachovia and Governor Duke’s bank a   year ago telling me that they were picking up customers that were uncomfortable working with   Wachovia or B of A Switching costs are there for sure  But I struggle with how hard they are   and, again, appreciate that you have crystallized genuine scientific issues to clarify the   discussion    Well, if I could, Mr Chairman, just to be clear—it is not that they are   not subject to runs; it is that runs don’t bring them down the way an institution like a classic bank   in 1932 would have been brought down by a retail run    If I could, that is a very important insight  It is part of the classic tension   between healing now versus looking at what we are doing as part of a repeatable process from   which people are going to be forming expectations about our future behavior  That is the   inevitable tension    I have a request, Mr Chairman  I asked the System Open Market   Account manager a couple of days ago, but now he is not the manager anymore  [Laughter]    You just didn’t want to do it  Tomorrow or maybe today we will hear   about a forecast for the path of the federal funds rate  In creating that, it is endogenous  It   depends on the economy, but it also affects the economy  I was wondering if we could get one   for our balance sheet, subject to uncertainty of all the obvious kinds  It would be useful to help   us think about the capacity of programs and extending them  I think it would be useful    I’m looking at exhibit 9  I note that the program involved half MBS,   half Treasury and that mortgage rates fell 125 basis points and Baa rates fell 75  What if it was        January 27–28, 2009 111 of 267  all Treasury?  What would the fall in mortgage rates be, and what would the fall in the Baa rates   be?  Would the effect on growth be larger or smaller?    Did you say 30 for both mortgage rates and Baa?    When you say “same,” you mean at the aggregate level    Presumably the fraction that is houses is different    The composition is different    So this implies that, if you did $1 trillion in Treasuries, the Baa rate   would be lower    I guess the 75 I guess I am confused  I see—the Treasuries have a   smaller overall multiplier  It is like 30  So it would be just 30  So it would just be 60 on that   and 60 on the—    Two more questions One for Brian  In exhibit 6, the projections,   bottom panel, longer-run inflation forecast, the dotted line is our October projections, and the   solid lines are our January projections If our intent was to find an inflation number that we all   report that had some stability from forecast to forecast, we seem to have failed    So one interpretation is that the implicit longer-run inflation objective of   the Committee has changed over this quarter    But this exact variability is what led us to be unhappy with the third year   of the forecast mechanism for revealing an implicit inflation target    Okay Well, we’ll discuss this more  One final thing I think I saw   Governor Duke try to intervene during the conversation about the responses to the Senior Loan   Officer Opinion Survey, which was something I was discussing with Governor Kohn a minute   ago You know, when I think about what people say about credit constraints, the idea of a   consumer with given characteristics—FICO score, income, and everything—with GDP growth   of plus 3 versus GDP growth of minus 5, the identical consumer is going to be riskier in the   second situation If a bank is not willing to lend in the second situation and is willing to lend in   the first situation, I assert that they would say they are tightening their standards  I would also   assert that it does not seem like a credit-channel, credit-constraint type of thing, as you might   otherwise think    Right, it would, but I was going to ask Governor Duke because she is   probably actually—    Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be very brief  Our indicators and the   anecdotal reports from the Fifth District are quite consistent with the national picture and the   picture that emerges from the reports that we have heard around the table from the Reserve Bank   Presidents so far today  There are only three nuances that I would take note of  One is recent   declines in the wage indexes in the manufacturing and services areas in our District—just a   couple of months of decline but potentially meaningful  Second, on the other side, expected   prices received in manufacturing have swung decisively from negative territory in November,   more than minus 1 percent, to positive territory, above 1½ percent  Third, a fairly significant   decline has occurred in the last two months in the index for expected capital spending in   manufacturing   On the national level, our outlook is basically aligned with the Greenbook, with a couple   of exceptions  I am a bit more optimistic about the pace of growth when the recovery begins  I   expect inflation to return above 1 percent later this year and to get to about 1½ percent rather   than sag in the out years I do not think we are going to want to keep the nominal rate at the   floor for nearly as long as the Greenbook expects  I am thinking liftoff is likely sometime in   2010 rather than in 2012   I endorse the statements made by Presidents Evans and Stern and others about the   depressing effect of the lack of clarity around government credit policy  Capital injections that   have occurred so far and prospects for future capital injections seem to have induced a tipping   dynamic by which we are at a corner solution—there is no private equity coming in for fear of   what future capital injections might do to them, and so we are left with the public sector being   the only source of prospective capital Looking ahead at the strategy, I think we want to get to a   point where the banks are healthy, which means they can raise equity privately  That transition        January 27–28, 2009 145 of 267  is the hard one to solve, and I endorse the ideas that President Stern just alluded to  I would also   say that I think public statements about our potential future credit programs and the expansion of   our programs to asset classes could well be a drawback in that they add uncertainty about where   we are going to come in next  I will cede the rest of my time to my past self  [Laughter]    The spread of views on this is likely to be related to the extent to which   we believe our credibility is complete—in other words, if we think that expectations about   inflation are so fragile and so changeable that our statement highlighting the possibility of   deflation could move them around  On the other hand, you could take the point of view that they   are so well anchored that it will not move them around  I find myself in the Hoenig and Plosser                January 27–28, 2009 184 of 267  camp on this—not viewing them as as well established as we want  Well, that is consistent with   my statement    Thank you very much, Mr Chairman  I fully support the expansion that   we have engineered in our monetary liabilities  I view our strategy as having expanded them   fairly dramatically to provide stimulus now that we are at the zero bound  I think our strategy   going forward is going to be focused on maintaining them at a high level and, while the economy   is in distress, perhaps varying the quantity and perhaps increasing it should distress increase, and   that seems productive  When the economy recovers, begin withdrawing that stimulus; then at   some time in the future, lift the funds rate off the floor  I am cognizant that assessing the   appropriate magnitude of that expansion is terribly difficult, for reasons that President Bullard   and Governor Kohn discussed We are, in fact, at the limit of our professional understanding of   the transmission mechanism, although I think there is a lot that is known that we could fruitfully   review and discuss in the Committee on this issue  I am less supportive of the way in which we   brought about this expansion in our monetary liabilities, as you all know  As I said yesterday   and on many other occasions, I think the case for targeted credit programs is weak, briefly put    They do not address any demonstrable market failure  They channel credit away from other   worthy borrowers, exacerbate moral hazard, and set bad fiscal precedents           January 27–28, 2009 187 of 267  Regarding the exit strategy, I do not see anything inherent in the economics that has   motivated our intervention into these programs or that links that to the state of the business cycle   and where the funds rate needs to be So I do not see why it would necessarily be the case that,   when we want to lift the funds rate, the perceived needs in any of these dysfunctional credit   markets will have necessarily gone away  I think that is clear just from the way the case has   been made and the fact that credit markets can dysfunction in the way they have been claimed to   dysfunction in peacetime, in any part of the business cycle   The TALF is our next new targeted credit program to be introduced  It is on deck to be   implemented in February  I believe that it would be better policy for us not to implement the   TALF but instead to expand our balance sheet by buying US Treasury securities  The effect on   credit markets will be more neutral  It will avoid distorting credit flows across private borrowing   segments  Adverse incentive effects would be minimized, and I think it would maintain more   distance between us and redistributional fiscal policies  Concerning buying Treasuries, I think   that monetization is something that I am less concerned with because the way I view it is that the   choice should be what we buy, in which case we are monetizing the same amount of stuff   I can appreciate the concern that, coming at a juncture in time in which a large fiscal   stimulus is being enacted, there would be a natural risk—and I think it is a risk—that the public   would make the inference that our increase in the balance sheet was at the behest of the   Administration  I think we should strive to avoid that  If we maintain our monetary liabilities   flat across this episode for the next quarter or so, we would be able to do that, but I will admit   that is a risk You have had conversations and will have conversations with the Administration   about the idea of a new accord  As I said yesterday, I applaud those  I think that is another   reason to hold off introducing any new program that we might ultimately be considering—and I              January 27–28, 2009 188 of 267  think we ought to consider—transferring wholesale to the Treasury  For all of these reasons, Mr   Chairman, unless we decide at this meeting to defer the TALF, I would respectfully dissent   because I would prefer to expand the monetary base by purchasing US Treasury securities   rather than through targeted credit programs  Thank you    Excuse me, if I could just reply—in the TALF as it is envisioned, we are   to declare that for three years it is going to be unusual and exigent, as I understand it  Is that   correct?    So the interpretation is that circumstances have to be unusual and   exigent at the time it is entered into    No doubt Thanks              January 27–28, 2009 189 of 267   I had a friendly amendment to Governor Warsh  “If evolving   circumstances were to indicate” seems more parsimonious      “Later this season”    “In the future”    Right Oh, I didn’t take out “evolving,” but I am indifferent on that    “Evolving” seems to emphasize—    I’m sorry  I missed what’s on the table  Is it that the economy has   weakened further or that the outlook has weakened further?    The economy  Okay That makes sense    I pointed out yesterday that the distribution of the numbers for inflation   had shifted notably I understand that people’s views about the appropriate inflation rate—the   steady-state inflation rate that they would put in a Taylor rule or some other reaction function—              January 27–28, 2009 213 of 267  might change from quarter to quarter  I also pointed out that I thought the motivation for doing   that was dissatisfaction with the extent to which the third year of our forecast inflation changed   from quarter to quarter and that it diminished the extent to which that report of our forecasts   served as a proxy for our Committee’s agreed-upon numerical inflation objectives  At our last   meeting, we discussed adopting an explicit numerical inflation objective  That hasn’t appeared   on the agenda today    Oh, okay I guess my attitude toward the longer-run projections is that I   remain unconvinced, as I was in our October discussion, that the benefits exceed the costs, and I   wanted to use the opportunity here to ask about the status of adopting a numerical objective for   inflation    I see Mr Chairman, do you view it as feasible, likely, or very unlikely   that consultations could result in your Monetary Policy Report to the Congress this season   involving a revelation of an objective? Or is that too much to hope for?    Okay Thank you very much, Mr Chairman    That would be an aggregator memo?  [Laughter]    I have a couple of questions First is about this last discussion  Maybe   there’s something else going on here, but the sense you get is that the inability of banks to raise   private equity has to do with two things One is that the probability distribution around their   losses is wide enough that there’s a substantial chance that, absent government intervention,    some losses would be absorbed by debt holders, so new equity would, to some extent, subsidize   current debt holders; the second is the prospect for future government capital injections that are   dilutive It strikes me that it’s going to be unlikely for banks to raise private equity until those   two sources of concern for potential equity investors are removed   The aggregator bank and some of the other programs can reduce that uncertainty—that   debt overhang problem  Of course, if the banks had enough capital, there wouldn’t be a debt           February 7, 2009 44 of 65  overhang problem  But if there is one now, they’re not going to be able to raise private equity to   get to a point where their equity cushion is big enough to reduce that debt overhang problem  So   I’m not sure it’s going to be likely they are going to have any success in raising private capital   under this plan And on this question, Governor Kohn said something—and if this was in your   presentation, Mr Chairman, I missed it—about them  not being able to sell assets to raise their   capital ratio Is that a provision of what is proposed?    Governor Kohn said something about a restriction on them not selling   assets I didn’t quite understand that    I took the broad lesson of the RTC, Japan, and Sweden to be that selling   assets has some benefits as well as some potential problems, so I wasn’t quite sure what the   attitude was about that   I’m a little puzzled about the incentives in the aggregator bank  You talked about the   private profit motive and paying fundamental values for things  Yet they’re going to have this   huge government guarantee in their liabilities, and I’m not quite sure how we ought to view the   incentives of the private equity holders who would control that  It’s not clear to me that they’re   going to be managing it from a socially optimal point of view    That argument depends on the financing rate being a true rate, and the   financing rate they could get now in the market being some distorted rate, I guess  If that’s not   true, then we’re subsidizing their financing, and they ought to be willing to pay more    Yes, but the value of those rents will be contingent on their ability to   pursue whatever strategy they want when they control it  So that doesn’t mitigate the effect on   what they’re willing to pay for things  In fact, it requires them to overpay if warranted by the   financing arrangement    I have two questions about the TALF  One is that I think it would be a   good thing if our best estimates are that the probability that the Federal Reserve bears a loss is   virtually negligible There have been analyses like that in the private sector that haven’t come   true in the past  We’re all tied together in the Reserve Banks in terms of these losses, and our   boards of directors are expressing an increasingly avid interest in the nature of the risks we’re   exposed to on our balance sheets And here we’re taking the Fed System’s balance sheet from   $17 trillion or something up to $27 trillion—this is a fairly notable increase  I think it would be   useful for us to have access, at a fairly detailed level, to this analysis of the potential losses to the        February 7, 2009 47 of 65  Federal Reserve that might be involved in the TALF—what kind of analytics determine the   parameters, and how they were set, and why we have confidence that the probability of losses is   fairly minimal  I’d be interested in knowing if you could assure us we’d get access to that from    whoever is doing the analysis within the System    Do you mean just a verbal presentation?    Yes I understand the details of the program  I understand all of the   buffers there are between us and some losses But in the past, people said the triple-A tranches   of RMBS CDOs were virtually risk-free, and now they’re selling for below 50 cents on the        February 7, 2009 48 of 65  dollar I know your folks are more expert in this than the rating agencies  It’s just that we want   some comfort, and we want to be able to vouch to our boards of directors, who still have the   standard fiduciary responsibilities—even though the Treasury is obviously bearing the loss at the   end of the day—that we understand the risks that are being run and that we’re comfortable telling   them that we understand the risks are low  So it will be good to get that analysis from you in   New York   The second question I have about the TALF has to do with the role that hedge funds are   going to play We’ve seen over the last couple of weeks a tremendous amount of political noise   about executive compensation at the entities that have received TARP capital injections  I   wonder what our political vulnerability might be here to questions from the Congress or concerns   raised in the public about the compensation practices or other practices of entities that are getting   credit from the Federal Reserve on terms that arguably aren’t available in the market, so they are   presumptively somewhat advantageous, and the loans are certainly governmental funds  Is there   some risk to us that we’d be caught up in complaints about compensation practices and lavish   expenditures at hedge funds?    I don’t want to shut off the discussion on this point, if there’s more    But, if not, this is my third and final question  It’s a comment in addition to a question, and it   has to do with where we’re going to come out in the end—a year or two from now—with regard   to an accord on credit policy  I understand that this is an intermediate step, and that you envision   further discussions down the road towards a more complete or comprehensive understanding   with the Treasury about credit policy My concern here is that I think that there are a range of   possible strategies, and I worry about whether the steps we’re taking now compromise where we   might ultimately want to go  I understand the provision of credit by the Federal Reserve in   exceptionally exigent circumstances, where there’s enormous time pressure—we get a call on a   Friday night, and convening the Congress on a Saturday afternoon doesn’t really seem feasible    That’s fine with me—that ought to be a Federal Reserve function   But for programs that take three months to implement, arguably it would be feasible—   perhaps not politically feasible, I’ll admit that, and that’s a separate question—but as a matter of   mechanics and parliamentary process, it would have been feasible to ask the Congress to approve   the authority of the Treasury to implement the TALF program  And it occurs to me that drawing   a bright line at what is, in terms of timing, feasible for the Congress to authorize the Treasury to   implement seems like a logical approach that has a lot of attractive properties for us           February 7, 2009 50 of 65  I’m concerned that we’re going down a path that’s taking us in a different direction, and   we might compromise something that might be more workable and more beneficial, and we’re   doing it without a real discussion of where we want to head more broadly with regard to an   accord on Treasury policy As you describe it, part of the understanding with the Treasury now   is that they would accompany us to the Congress in an appeal for a mechanism of one of two   varieties for us to be able to sterilize our lending  One would be the idea of us issuing non-  monetary liabilities; the other would be for the Treasury to issue debt and deposit with us under   the current program   The concern I have about the latter is what the nature of our understanding would be with   the Treasury about who controls those issues We ask, and they agree to say yes, usually, under   reasonable circumstances  There’s always the possibility that they will retain some implicit   leverage over us that would constrain our independence going forward  On the other hand,   having the ability to control our own issues of non-monetary liabilities seems really attractive   But, again, I worry about bargaining power; in an event, knowing that we have that   capability, the Treasury and the FDIC would, I think, retain the ability to stare us down and   essentially say, “Well, you have the ability to issue non-monetary liabilities that don’t count   against the federal debt limit, so you do it”  I think that’s exactly the dynamic that emerged in   the case of Citi and Bank of America, where there was nothing mechanically or legally that   would have restricted the Treasury and the FDIC from taking all of the risk, and for us to bear   none of the tail risk But knowing that we had this tricky little mechanism for dressing up a   guarantee as a loan, they prevailed upon us to participate and participate fairly substantially  So I   worry that setting up an ability for us to issue non-monetary liabilities that are the functional   equivalent of Treasury bills and are outside of the appropriations process and don’t count against        February 7, 2009 51 of 65  the debt limit would give both the Congress and the administration an avenue, a target, a   mechanism that would make it irresistible for them to come to us to finance things that they   didn’t want to go to the Congress to finance   In my mind, the discussion about the accord needs to be about where it’s appropriate for   government lending to be done  You all know I’ve raised objections about our lending   programs, but this is apart from the advisability of any one program  It’s about the Congress and   the appropriate constraints on circumventing the appropriations process, and it’s about our   independence   I worry that we’re going down a path where, as I said, we’re going to be vulnerable to   complaints about our inability or our unwillingness to constrain executive compensation or the   lavish expenditures that entities that are going to be benefiting from our programs might make    We’re going down a path where people like Elizabeth Warren are going to be writing reports—   or could be writing reports—about what we do  I think that’s a very uncomfortable situation to   be in, and I’d like us to think clearly about whether that’s what we’re headed towards or whether   this compromise is headed towards something that leaves us with a much broader and firmer   measure of independence  So I just wonder what thoughts you’ve given to that kind of question,   Mr Chairman, and the extent to which you view representations we’ve made in these discussions   as compromising alternative strategies about a credit accord    I thought the conventional wisdom about Japan is that it was   government action to delay adjustment that led to their stagnation    Yes, zombie banks, zombie borrowers that weren’t foreclosed on, an   inability to free up resources and pry them out of the hands of bankrupt firms and move them to   new productive uses    I know, this could be a long debate  The scrubbing of the balance sheets   is a very strong element in this plan, and I think that it’s well worthwhile And I think it’s really   clever to get around these accrual accounting problems rather than address them head-on  I think   it makes a lot of sense to go in and run a shadow regulatory regime around what those assets are   really worth    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I have several questions and a comment at   the end First, a compliment to the New York staff  I thought that the material distributed ahead   of time outlining all of the asset programs was very informative, very well laid out, and very   succinct My compliments to you on that work              March 17–18, 2009 26 of 266  I have a question for Ms Mosser This has to do with the comparison between a program   of agency and MBS purchases like we’ve been pursuing and what a program of US Treasury   purchases would look like  My understanding is that you plan your announcements and the size   of your purchases a little bit in advance  Would we get any more flexibility by using Treasuries   rather than MBS or are they pretty much the same?  Would you get a little more flexibility to   vary the size of the purchases week to week?    Let me follow up  When you buy Treasuries, when you do a coupon   pass, do you settle the same day or next day?    Next day These MBS and agency securities—they settle once a month?        March 17–18, 2009 27 of 266   I see So if I looked at it from the point of view of what happens to bank   reserves, it’s just a once-a-month hit    I see So it’s staggered    Right For Spence, I was very interested in the forecast of the balance   sheet, and we’ve been talking about that for the last couple of meetings  You have the forecast   going up in a straight line to the end of the year, and I take it that’s just because you forecasted   the end-of-year balance sheet, right?    Do you have a sense of what it’s going to do between now and the next   meeting?  Have you done that exercise?    So, in principle, if I asked you to write down numerically, as you did for   the end of the year, a forecast for the monetary base at the next meeting, say, you could do that?    Subject to the usual caveats  [Laughter] A question for Mr Nelson    You named a bunch of asset categories that you’re considering for the TALF  What criteria are   you using to pick those asset classes? I mean, what sort of principle or objective is driving those   choices?    But just ABS, right?    Oh, collateralized assets Okay    Okay I’m just curious  It’s sort of striking  The original impetus   involved certain securitization markets, where I thought we were motivated by particular   observations that suggested distress Are the problems we see in markets widespread across   securitization?    And then a question for Mr Sheets  You talked about moral hazard   This institution that you talked about—or any institution in this category—presumably has   overseas operations in which they have liquid liabilities and less liquid assets?    And I think we talked about this at the last meeting, right?  That’s where   you first briefed us on this    So, over that period—it’s been almost two months now—could an   institution like that have reduced its vulnerability to the possibility of having a funding problem   in another currency? Could it have let its deposits run off, maybe sell the assets upstream to the   parent? And if that’s true, then wouldn’t the presence of this program influence an institution’s   incentives to take steps in the weeks ahead to protect against potential funding problems?    If I could just follow up, Mr Chairman, I take it that the institutions, the   half dozen you referred to, are bank holding companies in the United States    What steps have we taken—particularly regarding the one you referred   to as being especially vulnerable—to encourage them to reduce their vulnerability to funding   risks in foreign currencies?    Is it our sense that they’re doing all they could?    I guess I’m looking not for shutting them down, but for measures that   could reduce the funding vulnerability, the liability–asset mismatch that gives rise to the risk    Thank you Thank you, Mr Chairman    You said something that confused me  You said we would be protected   against risk because we would be senior to the Treasury  Then you said “and the haircuts”?    But the haircut and the Treasury capital aren’t two separate things,   right?    So that’s separate from the Treasury capital invested alongside the   private sector in the partnerships?    Back to Maiden Lane—would that include the two ring-fence   guarantees?    I may be pressing you for things that haven’t been put on the table, but   do you envision a public statement with all of these elements in it?    And would it lay out a timetable on any of this, or the transfer?    Help me understand the statement about the Fed not taking credit risk,   because we do, and it’s just a matter of degree                    March 17–18, 2009 66 of 266   Would we have an understanding with the Treasury about what “de   minimis” means?    Have we quantified that?  What is it?    Thank you, Mr Chairman  About asset purchases, I agree we should do   more now The monetary base has declined by $200 billion in the last couple of months  That   was unanticipated, at least on my part, and the outlook seems to have worsened  So, if anything,   we should be moving in the other direction   I have a concern I’d like to discuss first about how we go about this  We have these   demand-driven credit programs that are having a big influence on the base  We’ve talked for   two meetings now about different points of view about whether it’s credit programs and our asset   side or whether it’s our liability side and the monetary base  We’ve talked about credit frictions,   and we’ve talked about the demand for bank reserves  I think if we’re honest with ourselves, we   admit that we as a group don’t have a clear view—we haven’t decided between these two   theories Policy robustness suggests acting as if either could be true  In this instance, the two   don’t conflict; they coincide Both a focus on the base and a focus on the credit programs   suggest we do more now because the economy has weakened in the last couple of months   What that perspective suggests to me is two things  First, that in the materials we   distribute before the meeting (this is something I have discussed with our secretary) it’s hard for   me to evaluate alternatives that differ in the size of one program on our balance sheet—the            March 17–18, 2009 83 of 266  SOMA—without having a sense of what’s happening to the rest of our balance sheet  There’s a   substantial amount of uncertainty about the TALF, about the CPFF rolling off, and so on  It   would make more sense, at least to me, for us to evaluate alternatives in terms of where the base   is going to be And this perspective of thinking that the base matters is one that leads me to think   that maybe we should specify policy in terms of the base   The second implication that it suggests to me is that we might want to direct the Desk to   ensure that the base does at least something—that it at least achieves a certain level or that it   doesn’t go down in the intermeeting period  We could set an objective and say, “By the next   meeting the base goes up by at least X”  Such a line in the directive wouldn’t conflict with any   credit programs, but it would direct the Desk to offset any unanticipated falls in the base due to a   running off of the credit programs  This is something I’d like to see us consider and talk about   tomorrow   More broadly, I like President Bullard’s idea—and I think that’s the way we ought to   think about this—that we’ve got to vary what we plan to do with the base in response to   economic conditions, as in a sort of a reaction function  I think we’re kind of groping toward   this What the New York staff did in forecasting the base is a great start, but it’s a little hard to   get a handle on such a large aggregate number so far ahead  I’m not looking for daily or weekly   forecasts of the base—that would be a little overkill  But something with a bit more granularity   on the time scale might be useful  I recognize there’s a lot of uncertainty about what these other   contributors to fluctuations in the base are going to do in the near term, and we ought to take that   into account But I think setting a floor for the path for the base in the near term has some   usefulness to it              March 17–18, 2009 84 of 266  About mortgage-backed securities versus Treasuries, I have a preference for Treasuries    The reason is twofold I was asking Ms Mosser about flexibility, and I thought that maybe   intervening in Treasuries would be a little more flexible than in agencies  But, more broadly, I   worry about the exit problem, and I worry about the optics of a situation in which, when the   recovery begins, we’re holding a huge portion of the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac securities,   and we’re contemplating selling it off in order to tighten monetary policy  I worry about what   elected political officials will have to say about that and what pressure they might bring to bear   on us to forestall selling off a big agency portfolio  I think we’d face much less pressure with   regard to Treasuries, appealing as we would to the 1951 accord   About FX swaps, I have very mixed feelings for live institutions  I’m very concerned   that the presence of it, which the banks would obviously come to be aware of, would diminish   their incentive to inoculate themselves against the circumstances that would give rise to their   need for it, despite the best efforts of our supervisory staff to ensure they pursue those   inoculations I think Case 3 is persuasive in conjunction with the closedown or windup of a large   institution So I’m willing to reluctantly support it  I think we ought to be transparent about it,   as President Rosengren said   About an accord, what you’ve outlined is not my ideal accord  I don’t think that the   credit-risk-free line you’ve sketched is a bright one  I think that the price that we’re paying is   pretty high in terms of using the TALF to fund what in early February was announced as   something that would be funded by the FDIC Bank rescues, I think, are worthwhile; buying   toxic assets is very worthwhile I think it’s very important that it gets done  Something clean   and simple and uncomplicated has much to recommend it, so I find myself supporting President   Rosengren on this, for some straightforward program               March 17–18, 2009 85 of 266  At the last meeting, we talked a lot about the TALF  I won’t rehearse the things I said   then about it, but I’ll note now that to some extent what we’re doing is recreating leverage  I   thought that there’s at least a case that a lot of what went wrong in the last decade was excessive   leverage And if you think too-big-to-fail is a problem, it’s a problem because it leads to   excessive leverage We seem to be trying to restore the status quo ex ante conditions in credit   markets by restoring the same extent of leverage, and I’m not sure that that’s the right   philosophy I’m not sure that we can have a lot of confidence about the incentives of the private   participants in the partnership  Are their incentives going to be to price it cleanly or to overpay   because they have the downside put to us?  I’m not sure I see analytically how that works out   I’d like to get rid of the ring fences very soon  I think New York has executed theirs We   in Richmond have not executed ours  If there’s any chance of relieving us of having to execute   that legal document, I’d really appreciate it  [Laughter] But I’m not getting my hopes up,   obviously I take it that this would require congressional action to authorize the Treasury to take   this?    About Fed bills, I agree with President Plosser that it’s something that would weaken our   ability in the future to resist entreaties to provide funding for something that the Administration   would rather not go to the Congress for This is not a comment on our current political   independence I’m confident that you’ve undertaken everything that we have discussed in   making a full independent judgment about what was worthwhile for the Federal Reserve  I just   worry about future political leaders and the situation we could find ourselves in one day   About resolution techniques, it has always struck me that there are two things that get   talked about there in one bundle  One is technical legal provisions of conservatorship authority   and the laws around resolving them, and the other is funding  We have a model that works with           March 17–18, 2009 86 of 266  banks, and the funding of that is pretty transparent  I’d rather not get us involved in similar   resolution funding for some other types of institutions  Let me just point out that the original   accord gave us independent control over our balance sheet, and I’m not sure this really restores   that Thank you, Mr Chairman    I’d like to ask what you mean by “improved liquidity” in this context   because we use that term a lot There’s a market, there are some sales, there’s a bid and there’s   an asked, there’s a certain flow We come in and we buy a lot  That increases the volume  Then   afterwards, the price is presumably higher  When you say “liquidity is improved,” do you mean   there’s increased the volume because we added volume by purchasing a bunch, or do you mean   the bid-asked spreads are lower?  Or do you mean the price is higher?           March 17–18, 2009 99 of 266   So even apart from our volume, other people’s volume is higher    Mr Stockton, what did you say about auto prices?  I didn’t quite catch   what made you believe they were going to reverse      Thanks           March 17–18, 2009 119 of 266   Thank you, Mr Chairman  The clear deterioration in the real economic   outlook since our last meeting is consistent with the information we had from the Fifth District    All our survey indexes remained at very low levels  The forward-looking components of most   weakened as well  The Carolinas have been particularly hard-hit in recent months  Their   economy is manufacturing-intensive and export-oriented, more so than the rest of the country,   and their housing markets, which had lagged the national cycle, have weakened substantially in   the last year   I was pleasantly surprised by the retail sales numbers and the Greenbook’s improved   outlook for consumption expenditures, which suggest that diminishing marginal returns to   cutbacks in discretionary spending may be setting in  I’m a little wary about making too much of   it I think the weak labor market is going to weaken further, and the possibility of further   declines in wealth could easily drive household spending down another step   I’d note though that in more normal times a significant deterioration in the forecast from   one Greenbook to the next would bring with it a revision in the assumed policy path for the fed           March 17–18, 2009 141 of 266  funds rate Now that we’re at zero, I’d expect a commensurate revision in the path for our   balance sheet If I’m reading the Greenbook correctly, the staff hasn’t made any change to their   baseline policy assumptions, and I would have thought the Greenbook would have built in more   expansion of credit programs or the monetary base or both   In this context, it’s striking that, as I mentioned yesterday, the monetary base has   declined by $200 billion since the beginning of the year  I’m looking at daily averages over the   first two weeks of January versus the period ending, I think, March 11  I understand some big   MBS transactions settled on March 12, so there’s a tiny little spike in the figures  But, still, that   was striking The base obviously remains at a very high level, consistent with our statements,   but I wonder if that $200 billion decline means that we tightened policy since the beginning of   the year I don’t think we know one way or the other, but I’d think we would want to make sure   we increase the base whenever the outlook deteriorates significantly  This is why I think it   would be useful for us to begin outright purchases of Treasuries, and moreover, I’d like to   suggest that we explicitly direct the Desk to make sure that the monetary base expands by a   significant amount during the policy period—maybe even put the number into the directive for   the intermeeting period  Thank you, Mr Chairman    My question is actually for Ms Mosser  If we adopted either B′ or the   schedule that the Chairman suggested, and you were to pace it the way you would, what are the   chances that the monetary base will shrink in the next intermeeting period?  You’ve got the TAF,   CPFF, AMLF, and foreign exchange swap lines Is there a significant chance that you won’t   make enough purchases in the intermeeting period to offset other declines in our assets and leave   the monetary base shrunken rather than expanded over the period?    Do you think the base is likely to increase?  Would that be your   expectation?    A couple hundred billion, would you guess?        March 17–18, 2009 178 of 266   The current size is around 400 or 500 billion?    Just to pursue this a little more, what’s sketched out here is $1¼ trillion   of increases in our assets above what they otherwise would be  If we were interested in assuring   that a certain portion of that passed through to the base, that might call for even more offsetting   increases   Let me ask something operational  If we wanted to be sure that the base expanded, or   that it expanded by a certain amount, could you vary Treasury purchases within the intermeeting        March 17–18, 2009 179 of 266  period in a way that would react to incoming information on the foreign exchange swap usage,   and the like, to achieve that?    Thank you, Mr Chairman    Well, you understand my concern  There is $1 trillion on our balance   sheet that is demand-driven and could roll off in very uncertain circumstances  I’m not quite   sure whether that will happen or not  So you can understand why this leaves a fair amount of   uncertainty about where the base is going to be at the end of the year               March 17–18, 2009 180 of 266   I am not sure I understand one point about this  Presidents Bullard and   Plosser propose a geometric path  But why not pick an endpoint and go linearly to that?  That is   what we are doing with the MBS so far Doesn’t that make more sense?  We could still call that   10 percent per month    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Obviously, sentiment is pretty gloomy   around the table, and there’s a fair amount of consensus that we want to make monetary policy   more aggressively stimulative with our actions at this meeting, and we’re grappling with how to              March 17–18, 2009 193 of 266  structure that shift  I think it makes sense to embark on a fairly aggressive asset purchase   program, but I think we ought to admit that we’re fairly uncertain about how our actions are   going to go about affecting the economy  This isn’t different in principle from four years ago—   then we were unsure about how another quarter point one way or another was going to affect the   economy  But the magnitude of the uncertainty is quite significant here   We’ve talked around this table for a year and a half about different theories of how these   programs and our actions are affecting the economy  We’ve talked about credit market frictions,   asymmetric information, and other frictions that might inhibit certain markets’ ability to respond   adequately to disruptions We’re not going to settle that debate here  We’ve also talked about   the effect of changes in the monetary base  Banks appear to have absorbed a humongous amount   of reserve holdings without a readily discernible effect on a lot of other aspects of their behavior    It suggests banks are more or less indifferent between holding reserve balances and other assets   that function as very liquid reserves  And, if so, that rationalizes the view I’ve heard some   express that increasing the supply of bank reserves is generally going to be ineffective at the   margin  And there are some readings of historical episodes of very low interest rates that are   consistent with that as well   But this logic has its limits  Commercial banks hold only about $13 trillion in Treasury   and agency securities, so if there’s a flat spot in the demand curve by banks for bank reserves, it   might not take that much more of an increase in our balance sheet to get past that flat spot  And   if we do that, I think there’s bound to be some effect; there just has to be a finite upper limit on   this flat spot of the demand curve for reserves  And even before that, I’d expect some rates of   return to have to change I have a bank in my District that held $136 billion in reserves a couple   of days ago Surely the configuration of repo rates and the other instruments they operate in              March 17–18, 2009 194 of 266  must have an effect on their willingness to hold that much in reserves  It’s really hard to know   where that upper bound is—where the end of the flat spot is—because we don’t have much data   to draw on; but I think it must be there  So, as I argued yesterday, I think we need to recognize   some uncertainty about which theories are the right ones to rely on and how to think about what   we do   I take the credit easing we’ve done—program by program, aimed market by market—as   arguing that more of those programs in more of those markets is more stimulative than fewer in   lower dollar amounts  I think that the logic of this focus on the monetary base also suggests that   more monetary base is more stimulative than less  So, in the current setting, I think trying to   ensure that we at least achieve a certain amount of growth in the base is consistent with both   views and worth pursuing That’s what has motivated my line of questioning for Patricia   Mosser, and it motivates why I’d like to suggest that we put a clause in the directive, at the end   of sentence four, that says, “but should ensure that the monetary base expands by at least X   billion dollars during the intermeeting period”  I don’t think we should conduct policy by   slapping 47 constraints on the Desk at every meeting, but it strikes me as a small thing to ask in   order to be sure that the stimulus that might be withdrawn as some of these programs roll off is   offset as we go forward   I would favor the larger program that you outlined, Mr Chairman, with the $300 billion,   the $750 billion, and the $100 billion increases  I like the idea behind the suggestion of   Presidents Plosser and Bullard about putting a commitment to a pattern of purchases in the   statement  But for the reasons I just outlined, I’m not sure that gets us where we want to be  It   seems to me that if we did that, and yet the balance sheet went down by the end of the year   because of a bunch of other stuff rolling off, I’m not sure we’d be persuaded that we had made                  March 17–18, 2009 195 of 266  monetary policy more stimulative or eased credit  So I’d like to see us focus on the overall size   of our balance sheet and our programs and the base  That would provide as well with an   overarching framework, a kind of coherence to what we do, to convey the sense that we’re not   just responding market by market, but that we have an overarching conception of how we’re   providing stimulus and how we’re going to get through this  And I share the view of Presidents   Fisher, Plosser, and Bullard that toning down the language would be useful  It has always been   the case that there’s a mapping from words we use, like “somewhat adverse,” to people’s   interpretations, which are much scarier than “somewhat adverse” I think we’re stepping outside   that mapping when we go as far as we did in the statement as it’s drafted    If I could suggest, because of the possibility of SFP or Fed bills, you   might want to try both the base and the balance sheet, rather than choose one    It’s the “severe contraction” phrase, I think, that gets attention    If I can respond very briefly to Governor Kohn, I agree with everything   you said about uncertainty, about the mechanisms by which changes in the monetary base are   transmitted to economic conditions, and about the difficulty of articulating how those   mechanisms would work  I wouldn’t advocate putting all of our marbles in that policy   transmission mechanism  I’d just note that it’s a viable contender, and we ought to act as if that   might be how we’re affecting the economy  Hitting a target for monetary base growth, plus or   minus, isn’t what I was advocating  I was just thinking about making sure it’s at least as   stimulative as we think it ought to be  I appreciate his comments  Thank you    Surely, if the economy recovers, it’s going to be a combination of policy   actions and market forces  Surely that’s the case    The directive?    Can we use Directive A?    That works     Thank you     I want to express my appreciation to the staff for the comprehensive and   voluminous information that they have presented this time about balance sheet projections,   breaking out the components and doing a thorough job of presenting the implications for the        April 28–29, 2009 21 of 201  base, all the components, and the liabilities  I think it’s an excellent, comprehensive, and much   better framework for the Committee   Mr Chairman, the staff material presented included a memo that I think Brian Madigan   distributed about the simulations There was one about the interest rate effects, large-scale asset   purchases, and other work about the effects of different things  Would it be safe to assume that   there’s a later part of our program in which the staff will be discussing that?  If I had questions   about the economic effects of changes in our balance sheet for the staff, would that be a more   appropriate time to bring it up?    Great Thank you    In the past, the Richmond Bank and I, myself, have had a tradition of   voting against these Earlier this year I did vote in favor of the swap lines that were introduced   as part of our management of this crisis  I’m willing to support these, given that a reexamination   of these is under way The distinction in my mind is the association of these particular swap   lines with the history of foreign exchange intervention, which has been thought of as fiscal   policy and outside the bounds of this institution, quaint as that notion may seem these days    [Laughter] So I’m happy to support this now    Yes I would like to ask a question about the effect of our balance sheet   expansion on the economy I notice that the staff has come around to the view that purchases of   Treasuries or MBS are likely to have roughly equal, similar magnitude, effects on a range of   interest rates As I have argued, that is the natural place to start  A couple of points in some of   the staff material mentioned that the amount of reserves on bank balance sheets could crowd out   private lending I wanted to explore that a bit because it is at the core of our struggles to figure   out just how the stimulus of a larger balance sheet works  I take it that the way your analysis   works is that microeconomically, market by market, Treasuries do this and MBS do that, based   on the ratios that you calculate, and you estimate the effects that way  But on bank lending,   wouldn’t it be the case that the Treasuries or the MBS that we purchased would free up space on        April 28–29, 2009 36 of 201  private-sector balance sheets that would crowd in private lending in an amount equal to the   amount that the increase in reserves on bank balance sheets would crowd out private lending?    Well, let me follow that up  Let’s say it all comes from outside the   banking sector Then you have all these folks outside the banking sector, and they all have bank   deposits because we buy these through banks So the liability side of all the banks has gone up    As a first step, that doesn’t change the capital ratio, but the traditional sort of money market   buyer’s story, that traditional mechanism, has banks, when they have more reserves relative to   deposits than they want, lending it out and scaling up their balance sheet  And while the   standard money-and-banking textbook leaves bank capital aside, the natural extension is that   they are able to bid for capital in the appropriate ratio to the size of their balance sheet  Granted,   some banks are currently holding lots of these reserves and are having difficulty raising private-  sector capital now and are not in a strong position to increase the balance sheet  But there is the   rest of the banking sector, and the reserves can easily be lent to them and find their way through   the usual mechanism  So it seems as though there ought to be the opportunity for that inflow of   deposits to finance itself That is just a one-for-one effect  Then, on top of that, you have the   potential for a multiplier effect  Right?        April 28–29, 2009 37 of 201  The reason I ask about this is that the usual prediction would have been that this amount   of reserves would have just led to an explosion in M2, an explosion of lending, and a burst of   inflation You mentioned at the beginning that one way to think about this is, well, we are   buying Treasuries from banks, so they are holding more reserves, but we are on the flat part of   the demand curve because of interest on reserves  So what we are adding in reserves is a perfect   substitute for what we are taking out—short-term Treasury bills  But banks’ holdings of   Treasuries, agencies, and MBS, which are all presumably perfect substitutes, have gone up   $200 billion So it doesn’t seem as though it is the case that we are just engineering a   substitution of reserves for debt on bank balance sheets  It seems as though banks have   substantially increased their demand for liquid assets  That seems to explain why we aren’t   getting this money multiplier effect  But, then, we are going to run up reserves to $2¼ trillion,   $2½ trillion What if we take this baseline assumption that reserves are a perfect substitute, at   the interest rate on reserves—for short-term Treasuries, agency debt, and MBS, say—and we run   up reserves to $2½ trillion?  Aren’t we going to run through banks?  I mean, unless their demand   for liquid assets rises, aren’t we going to just push through that?  And how are we going to think   about what happens to bank balance sheets?    Well, they are holding reserve balances of $800 billion, $900 billion,   plus $12 trillion in the stuff that is kind of a perfect substitute for it  We are going to make   reserves bigger than that sum  So something has to give, and we struggle with what that is going   to be and what kind of stimulative effect that might have    Well, the runoff of bank credit by itself doesn’t speak to whether or not   they are capital constrained I mean, lots of people report a decline in demand    We’ve discussed this before at a few meetings  Nobody is as   creditworthy as they were two years ago, and there have been widespread reports of declining   demand for credit, even in the Greenbook this time as well    But the Japan experience—I mean, there must be some limit to this,   right?    If I could just comment on this—just two things  First, President Yellen,   the way I’d reconcile it in my mind is that the first part of your question sounded as though you   were thinking about the leverage ratio with a fixed amount of capital as constraining your   balance sheet and what I think Chris Burke replied was that the gist of what we’ve heard from   banks is that they act as if there’s a shadow value that they have to earn on that arbitrage    Imposed internally on their trading desk is the shadow price on their capital, and I don’t think   that those two are inconsistent     Then Governor Kohn talked about lowering the interest rate on reserves  I guess I think   about banks as choosing, taking the interest rate on reserves and a bunch of other interest rates as   given, how much they want to hold; and for us to put more out there is going to require some   interest rate other than the interest rate on reserves to adjust  That’s different from the usual   situation in which, when we increase reserves, you go down this demand curve, and the federal   funds rate itself changes  Here it’s essentially the price of substitutes  So repo rates, reverse   repo rates, and the yields on agency debt would be the first things that ought to change to induce   them to want to meet their demand for liquid assets via reserve balances rather than agencies or   what have you I think that more insight into that would be really useful  Let me just point out           April 28–29, 2009 43 of 201  that your work on the effect of large-scale asset purchases entirely ignores all of this  It’s as if it   doesn’t matter how we finance these purchases, whether by bank reserves, Fed bills, or what   have you That makes me a little uncomfortable in placing too much weight on them in these   simulations   Let me finally mention that what motivates all of this is how we know we’re going to be   doing enough—President Pianalto’s question  How do we know if we’ve done too much?  How   do we know, looking at this, when to reverse course?  And how do we know when demand by   banks for reserves is pulling back and they’re about to try to lend them out to get rid of them and   set off an expansion in M2 in lending?  These are tough questions, and I think, Mr Chairman,   supplementing your outline of work going forward with some analytical work on this issue that   uses our insight into bank balance sheets and bank balance sheet management would be useful    Thank you very much    Thank you, Mr Chairman  A bit of a shift in our District information is   discernible over the last month or two  First, the quantitative information  Our Fifth District   manufacturing survey, which you will recall is released a few days later than the New York and   Philadelphia indexes, but covers more manufacturing activity than both of those indexes   combined—  [Laughter]    I believe more than the Dallas District as well  The survey has moved   sharply back to neutral over the last two months from the exceptionally negative readings we   were seeing earlier, and the shipments and orders components have increased from around   minus 50 in February to around zero now  Interestingly, the six-months-ahead expectation   measures for shipments and orders are solidly in positive territory, but the index for capital        April 28–29, 2009 74 of 201  expenditures remains negative, suggesting that excess capacity will be restraining business   investment for a while  So far we have not seen similar moves in our service sector survey    Overall our surveys suggest a bottoming out in goods production but continued decline in   services   Qualitative information from our directors and other contacts also suggests a shift in tone   from uniformly dismal to mixed  Some directors see signs of life for building lot transactions in   some markets—North Carolina and central Maryland were mentioned  There are scattered   reports of an increase in residential real estate traffic, although contacts are not yet saying that   this has translated into increased sales  Even though this may just be the seasonal pickup you’d   normally expect, people seem to be treating a normal seasonal pickup in real estate traffic as   positive news, given the experience of the past few years   The Fifth District hospitality sector seems to have been hurt by a fear of adverse   publicity One director whose firm stages trade shows says that “fun” appears to be the new F   word [Laughter] A contact who runs a resort on the South Carolina coast reports corporations   canceling bookings for which they have already paid in full  People apparently don’t want to   risk the bad publicity of showing up, which is puzzling because critics presumably object to the   expenditure not the utility derived  [Laughter]  In West Virginia, the coal industry is described   as somewhat shell-shocked because of falling coal prices, although drilling rigs from western   states have been moving east to take advantage of increased drilling activity in the Marcellus   shale formation   At the national level, there have been some signals consistent with a business cycle   trough sometime in the middle of the year, I think  I put the tentative signs of stabilization in the   housing sector chief among these since the return of some confidence on that front seems           April 28–29, 2009 75 of 201  important for restoring a broader willingness by households to resume discretionary spending    Of course, we have been fooled by hints of housing market bottoms before  So it is not hard for   me to curb my enthusiasm  Still, the recent consumer spending numbers also suggest that a   broader household resilience may be emerging  Consumers seem to have been cutting back in   response to the general erosion in their confidence about future income and wealth; and the fact   that consumer spending was relatively stable in the first quarter, despite ending on a down note,   might reflect some households looking through the recession toward a return to sustained   growth Similarly, I think the weakness in business spending has been driven mainly by a dearth   of foreseeable profit opportunities as opposed to being held back by credit constraints  The   tentative signs of stabilization on the durable goods front are welcome news, but I think it will   take some evidence of a sustained improvement in consumer spending and, thus, revenue growth   to bring business spending back to the table in a major way   Regarding inflation, the stability of long-term expectations has been notable and stands in   contrast to the Greenbook’s forecasted expectations that inflation will drift steadily downward   over the next few years Personally, my outlook for inflation expectations is centered near   2 percent  I think the inherent difficulties in projecting inflation expectations are significant, but   there’s also at least as much of a chance that they will increase significantly during the recovery   rather than decrease I continue to worry about how we are going to know whether we are doing   enough, too little, or too much and how we are going to know when to begin unwinding the   expansion of our balance sheet It seems like a daunting problem for us  My sense is that credit   spreads are going to be too ambiguous to act on, and I am leery of taking too much comfort from   Japan’s experience So I believe we could use a better understanding of the effect of our large   reserve balances on the banking system            April 28–29, 2009 76 of 201  Finally, Mr Chairman, down in North Carolina the bankers are distributing these lapel   pins They’re little round green things and they say “EGBAR” Now I am not going to be able   to do justice to a North Carolina drawl, but it comes out something like this  “Everything’s   going to be all right” [Laughter]  I don’t know whether they believe it or whether they just want   their customers to believe it  But in any event, they don’t say when it’s going to be all right, so   I’m not sure that we should put much faith in this either  Thank you, Mr Chairman    I got this one for free, and that means it is worth less than $20    [Laughter]    Yes, but the relative depth of the market matters in only a habitat kind of   view, in which case the spillover to other markets is commensurately lower even if you’re having   a higher effect I think that is what was troubling Governor Kohn    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’m comfortable with continuing on the path   that we laid out at the last meeting—expanding our balance sheet  We did pretty well against        April 28–29, 2009 129 of 201  objectives over the intermeeting period  Asset purchases added $215 billion, and the net runoffs   in other lending, the reduction in the Treasury’s general account, and some other miscellaneous   wiggles in our balance sheet meant that currency plus reserves increased by $146 billion,   virtually all of that in reserves  So I’m happy with how we did over the last intermeeting period   This last discussion has been fascinating against the backdrop of our not having a clear   sense of exactly why and how expanding our balance sheet affects the world  I think about all   the experience we’ve had with tracing the course of the fed funds rate through a recovery and out   again, and I look at the graphs of our balance sheet and the timing of the recession, and I’m   thinking, Why should our balance sheet peak in December or whenever it does?  Do we have an   analytical sense that that’s the right timing for the magnitude of the stimulus?  Are there   announcement effects?  Maybe it doesn’t matter  Maybe it’s just the time path cumulatively   summed But this habitat theory doesn’t say that there are announcement effects; I’m not sure   you get any announcement effects in that  And is it the assets or the liabilities? Is it the base?  I   think we’re really groping in the dark here  I think we need to recognize that   I’d like to see the Desk pay some attention to the base and accelerate its pace of   purchases a little if the credit programs are running off faster than we seek  Similarly, if the   credit programs don’t run off as fast as we think, maybe the Desk could lighten the pace and   respond accordingly I think it’s going to be really hard to think about adjusting this over the   year As I said yesterday, it’s not likely to happen next week, for sure, but what if banks’   demand for liquidity, protection against adverse market events, falls or rises?  That could shift   the effect of what we’re doing It could shift us toward a much more stimulative effect or a   much less stimulative effect pretty suddenly, and I think we need to be alert for that              April 28–29, 2009 130 of 201  As for the statement, something B-ish would be good for me  [Laughter] I guess I like   the general structure of B′′′, as it’s being called here—it’s simple  But I could go with any of   them    And this is related  Governor Kohn, you described the forecast as   unsatisfactory with respect to our mandated objectives  Is it unsatisfactory because a preferable   outcome is feasible or because the feasible outcomes make us really unhappy?    I am, too  I made the mistake, when I initially read it, of reading the   plain language version as symmetrically contingent  But I think Kevin is fairly persuasive that,   in the context of our statement, it is likely to be read as pointing toward the possibility of   expansion Now, there are times in which the appropriate contingency ought to be asymmetric,   but I don’t think we intend to communicate that here    “May consider”? “Adjusting somewhat”  [Laughter]    Mr Chairman?    The word “somewhat” in the first sentence just snags my brain    “Somewhat” is great the way we usually use it—you know, somewhat   higher, somewhat lower  That is a long and honored tradition in central banking  [Laughter]   But “slowing somewhat”—    That would be much more direct    I am not a good enough writer to know why    Perfect    If we elect not to reveal names, would these tables be constructed the   way that the Census does it, where if there are fewer than n firms, where n is a number like—    I thought they were for the Maiden Lanes    Not individually, but for each Maiden Lane I thought there was an   expense line    Right, but that’s varied    If the Congress wants to make us release names, we could insist that the   names of Home Loan Bank borrowers also be released    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I did suggest that this be a formal FOMC   meeting to you in conversation last Friday  I did this for three reasons  One, to make sure we   would be able to elect Brian Sack as soon as possible  Second, the staff noted that the change in   the monetary base projections or the balance sheet or however you look at it was going to be   substantially different from what they had told us they would expect, given our plans coming out   of the last meeting  And I think in light of our uncertainty about just how transmission   mechanisms are working right now, a little consultation was warranted even if one’s expectation   coming into this might not be that recalibrating or recrafting our plans was warranted  My own   sense—I agree with you, Mr Chairman—is that we shouldn’t alter our purchase programs right   now Maybe we view that as warranted at the next meeting, but I do not at this meeting want to     June 3, 2009 18 of 20  suggest that we ought to change our purchase programs, even though the trajectory for the   balance sheet seems significantly lower  The third reason I wanted to suggest that this would be   a fruitful discussion had to do with the Treasury market selloffs that occurred over the last couple   of weeks, which you alluded to and Trish Mosser and others have talked about  One notable   feature of those selloffs is that they at times were accompanied by substantial market chatter   about the possibility that we might intervene or increase our purchase programs in order to limit   yield increases   Now, this highlights for me a communication challenge that I think we are likely to face   several times again  We have embarked on an asset-purchase program of a certain size, and we   didn’t discuss much how program size could or would or should or ought to vary with   circumstances  Even though there is language in the directive that says it ought to vary with   circumstances, we didn’t really talk about the way in which it ought to change with evolving   circumstances  That language is in the directive  So you can see how the private sector might   have been encouraged to think that, if we get surprised by something, we might react by   changing our purchase programs  I think that market participants believe about our programs   that we want to lower borrowing costs and to lower them in particular markets like mortgages,   credit cards, or auto loans And that connection, which I think has been made in a lot of market   participants’ minds, would lead naturally to the supposition that we want to reduce yields on   things like Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities  From there it is just a short step to the   notion that we might react to unexpected increases in yields with an expansion of our purchase   program   But as you pointed out, Mr Chairman, there are a lot of reasons that yields could increase   in ways that wouldn’t imply that we would have a motive to increase purchases  In fact, some of           June 3, 2009 19 of 20  these reasons, if anything, would imply that we might want to consider backing off or reducing   the scale of our purchases Better growth prospects, for example, indicate perhaps a reduced   need for stimulus Higher expected inflation or reduced probability attached to the possibility of   deflation would seem to suggest reduced stimulus  Higher federal deficits—again, if we were to   increase our purchases, that would amount to sort of monetizing the debt  Or if we were to try to   offset the effect of higher deficits on yields, that would amount essentially to monetizing some of   the debt, which would be inflationary I do not think we want to do that   To my mind, this arises in part because of the degree to which we have emphasized the   asset side of our balance sheet rather than the liability side  The way I have communicated about   our stimulus and our asset purchases is to refer to them generally in terms of the overall stimulus   that the programs are supplying  So in the weeks ahead and maybe even the months ahead, when   we get to episodes in which yields change in an unexpected way and people are talking about   how we are going to react, my own view is that articulating this in terms of the overall stimulus   we are providing and de-emphasizing borrowing costs and interest rates in particular market   segments might be useful  In addition, sort of in conjunction with that, it might be useful to   emphasize other developments that could be affecting yields for plausible reasons that would   obviously not warrant an increase in stimulus—improving credit market conditions, reduced   downside risks to inflation, and so on   So those are just the remarks I have, but again, it was out of a concern that recent market   events and commentary on them seemed to indicate some uncertainty and confusion about our   potential reaction function—in this case, thinking of our reaction function as being asset   purchases as a function of incoming information, like yields  I was just struck by the extent to   which markets put some probability on the notion that we might increase the scale of our           June 3, 2009 20 of 20  intervention to try to damp the increase in yields, which I think in this case would be pretty   clearly the wrong thing to do  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Well, I was going to say that we tried increasing reserve requirements   when excess reserve holdings were really large once in the late 1930s, and it didn’t turn out so   well    I have a couple of things I want to ask about  First, let me compliment   the staff on providing us with a special abundance of interesting analytical reading over the   weekend Obviously a lot of work and thought went into it  Let me first check something and   then ask a question In the projections of the balance sheet, there are two scenarios, but your   projections for the use of credit facilities and liquidity facilities are the same in both  Am I   correct about that?    So you made the same assumptions?    I was thinking about it a different way, and I wanted to get your   thoughts on this The basic scheme here is, you write down our asset purchases, and then        June 23–24, 2009 37 of 261  program by program you have a sense of what you are going to project for usage, and then you   add those up, and then you subtract currency, and you get reserves, right?  In the old days we did   it the other way, right?  We used to think that if we drained reserves, for example, that would   force banks to the window to borrow So we used to think that you would take our assets,   subtract currency, and there would be a certain demand for reserves, and the residual would be   met by borrowing  So you guys have turned it around    This is the economics of the market  I mean, we’re just changing policy   here, right?  Let me explain why I’m thinking about it  We monitor pretty closely the institution   that leads your league table for holdings, and we monitor the liquidity management function   particularly closely They have $150 billion in balances with us  They also hold a sizable   portfolio—$70 or $80 billion—in general collateral Treasuries and agency MBS  They view   those two as really close substitutes as liquid assets  By the way, I was a little puzzled that in   one of the papers that talked about banks and lending, liquid assets never made an appearance   and was sort of the residual, I guess   The institution is undergoing a review now They’re rethinking  What we hear is that   they’re thinking of reducing their Fed balance now and increasing their holdings of agency MBS   and Treasuries in order to get a higher yield  That suggests a demand for reserves that’s   determined by the relative yields of things  Another observation I had is that over the last couple   of months, we’ve ramped up asset purchases, liquidity programs have come in below   expectations, and reserve holdings seem to have been sort of flat, all of which is kind of striking   and also has the flavor of this other direction that I talked about  Do you see what I’m saying?              June 23–24, 2009 38 of 261   In some of these programs, like the CPFF, counterparties are outside the   banking system, but in the TAF, the primary credit facility, and to some extent the foreign                    June 23–24, 2009 39 of 261  currency swap lines, those are all inside now  Wouldn’t you think that how much a bank wants   to borrow is determined in part by how much reserves they want to hold?  Now, to some extent,   it’s an unfair question We all recognize that in reality it’s a simultaneous thing—given the   yields they see, they decide how much reserves to hold, and given their funding opportunities,   they decide where to get the funds But it seems plausible to me that they choose reserves, we   buy assets, and that results in inflow of reserves to them; they don’t need to borrow them from   anybody, they’ve got somebody else funding them essentially, and so they run off the   borrowings   The reason I ask is that in the analytics you have shown us about that, you haven’t shown   us anything about this link through reserves When we’ve had this big discussion for several   months now about the effect of these large-scale asset purchases, it has all been sort of   microeconomic, financial market by financial market  If this picture I’m drawing is right, then I   wonder if there’s a channel that’s missing from your analysis  For example, for Bank of   America to hold more reserves, that means they’d have to want to hold less Treasuries and MBS,   which means the yields on those would have to go down  So we could be buying peanuts and   Crackerjacks, and it would drive yields down  Do you see what I am saying?    I understand Well, the reason I ask about this is that the focus is all   supposed to be about exit strategy  We’ve come through SCAP, and financial market conditions   seem to be on the mend  Admittedly there’s a lot of downside risk and a lot of uncertainty—is           June 23–24, 2009 40 of 261  the economy going to find its footing?—but it’s also conceivable that something like the   Greenbook forecast comes about later this year and we get positive growth  And it’s conceivable   that banks’ ability to raise equity improves—this was left out of your analysis; you took equity as   sort of an exogenous parameter  But if banks find that, because of an increase in economic   growth, there are some borrowers that they are interested in lending to, they could ramp up   lending and expand equity If we continue to buy assets and their need for funding collapses, so   that the borrowing through our facilities collapses, we could get to the point where they’re   holding all the reserves they want Then there’s sort of a discrete change, where we’re pushing   reserves up in a way that can’t be absorbed by changes in their borrowing  So the concern I have   is the possibility that our programs could get very stimulative very quickly  That’s why I’m   thinking about what the effect would be if they weren’t borrowing anything but we kept pumping   reserves out there by buying assets  Do you see what I am saying?  Is that a possibility?    Would we want to add reserves at $100 billion a month or so and raise   the interest rate on reserves at the same time?    Well, I just worry  Banking is sort of sitting there with a certain amount   of borrowers I’m worried about a flip back to the classic model in which we pump in reserves   and they lend it, and it’s stimulative    But presumably their ability to access equity markets is going to   improve    I had two smaller things to ask about  One had to do with MBS spreads   This past intermeeting period is one of those episodes where convexity-related hedging, that is,   selling in the Treasury market, was a widespread feature of commentary, and it has happened   many times before in the last decade or so  The picture you get, and let me check this, is that   there are a lot of holders of mortgage-backed securities who hold a lot of Treasuries  So they’re   active in the Treasury market and they’re active in the MBS market Is that a good picture, a fair   picture?    So this is broadly speaking a set of financial market participants very   active in MBS markets and very active in Treasuries as well  They would seem to have the   ability to look at the spread and make decisions at the margin about buying and selling   Treasuries or MBS based on their view of the proper level of the spread or where the spread is   headed, right?           June 23–24, 2009 43 of 261   I’m less interested in convexity-related trading per se than the linkages   between the MBS and the Treasury markets  There are a lot of players taking a position on the   spread, and I’m wondering what we know that they don’t know about where the spread should   be So, analytically, on what basis would we make a judgment that the spread is too low or too   high?    This is history they can see, right?    A related question One of the memos was pretty eloquent about the   need for greater clarity and better communication about our strategy  Is there any chance that   providing the Desk with more flexibility about the composition of our asset purchases could   diminish rather than enhance market understanding of our strategy?    One final question about the interest rate on reserves and the reserve   management tools  Does the staff think it’s at all likely that the effective funds rate would not be   brought up pretty much in tandem if we raised the interest rate on reserves under current   arrangements?    Have you thought about whether we care about the federal funds rate per   se, that is, if the interest rate on reserves is more relevant than the weighted average you   calculate every day?    Thank you    Yes I think you are right, Mr Chairman, to ask the Desk for their   suggestions as to language that would help them achieve the results we desire  A corollary to   that is that they understand the results we desire My interpretation of what we decided when we   embarked on this was to achieve whatever improvement in MBS yields would result from the   quantity we sketched out, not to peg yields at a given level, not to dampen fluctuations in yields,   not to reduce the dispersion of future yield outcomes, and not to respond in the way the markets   seem to expect us to respond  We didn’t put that in the directive, obviously, and we didn’t put   that in the statement either  In preparing for this meeting, I looked at the statements and read   them from the perspective of the intermeeting period, and it strikes me that there are things in the   statements that markets could have latched onto that led them to misinterpret what results we   desired to achieve I think that’s useful to keep in mind    Is the risk all to the downside?    Yes But is termination also potentially a signal of the confidence we   have in the economy and financial conditions?  Is there a chance they’d interpret it that way?    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll start with our instructions to the Desk on   asset purchases I agree with Governor Kohn, and I was going to express it the same way—for   clarity of instructions, fixing a price or fixing a quantity really can’t be beat  I agree with   President Bullard that a reaction function would be preferable on some grounds, and if we were   able to communicate a well-understood one, that would be great  But in this instance I just don’t   think we have the time to communicate that in a way that does not add uncertainty about the   exact way in which we’re likely to react to incoming data  Moreover, I want to emphasize that I   think we should give the Desk less discretion, and I do that without any lack of respect for the   tremendous acumen and skill of the people on the Desk  It’s just that it places an impossible   burden on them to operationalize our terms of art in the directive and to communicate that           June 23–24, 2009 96 of 261  coherently to markets in a way that doesn’t add chatter that we don’t need and that distracts us   from what we’re doing   As for monetizing debt, we’re monetizing mortgage-backed securities just as much as   we’re monetizing debt  I think the danger—and this has been the danger this spring—is   conveying that the amount we monetize might vary with the amount the government issues    That’s something we have to stay away from, and it’s another reason not to go down the path of   seeking to adopt a kind of a reaction function that tries to skin a bunch of cats   As to our exit strategy, I think we’re likely to be in this situation with zero interest rates   for a while But I have a hard time ruling out the possibility that, if the Greenbook’s expectation   comes true, towards the end of the year there will be another gigantic sigh of relief, much as we   experienced after the bottom in March—maybe not euphoria, but a turn in expectations and   sentiment that makes the world look different and makes us at least want to think about backing   away from stimulus before the end of the year  I have no idea how likely that is, but I think we   need to pay attention to the amount of stimulus we’re providing and the effects we’re having  I   think we need to pay attention to the banking system, in particular, and to monitor bank asset   holdings and their liquid liabilities and that channel for policy  Sure, we were intervening in   order to reduce MBS rates and to reduce Treasury yields below what they otherwise would have   been Granting that, it’s not clear which of those two channels had the bigger effect  But we   need to be thinking about the timing—what it’s going to look like when it’s going to be the right   time   I think that it’s too early to signal that we’re thinking about exiting, but it’s not too early   to explain in the Monetary Policy Report that we are thinking about what it would be like    We’re not thinking about doing it yet, but we’re planning and thinking carefully about the           June 23–24, 2009 97 of 261  mechanics of it  I think that raising the interest rate on reserves seems quite likely to succeed    To my mind, the most logical and natural path forward on this issue of reserve management is to   use this opportunity to back away from federal funds rate targeting  We’ve backed away from   nonborrowed reserves targeting If historically, by some fluke, we had been targeting RP rates   over the last three decades, I don’t think we would have known the difference, and yet RP rates   never equaled the fed funds rate So I don’t think we have a real strong reason to tie ourselves to   the federal funds rate as opposed to the RP rate The interest rate on reserves in this regime is   going to be the relevant marginal rate for banks  So when the time comes, I think we just back   away from the target, explain that, “here’s our policy rate, the interest on reserves,” and let it go   at that   As a result—and this is sort of related—I think we should be really hesitant to engage in   clever tinkering to try to get around problems with this, as good as we seem to have been at   clever tinkering recently So to my mind, reserve collateral accounts are just not worth the   bother In terms of changing the leverage ratio and exempting some institutions, I don’t think we   should tinker with supervision and regulation just to solve a monetary policy problem  I find the   guidance thing to be even murkier   I’m against Fed bills  I don’t want us to have that ability  I don’t want to make us a   target for those who would want us to finance stuff  We’ve gotten involved in housing finance,   and I think one of our biggest political problems in the next couple of years is going to be   backing away from housing finance, the way we had to back away from it in the 1970s  That   transition out, I think, would be made more difficult if we have this off-balance-sheet thing  I   was stunned to learn in the staff memos that if this had full faith and credit, our books would be   consolidated with the US government  To me, that has some optical characteristics that I think           June 23–24, 2009 98 of 261  are dangerous for us as an institution  We’d be seen as on balance sheet and yet outside of   appropriations So I just don’t think we should go down that road   Hybrid ARMs—again, sort of clever tinkering For us to go to these little markets and   kind of try to pick up some effect just opens us to rent-seeking  Maybe we’ve gotten good at   handling it, but it just doesn’t seem worth it to me   As for the facilities, I would have terminated them all  [Laughter] I wouldn’t have   initiated any of them anyway, but given the Board’s decision, I’m willing to go along with the   foreign central bank swap arrangement  But let me say about rescinding the GSE facility that I   am wildly enthusiastic  Thank you, Mr Chairman     The version of the output gap that President Plosser was referring to, as   opposed to this other statistical one—that’s the one that governs inflation dynamics in that   model, isn’t it?    But that one is related, somehow, in a complicated way, and the one you   display is not, right?    Well, wait  I thought you said the model stood apart  What does this   gap measured from EDO have to do with inflation dynamics in the model?           June 23–24, 2009 116 of 261   Thank you, Mr Chairman  Fifth District economic conditions are pretty   well aligned with the national situation, with activity stabilizing in some areas, though at a level   that’s still pretty depressed Our manufacturing index has risen above zero from deep into   negative territory, and there are encouraging signs for orders, shipments, and, to a lesser extent,   capital expenditures Nevertheless, services, residential construction, and the labor market all   remain depressed   I think it does appear that the real economy is reaching something of an inflection point    Since the turn of the year, real PCE, light motor vehicle sales, and single-family home sales,   starts, and permits have leveled out and, in some cases, eked out small gains  Initial   unemployment claims have steadied and have come off their early peak  Consumer sentiment   indexes have bounced back from their lows  The ISM manufacturing survey rallied, as did many   regional surveys Encouragingly, the new orders component poked its head above 50, and,   moreover, this morning’s durable goods report seems pretty positive        June 23–24, 2009 135 of 261  Equally heartening has been the improvement in financial market conditions  Equity   prices for financial institutions are up significantly from their lows in early March  Bank CDS   spreads have declined A wide range of large banks have successfully issued equity and   non-FDIC guaranteed debt Three-month dollar LIBOR rates are below 1 percent  Triple-B   corporate bond yields are just below 8 percent, off from their 2008 year-end highs of 10 percent    I think all of this suggests a substantial reduction in risk premiums  And because the extent to   which bank liabilities are government supported hasn’t changed materially over the horizon, the   improvement is probably due to a better outlook for fundamentals   At the same time, these signs of stabilization do not by any means guarantee vigorous   economic growth any time soon, and I don’t think they will prevent unexpected shocks,   obviously The stabilization in housing starts and auto sales is encouraging, but it’s occurring at   extraordinarily low levels The outlook for commercial real estate is not good—further increases   in vacancies, delinquencies, and loan losses are in store  And many banks face further increases   in credit card losses and commercial real estate losses as well  While, at this point, it looks as if   these familiar features of cyclical downturns are going to prove manageable, they do suggest that   we have a ways to go before the downturn is over and growth may be slow for a while   Since December, core PCE inflation, excluding tobacco, has come in fairly close to   1½ percent But even though energy prices helped us late last year, gasoline prices have been   increasing steadily over the last few months We’ve seen a consistent pattern over the last   several years of increases in energy prices followed by smaller but noticeable increases in core   inflation with a lag of a couple of months This pattern makes me skeptical of the Greenbook’s   forecast that core PCE inflation is going to fall significantly over the next couple of months and        June 23–24, 2009 136 of 261  quarters And it leads me to expect core inflation to remain where it is, or, if anything, to rise   over the next few months   Core inflation has been reasonably well behaved so far this year  Worries about future   inflation have become disappointingly common over the last few months among financial market   participants and among my contacts—people raise it independently  And a couple of Presidents   have cited concerns that link that to what people see happening to our balance sheet  I think   concerns about sustained deflation have evaporated more or less, and measures of inflation   expectations have increased noticeably, obviously, since our last meeting  They’re back to levels   consistent with those we saw before the middle of last year, levels we associated with price   stability Market commentary speculated about the possibility—we talked about this a lot   yesterday—that the Fed will come under pressure to monetize future deficits, given the currently   unsustainable upward path they seem to be on   We’ve been reasonably clear about our planned purchases, but we provided much less   information, I think, about our reaction function I think that’s an inevitable byproduct of the   urge to preserve discretion, and this is an example of the extent to which discretion can be the   enemy of clarity  That lack of clarity, I think, contributed to the belief—and maybe it’s not a   predominant belief, but it is something you hear—that we might be setting a ceiling on long-term   interest rates, kind of the way we did before the 1951 Accord, a period when monetary policy   was very inflationary In this context, the signs of stabilization in the real economy and financial   markets make it unlikely that we could announce additional open market purchases without   aggravating market concerns about inflation  But, more broadly, whatever we do with the   statement at this meeting, I think we should strive to add clarity        June 23–24, 2009 137 of 261  About exit, I think it’s too soon to hint that it’s imminent, but at the same time I think   there would be a great benefit in clarifying the extent to which we believe we know how it would   work and how we could accomplish that  And that’s sort of the delicate balance to strike in the   Monetary Policy Report, I think  Thank you very much, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I think we should continue now with the   announced schedule of asset purchases I don’t think expanding our purchases makes any sense   now, given the stabilization of the economy, the diminution of concerns about deflation, and the   emergence of some scattered concerns about inflation  I agree with you that we’ve sort of           June 23–24, 2009 172 of 261  normalized inflation and inflation expectations at this point, and we’re okay where we are  But   given that, I don’t think it makes sense to provide more stimulus     It’s true that our credit programs have run off more rapidly than we expected as of the   last meeting  As I discussed yesterday, it means our balance sheet is smaller, so you might think   that it provides less stimulus than you would otherwise expect  I outlined another perspective,   where some components of borrowing respond endogenously, as sort of a residual  This   perspective is based on the notion that the demand for reserves isn’t perfectly elastic at current   rates That would suggest that the degree of stimulus hasn’t turned out to be much different from   what we expected it to have been I’m happy that the Desk didn’t attempt to offset the shortfall   in the balance sheet, as the discussion at our last meeting might have led them to think I would   have desired I’m broadly apprehensive about the increases in reserves implied by completing   the path of asset purchases we’re on  As I’ve indicated, I think the impact depends on the nature   of the demand for bank reserves  If what I outlined yesterday has some validity, then, at some   point, all that buffer of borrowing from us goes away, and then the nature of the impact of our   balance sheet expansion shifts qualitatively Now, whether it’s quantitatively important or not, I   don’t think we know We have all known that we’re sort of groping in the dark here as to what   the exact analytics are of this balance sheet expansion as monetary stimulus  But I think the kind   of thing I outlined yesterday deserves some consideration, and it makes me apprehensive about   following all the way through on the purchases   Now, I’m not saying I have any idea about when we’re going to want to withdraw   stimulus, or how the economy will play out  It just strikes me as plausible that we get to a state   where we need to think about exit I don’t know when that is, and I can’t pretend that I do  But I   think that, when we do get there, we’re going to need to be cognizant of the elasticity of demand           June 23–24, 2009 173 of 261  for reserves In consequence, I think we ought to give some consideration at the next few   meetings to lower paths for our asset purchases  If we get outcomes that are on the good side of   what we are expecting, in the fourth quarter we could find ourselves in a situation where we want   to pull back on what we’ve planned I also think maybe a less gradual unwinding of the assets   ought to be on the table I applaud the staff again, by the way, for all of the good work they’ve   done so far on our exit strategy But I think we’d all admit we have a little more to do   I’m happy with alternative B  I’m happy omitting the bracketed sentence at the end  I’m   not quite sure what it means  I’m not quite sure about the extent to which we have taken account   of ensuring that our policy accommodation can be withdrawn smoothly and at the appropriate   time  So I’m not sure how we’d explain it to people  And, besides, I think it’s a little too soon to   convey, as I think the sentence would, that we think of exit as likely to be imminent enough to   warrant our mentioning it in the statement  At the same time, I do think it’s important, as I said   earlier, to convey in the Monetary Policy Report, or elsewhere, that we have a grasp on this and   we’re working hard on it Also, I’m happy omitting the statement in paragraph 2 about inflation   being at low levels—I think it’s important to acknowledge the shift in inflation outlook  Thank   you, Mr Chairman    Governor Tarullo, you mentioned an imminent announcement by the   Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation?    Thank you    I think the “financial conditions have improved” is worth having    Brian Sack, I’m looking at chart 1 on page 7 of 8 of the memo that you   distributed, which shows agency ARM issuance monthly beginning in 1994 and up through the   present, and it looks as though in late 1998, early 1999, that there was a really strong dip    Quantities got down exceptionally low, and then the same thing happened in 2001  My memory   is that those were occasions in which interest rates fell, and if I look at chart 1, it doesn’t seem   that surprising that ARM volumes are low  Now, in chart 3, you show us the results of some of   the regressions The way it is described in the text, you say that you address this ARM–fixed   spread on the slope of the yield curve?    But did you include the level of the yield curve?  This goes back to   President Bullard’s remark that it certainly seems as if you could look at the data and be forgiven   for thinking that, when the overall yield curve is low, there is an effect depressing ARM rates   because people think it’s going to be mean reverting rather than just a random walk        August 11–12, 2009 20 of 165   If I could follow up, Mr Chairman—you used the word “disrupted”   about the agency ARM market  I am assuming that this yield spread and the quantities are part   of the evidence that you would use to bolster that case  So here is the question It could be the   case that you have qualitative observations bolstering the characterization as “disrupted”—things   like market makers who have left the market, wider bid–asked spreads, and the like  But if it is   just quantities and these spreads, I guess I find this less than compelling to qualify for the word   “disrupted,” the way I usually think of that More broadly, we did intervene in the fixed-rate   securitization market  We would have predicted that the intervention would increase the flow of   credit to that sector and reduce the flow of credit to other sectors  It is exactly what we would   have expected So there is going to be an endless supply of other sectors that, because of our     August 11–12, 2009 21 of 165  intervention, now are seeing less credit than they otherwise would  So are we on a treadmill here   that we will do this and then we will find that interest-only ARMs really deserve some help, and   we will do that?  What are the criteria here for drawing a boundary between where we are   intervening and where we are not?  I am not sure I see it in the way you have laid out the pros   and cons—it makes it seem as if we just assemble a pro and con list and see what wins each   time    It was this way before the crisis    Well, I think the bid–asked spread in any market would go up if the   volume went down  I wonder what happened in ’98, ’99, and 2001 to the bid–asked spread  Do   you have a benchmark against which to compare those bid–asked spreads and view them as too   high, or is it just a byproduct of the low issuance?    You don’t know if it is high relative to what it would be if it were   efficiently undisrupted?    Mr Chairman, I have another question about the asset purchase   programs, but I understand the discussion here has been about this, so I defer my question until   later    Mr Chairman?    If I can just follow up  First, let me say that that sounds like admirable   research, and I enjoy benefiting from it, President Yellen  This brings to mind another aspect of        August 11–12, 2009 24 of 165  the adjustable/fixed-rate margin  My understanding of the empirics of mortgage losses over the   last couple of years is that they have revealed that a substantial selection effect goes on in the   choice between adjustable and fixed-rate mortgages  And what we know of models with adverse   selection suggests that the relative frequency of good types and bad types in the canonical model   is going to influence equilibrium pricing in those models  So you would expect that, if there is   more in the general population of the riskier types, you might get higher risk premiums on the   ARMs because they are selected by the riskier types of agents, and this could be a factor   explaining the high spreads on adjustable-rate mortgages now  Whether it would be picked up in   an atheoretical principal component analysis or not, I don’t know  I just mention that as   something that has arisen out of the data recently  Thank you    Yes This has to do with our asset purchase program  I want to refer to   chart 25, “Balance Sheet Assets by Category,” on the last page of your presentation  It looks as   if, when we buy our large-scale assets, short-term liquidity facility usage goes down  That   suggests that maybe banks have a certain amount of reserves they want to hold, and when we   buy stuff, they have to borrow less to have the reserves they want to hold  In fact, reserves went   down in the last intermeeting period, and we keep missing the forecast of reserve balances and   short-term liquidity facility usage on the low side as we ramp up these purchases  My   understanding is that you go around facility by facility and construct these forecasts, and then   reserves sort of pop out as the residual Now we are going to keep purchasing assets, and my   understanding is that the forecast says that we are going to take reserve balances from   $700 billion to $14 trillion        August 11–12, 2009 27 of 165  There is an interesting memo by Charles Sims and Kevin McDonald on the   MarketSource website that forecasts balances for the large banks and for various bank categories   like community banks  My sense is that there is a sort of judgmental forecast as to how the   shares of total reserve balances are going to change, but it has Bank of America—this is the   largest holder—going from $140 billion to something over $250 billion  I checked this morning    They are planning to reduce their reserve balances over the next several months, and the reason   is that the cost of carry is too high  I mean, it is valuable to them in terms of the liquidity it gives   them; but at 25 basis points, it is below their cost of funds, and they are planning to shift funds   into cash equivalents, like Treasuries and agencies, that are higher yielding and have a lower cost   to carry So my question is, What effects do you expect, if this hypothesis is true, of our   expanding large-scale asset purchases enough that short-term liquidity facility usage is driven to   zero and yet reserve balances keep going up?  What yields are going to change to get banks to   hold this? How does that square with the Greenbook’s forecast that yields increase rather than   decrease over the period?  And how much stimulus does that provide, in some broad sense?  I   realize that is a tall order, but I am just raising the question of whether there is a discrete change   in the sense of the stimulus we provide as we cross that threshold      Right    Well, I argued in January that is the effect of what we were having to do,   so I am aware of that  But we didn’t sign up to do an infinite amount of it  We want to do the   right amount    And as economic conditions change—and I argued this in January as   well—we need to adapt, just the way we adapt our funds rate when the funds rate is operative    We ought to be thinking about how much stimulus we are supplying  So the question arises, Do   we know what kind of stimulus we are going to be supplying?  Apparently, the banking system   isn’t planning on doubling their holding of reserves any time soon    Yes, I know But is this consistent?  I mean, this suggests that, when we   cross this threshold, there will be a discrete downward effect on these longer yields  We may   want that; we may not     Well, because there is a discontinuity in the use of our short-term   liquidity facilities at zero    No, I understand that the CPFF is in this orange part here  And to some   extent that is different from the PCF and the TAF, where it is driven by their demand for funds, I   think    Strange as this may sound, I am sort of willing to entertain the notion   that the yield curve doesn’t build in this sort of effect yet     About scale, I was wondering, the thought that occurs to me is that   surely it is sort of endogenous It is a matter of price  If we pay them enough, they will increase   their capacity I mean, is that reasonable intuition?    And just a question for Jamie McAndrews  Chris Burke said that   80 percent of the funds market is GSEs to banks?    Brokered, right That suggests that typically GSEs lend to a lot of   banks How many typical counterparties does a GSE have in the fed funds lending market?   How small are the numbers?  How limited is competition?    So you are essentially claiming there is an oligopsony consisting of   dozens of US banks    I guess the deeper question I have about this is—again, it seems clever,   to echo Governor Kohn—that it seems like a lot of work for a few basis points  We have lived   for years tightly targeting the fed funds rate but tolerating the RP rate 10 or 15 basis points on   either side of the fed funds rate And we have never had a solid conviction that it was one and   not the other that was relevant for the constellation of rates  Or even look at, I don’t know, one-  month T-bill rates, right? So tolerating 15 basis points seems in the grand scheme of things to be   something we are willing to do    That is a serious question    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Manufacturing in the Fifth District appears   to be running ahead of the nation, and I guess fairly confidently I can say running ahead of the   Fourth District’s Our survey index moved up again last month and has been in positive territory   for three months in a row  And the new orders component registered a particularly strong   increase Our service sector continues to contract, however, although somewhat less broadly   than before What improvement has taken place has been most notable in nonretail businesses    Apart from the cash-for-clunkers frenzy at auto dealers, retail firms in our District still report   very slow shopper traffic and depressed big ticket sales   Our directors and other contacts continue to describe conditions as gloomy—a view that   seems to be associated with the low level of current activity rather than its rate of change  I   suspect they are less impressed than economists by trends in first differences  Some of our   contacts wonder how long current conditions will last, and one director reported that people are   hanging on like Sergeant Snorkel, a character in the “Beetle Bailey” comic strip who is   sometimes seen dangling from a small tree growing out of the side of a cliff  [Laughter] On the   other hand, we have also heard reports of activity picking up here and there around the District    Both our surveys and our other contacts indicate little or no price pressures at this point  A   couple of our bankers report strong deposit growth  One cited state and local government   shifting funds out of money market mutual funds in order to obtain unlimited federal insurance    Some of our large banks—and I have seen these reports from elsewhere in the country—have   seen a small decline in early-stage credit card delinquencies, thirty days or less, which they   believe may be the beginning of a peak in consumer credit losses           August 11–12, 2009 92 of 165  But one of our banks has done some really interesting research  This is a large, formerly   monoline credit card bank with a fairly good reputation for quantitative research  Their staff   looked at the 2001 and 2008 stimulus programs  And there, because the disbursement was   staggered by the last two digits of your Social Security number, they were able to trace the effect   through their customer base  They estimate an effect between 20 and 50 basis points on their   second-quarter early-stage delinquencies from the stimulus payments this year  This is enough   to undo the decline from the first to the second quarter in the early-stage delinquency results that   they saw Now, that said, if you look at their monthly data, even with the adjustment they still   show a peak in May rather than in March as in the unadjusted data  So there is still a glimmer of   hope, but it is a fainter glimmer than one would take just from the raw numbers  I thought that   was pretty interesting   Since our last meeting, the national data have come in pretty much as expected or, in   some cases, not quite as dismal as expected  As a result, our projections haven’t changed   appreciably  It seems pretty clear now that the downturn has ended, and positive economic   growth is set to resume  But as I said, I get the sense that economists are taking more comfort in   this than anyone else And it seems as though many people are coping with the depressed level   of current activity and uncertainty about the timing and strength of the recovery  I think that, in   turn, is going to depend critically on the path of household spending  The 2 percent decline in   real consumption from the end of ’07 through the beginning of this year has been fairly   extraordinary But the fact that consumption has been fairly flat this year I take as encouraging,   considering the decline in compensation and the tightening in credit terms over that period  This   suggests that consumer spending is likely to expand if labor market conditions stabilize and the   recent gains in household net worth are sustained  That expansion is likely to be at a cautious           August 11–12, 2009 93 of 165  pace, however  Labor market conditions may stop deteriorating, but they are unlikely to improve   dramatically anytime soon, I think  And any recovery in consumer creditworthiness is likely to   depend on improvements in consumer income prospects   For other components of demand, the outlook is more mixed, as some of you have said    The prospects in nonresidential construction are bleak, given the ongoing rise in vacancy rates    But the inventory swing in GDP is going to give us a second-half boost, and the drag from   residential investment appears to be lessening as housing starts begin to affect the flow of   residential construction spending   Inflation has been sort of choppy lately but reasonably well contained  Core PCE over   the last six months averaged 18 percent or a few tenths lower if you back out those tobacco tax   hikes One widespread view is that some sort of output gap is going to hold down inflation    There has been a little commentary on this so far around this table  This situation bears some   resemblance to the beginning of the last recovery in late 2003, when the Greenbook forecast had   inflation falling to 1 percent because of the remaining slack in the economy at that time  Of   course, we had that scare in early 2003, when core inflation seemed to fall below 1 percent for a   time  But by the time of the December meeting, inflation was running around 2 percent in the   data we had at that meeting  Moreover, TIPS inflation compensation had risen pretty sharply in   the second half of 2003, so inflation expectations and our expectations about the output gap were   giving conflicting signals about how inflation was going to evolve  As it turned out, what we got   was a small inflation scare in 2004, not disinflation  Overall inflation turned out to be 3 percent   in ’04 Core inflation was 2¼ percent And it suggests that, at least in that episode, expectations   trumped the gap     August 11–12, 2009 94 of 165  Reflecting on that episode reinforces my skepticism—others have commented on this—   about the usefulness of conventional output gaps for forecasting inflation, particularly at the   beginning of a recovery  Now you might argue that the amount of slack in the economy was far   less then and it is far larger now  The unemployment rate then was only about 6 percent  And   that may be true, but then the question that arises is, Why hasn’t inflation fallen by more now if   the output gap is so much larger?  And a recent San Francisco Fed publication by a couple of its   economists made this point pretty firmly     President Plosser and I discussed output gaps with Mr Kiley at the June meeting  That   conversation may have seemed a bit confusing  It was when I read the transcript  [Laughter]   But I think the point to take away from it is that in DSGE models, like the Board’s EDO model,   and all of the broad class of New Keynesian models that are coherent accounts of how the gap   interacts with inflation, the relevant potential or natural output is something that varies a lot with   supply and demand shocks  This is the point that President Plosser made yesterday  Now, you   can always step outside one of those models and calculate some smoothed output trend from the   data, and you can call that potential, but that number has no significance for the behavior of   inflation within the model  I think these models provide a way of understanding how it would be   possible for monetary policy to generate an increase in inflation even if output is fairly low   relative to some smoothed trend calculated from outside the model  These issues have important   implications for our strategy and our recovery, and that suggests to me that it could be very   dangerous to rely on a sense that output and labor markets are not tight enough to trigger an   increase in inflation That completes my remarks    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I think we need to be very careful going   forward and watch the banking system very carefully as we continue with our large-scale asset-  purchase program, as we discussed yesterday  I don’t think of discussing cutting back on   additional purchases as withdrawing stimulus so much as reducing the size of the planned   increase in stimulus  Our understanding of just what will happen when we reach this   discontinuity, when our asset holdings drive short-term liquidity facility usage to zero, is   significant  And there is a chance that we may inadvertently at that time begin increasing our   stimulus quite powerfully and more than we expect and more than we intend, just at a time when   we are starting to consider withdrawing stimulus or reducing the amount of stimulus we provide   in light of a strengthening economy   I see some merit in alternative C for this reason—to hedge our bets somewhat with the   economy turning and downside risk moderating  In addition, I think there are abundant   reasons—at least, I see abundant reasons—to be deeply uncomfortable with large-scale holdings   of agency mortgage-backed securities There is a sense—and I think this was explicitly   acknowledged in the design of the program—that it is impeding a structural transition to   whatever is next by way of the configuration of our housing finance system  But it also involves   some very serious political entanglements that I have alluded to before and that give me pause   about our ability to flexibly shed that portfolio should we find the need to do so   However, I am prepared at this meeting to support alternative B (revised) for now  Along   with President Stern, I think it is a little premature to scale back our announcement about what        August 11–12, 2009 131 of 165  we intend with mortgage-backed securities  But, again, we need to be very watchful of what is   going on in the banking system with reserve holdings, and it might be good to mount an effort to   do that on a very systematic and granular basis  More broadly, with the economy turning, I think   it is time to stop looking around for credit spreads to fix  As I said yesterday, our interventions   in some segments of the credit market have reduced the supply of credit to other segments, and   there are always going to be markets in which some spreads are elevated compared with the   spreads that prevail in markets in which we have intervened  That is just always going to be the   case from now on  Moreover, continuing to add market segments or to extend the life of   programs beyond this point in the business cycle could be mistaken for an intention that we will   extend our intervention deeper into the next expansion     We have talked a lot about exit strategy But when we have done so, it has been in the   narrow sense of the capacity to manipulate our balance sheet and our policy tools in a way so as   to raise the federal funds rate Mr Chairman, you have done a very good job of articulating our   capacity and the tools we have for doing that and, I think, have allayed a lot of concerns in the   public’s mind about our ability  But one byproduct of the way in which we have done that is that   some of the means of doing so allow for the continued coexistence of fairly broad and deep   intervention—in other words, a large balance sheet and raising interest rates on reserves and so   raising the funds rate without reducing our balance sheet     That leaves open the broader question about our intervention in credit markets  I think   the other sense of exit strategy that we need to ponder is the nature of our engagement in credit   markets and what transition that is going to display over the next couple of years  I am   assuming—I may be wrong as we haven’t talked about this—that at some point in the expansion   we will want it to be the case that we are no longer intervening in any market, even MBS  And I              August 11–12, 2009 132 of 165  think that communicating about that transition would be useful and thinking about it would be   useful as well We have intervened on the basis that emergencies in credit markets warrant   protecting the economy from damage from credit market malfunctions  And when the economy   recovers and is growing strongly, it seems to me that the compelling need for that will be   diminished  On the other hand, it is not clear that we have articulated principles that would   necessarily lead an observer to believe that in an expansion we wouldn’t be intervening  I refer   again to the list of pros and cons that we heard yesterday about agency ARMs that make it seem   as if elevated credit spreads are a primary consideration for a lot of these programs  So I think it   would useful for us to think more broadly about the transition we intend to make from the   current level of engagement and intervention in credit markets to whatever the sort of normalcy   is beyond that This sets aside what we want people to expect from us in the next recession,   which is another problem as well and another set of issues we need to grapple with at some   point But, again, I can support alternative B (revised)  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman    Do we anticipate our purchases to expand the balance sheet significantly   in coming months in view of recent history?    Haven’t we missed on our liquidity facility forecast?    So is it in the intermeeting period?  In the intermeeting period do we   expect to drive this down to zero and on that basis?  Is that why we are expecting the balance   sheet to expand?    Excuse me, I just want to be clear about the question  You have   described the forecasting procedure that goes program by program and neglects any   consideration of the demand for reserves And we keep missing on that basis in a way that   suggests that the demand for reserves is driving demand for liquidity facilities, not the other way   around So I just raise the question That is why I was asking  Mr Chairman, you called for a   robust discussion next meeting of the MBS program; I think that is great  This consideration,                              August 11–12, 2009 149 of 165  which we have been discussing, deserves some attention there, too  What staff work could be   done on that might be useful as well    Mr Chairman?    Are you talking about spreads or yields? And how would it affect the   Treasury market?    But wouldn’t the Treasury view this as the Treasury market—damp the   effect on yields, right?  I mean, if the spreads don’t move as much    No, it was a one-hander, Mr Chairman     Thank you When you announce individual auctions that you hold to   buy Treasuries or MBS or agency debt, you don’t announce the amount, do you?    With regard to the total program, we talked about the value of clarity  I   was wondering why you don’t announce the amounts when you do individual auctions,   especially if there’s a flow effect    Okay It sounds like the value of flexibility to you exceeds the value   that providing clarity to market participants on that day would provide   I have another question, if I could, Mr Chairman  Brian mentioned strains in the agency   debt market  I would be interested in learning a little more about sort of what observationally   that looks like    For Treasuries    Do you think the market is better off with our intervention?  Do you   think we’re accomplishing other things that outweigh the detrimental effect of these strains?    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I have three questions  First, for Mr English, about   the four banking organizations responding that they wouldn’t change lending terms  I assume you’re not   shocked they didn’t tell you they would ease credit standards     On the lending terms, aren’t a lot of loans priced as a spread over a market rate?     So if they say they weren’t going to change lending terms, would you interpret   that to mean they wouldn’t change the spread?                          September 22–23, 2009 33 of 212   So it’s sort of like a partial equilibrium response, and if other stuff that went on   pushed down rates, it could push down lending terms as well     Right     Right I have a question for Mr Clouse on these reserve collateral accounts    When you think about, sort of, a “medical intervention,” you wouldn’t run around and do that on the basis   of a two-month-old working paper; instead, you’d look for peer-reviewed research  You guys are   working hard on implementation  What are you doing to check the robustness of the theoretical basis for   what you’re designing this program around?    Do you have the results of the GSE conversations yet?    Did you say they’re putting it through their standard new product evaluation?    [Laughter]   And finally, a point about term deposits  You were talking about some features that would make   these pretty liquid—they’d be able to pledge them at the discount window and withdraw them without   penalty If you make these things really accessible, then I’m not sure why draining reserves and putting   them there would have any effect  Why would you expect that? Don’t you need some stark, sharp,   constraining differences in order for them to have any sort of monetary effect?    Thank you    I will follow up on a couple of things  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Bill, you   talked earlier about where in the yield curve you would expect the effect of quantitative easing to show   up, and you suggested the short end  I guess you’re thinking six months or less    Two or three years  Okay  We’ve seen that  But you’re saying that   because we’ve seen effects farther out the yield curve  That counts against quantitative easing as   a monocausal explanation for what has happened over the intermeeting period  But it doesn’t   rule it out, right?     September 22–23, 2009 43 of 212   They hold a fair amount of agencies, is my understanding    Yes, I don’t think there’s much debt  I think agency MBS   Brian, I have a question about your yield effect estimates Shouldn’t that depend on how   they are financed, like what we do on the other side of our balance sheet, right?  If our early   purchases were essentially sterilized by offsetting reductions in borrowings, that’s going to have   a different effect on agency yields than if we add enough to reserves that it induces those yields   to fall Do you see what I’m saying?    Right    The estimate you gave us earlier—I can’t remember what it was     What was the estimate?     No, it was the incremental effect    15 to 30    Well, now I’m confused  You gave us these estimates earlier in the   year Are you interpreting these announcements as being viewed by market participants as   sterilized or unsterilized additions to the stock of our holdings?    How does this estimate line up with what has happened so far, which   presumably is sterilized?    You gave me some estimates of effects  You were talking about   estimates of effects that have occurred so far during a period where we have essentially sterilized   them    I don’t see how you can say that  Earlier in the year we were buying   MBS, and you kept forecasting increases in reserves  They kept not happening Borrowing kept   falling It looks as if they were sterilized    Yes De facto sterilized by offsetting, right    I just have a question about SFP  If you want to talk about this more   tomorrow in your presentation, and tee it up to do that, I’m fine with that, but it sort of gets to a   broader issue The SFP is now projected to fall, consistent with the Treasury’s announcement,   and then rise again I noticed that in our previous Bluebook it had been projected to stay longer   where it is now, fall, and remain at zero permanently  I was confused about the shift in the   forecast after this intermeeting period, and I wondered what that represents    It’s a $185 billion bulge, obviously  And it adds a lot, right at the peak   of that curve there    You took into account the monetary policy effects when you discussed   this with the Secretary?    The longer-run projection used to be zero  Why were we projecting   zero, and then we changed that to $200 billion?    Do we have an understanding with the Treasury about it returning to   $200 billion?    A capital buffer for us?    Above our statutory?    Above what we do now    I’d just like to second the notion that the minimum bid rate is a policy   parameter that we set, and I fail to see why an auction would be inconsistent with raising that to a   penalty rate And it’s a little odd that the term structure is inverted for those funds    Thank you, Mr Chairman  The change in the Greenbook forecast for   this meeting was really quite striking  There were marked improvements in consumer spending,   equipment and software, and residential investment for the remainder of the year, and it is   notable to me that the improvement is carried through over the forecast horizon  The turn in     September 22–23, 2009 80 of 212  housing, for example, extends beyond the expiration of the homebuyer credit  I haven’t been at   this long, but I haven’t seen many revisions this large  It strikes me that they are well supported   by the data we’ve seen since the last meeting Almost every indicator has surprised to the   upside, and, taken together, they paint a picture that looks more like the beginning of the   recovery than an economy trying to find where the bottom is   There are abundant reasons for caution, however, as one would expect at this stage in the   business cycle Perhaps chief among these is the labor market, which does look like it’s trying to   find a bottom We have seen definite improvement in the rate of change in employment, but I   would feel more comfortable if the weekly claims numbers were falling a bit faster  I think   uncertainty about the labor market poses obvious questions about how hardy consumer spending   is going to be in the next few quarters Uncertainty about compensation growth poses similar   questions The Greenbook has marked up its forecast here as well, based on the notion that the   weakness we’ve seen represents a one-time level adjustment, and that strikes me as quite   plausible, but it will be great to see that in the numbers   The picture in the Fifth District is broadly similar to the national outlook, and I describe it   as signs of improvement tempered by pervasive caution  Our manufacturing index, which five   months ago was the first among the regional surveys to venture into positive territory, held   steady this month at 14  Of particular note, the employment component moved into positive   territory for the first time this month, as did expectations of manufacturing employment six   months ahead While our services index remained in negative territory also, overall it has also   shown some recent recovery, especially on the retail side, where sales revenue and shopper   traffic showed big improvements  Service sector wages, both retail and nonretail, also showed   their first positive reading since the beginning of the recession             September 22–23, 2009 81 of 212  The anecdotal information from around the District also has a cautious tone amid signs of   improvement  Suppliers of auto components report a significant uptick in industry demand  A   large packaging manufacturer reported a surprising surge in August sales  Other contacts,   however, report delays in investment projects due to uncertainty about the economic and political   climate  Commercial real estate continues to soften  Contacts expect construction to be lower   for the next two years, with the exception of the Washington area, where several federal agencies   are embarking on building projects, apparently  One large electric utility reports slower hiring   because their current workers are staying on rather than retiring as they had planned   On inflation, I agree with the Greenbook’s assessment that the relative stability in the   core is due largely to the stability of expectations  It depends, in turn, of course, on the stability   of expectations about future policy, as President Plosser pointed out, and that makes the large   discrepancy that he commented on between market expectations and the Greenbook’s   assumption regarding the funds rate something of a problem  Personally, I think the market   expectations are a bit closer to the mark   What’s happening in banking and financial markets since the last meeting is pretty   striking, too, I think At a time when economic reports have generally surprised on the upside,   interest rates have trended down—the six-month rate, for example, went from 28 basis points to   20 You would have thought that rates would have risen instead, in response to the good   economic news  Bill English was discussing interpretations of this downward shift in the yield   curve I would point out we were buying all across the spectrum, so the combination of our   purchases and quantitative easing—some mix of those two—could easily have been operative   At our last two meetings, I’d been suggesting that we may start to see quantitative easing   effects when our asset purchases completely displace short-term liquidity borrowing to the              September 22–23, 2009 82 of 212  banking system  But over the past intermeeting period, our asset purchases have been only   partially offset by reductions in short-term borrowing, if you take this point of view  Our   security holdings increased $191 billion, and our reserve balances increased $101 billion  And in   comparison over the previous intermeeting period, our security holdings increased by   $149 billion, but reserve balances actually shrank  Combining the behavior of borrowing with   the increase in reserve balances and the decrease in interest rates suggests that we might already   be seeing some quantitative easing as a result of our asset purchases   I’d note that, in the period from February to May of this year, we had a similar increase in   reserve holdings and a similar decrease in interest rates—the six-month rate, for example, went   from 46 basis points down to 30—and at that time bank demand for reserves seemed to be   increasing; an anecdotal report suggested that preparation for the announcement of the stress test   results, or the conclusion of the stress test, was inducing banks to build up bigger liquidity   buffers  This only partially offsetting effect that we might be seeing could occur if some banks   are using us for wholesale funding rather than as a source of just getting the reserve balances   they need Some short-term borrowing is for up to three months, and that means delays in   adjustments in response to our asset purchases, and for both those reasons, banking system   borrowings might not shrink dollar for dollar with our asset purchases   Therefore, it looks to me as if there’s a good chance quantitative easing may have   actually begun since the last meeting  But even if that is not true, we’re certain to cross that line   soon, because the Desk has made $131 billion in MBS purchases that haven’t settled yet, and the   supplementary financing program is going to run down by about $185 billion  So that’s   $316 billion in additional reserves, even if we don’t purchase any more MBS, that are going to   be added to the banking system        September 22–23, 2009 83 of 212  From my perspective, every additional purchase from here on out represents additional   monetary stimulus, and it’s as if we were continuing to cut interest rates  If you look at Bill   English’s first chart, it’s going to take bank reserves well outside of its range over the last year or   so Now, if we were working with interest rates, and the fed funds rate were, say, 1 percent and   we had the same macro data up until this meeting that we’d seen, I have a hard time thinking we   would cut rates, given the improvement we’ve just seen in the economy  I realize that’s open to   debate, and we can discuss that  But because of that, I’m not sure how I feel about additional   MBS purchases, that is, whether it’s a good idea to add that stimulus right now  I’m looking   forward to hearing people’s views about the economy and these MBS purchases  But in any   event, I think we should avoid making any commitments at this meeting to the amount of asset   purchases, particularly for our agency MBS  We haven’t made any public commitment so far    Our statements have always said “up to,” and they’ve always said that we’re monitoring the size   and composition of our balance sheet and will make adjustments to our credit and liquidity   programs as warranted, right near the end of the statement  I think we could get to the next   meeting and decide additional monetary stimulus is unwarranted, and I think in that case we   could want to finish up our agency MBS program before we get to the full amount  So that’s   where I am, Mr Chairman  Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I just wanted to make a comment about   slack, since that’s gotten a lot of commentary in past meetings from this end of the table  I don’t   think anyone disputes the correlations you can find in the data or the correlations you get from   the mainstream models we have  I think the question is  What’s the structural link?  To talk   about correlations between inflation and measures of slack without talking about monetary   policy is like talking about Hamlet without the Prince I think the point some of us would make   is that you cannot rely on slack by itself The correlation you see is sort of an endogenous   interaction I know you all understand this, but I’m just responding to the sense of puzzlement                                                               4 The materials used by Mr Madigan are appended to this transcript (appendix 4)   September 22–23, 2009 135 of 212  about what people who have talked about slack and potential output and inflation have in mind    I’m just speaking for myself here    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Now that the economy has stabilized and   looks as if it’s beginning to recover, albeit perhaps tentatively, I think it’s time to start calibrating   our policy stance a little more carefully You argued, I think quite convincingly, for the array of   factors affecting the outlook, and obviously the implication is the great uncertainty about just   how that balance of forces is going to play out  And you argued compellingly, I think, as well   for nuance in our views And I think that needs to be reflected in our policy stance as well   The maximum amounts for our purchase programs were set back in March, amidst the   bleakest days of the recession We made very rough estimates of what was needed, based on the   best analysis we could muster coming into that meeting  But, if you read the transcript, we   changed those numbers on the fly  Things looked potentially very grim, and we picked large   numbers and raised them during the meeting, and I think it was out of a sense that we wanted to   convey credibility to our commitment to do what it took  But to some extent, looking back on   that, and looking back at the deliberative process, the numbers were somewhat arbitrary at the   time  We deliberately set maximums rather than predetermined amounts, so that we could take   advantage of incoming information and adjust our plans accordingly  We explicitly have   acknowledged in our statements that we would monitor programs and make adjustments as   warranted   We’ve talked a lot at this meeting and previous meetings about the extent to which, until   now, our asset purchases have just amounted to our displacing short-term borrowing, and about   the fact that our short-term borrowing has had us basically accommodating an elevated demand   for reserves, and about the fact that we haven’t perhaps done much by quantitative easing until   maybe the last couple of months; perhaps we did so as well in the February to May time frame—   I don’t know But as I said yesterday, I think we’re at the point where, from here on out, every           September 22–23, 2009 146 of 212  additional purchase represents additional monetary stimulus in the quantitative easing sense, as if   we were continuing to cut rates   I would point out again, over $300 billion is going to be added to reserve balances from   MBS settlements and the runoff in the SFP, and new MBS purchases would provide additional   reserves on top of that If we continue with our asset purchases, my sense is that that’s going to   give us further declines in rates, albeit from very low levels, and albeit of an uncertain amount,   and I’ll acknowledge that it could be small, as Bill English’s analysis yesterday showed  But my   sense is that we’re going to get more stimulus than the Greenbook assumes  Again, how much   more is quite hard to know, obviously   A couple of other factors are relevant here, at least to my thinking  First of all, it’s not   clear what net stimulus the MBS purchases are providing, over and above their effect on   reserves If you look at the OIS spread, which has been, relative to its historic fluctuations,   essentially near zero for a lot of this year, it suggests we have gotten to the point where maybe   MBS, which are issued by an entity that is, after all, in government receivership, is a perfect   substitute for Treasuries And you would expect at that point that buying MBS is just like   buying Treasuries   We talked earlier this year about the effect of different purchase program strategies,   whether to buy Treasuries or MBS The staff did the best job it could, with limited data and   limited natural experiments to go on, to give us a sense of what yields would do  But they didn’t   give us any evidence that would refute the hypothesis that you would come to naturally, from   just looking at a standard model, namely, that if we’re successful in driving down MBS rates,   then that would come at the expense of raising rates elsewhere in the economy  It has never been   clear to me that lowering mortgage rates is, on net, stimulative to the economy  And I’ll admit                  September 22–23, 2009 147 of 212  we don’t have much evidence one way or the other, but it’s hard for me to rule out the notion   that we’re just shifting credit from one sector of the economy to the other   I’m happy to stipulate, as Vice Chairman Dudley requests, that we are not worried about   an exit strategy I’m sure we can find an exit  The question is which exit we want to take I’m   fine with the idea that we can find an exit strategy that raises rates, but I think there’s an   important question as to what we are going to exit to, what regime we’re going to be in   afterwards And I think the open question has to do with how big our balance sheet is and what’s   in it when we finally exit  I’m sure there’s going to be resistance to selling MBS down the   road—I can just sense it Our plans are to hold on to it, let it roll off There would be political   headwinds on that So I’m reluctant to have us essentially be the housing lender of last resort    And it strikes me as odd that we would head towards a configuration of our balance sheet in   which we’re issuing nonmonetary liabilities to fund housing debt—the political economy of that   for a central bank just strikes me as odd  And I think we ought to strive to avoid it   So all of these factors make me wary of increasing our MBS portfolio any more than we   need to I’m not ready to say now that we ought to scale back and cancel all the rest of the   purchases, but I think we need to leave our options open  Between now and the next meeting, I   think we’ll learn a lot about this quantitative easing question, if the projections are correct  So I   would argue strongly for retaining the “up to” language   On other questions, I like the idea of tapering  I like President Rosengren’s suggestion of   language that is less committal about the timing  In particular, if we do include the phrase   “second quarter,” the preposition “in” implies that we’re going to get all the way there, so it   might be better to say “by the second quarter” or “by the end of the second quarter”  That way              September 22–23, 2009 148 of 212  we’re not committing to purchase enough to get us to the second quarter  And I’m happy with   dropping the word “wide” Thank you very much, Mr Chairman    Well, if we’re going to do “second quarter,” it should be “by the second   quarter” or “by the end of the second quarter,” rather than “in the second quarter,” which implies   we get all the way there    Those seem consistent    Taking out “up to” is a firm commitment to the program  If we were to   see some problems in banking markets caused by the expansion of reserves, would we consider   running off Treasuries, or selling Treasuries, in order to drain reserves?  Is that an element of   flexibility that remains on the table?    It’s related to this question as well    Well, there’s “narrow range,” and “wide” is in between “narrow” and—   [laughter]    I was going to ask Mr Sheets about the rough magnitude of the dollar   reserves held by the four central banks that you are proposing we establish swap lines with    Okay Is a lot of that held with CBIAS in New York, or do they have   their own arrangements for buying assets?    So, operationally, how would a foreign central bank selling dollar   reserves in order to lend dollars to one of their banks compare with the operational requirements   of obtaining dollars through one of these swap lines and lending them on?  For operational   convenience, how would those two compare?    And these are dollar reserves  So if they are selling off government   assets, these are probably Treasuries?    Don’t Treasury security prices usually go up during times of stress?             November 3–4, 2009 23 of 201   We heard earlier that a huge amount of the primary credit facility   borrowers are foreign banks Does the borrowing through these swap lines occur by banks that   don’t have access to our primary credit facility?    So there are some institutions that could borrow from us directly, and   they borrow either instead or also through—    So one of these banks that is borrowing directly from us could lend it on   to one of these others banks, couldn’t they?    Okay    I see One final question When you refer to funding pressures, you are   not talking about the overall supply and demand of reserves  You are talking about individual   institutions that have to pay up in the market?    But I guess my point was that this doesn’t do anything for the overall   supply of reserves in the market that discount window lending or open market operations   wouldn’t do It just facilitates channeling those reserves to particular institutions that would   otherwise face high counterparty credit-risk premiums    Just one more little follow-up  Do we know whether the difference   between rates paid last fall in the early part of the day by foreign banks and rates paid after they   ceased participating in the market, which were lower, reflected market segmentation across the   day or higher credit-risk premiums if they were paid?      A two-hander?     These observations are from pre-IOER  The operation he is talking about   is soaking up reserves late in the day, which is exactly what the interest rate on reserves has done  It   is not clear that this would be a big problem    Yes, about the liquidity swap lines that would enable us to lend foreign   currency to our institutions and some other countries  My recollection is that those were   motivated—I won’t say “primarily,” but largely—by one large institution  At the time it seemed—   correct me if I’m wrong, if the reasoning goes in a different way—preferable to the long and   arduous task of encouraging through supervisory means that the institution find other foreign   currency liquidity sources on which it could rely and reduce the extent of maturity transformation   that it conducted in foreign currencies  So I was wondering if progress has been made on   supervisory efforts to encourage that institution to reduce its vulnerability to maturity transformation   in other currencies    Yes On the swap lines, I have never been a real big fan of these  My   affection rose slightly earlier in the year, but it was a transitory rise [Laughter] I find my   enthusiasm waning  Basically, I don’t think they solve an economic problem worth solving  We   have dollars out there, and maybe I am just really sanguine about the ability of the system to   move dollars around I guess at the end of the day that might be where we differ  It has the   disadvantage of our having to police other central banks’ use of the funds and not let them do   foreign exchange with them and all  So, broadly speaking, I wouldn’t favor it because I think we   can maintain the operational capability without the authorization for these things  I think we can   practice these things some way or another  I think we can manage to maintain our human   capital   On the foreign currency swaps, where we borrow a foreign currency in order to lend to   one of our institutions, I think at this time horizon, nine months down the road, the vulnerability   of any of these institutions, because of maturity transformation in a foreign currency, is entirely   endogenous It is entirely the choice of how they run their business, and I don’t think there is   any excuse at this horizon not to have pushed them out of the nest  I don’t know the details of   these institutions, but I think we ought to be working toward pushing them to run their business   in a way that they are not so vulnerable to that   As for the NAFA things, I think those are classic foreign exchange  It’s a vestige of our   classic foreign exchange currency swap things that we have always opposed  They are really   fiscal policies—the same reasons that Vice Chairman Dudley articulated   I am glad to hear that RCAs are on hold  I didn’t think they were worth pursuing, and   they seemed to benefit mainly the GSEs  As for the other things, I think a question we want to   ask ourselves before this is, What sense of urgency do we really feel about reverse RPs and term           November 3–4, 2009 42 of 201  deposits?  I was struck by that chart that Brian showed us and the new section at the end of the   Bluebook that discusses a sequence of potential statements that we could use for the exit  I was   struck that they placed primary reliance on these two mechanisms for draining reserves and held   asset sales in abeyance I would like to have the Committee really grapple with that  I don’t   know why we wouldn’t go to asset sales first  If our balance sheet were as small as it would be,   let’s say, nine months from now without these deposits, would we issue a bunch of deposits to   buy MBS?  I don’t think we would do that I don’t know why we would avoid selling MBS over   the near term as we want to scale back reserve balances  I think we ought to grapple with just   how much urgency these things require before we go public and get everybody all excited about   them    I understand the more tools part, but here we are at the threshold   where—I mean, we have already tickled their fancy in the financial markets  And before we go   too much farther down the road, I am not sure we shouldn’t think of these as the backstop and   asset sales as the primary tool    Potentially a primary strategy  [Laughter]    Thank you, Mr Chairman  In the Fifth District, the outlook hasn’t   changed much since our last meeting, so I will be brief  Both our manufacturing and services   indexes slipped a bit in October, but the overall manufacturing index remains in positive   territory Reports from our directors and other contacts remain decidedly mixed  They say, for   example, that many commercial real estate and banking markets continue to weaken, but they are   also reporting more optimism in some sectors as well           November 3–4, 2009 81 of 201  National economic reports also seem to remain mixed  We are making progress toward a   recovery, but clearly not all segments of the economy are participating  Commercial   construction continues to decline  It is likely to be a drag on growth for some time  People are   losing jobs more rapidly than people are finding them  And as long as that is happening, average   consumers’ confidence in their income prospects is not likely to increase dramatically    Moreover, the contribution from the inventory swing to top-line growth is bound to fade at some   point, as is the contribution from the stimulus     Nevertheless, I find myself somewhat optimistic, though cautiously so  Consumer   spending seems to be on a moderate upward trend, as does the housing market  Business   investment in equipment and software, in the aggregate numbers, seems to have stabilized  And   the end to the massive inventory liquidation will add at least somewhat to growth in the near   term  At this point, the distress in commercial real estate seems likely to be relatively   manageable for the banking system taken as a whole  And I think the decline in initial claims   suggests that the overall job market is likely to bottom out reasonably soon  I also like the fact   that inflation seems pretty quiet now   In closing, let me just again note the passage in the Bluebook outlining potential   sequences of statements going forward  We will talk more about policy tomorrow  I think it   does make sense in this environment to look ahead, though, and to think about potential   sequences of events and actions and see if we can’t take them on board in crafting our statement   today I will also note the expansion of the “extended period” sentence introducing language that   gives at least some suggestion of conditions under which we might start removing   accommodation  It would be useful for us to spend a lot of time talking about what we think        November 3–4, 2009 82 of 201  those conditions might be and reaching a modest consensus on what we could put in the   statement about that  I think that would be useful  That concludes my statement, Mr Chairman    Mr Chairman?     So we are not going down this path; it is just testing still?  We are not   making a commitment to any particular volume of reverse repurchases?    Okay               November 3–4, 2009 92 of 201   Mr Chairman     The research you referenced, VARs and lending, is that available?  Is that   written up?    Give us a list of the variables, we’ll run it ourselves if we have to  If it was   written up, it would be really convenient    Thank you, Mr Chairman  This has to do with your interpretation of the   “including” word The original version last week was that we continue to anticipate that these   three things are likely to warrant low levels for an extended period  I interpreted that as a one-  way thing and as that we are not going to raise rates unless one of these three things changes  So   there are two things First, I take low rates of resource utilization to be a broad reference to the   level of economic activity  Then there is inflation  I am wondering what else there is that is   relevant to policy And then I have another question    The second question is, The original way in which I read this is that we   are not going to raise rates unless one of these three things changes; is that the way you   interpreted the original?    Yes, I understand that But now there is a fourth thing that we are not   telling them about, which could induce us to change rates, even if these other three things—    Whatever it is    We are saying that we are not going to change rates unless one of these   three things changes or a fourth secret thing changes  Is that the right way to interpret this?    But it is one way, right?  It says that we are not going to do it unless one   of these three things changes But if one of these three changes, we don’t have to do it, the way   it was worded before So it doesn’t require us to do it if one of these changes  It just means one   of those things has to change before we do it  Right?  That’s the way I was interpreting it    I guess what I’m saying is that the way it was before and the way it was   done, if conditions are in this set, rates will be low    And if they are out of this set, all bets are off  We’re not saying whether   they are going to be low or not     Exactly I endorse that entirely    Absolutely Yes I think it is valuable to provide some more guidance   like this and to round out the reaction function  But my interpretation is that we are just saying   that in this set of conditions we expect low rates  It is sort of asymmetric in that regard      All right    Thank you, Mr Chairman  At this time, I don’t think it is warranted to   increase interest rates, so I am in favor of alternative B, with some comments on the language   that I want to focus on First, let me say with regard to the agency debt language, it is still   $175 billion too high in my view But it is a step in the right direction  I would support that     November 3–4, 2009 142 of 201  change I share President Plosser’s eagerness to move to the “some time” language, but right   now I think it is probably too soon, with all due respect, to make that move  So I am happy   leaving the “extended period” language in there  I strongly support adding the list of economic   conditions to spell out, to some extent, the nature of our reaction function  I think that is a good   idea I think that is way better than treating markets to an extended period of altered adjectives   on our way to our first increase   My comments have to do with just wanting to tighten up how we all understand that and   how we communicate that new language So, as I said earlier—and I did a very imprecise job of   explaining this—the way I view the little grammatical construction of the sentence is that our   forecast is, if these three conditions are all true, then interest rates will be low  Now, in my view,   that doesn’t say anything about the states of the world in the future in which one of those is false    So I don’t view it as, strictly speaking, tying our hands to move if one of those conditions is   violated So I think it is a minimal, nice, sort of judicious conveyance of the things we are going   to be focusing on and that are important, what they can count on with regard to keeping interest   rates low, and what might trigger but wouldn’t necessarily trigger an increase  So I don’t think it   ties our hands too much  I know that is always a broad concern  From that point of view, I am a   little uncomfortable with the “including” language  Maybe we won’t keep secret these other   conditions, which is not to put them in the statement, but it’s hard to think of another condition   that we care about that wouldn’t have an effect or be expected to have an effect on these three   things—inflation and rates of resource utilization, which I take to be a reference broadly to   economic activity  So the value of the dollar, for example, is going to have an effect on   economic activity  Fiscal policy potentially is something you might point to, but, there again,   that would imply a change in economic activity absent our reaction  So I don’t view this as        November 3–4, 2009 143 of 201  useful, and it waters down the conditionality because, remember, it would make the statement   that there are more than three things that have to be true, and we are going to tell you three of   them, under which interest rates will always be low  But there are some others we are not going   to tell you about So I think it would be clear if we dropped the “including” and went back to the   original thing   The main concern I have about the language is the phrase “low rates of resource   utilization” Now, let me make clear that, unlike President Plosser, I don’t object to the use of   the phrase “resource utilization” here because this is not in the context of an inflation forecast  I   think it is quite logical to benchmark our description of the level of economic activity in terms of   some normative or long-run averages or sorts of norms, the way President Kocherlakota did  So   I am comfortable with it in this context  My concern is that “low” is a very imprecise term and   could be interpreted more broadly than I think we have in mind  And to my mind, it has this   whiff of association with policy under the sort of stop–go era of policy, when we waited until we   got back to something like full employment or thought of ourselves as waiting until the   unemployment rate was all the way back again to normal before we raised rates  And I don’t   think we want to be that liberal  I don’t think we want to cast that wide a net around the   conditions under which we are going to keep rates low  So I would be more comfortable with a   tighter characterization   Now, this also made me think of President Bullard’s memo, in which he argued that the   range of uncertainty about the level of the output gap is an argument for working in terms of first   differences rather than levels of gaps And that would suggest some sort of first-difference   language here Unfortunately, the best I could come up with was “non-increasing rates of   resource utilization” That struck me as so clunky and so obscure as to not really be a serious           November 3–4, 2009 144 of 201  contender As a substitute for that, some tighter characterization of “low” would be useful—like   “very low” [Laughter] I thought about “stagnant,” “moribund,” “depressed,” and went through   the thesaurus function of Microsoft Word pretty thoroughly  But “very low” is about the best I   could come up with  I think that it would be useful to constrain the amount of information we   are conveying a bit in a way that I think is consistent with—I mean, let’s be honest here—we are   looking forward to a period in which I think we all recognize that we bring to this table some   very different predilections about sooner rather than later, later rather than sooner  And we’ll   wrestle with those issues when the time comes  In this statement, let’s just look for a consensus   across both camps  Let’s just look for something that we can all sign onto here  It’s in that spirit   that I think “very low” is preferable to me to just “low rates of resource utilization”—as   hopelessly finagling as that sounds   So let me comment a bit about asset sales because this came up yesterday  First of all, I   want to commend the Bluebook, which sketched out what the steps might look like  I think it is   a very good thing for us to think about devoting some time to really discussing and analyzing   that I am going to have some suggestions for staff analysis that in the future might help us work   through that But my presumption would have been that we would view asset sales as our first   choice rather than our last choice  So I would like to see some discussion and analysis of that   going forward   I appreciate the value of additional tools  I don’t object to our building them and having   them in place  But there are essentially two reasons that I think we ought to think about asset   sales first One is that it is not obvious the extent to which reverse RPs and term deposits are   going to be as effective at altering monetary conditions as asset sales  We talked yesterday about   the extent to which reverse RPs or term deposits are nonmonetary  Obviously, just that little cost              November 3–4, 2009 145 of 201  makes them to some extent nonmonetary  But that cost, which could be kind of small in some   contexts, is a measure of how close they are to being virtually a perfect substitute  Moreover,   with reserve balances as high as they are, surely some banks view it as extremely likely that four   weeks from now they are going to want as much reserves as they have now  If that is true, then a   bunch of the reserve holdings are in some sense inframarginal, and for them to convert those to   term deposits may not have any effect on their desire to shift funds out of excess reserve balance   holdings So there is some uncertainty to my mind  I think there is a good chance that they will   succeed but also a good chance that they will just be viewed as a perfect substitute for overnight   reserves and won’t have much of an effect   Second of all, just asset sales in general—yesterday we heard evidence from the manager   that our purchases have driven down MBS rates by much more than they drove down Treasury   rates Remember earlier in the year we had this sequence  In December, we got these   predictions from the staff that the effects of Treasury purchases versus MBS purchases were   different in amount  Then, a couple of meetings later, there was sort of an about-face, and it was   a parallel shift They thought that they would have the same effect under the idea that there is a   good arbitrage between the two Now, it seems as though the evidence over this year of   experience is that we have driven down MBS rates more than we have driven down Treasury   rates Those spreads were described as abnormally low, which suggests to some extent relative   to some long-run norm that we are distorting markets now  As we exit from what we are doing   now, we ought to be thinking about where we want to go, and I think we want to go to a world   where we are not having this permanently expansionary effect from depressing MBS rates    I will just mention as well the hypothesis—and I haven’t seen any evidence against this—   that by buying MBS we are implicitly withdrawing credit from some other sector of the              November 3–4, 2009 146 of 201  economy  I mean, it is bound to be true  So whether it is net stimulative is completely uncertain    It is not at all clear that this is stimulative on net for the economy to drive down MBS rates rather   than Treasury rates   So on a lot of grounds I would like to see us transition to being out of the housing finance   business a couple of years from now, and there are abundant political economy reasons to do that   as well I recognize that asset sales, even announcing them, might have a dramatic price effect    But the minute we raise the interest rate on excess reserves, we are going to have a yield curve   effect  There is going to be a selloff of Treasuries  They are going to know that this is it  Here   it comes—a sequence of tightening moves  So I don’t think that should dissuade us—that it   might be an outsized move     Those are the broad reasons I think that asset sales deserve equal time on our agenda and   some serious analysis as instruments as we move forward  Thank you very much, Mr   Chairman    Or we can make 30 speeches    I would point out there is going to be a cottage industry no matter what    The question is, What is the object of their endeavors in their cottages?    [Laughter] So they are going to be focusing on “low” versus “very low”  It seems as though   “very low” is the right thing to focus their attention on  It seems like a more accurate   characterization    Well, I would just reiterate that we are conveying a set of conditions   under which we anticipate retaining low rates, and narrowing that range of conditions only   reduces the amount of pre-commitment  So it makes it a more inclusive, broader, weaker,   statement in some sense     I go back to the way the sentence reads  It doesn’t say “only if   economic conditions are”  It just says “if”  It is if this, then low—it doesn’t say “if not this, then   raising rates”    I’ll pass Honest [Laughter]              December 15–16, 2009 24 of 247   I changed my mind  [Laughter]  The day we announce that we’re going   to sell assets, there’s no doubt that prices are going to change  So I don’t think “no price   change” should be the standard of safety, right?  We want to minimize the volatility of the path   that prices take to where they’re going after the shift of our policy, represented by the   announcement of a path of asset sales  Is that right?  I mean, you’re using the word “safely”    I’m sort of inquiring about your meaning of the word “safely” here    But is it obvious that any backup in rates on MBS would be   counterproductive? There’s some threshold we might want to achieve—right?—because the   data all suggest that we’re pushing them artificially low    Yes Absolutely    Yes Could you elaborate on what discussions with our directors you   envision in January?    I see    Mr Chairman?    Is it useful to consider alongside that question, President Bullard, the   question of how a term deposit compares in liquidity with an equal term Treasury holding, which   is equally collateralizable, and, thus, equally liquid, but we consider a nonmonetary asset?    Right They’re nontransferable  There you go It’s even less liquid   than T-bills    Yes, I was just going to suggest that  I think the record is that rate   change requests from Reserve Banks have not leaked—I don’t know of any example of rate   requests that have leaked I do think a little more formal coordination might be useful, in that,   going into our January meetings, we’d know that we’re getting the wink that the Board is likely   to approve this technical adjustment                          December 15–16, 2009 37 of 247   Thank you, Mr Chairman  I am not sure I have ever seen President   Dudley blush [Laughter] Our information about the Fifth District economy has been somewhat   mixed lately  Surveys indicate the service sector is looking up  The nonretail revenue index has   moved back toward positive territory—it’s not there yet—having been quite weak for several   months The retail revenue index has edged into positive territory for the first time since the   second quarter of 2007 Readings for employment in these two service sectors and expected   demand six months ahead have also strengthened noticeably  The manufacturing index has   backed off its recent highs, however, and is hovering around the break-even mark  Anecdotal   comments suggest demand has stabilized in many firms after having recovered in the middle of   the year, and exports are widely cited as a bright spot in the District  Our survey measures of   price trends remain stable at a low level   Nationally, at the last meeting I think most of us were expecting national data to show a   moderately paced recovery  The intermeeting data have generally been consistent with that or in   some cases a bit better than expected, as many have remarked  Payroll employment losses have   slowed substantially, and, as is typical in recoveries, there were strong upward revisions for prior   months Initial jobless claims have fallen more than 20 percent in the last six months, and the           December 15–16, 2009 63 of 247  improvement in aggregate hours worked after so many months of stagnation was particularly   useful This stabilization in the labor market bolsters the outlook for consumer spending, I think    Revisions that have added 1¼ percentage points to the level of personal income cumulatively   also bode well for consumption, and these developments make the recent growth in retail sales   look more sustainable  The recent firming in net exports and residential investment are also   supporting domestic production  The strong ISM manufacturing readings for production and   new orders are consistent with recovery in the manufacturing sector  Because the Fifth District   manufacturing survey led the ISM on the way up, however, it led the much smaller Empire State   survey and Philadelphia surveys as well; its recent decline might be a reason for caution about   the robustness of manufacturing at the national level  Commercial construction is obviously a   drag on economic growth, but those figures have not come in noticeably worse than expected,   because expectations were so low to begin with  So overall, I’m expecting moderate growth to   continue along the lines of what’s in the Greenbook, but without as much disinflation   Having said that, I find it hard to get a bead on just how this recovery is going to shape   up over the next year or so I sense a degree of caution among businesses attributable to   concerns about the shifting regulatory environment and potential health care and climate change   legislation Some of my colleagues around the table have remarked on that  In addition,   uncertainty about the future path of federal deficits, I think, looms over the outlook as well  So   economic growth might not accelerate much from here   In financial markets, rates on an array of short-term instruments have fallen since the   September meeting—T-bills, commercial paper, and short-term euro-dollar deposits, for   example  Meanwhile reserve balances have risen by more than $200 billion over the same   period This looks a lot like the quantitative easing we were expecting, and it may be partly        December 15–16, 2009 64 of 247  responsible for the decline in other medium-term rates as well  It’s not obvious that further   easing was really needed over this time frame, as the outlook has generally been improving  The   magnitude of the effect seems to have been relatively small, however, and inflation expectations   seem to have remained stable   The case for expecting further disinflation continues to weaken, in my view  The   Greenbook’s forecast for 2010 core PCE inflation was marked up yet again this time and has   doubled since March  The 2009 core forecast has been revised up since then as well, as core   inflation has failed to fall as expected It looks to me as if the stabilizing effect of inflation   expectations has dominated any depressing effect coming from gaps between output and   statistical trends in output, but I’m sure we will discuss this at greater length in our special topic   tomorrow  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I have some attraction for alternative C  I   don’t think we need to provide further stimulus over the next couple of months by buying more   MBS If we had committed a couple of months ago to buying the amount listed in alternative C,   I don’t think we would decide to increase that amount to match up with alternative B   I think that President Kocherlakota was very eloquent about the concerns about our   balance sheet, especially our strategy past March  I think Mr Sack’s graphs showing the     December 15–16, 2009 123 of 247  option-adjusted spread on MBS is stunning It shows that we have driven MBS spreads well   below historic norms  And I think it’s worth keeping in mind that those historic norms already   reflected an implicit subsidy due to the perceived status of the government sponsored enterprises   as benefiting from a government guarantee  President Kocherlakota pointed to the value of our   asset purchases last fall and earlier this year in improving market function, and the natural metric   for that is spreads These spreads have not only restored market functioning, if you take them as   a serious indicator, but we have gone beyond that, and we’re subsidizing the housing market   now I think we should look at our MBS strategy in terms of the composition of aggregate   demand that we want to foster  Do we want to tilt aggregate demand towards housing and away   from other components?  I understand the need to stabilize the housing market, and we did that   earlier this year The market was in freefall  Prices were falling  That was cutting household   net worth People were cutting back on consumption  They did not know where things were   going   But the market is broadly stabilized now  Prices have pretty much stabilized at the   national level, though there is local price movement  Granted, there is a huge foreclosure   overhang, but the market is working through those foreclosures, working through those   workouts, transferring those assets to productive hands  I don’t see the need to drive MBS down   further, and I don’t think as a long-run matter we want to be skewing demand towards housing   construction It’s an easy fix for a weak economy  It’s easy to get those construction teams out   there putting foundations in and putting up frames, but if we haven’t built too much housing   now, I am not sure when in our history we ever have  Having said all of that, I do believe I can   bring myself to support alternative B on the grounds that we already have made a commitment to        December 15–16, 2009 124 of 247  purchase the full allotment at the next two meetings, and perhaps not enough has changed since   that decision two months ago   One thing I like very much about alternatives B and C is the new final paragraph   announcing the winding down of our presence  I think it will be interpreted as an “all clear”   siren, a signal of our view that the financial market crisis is more or less over and the conditions   are no longer unusual and exigent  I think that’s a good signal to send  I think it will contribute   to a little more confidence at the margin in the recovery   I believe we should let mortgage-backed securities roll off as they mature  I think that   the primary credit rate is worth thinking about and studying, but again, like President Fisher, I   was caught unawares by that issue and would like to go back and put some numbers down on   paper about potential slopes of the yield curve and in the primary credit rate and think about   what it means for the term deposit facility and our overall configuration  President Plosser   mentioned this as well   The TALF sentence—I’d like to see it remain the way it is  I still haven’t seen evidence   that the CMBS market is remedially fixable  Quantities are low, but it sure looks like   fundamentals are troubled there   “Holdings” I think would be a useful change  I support President Kocherlakota’s   suggestion that we reword our reference to our assets in terms of “holdings”   I also support President Bullard’s suggestion to move paragraph 2 of alternative C into   paragraph 2 of alternative B, although if we don’t do that after today’s discussion of inflation   dynamics and output gaps, we might want to think about replacing the phrase “substantial   resource slack,” with “low marginal cost”  [Laughter]  But we can debate that later  That   concludes my remarks           December 15–16, 2009 125 of 247   Well, this is our last meeting before the Board of Directors meeting at   which you want to suggest that we execute    I know    I understand that    Actually, she was talking about paragraph 3    My sense is that it would be interpreted that something is—     Mr Chairman, if you take the model as a maintained assumption, it tells   you how to calculate the gap, and you do use all those variables  So when they talk about model-   generated gaps, that’s exactly what they’re talking about  I think the difficulty arises, as their   memo and the Chicago one illustrate, in that different models give you different estimates of the   gap, and different estimates of how productivity shocks affect what you regard as—    In a statistical atheoretical model  Right    Thank you I just want to sketch out how I see these presentations   related to past discussions we’ve had, as President Evans did  I’ve often sensed some intuitive   hurdles to consensus here At this end of the table, some participants have argued that you ought     December 15–16, 2009 162 of 247  to think of the gap differently from the unemployment rate relative to 5 percent or so  That   intuition—that the gap has to be really big right now with unemployment at 10 percent comes   from this earlier way of thinking about macroeconomics that President Kocherlakota referred to    We had macroeconomic models that were essentially static (the static part isn’t important for this   purpose), but they weren’t growth models, and they were grafted on a deterministic growth   model, and the idea was that the deterministic growth model gave you a benchmark of what   output and activity could be and what inflation could be, and then macroeconomics was about   deviations from a deterministic growth model   We faced that, and there was this challenge of integrating the two  We didn’t know how,   and we know how now The way we integrate growth and fluctuations is the stochastic growth   model, and that provides an internally consistent, coherent understanding of the determinants of   growth and fluctuations So we don’t need to rely on this ad hoc marrying of two different,   disparate models   When I think about gaps, I always want to start from scratch  I want to say, “All right,   let’s take a model and let’s pretend you don’t know what a gap is or you don’t know how a gap   is defined Let’s look at inflation dynamics  Does the difference between output and some other   counterfactual output appear in that equation?  And let’s look at optimal policy, and does the   difference between output and some other counterfactual output appear in optimal policy?”   When you do that in these stochastic growth models, what you get is the counterfactual   with which you should compare output to figure out what inflation is going to do and what   policy should be It’s something that responds to shocks  That’s the basic lesson I get out of this   class of models that Mike Dotsey was talking about, unlike the deterministic growth model   where the benchmark counterfactual output everyone was thinking about is something that,     December 15–16, 2009 163 of 247  because it comes from the deterministic growth model, does not respond to shocks; so you can   estimate it easily with an exponential function of time into a smooth statistical trend   The thing to remember here is that it’s marginal cost, and it’s just this use of production   functions to get to an output gap that gives us the ability to write these modern inflation dynamic   models in terms of output gaps—hence my facetious suggestion to substitute real marginal cost   for resource slack in the statement  Another way to look at this intuition is to think about a 6   percent unemployment rate in January of 2010  That seems preposterously unlikely  It seems   that it would be really hard for us to engineer policy coming out of this meeting to get that  But   if you’re having trouble understanding an output gap or a potential that moves down a lot in a   recession, think about why you don’t think we could achieve a 6 percent unemployment rate in   the first quarter It would be really costly to employ all of those resources  It’s that the marginal   cost is kind of high now—it’s not as low as you would think by just looking at the gap  That’s   the intuition, I think, for this other way of thinking about what counterfactual level of output or   activity ought to be your reference in thinking about inflation dynamics   I want to say a word building on what President Kocherlakota observed about the use of   models in policy Dotsey et al conclude that these models are not quite ready for use in policy,   and I’d qualify that To paraphrase Churchill, they’re not quite ready for policy, except that all   other models are less ready for policy than these models are  I think it’s fair to say that this   broad class of models is the only game in town now  What most people have said is that further   approximations to reality are all going to be extensions of, elaborations of, this broad class of   models where there is price setting with price stickiness, and that’s where the real nominal   interaction comes from        December 15–16, 2009 164 of 247  Within a model, you can answer these things really tightly  So you’ve got to step back   and look at a range of plausible models that, as President Kocherlakota points out, fit the data   roughly equally well and decide what to do If you don’t look at models, you’re still using a   model, because you’ve got an implicit model in your head  It’s kind of like axiomatic choice   theory, right?  You’re acting as if you have a model in your head if you’re making a choice    Being explicit about which models you understand and you’re relying on seems obviously   preferable to an approach where you don’t formalize those things and don’t tie down your   insights or your intuition with the kind of internal coherence that President Kocherlakota   described   I’ll make a final point  Except for the case of purely backward-looking inflation   expectations, the models depict us as in an equilibrium in which we are following, have always   followed, and will always continue to follow a fixed rule, a fixed mapping from economic   circumstances to what we choose  Maybe there’s some drift in it over time, but that’s the basic   framework, so at all times you’ve got to look at a gap  But, then, what does it tell you about   policy?  What does it tell you about what it’s going to take to follow through on that rule in order   to maintain the consistency of inflation expectations with what you would like to see   maintained?  That’s a key question Sometimes the gap doesn’t say as much about that    Sometimes I sense a large gap being adduced as evidence that we can pause for a long time, and   it’s not obvious that that’s the case  It’s not obvious that our policy rule doesn’t build in a   different response So that’s just my effort to tie this back to discussions we’ve had around this   table I compliment the authors  I learned something from all three of them, and I’m grateful for   their efforts                 December 15–16, 2009 165 of 247   We do    I didn’t mean to imply that you or the Board staff don’t use models    I’m not sure what you’re saying    Yes    Well, the answer is always going to be our policy role, right?  Isn’t it?    The answer to why inflation did what it did would be a combination of   the model and our policy role     Thank you, Mr Chairman  In the briefing on balance sheet and market   developments that you distributed, Brian, I came across the following sentence I’d like to read    “Market participants have suggested that the full potential of supporting the agency MBS market   has already been reached and that further purchases would continue to reduce available MBS   supply and endanger smooth market functioning going forward”  It has been my experience on   the Committee that the System Open Market Account Manager and the New York Fed in general   are avidly interested in ensuring smooth market functioning  So I half expected to have you   come in and recommend that we suspend our mortgage-backed security purchase program at this   meeting  So I wanted to ask you why you didn’t do that  And do you agree with this   assessment?     If I could follow up, Mr Chairman—in your presentation you   mentioned the practice of dollar rolls, that when someone is going to fail to deliver it to us, you   essentially say, “Oh, you can wait a month to deliver it”  In this context, given the timing—and   we’re going to hear a briefing a little later that is going to include a discussion of the possibility   of asset sales—is it conceivable that we dollar roll a bunch of delivery obligations into a time   period at which we are also selling assets or these MBS ourselves?  And would you advise us   against that?  Would it come to a point at which you would want to just give up on the dollar   rolls and let them fail to us?     Thank you  I have two questions  First, Mr Clouse, you said that the   staff was considering reviving work on the reserve collateral accounts proposal  Several months   ago you advised us that you were suspending work on that  What changed your mind?  Why   should we revive work on that now?     I see  I made the suggestion last time, and I hope the work group takes   it up, to look at both the theoretical fragility of the model that suggests this is a good thing to do   as well as the sense of what magnitude of welfare costs this would alleviate  I understand the   symbolic value of having a federal funds rate that does just what we want it to if that’s what we   want to have guide policy, but I am just deeply skeptical of the value of this project, and I would   urge you to approach it with a skeptical eye   The second question I have is that we have these two memos, one on asset sales and one   on alternative reserve-draining strategies using term deposit facilities and reverse repurchase   agreements  The latter presumes that we use them at some time and seems disconnected from   the former  So I was wondering if the staff had any view about an option in which we don’t use   these reverse RPs or term deposit facilities at all and rely instead on asset sales to drain reserves    The staff memos contain no information on that question   January 26–27, 2010 38 of 260      Right, and that, if this question arises in this contingent strategy, we turn   to further asset sales rather than turn to these reserve-draining tools     Well, it’s kind of apart from the relative value of these two tools, right?    I mean, you have these two sets of tools  One, we issue debt; the other, we sell assets  We sort   of never got around to comparing the two, the way I read the two memos  That’s why I was   asking you     Did you say “externalities”?     Oh, market disruption     Thank you, Mr Chairman  First, let me make clear that I really   appreciate the tremendous volume of staff work that has gone into this meeting, particularly in   New York and the stuff that is posted on MarketSource   I support the staff’s recommendations about the primary credit facility and the TAF  I   agree with President Rosengren’s suggestion about communicating it carefully and agree with   President Fisher about wanting to be able to consult with our boards in a face-to-face meeting    But that should allow for that  I also agree with President Yellen on the advantages of   unanimity   In the long run, I think we should go to Treasuries only  I think others—including   Presidents Yellen and Fisher—have said well that we should be out of housing finance and the   associated political entanglements  I am highly averse to our issuing debt instruments like   reverse RPs and the term deposit facility  This has already been noticed and has garnered   criticism at the American Economic Association meeting  Of course, evidently we don’t put   much stock in the views of economists, but still there people said on podiums that it made us   look like a hedge fund and that this was an end run around the Congress and was dangerous for   our independence  I think it paints a target on our portfolio and just makes it tempting for the   Congress to legislate or the Treasury to ask us to fund things outside the congressional   appropriations process  And I think we should strive mightily to avoid doing that   January 26–27, 2010 74 of 260    About the interest rate on reserves and the federal funds rate and other interest rates, I   sort of agree with President Yellen  I think we targeted the federal funds rate for decades   because we couldn’t pay interest rates on reserves  But I think President Bullard is right  We   should think about this in terms of our overall effect on market rates  I am struck, though, by the   contrast with last year  Last year we were talking about the effect of additional purchases and   the addition to our reserve balances and the effect on monetary policy and the easing of financial   conditions  And I expressed some apprehension that the asset purchases that had occurred up to   the middle of the year had not really increased bank reserves and that later in the year we would   see increases in bank reserves as there were no longer borrowings to displace when we made   purchases  Essentially the quantitative easing hadn’t come yet  It was going to come, and it   might have large easing effects  You all convinced me not to be so afraid  In the end, I think the   effects were small; they are what you see in that demand curve for federal funds, that scatter plot   of the federal funds rate, where it goes down to 12 basis points as we push reserve balances out    Well, on the flip side of that is that draining reserves by selling assets without changing the   interest rate on reserves ought to have an effect of a similar magnitude  So I am not sure I would   understand the kind of skittishness on this side when I was persuaded to be more sanguine when   we were increasing reserve balances last year   I agree with President Bullard that we shouldn’t be as fearful of the bogeyman of market   disruption if we were to sell a dramatic amount of assets  The US Treasury, after all, is selling   quite a large amount of assets, and we ought to benchmark our estimates of the rate effect of   selling MBS or Treasuries, against what that would imply for the effect of deficits on interest   rates now  That is a useful comparison  It strikes me that 100 basis points is on the high side   measured against that benchmark  So to the extent that our mortgage-backed security holdings   January 26–27, 2010 75 of 260    have depressed MBS spreads, I am not concerned about those spreads widening  The evidence   suggests that we have pushed down those spreads below fundamentals in some sense  I will talk   more about this later today or tomorrow, but if housing flat-lined over the next two years, I think   that would not detract much from the recovery  I think 06 percentage point in 2011 is what the   Greenbook has   I would also point out that there was a table in a MarketSource report that showed that   other—this “other” category, which I think the Desk identified as mutual funds of various   sorts—holdings of mortgage-backeds have gone from $18 trillion to $1 trillion, suggesting that   there is a fair amount of capacity out there institutionally and operationally and infrastructure-  wise to absorb these things without some short-run disruption going on  As I said, in the long   run, I would like us to get as soon as possible to US Treasuries only   In terms of timing and speed, it’s true that the Greenbook’s forecast is first to raise rates   at the end of 2011, but I don’t think we should lose sight of the confidence bands around that,   both in the Bluebook analysis and in the market’s analysis  If you look at it, it looks as though   there is a fairly substantial chance, maybe as much as 30 percent, that we raise rates by the end   of the third quarter or sometime in the fourth quarter  As we think about this in the next couple   of meetings, around midyear we ought to think about, well, maybe we need to be preparing for   wanting to raise rates  But the natural way to think about this is that we are going to undo   quantitative easing for a while, and when we have IOR—and I am calling it just IOR; I am   dropping the E [laughter], based on trouble with it, just for safety’s sake—we should think about   this as withdrawing a quantitative easing that seemed to have relatively small effects at the end   of last year and see if that has some grand signaling effect about when we are going to raise   interest rates  I think we use the statement to manage that as we see fit when the time comes   January 26–27, 2010 76 of 260    One last thing  I was struck and somewhat amused by the contrast between the state-  contingency option and the other ones, as if the other ones would be such firm, iron-clad   commitments  I am sort of reminded of Brett Favre announcing his retirement  [Laughter]  They   seldom issue a statement that doesn’t include the boilerplate language that we’re going to   naturally reevaluate things in life  I think what we are going to do we are going to end up doing   in a way that is going to communicate that, Yes, we will look at this again  I’m not sure we   could possibly bring ourselves to commit in an iron-clad way to a schedule  So those are my   comments, Mr Chairman      I’m sure the rest of the group also benefits from that as well  [Laughter]     On average, no  [Laughter]     Don’t the instructions ask us to respond to that question with reference   to a particular historical period—I think the last 20 years—and wouldn’t that allow us to always   think uncertainty is higher than usual if it trends up?     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Let me first say that I am very impressed   with the breadth of market intelligence reading that President Fisher seems to be able to do  I   may unsubscribe to Goldman-Sachs and begin subscribing to Beer Marketer’s Insights right   now  [Laughter]  It might upgrade the quality of my market intelligence   Reports we have received on the Fifth District’s economy continue to indicate a mixed   picture, but the picture has been improving marginally over the last month  Overall   manufacturing, which increased earlier than other indexes, you’ll recall last year, came down to   January 26–27, 2010 129 of 260    neutral in November and has remained essentially flat since then  The components of the   manufacturing index have been basically flat as well  The only component that showed any   sizable movement was the wage index, which swung from minus 5 to plus 6 in January  In   services, the retail index is neutral this month after having recovered from a very sharp   downward dip in December  There were noteworthy positive signs in the shopper traffic and   expected demand six-months-ahead components  Big ticket sales are still fairly negative,   however  While price trends were stable in the services sector, there was a notable pickup in   price trends in the manufacturing sector  Both prices-paid and prices-received numbers moved   up, and the expected trends ratcheted up as well   The anecdotal reports we are getting from our directors and other contacts are still mixed   this year  As I noted in the last meeting, we continue to hear reports that uncertainty about   changes in tax and regulatory policy seem to be inhibiting willingness to commit to hiring and   investment outlays  And it’s a bit broader than you might think from the news  For example, in   West Virginia, they report that a wholesale revisiting by the EPA of permits and permitting   decisions made over many years is impeding investment in coal and extractive industries there    But, overall, the reports we have gotten have a noticeably more positive tone since December  A   few examples—temp agencies are seeing a pickup in orders, consistent with the data you   showed  Residential real estate is said to be firming in several markets  The national   homebuilders are said to be gearing up to build inventory  Stability is visible in the multifamily   housing markets  And tourism is picking up along the Carolina coast   My outlook for the national economy hasn’t changed much since the last meeting  After   smoothing through the usual volatility, real output appears to be on a solid growth path  Despite   the shaky labor market, consumer spending has moved higher in recent months  Once we start   January 26–27, 2010 130 of 260    adding jobs, I think we can expect consumer spending to gain a bit of momentum  Regarding the   labor market, I agree with the staff that we are likely to see positive employment growth soon,   with the obvious caveats about risks around that outlook  Business investment in equipment and   software is also advancing  The latest data on new orders are consistent with the view that   equipment spending is likely to add to overall growth this year  And I am positive about   equipment and software, just out of a bit of introspection, knowledge of what the national IT   infrastructure at the Federal Reserve is doing, just abundant opportunities, not that they are   spending a ton of money recklessly      Right  Spending in a very disciplined way  But there are just abundant   opportunities to improve business processes and rationalize the infrastructure that we have built   up over the last couple of decades  There’s a drag, naturally, from commercial construction, but   that is only 3 percent of GDP  So it looks to me as if the positive factors are going to lead to   decent GDP growth this year and better growth next year  We wrote down 3½ percent for real   GDP this year, about the same as the Greenbook, and 4 percent for 2011, which is somewhat   below the Greenbook  My main difference with the Greenbook probably isn’t a surprise  The   Greenbook has us waiting until the end of 2011 to raise rates without having any trouble keeping   inflation in check over that period  The Committee waited a similar two-and-a-half-year period   after the end of the last recession before beginning to raise rates, and core inflation rose above 2   percent in 2004 and remained elevated throughout the rest of that expansion  Overall inflation,   of course, was significantly higher  This time around, I think there is a very good chance that to   keep inflation in check we need to raise our rate sooner than late 2011  And that is why my 2011   GDP forecast is somewhat below the Greenbook’s   January 26–27, 2010 131 of 260    Finally, let me say a word about housing, because it is the macroeconomic sector that is   probably the most closely related to the discussion we had yesterday afternoon  The Greenbook   has single-family housing starts, as I mentioned yesterday, rising pretty briskly from 05 million   units to 1 million units by the end of 2011  But even with that strong recovery, residential   investment, given the small size of the sector now, contributes only 01 percentage point to real   GDP growth in this year and 06 next year  Now, I recognize that stabilizing the market for   housing was an important motivation for our MBS purchases, given the aftermath of what in   hindsight looks to have been a decade or so of overbuilding in the housing sector  I realize that   stabilizing housing prices probably contributed substantially to stabilizing consumer spending   and household wealth over the course of the last year  But given all of the overbuilding we have   seen, the magnitude and the scale of that, it seems to me awfully uncertain just how rapidly we   ought to expect homebuilding to recover in this expansion and how much we ought to hope   homebuilding recovers in this recovery  Given how small a share of GDP is devoted to it, I   wouldn’t be that disappointed if residential investment were essentially flat for the next couple of   years and we didn’t get a recovery in starts and we didn’t get new home demand rising over the   forecast as it does in the Greenbook   So this contributes to my willingness to run some risk about what happens to mortgage-  backed security rates as we remove stimulus in the next couple of years  If anything, if we’re   having any effect on the housing market, it is subsidizing home mortgage finance, and that sense   I have is bolstered, I had mentioned, by the Desk’s analysis, some of which documents the   limitations to the ability of market participants to short MBS  I think that our task in this   recovery, unlike previous recoveries, is twofold  And this is another way to think of what we   have before us  We have to withdraw monetary policy stimulus, but we have to withdraw a   January 26–27, 2010 132 of 260    perhaps sizable subsidy to the housing finance market  To my mind, the recovery is going to be   healthier faster the more rapidly we withdraw that artificial subsidy and get capital markets back   to neutral  Thank you     Let me go in reverse order  A fair amount of capital seems to be   flowing into the banking system  There is a lot of private equity on the sidelines or being   mobilized to go into the community bank sector, for example  Large banks have been able to   raise capital, even in recent months, quite notably at the large end of the scale  So I don’t see the   economy as terribly constrained by the amount of bank capital  And even if it were, I don’t think   buying MBS is the right way to recapitalize banks  It’s kind of an indirect channel  As for   housing wealth, if what we are doing is subsidizing mortgage-backed securities and keeping   housing prices artificially high as a result, I’m not sure that’s a healthy way to build a recovery   either  I think we ought to be aiming to get housing wealth and housing prices to where they   ought to be relative to the economy, if they are being held up by our mortgage-backed securities   holdings     Thank you, Mr Chairman  First, a word or two about timing  As I said   yesterday, I think it would be a mistake to take the centerpoint, the mean of our expected date of   tightening, and plan a program around it  I think we need to plan for the possibility of different   January 26–27, 2010 189 of 260    dates at which we would want to raise our policy rate, either the IOER rate or the federal funds   rate, whatever it is   As I alluded to yesterday, I think that, if we are honest about it, we will admit that, if we   aggregated all our uncertainty about when that most appropriate date would be, there would be a   substantial mass this year  Just take for a minute the Greenbook and imagine that it literally   comes true this year—now I know Mr Stockton will tell me that has virtually no chance of   happening     Probability zero  I was going to say virtually zero, but there is as much   mass on either side of that, obviously   You know, at the fourth quarter this year, job growth would have picked up quite smartly   in the second half of the year  It would have been notably more rapid than at the beginning of   the previous recovery  Real consumer spending would have been solid, growing around   3 percent at the end of the year  Granted, the level of unemployment would be relatively high   then  But by the same token, the current level of real interest rates would be relatively low then   as well  If you look at the Bluebook simulations, they seem to imply a substantial probability of   raising rates by year-end   This is the staff’s model  The staff, as we learned before, is a little more on the side of a   later tightening than the Committee is  If you look at the confidence intervals, they seem to   imply a 15 percent chance that we will raise rates by June of this year, and my own personal   ocular interpolation indicates about a 30 percent chance, perhaps more, that we will raise rates by   the end of the year  This is in the Bluebook     It must be true then  Probability zero  And obviously markets put an   even higher probability on it  So I think we need to make a plan that would accommodate   something that has a 30 percent chance of being something we want to do  And that is why, as I   said, I favor—and this is a point that President Bullard made—a fairly aggressive approach of   reducing reserves this year   As I said yesterday also, I favor Treasuries-only because of the political entanglement   issues but also because it’s likely to yield healthier growth to take out the tilt toward housing    Then, if you think about any given path of reserve drain, using term deposit facilities or reverse   RPs, as opposed to just asset sales, means continuing with more tilt toward housing than we   otherwise would  So for those reasons I am in the Treasury-only camp and the sales-only camp    I agree with President Kocherlakota that the US financial market should be able to absorb   substantial sales  In fact, I think they could absorb substantially more than he suggests   About divisibility, I think you’re right, Mr Chairman, to suggest that we move slowly   toward an exit, but there is a certain limit on the divisibility of our actions and statements  A   couple of meetings ago we debated two words about our purchase program  We have now   advanced to debating one word about our purchase program, but that’s the limit  We can’t   debate less than a word     But there is a tension with Governor Kohn’s suggestion that we should   aspire to no surprises because you have to look at this a few meetings at a time  I mean, no   surprises now sort of builds up pressure for a big surprise, and maybe a lot of little surprises are   better than no surprises for a while and a big surprise   January 26–27, 2010 191 of 260    I think we should recognize that, no matter how we decide to play our hand this year,   there is a substantial chance of significant moves in financial-asset prices around the times of our   announcements or communications, even if those occur via leaking something or other to Larry   Meyer, which is not the right way to do this  There is going to be a point at which we are viewed   as saying “boo,” and when that happens, there is likely to be a market break  I don’t think that’s   avoidable  We can minimize that, and we can try for clarity and try to avoid spurious   movements in markets’ views, but I think we are just going to have to see that as something that   is going to come with the territory  I don’t think it needs to be something that dissuades us  I   don’t think we should be afraid of every possible discontinuity in market prices     So as we go forward—let me just add one final word  This term “market disruption,” I   am just going to repeat, as dispassionately as I can, an observation I made before that the mere   observation that prices have changed a lot and quantities have changed a lot, perhaps to zero, has   by itself absolutely nothing to say about the advisability of policy intervention or any particular   policy consideration  It is something that I know everyone understands around here, but it is   worth emphasizing because I don’t want to say that there could be market disruption if we do X    To me, it says very little  I will say as well is that I am quite open to a careful, reasoned account   of how regulatory constraints and market imperfections interact to yield some policy   implications that aren’t trivial  So this isn’t an ideological point of view  It is just that I would   like to see, rather than waving the red flag of the phrase “market disruptions,” some concrete   account of what’s going on in the market that makes some policy consideration of the potential   for market disruption warranted  And I know the staff is capable of such accounts    So I favor B  I like “holdings” because it seems like the smallest subdivision of   movement of our message  I like the final auction idea  I, too, have a leaning toward alternative   January 26–27, 2010 192 of 260    C, paragraph 2, but the phrase “monetary policy adjustments” in there in the current context is   perhaps too strong a signal of raising rates imminently  So I would back away from that and   accept what is in alternative B, paragraph 2, right now  Thank you, Mr Chairman     The sentence refers to the next meeting  Are we going to be evaluating   purchases or holdings at the next meeting?     Yes     Okay  I just added something that I thought was relevant to this     Mr Chairman, there’s an interpretation of “extended” as referring to six   months  At the next meeting, as someone pointed out, six months out is pretty deep into the end   of the year, so we’re going to have to remove it  What I’m saying is that we would want to   remove it at the time when we don’t intend to signal or we don’t believe we are going to move in   the next two or three meetings      Okay  But that suggests that those of us who have suggested   interpretations that are closer to six months might want to reguide or reeducate markets about it     Yes  I am all in favor of our feeling as if we could drop “extended” and   move very quickly after that   January 26–27, 2010 205 of 260      I agree  I take your line of argument to mean that you would not be   receptive to an argument that we shouldn’t remove it because we don’t intend to move within the   next two or three meetings     Okay  I understand that, and I don’t want to belabor this—this will be   my last shot at it  An argument that we don’t want to move within the next six months doesn’t   mean we shouldn’t remove it     I understand     Do you intend to have the same three-part structure, or are you going to   go back to two-part?     I have a couple of questions  First, on the Treasury redemptions, I’m   struck that this is brought to us in isolation  At the last meeting we talked about a range of   strategies and a range of sequencing, and yet here you’re asking us to think about this in   isolation  You folks say there is something like a 10 to 15 basis point effect on yields  What if I   said, “Let’s not redeem Treasuries but sell an equivalent amount, follow an equivalent path, of   MBS”?  What would the effect on yields be?   March 16, 2010 13 of 146      How did we do with our commitment last year?  Did they view that as a   relatively ironclad commitment to a certain pace of purchases?  It didn’t seem that there was a lot   of uncertainty or that the market was terribly troubled by the prospect that we would stop selling   or start buying more     So you don’t think it’s infeasible for us to achieve that level of   commitment     More broadly, I’m drawn to the idea of thinking about what reserve   balance path we want and then choosing among a variety of ways to achieve that  I’d feel more   comfortable thinking about redemptions in that context   Regarding the RCAs, last week one of the GSEs, Fannie Mae, announced that it was   dropping something like a dozen or so counterparties from its list of counterparties  To me, this   seems problematic for the theory of the usefulness of reserve collateral accounts, because the   theory is that risk considerations lead the GSEs to limit the number of counterparties, and yet   that’s costly to them because the resulting diminution of competition leads them to earn less on   their invested funds  So here they are voluntarily shedding a bunch of counterparties, which   presumably is going to lead to their earning less on their funds  And this is happening in an   environment in which the broad trend is that institutions are getting less risky, not more  Some   of these institutions are less risky than institutions that are still on their counterparty list  So I’m   wondering how you’d square that observation with your theory     The theory is all built on this restriction to the number of counterparties    I don’t see how arbitrarily adding counterparties is going to improve their competitive position in   the model you wrote down, right?  I just don’t see how they’re unrelated   Another observation that I think is relevant here is that, at the same time, Fannie Mae   approached a large Carolina-based institution to increase the amount of overnight fed funds   lending it would do with the institution from $500 million to $5 billion, and Fannie Mae is doing   this at 5 basis points  This isn’t brokered, so it doesn’t enter the effective fed funds calculation,   but I noticed that yesterday’s expected fed funds rate was around 20 basis points  To me, this   suggests that there’s a lot of other stuff going on in the market  First, that leverage constraints   could well be binding—there’s something limiting banks’ willingness to bid aggressively for   funds to drive up the rate that Fannie Mae pays; second, that there’s some sort of relationship—  people do business with Fannie Mae across a broad array of products and services, so the funds   rate might not be a particularly market-driven rate or a rate determined in isolation  I also note   March 16, 2010 16 of 146    that GSEs are active in the repo market and have an effect there and have the ability to arbitrage   those two choices  And the funds rate is at about the same level as the RP rate   More broadly, I think we ought to take two steps back and ask why we care about the   effective funds rate  The staff mentions two reasons  One is as a measure of banks’ marginal   opportunity cost of funds  If that’s the purpose it was serving well before the crisis, let’s take a   step back and ask how to measure that  Presumably, there still exists a bank’s marginal   opportunity cost of funds  The natural question seems to be, “Why isn’t IOER the best estimate   of that”?  The staff also mentions a tighter link to IOER  I’m not quite sure why we care about   that per se  Our quantitative easing has driven down market rates, so you’d expect a broad array   of market rates, including RP rates, to be driven down, and that pulls down the fed funds rate   I’m not sure why we want a technical measure to undo that   We have the effective fed funds rate, a measure of bank’s marginal opportunity cost of   funds, and dramatic changes in the policy regime make that a much less perfect measure  It   seems that we’re trying to make a structural fix in order to get that measure what it used to   measure  I think it makes more sense to take a step back and ask, “How do we want to measure   this best?”   If you look at the effective fed funds rate mechanism, too, it’s sort of antiquated  We   take rate and volume data from a set of brokers—it’s just a fraction of the market—and the   volume is relatively small  People can move transactions out of brokers or into brokers and   affect the rate  I heard a rumor that Citibank is unwilling to take trades through brokers at less   than 10 basis points, but they’ll do it if you call them up  I don’t know what that’s about If we   really want to measure the funds rate more accurately, we could ask for everybody to report all   March 16, 2010 17 of 146    fed funds trades, right?  We could put a new transaction code in Fedwire  So this just doesn’t   seem to be solving the right problem, and that’s my reaction to the RCAs     I don’t think that building the mechanism is worth doing  Now, I’m not   saying we ignore the fed funds rate  I don’t think we ignore the RP rate  We don’t ignore   commercial paper rates  We don’t ignore a lot of rates  If we want the fed funds rate to be close   to the IOER rate, making reserves scarcer seems like a logical strategy, and I think that would   help     Mr Chairman, one possible source of confusion is that President   Kocherlakota proposed that we begin midyear with this reverse taper  And in your summary at   the end of our discussion—I have the transcript, I brought it—you don’t comment on the timing    Presumably we didn’t think we were going to raise rates before midyear  So I came away with a   very different sense  I mean, your summary didn’t give me the same sense that your testimony   did     Is that your only point?     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The most recent published data for the Fifth   Federal Reserve District continue to show a lethargic recovery  For example, our surveys of   manufacturing and service sector activity were tepid in February  Within the last few weeks,   however, the tone of the information flow has begun to improve noticeably  Several of my   directors have reported positive unexpected developments that occurred in recent weeks, such as   IT suppliers beginning to hire temporary workers to fulfill rising demand  In addition, a   preliminary tally of responses for our March survey has found improvements in a number of   categories  For example, our manufacturing shipments index was zero last month, but the   preliminary March reading is 8, and the retail sales index was a minus 15 last month, while the   preliminary March reading is 5  These indexes are often choppy, of course, and the February   March 16, 2010 53 of 146    readings were likely held down by the snow  Still the improvements are striking, especially in   conjunction with the better anecdotes we’re hearing   Turning to the national outlook, the Greenbook responded appropriately to the soggy   information flow by marking down the current quarter GDP growth forecast by 06 percentage   point  In addition, the staff lowered the projected growth rate of real GDP through the end of   next year  I do agree with the staff that it makes sense to mark down the near-term outlook  The   downward revisions to previously published employment and income levels were striking, and   the housing market appears to have stalled out     That said, I’m not so sure that the latest data warrant pulling down the forecast of growth   a year or more ahead  Consumer spending still appears to be expanding at a reasonable pace   despite the substantial strains many households must be experiencing, and housing is such a   small part of the economy now that flat residential investment isn’t much of a drag on economic   growth  Besides, this is likely to continue to be a somewhat choppy recovery for some time, and   I think we should be careful not to over-interpret or perhaps over-extrapolate month-to-month   forecast misses  I haven’t pulled down my longer-term forecast just yet, and I still think that   there’s a reasonable chance that growth will come in above our baseline projection  If growth   does surprise on the upside, we’ll probably want to begin to normalize policy sooner, perhaps a   lot sooner than the Greenbook assumes  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I would like to associate myself with the   compelling arguments of the Committee participant who is catty-corner from me, President   Kocherlakota, about combining alternative B with C′  I think that has a lot to recommend it    And although I would personally make modifications to C′, I think that doing it sooner rather   than later makes sense  I’d be willing to support doing it immediately, but doing it after the   April meeting at which we have plans to devote more time to discussing our exit strategy, makes   a lot of sense as well   I strongly support the idea of keeping the “extended period” language over the horizon of   introducing the public to our exit strategy and our plans  I think that makes eminent sense  I’ll   also say that I thought a people made good arguments about the idea that at our first sale markets   are going to go a little bonkers and just be totally perplexed about what we’re going to do next,   though it’s a bit of a red herring  We were very careful about communicating a pace and   March 16, 2010 108 of 146    committing to it, following through, on the way up  And I would expect, if we adopted an asset   sale program, we’d find a way to do our best job of communicating a steady, moderate pace for   our reductions  Besides—I made this point last time, maybe not that effectively—we are going   to take a first step  By definition, the probability of a second step will rise, because, before the   first step, the probability of a second step is zero  You can’t do it before you take the first step    So, inevitably, we’re going to get a reaction in markets, and I don’t think that should overly   dissuade us  We always get a little burp when we turn, and we can just hope that we   communicate it clearly and that it’s a manageable change and one that aligns well with what we   think about how markets ought to react   There was an argument articulated at our last meeting that the prospect of capital losses   ought to dissuade us, or is an argument against or a danger to selling MBS  I’d just note that,   thanks to an accounting policy change recently adopted by the Board of Governors, we no longer   need to fear capital losses, because they would merely be accounted for with an offsetting   addition to our assets in the form of future interest on Federal Reserve notes to the Treasury   I want to reiterate this  I think it’s intuitive to think about a balance sheet path, and then   figure out the order in which we’re going to do things  From that point of view, as you know, I   still favored selling MBS first—I think that makes the most sense  The language in C′,   paragraph 4, still places term deposits and reverse RPs in temporal priority as draining tools  I   was a bit surprised to see that  Like President Fisher, I was a bit surprised to see the testimony   and the way it formulated the priority  I didn’t come away from January feeling as if we had   settled that  And, as you know, we’re going to discuss this further in April  So I would support   B with C′, combined this way   March 16, 2010 109 of 146    About financial imbalances, I can appreciate, just given the history of what has happened,   the role of financial balances in macroeconomic growth and in monetary policy  But I’m still   very unclear myself about whether it’s a separate factor or whether it’s something that’s related   to future growth in a way that we ought to respond to it  And I fear, as President Plosser said,   that articulating financial imbalances as an objective will lead some to believe we have the   capacity not only to judge inappropriate financial market behavior ourselves but also to eliminate   as much financial instability as some people may hope  So I’m very wary of going down that   path  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Silver linings     Yes     Don’t worry, Don  You’re going  [Laughter]     I know we said “up to”     Thank you, Mr Chairman  What’s striking to me about the analysis—  which I also think deserves the glowing praise you heaped on it earlier this afternoon, it was   very, very helpful—is how small the effects are on the macroeconomy and on interest rates  As I   April 27–28, 2010 21 of 206                   recall, in the most aggressive strategy you described, the effect is 35 to 50 basis points on longer-  term yields   The memo also mentions a 15 basis point additional effect on the MBS–Treasury spread,   which has increased by about that much in the last couple of months anyway  To me, this makes   a very aggressive and fairly rapidly commenced strategy pretty attractive  So I’m attracted to   option 5  In fact, I like to refer to it as the “centennial strategy,” because it is the only one that   gets us out of MBS before the Federal Reserve System centennial  [Laughter]  I think that has   some independent benefit   One drawback someone might articulate regarding an aggressive program is that it   withdraws monetary policy stimulus too rapidly  That’s what the letter that I distributed last   Friday was really aimed at addressing  It’s just to point out that our security holdings fall in two   categories—it gives us two variables—which means we can make the sum do something   different from the total of our MBS holdings  As I read the staff’s analysis, their belief is that the   sum of our security holdings is what is responsible for the effect on long-term yields, and I am   seeing Mr Reifschneider nodding his head in assent  So it suggests that what we could do is   commit to a brisk pace, pretty soon, of getting the composition of our portfolio back to   Treasuries-only pretty rapidly, and then think separately about monetary policy, that is, think   separately about stimulus   We could use our decision about redemptions and our decision about   our overall holdings of Treasuries to calibrate how much monetary stimulus we’re withdrawing   and at what pace  We can then craft our language accordingly, so that the unwinding of our   special intervention in the MBS market is viewed much like our getting out of these special   programs   April 27–28, 2010 22 of 206                   This would have the advantage of addressing the tension that was evident the last time we   spoke of this between the desire to comfort the MBS market about the expected pace of our   sales—to provide some surety, some confidence in how we’re going to proceed—and the desire   to retain the contingent nature of monetary policy; we could commit to making monetary policy   contingent on incoming data on economic and financial conditions  This would do that by taking   those two apart, saying to the MBS market, which is not as deep as the Treasury market, “We   can give you some surety,” while at the same time saying to the deep and liquid Treasury market,   “This is where our intervention, the size of our holdings, is going to be contingent on incoming   information”  The broader point I was trying to make is that it doesn’t make sense to oppose   rapid MBS sales on the basis that it would withdraw monetary policy stimulus too rapidly    That’s what I wanted to disentangle   Now, don’t get me wrong, I do think asset sales should commence fairly soon  A June   announcement wouldn’t be too soon in my book, and a summertime commencement wouldn’t be   too soon in my book  If it were up to me, I don’t think I would add in Treasury purchases  I   don’t think we need to do that, but I just offer that up as an option for those who might otherwise   be attracted to an aggressive pace of sales but fear too rapid a monetary policy stimulus   reduction   I don’t think we should decide on redemptions until we’ve figured out asset sales  I don’t   think it makes sense for us to sign up for redeeming Treasuries and then go down the road to the   next meeting and look at a situation where we would say, “Oh, to sell MBS would be   withdrawing too much stimulus”  I think it makes sense to consider these in the context of one   decision, one crafted strategy about our portfolio going forward  Those are my remarks, Mr   Chairman  Thank you   April 27–28, 2010 23 of 206                     Thank you  This question just occurred to me in looking at this year’s   bank earnings reports, and it probably should have occurred to me earlier, and you have probably   thought this through, so help me with this  When loans are written off by a bank, that’s an   increase in the net worth of the consumer, but my understanding is that that’s not included in   April 27–28, 2010 70 of 206                   NIPA personal income, and, as a result, there’s sort of a boost to net worth, like an unmodeled   income flow, that we’ve been seeing  A couple of back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest it’s   roughly 1½ percent outstanding balances at an annual rate  I can’t claim we have nailed this, but   it could be material—it looks like it could be maybe 04 percent of disposal income at an annual   rate  So do you think that might be responsible for consumer spending coming in stronger than   you might have expected?  Do you factor this in?  How do you think about this?     Yes  Well, let me follow up  Do you calculate this financial obligations   ratio?  Does that factor into your modeling at a formal level?  I mean, it’s sort of a “cash-flowy”   kind of thing     Thanks     Yes  It’s interesting     I think there are both  It decreases their liabilities, which makes them   better off     But then a mortgage restructuring reduces your monthly payment flow,   and that has this financial obligation ratio effect  So I was thinking about that     But presumably to more credit constrained borrowers     Right     But the secular trend in debt would last then     Thank you very much, Mr Chairman  My sense of the strength and   durability of the recovery has improved in the past few weeks, and that has been in response to   the recent data flow at the macro level as well as particularly upbeat reports from our District    Fifth District manufacturing and service sector survey results were released yesterday, and they   were particularly strong  The composite manufacturing index set a new all-time record in April    This is a series that goes back to the very beginning of the 1990s; it gained 24 points, to reach a   April 27–28, 2010 94 of 206                   level of 30, beating the previous record set in early 2000 by 8 points  All of the individual   indexes increased significantly, as did readings in every industrial sector, with the exception of   transportation equipment  Our manufacturing index had lagged a little bit behind some of the   other regional indexes, so this move is pretty noteworthy   Last week the annual spring furniture show was in High Point, North Carolina  It’s a   well-known international trade event, so it’s something of a bellwether for the US furniture   industry, such as it is  There still is a US furniture industry, I assure you [laughter]  Attendance   was over 80,000 this year, a 15 percent gain from last year  Orders were strong compared with   recent years, and that should show through to shipments in the second half of the year  Many   participants were pleased with the robustness  It has been several years since they had a good   show, and people in High Point put big stock in how well the show goes  Many participants,   though, I will mention, were concerned that supply constraints and rising demand for furniture   could put upward pressure on prices  Some of them aren’t convinced that the Chinese suppliers   who have retreated from the market as demand fell are able to come back on line and really meet   demand  So they’re worried about upward pressure on prices  That improved sentiment was   echoed in our service sector survey  Both retail and nonretail service sector revenue indexes   turned positive in April  The retail sector index reached its highest level since June 2007, and   shopper traffic rose to its highest level since early 2006   A more optimistic outlook is also evident in the array of anecdotal reports we’ve been   getting from our directors and other contacts  I won’t recount them to you, but I’ll just note that   over the last few months the positive elements in these reports have grown steadily as a share   and become more and more prevalent  We’ve also heard some scattered reports of concerns   April 27–28, 2010 95 of 206                   about current or imminent raw material shortages and upward pressure on input prices, consistent   with what President Plosser was alluding to   Turning to the national picture, my outlook for output and employment is similar to the   one presented by the Greenbook  I thought that was a balanced presentation yesterday  Also like   the Board staff, I have raised my forecast in response to the incoming data flow  I think the long   awaited appearance of decisively positive, though not yet robust, employment growth was   particularly encouraging, as was the favorable surprise on retail sales in the first quarter  So my   sense is that we’re going to continue to see favorable developments on the consumer front this   year  Pent-up demand in the early stages of a cyclical recovery has often contributed to a robust   burst of growth in consumer spending in the past, and I think it can be a factor this time as well    The overall financial position of the consumer sector has probably improved enough so that pent-  up demand can be realized ahead of employment and income gains  Consumers seem to be more   confident now that those gains are going to be realized, or at least that the downside risks to   those gains will not be realized  In addition, it seems plausible to me that consumer credit write-  offs are going to continue to transfer wealth to more liquidity-constrained consumers, and I think   that could be a positive factor, whether or not we have an econometric handle on that  Thus, I   wouldn’t be surprised to see more markups of consumer spending forecasts by the Greenbook in   coming quarters   I’d like to say a word about consumer lending  Apparently write-offs are far larger than   the reduction in consumer credit outstanding  Large banks report that they’re extending a lot of   new credit, which is not nearly as much as they’re writing off  So there’s new lending going on    It’s sort of like employment—it’s just that the net flow is negative at this point in consumer   credit  I interpret a phrase like “not enough lending is going on” to mean that there aren’t   April 27–28, 2010 96 of 206                   enough creditworthy borrowers that lenders can find  In any event, I think we’re on a path at the   national level toward realizing steadily increasing growth rates in final sales over the last three   quarters and going forward as well  That shortly will establish growth well enough and strongly   enough to warrant raising rates at some point later this year   Turning to inflation, I’ve lowered my near-term forecast in response to the recent   numbers, but I’m struck by the persistence of the relatively high readings on expected inflation   from both the surveys and the TIPS market  I hope we don’t experience a repeat of late 2003    At that time, what seemed like high unemployment—it doesn’t seem very high in retrospect—  led us to underpredict inflation significantly for 2004  Yes, the unemployment rate is far higher   now than it was in 2003, but I think the relationship as we understand it between unemployment   and inflation is just as tenuous, just as murky, on both theoretical and empirical grounds as it was   then  If it turns out that we’re too sanguine on inflation, by extrapolating this low point in   inflation, then that adds to the risk of waiting too long, in my mind  If inflation firms up this   year and markets see us holding rates low for an extended period as that happens, I think   expectations could erode suddenly  I think that recent legislative proposals that would have the   effect of politicizing the FOMC just exacerbate this risk, especially if any of them make it into   law   I think it would help us reduce this risk—I will say much more about this in the policy   go-around—to begin selling assets as soon as we can, and my preference would be to look to   June for an announcement  I think that could help ratchet inflation expectations down a notch   and give us some leeway in the event of an unfavorable inflation surprise  But again, I will say   more about policy in the policy round  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  My main concern with our path for policy in   the coming quarters is that we be prepared and well positioned to raise rates when the time   April 27–28, 2010 157 of 206                   comes  And I continue to believe, as I’ve said at previous meetings, that the time to raise rates is   likely to come far sooner than the Greenbook assumes  A time later this year seems quite likely,   at least to me  I’ve said I’m going to be looking for a time when economic growth is strong   enough and well enough established  If the Greenbook forecast plays out without any   unanticipated adverse shocks, I think that by the fourth quarter final demand is going to look as if   it has been pretty strong for a pretty long time  I think the experience of 2003 and 2004 provides   a cautionary tale  I note the citation by Governor Kohn of the episode of the early 1980s in   which strong economic growth accompanied declining inflation  But I’ll note that the chief   claim to fame of the early 1980s episode in the historical narrative of the Phillips curve   relationship is the demonstration that the amount of inflation associated with a given amount of   slack was larger than expected, so for me that example might cut the other way  The other thing   is that the evolution of inflation expectations were quite important   I disagree with the notion that moving too soon is likely to be costlier than moving too   late, an idea that came up at our last meeting  I think some are concerned that, with the levels of   slack we’re seeing, a tightening could produce disinflation or deflation or force us back to the   zero bound  But I think we’ve demonstrated our ability and our willingness to use quantitative   easing tools to provide stimulus at the zero bound  I don’t think people are likely to view us as   reluctant to try to increase inflation, should that occur  So overall, I just don’t think we would   face outsize challenges if we experienced a little more disinflation   On the other hand, I think the risks associated with delaying tightening—moving too late,   or moving in a way that turns out to be too late—could be substantial  I think the risks   associated with that are that inflation expectations might ratchet up, and the process of getting   those down is nonlinear, the way policy at the zero bound is  I think there’s a danger that, if   April 27–28, 2010 158 of 206                   inflation ratcheted up and inflation expectations ratcheted up, the public could come to the   conclusion that we’re willing to let our inflation objective drift up  The current environment,   where prominent economists are talking about how we ought to have a 4 percent inflation   objective, or whatever, just adds to that   I’m comfortable holding rates steady at this meeting, although, as I’ve indicated, I think   we’re likely going to need to raise rates later this year  I think that we should, as I said, begin   draining reserves, begin asset sales, over the summer  I was persuaded by Governor Warsh’s   suggestion that we provide a framework, some statement of our overall goals, when the time   comes  I think June would be a good time for that  I find President Kocherlakota’s argument   fairly compelling for telling people what we know when we know it, as it were, or what we have   a workable consensus on when we have a workable consensus  But I can be patient and let a   little bit more economic growth establish itself and let a little bit of dust settle in the halls of the   Congress   Why do I think we should commence asset sales very rapidly and go pretty aggressively?    Well, I have three or four reasons The first is that our movements on the interest rate on excess   reserves are likely to be more effective, and we’re likely to find their effects more predictable,   both on market rates and on the economy, with much lower reserve balances—substantially   lower than we have now  So, if, as I believe is true, we’re likely to want to raise rates by the end   of the year, I think that argues for getting those reserve balances down as soon as we can   Second, I think the job we were trying to do with our program of purchasing agency and   mortgage-backed securities, has been done and is no longer needed, and we ought to pack up and   go home  The housing market has stabilized—prices are moving up, moving down, but they’re   no longer plummeting, as they were from 2006 to early 2009  Price discovery, as a result, has   April 27–28, 2010 159 of 206                   essentially reestablished itself—individual buyers can now do a much better job of figuring out   what a house is worth relative to the market, because they don’t have the huge trend in overall   market prices to deal with and to disentangle from  Sure, there’s an overhang of vacant homes   and there are foreclosures and short sales coming down the pike, but current prices seem to be   consistent with a broad awareness that there is this overhang  I think most Americans are aware   of a huge amount of foreclosures coming on the market, and, if not, their real estate agent is   likely to help them understand that fact  Still, prices seem to be moving sideways, even with that   overhang  So it seems to me that we’re likely to get the housing market moving sideways at a   low level of construction and with some fluctuating level of sales of existing homes for some   time   Third, the effect of announcing a program of MBS sales on mortgage rates is highly   uncertain  The staff’s estimate is 10 or 15 basis points  In the last few months, mortgage rates   have gone up anyway and by more than that  So I don’t think the effect is likely to be large  But   even if it were, whatever the size of the subsidy, I think it’s bad policy to continue it any further   into the recovery than we need to, because it just results in an imbalance in investment flows   further out into the recovery   The argument is raised that, as soon as we announce asset sales, there’s going to be a   tightening and markets are going to react, and so we should wait until we are ready to tighten   policy  I think there are many in financial markets who will naturally prick up their ears and   who are eagerly awaiting that first shoe to drop, that is, for us to announce asset sales  But I   think a broad segment of the public views tightening as beginning when we raise interest rates,   so they’re not going to notice when we announce asset sales  We’ve wound down and closed a   number of credit programs, and we’ve ended our credit purchases  Admittedly, these events   April 27–28, 2010 160 of 206                   were a gigantic preoccupation for the very important market professionals that the New York   Fed contacts on a regular basis  But for a lot of Americans, I think, tightening policy is raising   rates, so while it will have some announcement effect, I don’t think it ought to make us shy about   making some announcement like that   The fourth set of reasons is uncomfortable to talk about, but it’s essentially political   economy concerns  I won’t go into a lot of detail, but I think we’re going to have a window of   opportunity in the second half of this year, after regulatory reform gets done but before   legislative disposition of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is taken up, which, if it ever happens,   would be early next year  I think we should take that opportunity to set a rapid course for the   exits  I think not doing so risks perpetuating the political entanglements that are the very   unfortunate fallout of this whole episode for us   On redemptions, I’m okay leaving it out of the statement, obviously  I’m personally   favoring a more aggressive approach, as you’ll note, to reserve balance draining  Aggressive   sales and redemptions would be ideal from my point of view  If we’re not going to do   redemptions, or if we are going to consider selling MBS at a slower pace, I’d prefer a more rapid   pace and no redemptions than a slower pace and redemptions, since the composition of our   portfolio won’t shift as rapidly  So I’m happy with deleting paragraph 4  I continue to favor   language in alternative C, paragraph 2 over that in alternative B, paragraph 2  That concludes   my remarks  Thank you very much, Mr Chairman     You didn’t state this, but I’m assuming that the intended use of the swap   lines is for liquidity auctions, as we had last time, and not for intervention in foreign exchange   markets  Is that correct?  On a related note, have you been asked to intervene in foreign   exchange markets?     Will we sterilize these ourselves?   May 9, 2010 14 of 42               If we don’t sterilize swap draws, we’re going to be taking dollar funding   from market participants in the US and passing it on through the ECB  I’m not quite sure I get   that  Plus, there’s the issue of selling US Treasuries  Treasuries are getting scarce  Their price   is going up because of the flight to quality  So I’m not quite sure I understand your line of   argument, Brian     But if we don’t sterilize, we’re adding to bank reserves, we’re   essentially taking the funding from banks and lending it on through the ECB  If we do sterilize   with reserve draining, then what are we doing?  We’re taking it from money market mutual   funds and handing it on     Yes, I have just one more question  The fundamental issue these are   addressing is dollar-denominated maturity transformation by European banking institutions that   are exposed to euro-denominated sovereign credit risk, which has led some to have trouble   funding  I’m familiar with the change in liquidity management by some large active US   institutions over the last three years  This maturity transformation by European institutions was   obviously a problem very early on, in late 2007  I wonder if anyone on the call has some insight   into or would be able to characterize the relative progress made by European institutions in   reducing the riskiness of their dollar-denominated maturity transformation activities since late   2007  If that progress has lagged notably behind the progress of US institutions, I wonder   whether this would be a good opportunity, as part of the conversations around this service we’re   May 9, 2010 26 of 42             offering the Europeans, to urge them to take stronger action to assure that they make progress in   reducing the riskiness of their dollar portfolios     Thank you, Mr Chairman  In the past, I’ve generally opposed swaps as   a matter of regime choice  I still oppose them, but this is not the time to take a gigantic bold leap   towards a regime I’d like  So I won’t oppose this now, and I’ll support giving you the discretion   to enter into these, as you said  I think the political risks are tremendous  I think there’s a good   chance we will dodge them with expert communication, and I think the comments of President   Fisher and others about needing to manage those aggressively are worthwhile  I think the   confluence of those risks with this environment and what we’re doing here isn’t an accident    This is one of a set of essentially fiscal policy actions we’ve taken in the last three years that   have generated this firestorm around us  The continuing fallout of that generates the   environment that makes this fiscal policy action more politically risky for us   On sterilization, I’d love to use this as an opportunity to argue for selling an equivalent   amount of MBS, but we can wait until another date for that  Those are my comments  I support   your decision     Yes  Thank you, Mr Chairman  In chart 17, the MBS fails, there’s a   pretty big number, $700 or $800 billion  How much of that is in the 55 coupons?  Actually, I   don’t care how much is in the 55s  How much is in the 45s?  Are there fails in the 45s now?     But there are fails in the 45s, you suspect?     In our purchase agreement, if our counterparty is failing to us, what   obligation do we have?  Can we cancel it?  Can we unwind it?  Can we renege?     You described the transaction as a sale To some extent, it’s just like   saying you have an option, and you engage in the opposite option, and that cancels the first   option contract—right?—and any sort of forward thing  You could use the word “unwind” for   that, right?     So you could describe it any way we want  We could say we dumped   $9 billion on the market, or we could say we’ve unwound a transaction that had failed  And you   could describe it in sort of antiseptic terms, couldn’t you?     Forcing through, right     Do you really think that if we said we were doing this one time because   of the fails, then markets would believe we were sneakily taking the first step down the road to   an asset sales program?  You really don’t think we can convey to markets that this is a one-time   deal?     But, to some extent, you’re just shifting the problem to the 45s, where   the problem isn’t as strong  But, on net, there are all of these fails in MBS  Ironically we   entered this market to improve functioning of financial markets, and now we seem to be a force   for bad in this market rather than a force for good     I’ll start  It’s true  I’ll admit it  There’s this third option, but let’s focus   on the choice between selling $9 billion and swapping $9 billion of 45s  Let’s suppose we sell   $9 billion, and then we decide whether to buy 45s  At this point, I look at financial conditions, I   look at the market, and I ask, “Why buy 45s?”  Would I like to start selling assets?  Sure  But,   to me, that’s separate, that’s not on the table today     Thank you very much, Mr Chairman  The more I think about this, the   harder it is for me to shake this idea that the size and the composition of our asset holdings are   two distinct things that we can vary differently  I’m struck by the extent to which, at the last   meeting, some earlier meetings, and the discussion now, asset sales are viewed as synonymous   with reducing the size of our asset holdings  I read over the minutes of the last meeting    Everyone who spoke against asset sales was speaking against reducing the size of our asset   holdings  No one opposing asset sales said anything about the composition of our balance sheet    The minutes accurately reflect that a majority were in that camp  I think it’s misleading—and I   wish I had brought this up when we had a chance to edit the minutes—to refer to that as asset   sales  In fact, a majority favored not taking steps to reduce our asset holdings   We all want to normalize our balance sheet and return to Treasuries-only—it’s one of our   principles  It looks to me as if we can have both  We have these four principles here  There’s a   Pareto improvement available to us, where we can normalize our balance sheet more rapidly   without sacrificing anything on the other dimensions  So I’d advocate selling  We’re talking   about taking the proceeds of maturing Treasuries and buying assets with them  Not only is this   the status quo, but we’re buying new assets as we go along  I don’t see why we can’t embark on   a program of selling mortgage-backed securities  And if the majority of the Committee believes   we shouldn’t reduce the size of our asset holdings until after the first interest rate increase, well,   then, so be it—we’ll put the proceeds into short-term Treasuries  As for the narrow question, I   June 22–23, 2010 32 of 213             favor option 2, because I don’t want to reduce our Treasury holdings—we’re only going to   increase them later as we roll off MBS  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Mr Chairman     Can I respectfully pose a question to Governor Kohn?     How would Governor Kohn feel about selling MBS and buying   equivalent duration Treasuries?     It’s eroded on so many other fronts     Mr Chairman, can I follow up on this?     Three to three and a half is the duration of our MBS holdings?     And the duration of our overall Treasury portfolio is five and a half   years?     So our MBS are less than average duration     So what’s the duration of the public’s portfolio?  I’m trying to think,   with respect to what Governor Kohn said—if we sold the MBS, that would increase the average   duration of our portfolio, wouldn’t it?   PARTICIPANT  It depends on what you buy     Because it’s below the Treasury duration, right?     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The flow of data since the last meeting has   been mixed at best, and, like the Tealbook and most forecasters, we’ve marked down our outlook   for real activity a bit  But the changes in our projections haven’t been as quite substantial as the   Tealbook’s  The case for a large slowdown in consumption—to below 3 percent for the rest of   this year and barely over 3 percent next year—appears to lean heavily on the effects of credit   constraints  My sense is that fluctuations in the degree to which consumers or small businesses   feel credit constrained is driven predominantly by fluctuations in their own prospects rather than   by variations in bank capital or other supply-side factors right now  So, while European   developments have certainly heightened real and financial uncertainty and should not be taken   lightly, it doesn’t seem that likely to me that these developments will impinge much on the   gradual improvement in credit conditions for US households that seems to be under way   Because, in my outlook, consumption growth doesn’t slow quite as much as in the   Tealbook, the accelerator mechanism implies stronger business investment growth  In addition, I   think replacing and upgrading equipment in IT systems seems to be playing a very important   role—investments driven by depreciation rather than by output, in a sense  So I see decent   prospects for firms returning to investment plans that were put on hold before the recession   Finally, I see a faster return of inflation to a trend between 1½ and 2 percent    Expectations have remained remarkably stable during the recession, despite the weighty burden   June 22–23, 2010 98 of 213             of a large output gap  If the recovery continues and becomes better established, I think expected   trend inflation will exert a more powerful force on overall and core inflation   My guarded optimism on the national economy is buttressed by the largely favorable   information we’ve received lately about the Fifth District  Our manufacturing survey’s overall   index was down just slightly in June—from 26 to 23, still a very strong positive reading—and   we’ve received reports from manufacturers in a wide array of sectors in the Fifth District noting   rising orders, and port activity has been on a very distinct rise  Our services survey remained in   positive territory as well, although retail remains a bit soft, and respondents to all of our surveys   appear to be fairly upbeat on balance about the next six months  Government contractors in the   DC area are showing particular strength—you can take that as a good sign or a bad sign, it’s up   to you  We’ve received anecdotal reports from around the District that are positive, including   positive comments about labor markets  And, as summer gets under way, tourist numbers on the   Carolina coast are up year over year  Most of the less sunny reports we’ve received involve   commercial real estate in our District, which isn’t doing so hot   Overall the picture that emerges from the District is of broadening areas of positive   momentum with some lingering weak patches  So my bottom line is that the recovery is likely to   be sustained at about its current pace, even though the downside risks have increased somewhat    Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  At this meeting, I’m willing to support   alternative B  The modest increase in downside risk since the last meeting makes this an   inopportune time to make any significant adjustments in our policy rate or our language  I   continue to believe we’re going to need to tighten earlier than the Tealbook assumes  I think the   likely modal outcome is that these downside risks will dissipate, and the economy will proceed   June 22–23, 2010 136 of 213             to recover, and we’ll get to a point months down the road where the economy looks about the   way that we forecasted it would back in March   I continue to believe that normalizing our balance sheet is an independent policy   imperative that we should be discussing, and I don’t think it needs to wait until we raise rates    As I said yesterday, I think the composition and size of our balance sheet are two different   things—there’s no reason we can’t vary them independently  I don’t think we’ve given that   option enough attention in our discussion, so I support President Hoenig’s letter urging more   discussion and analysis of scenarios involving asset sales  Everything the staff has presented to   us, as I said yesterday, involving asset sales involved a concomitant variation in the size of our   balance sheet   There was some discussion yesterday about the effect of reserves, rather than our assets,   on the economy  I don’t see, from observations on what we’ve done so far, how you disentangle   the effect of our asset purchases from the effect of the reserves we have put in the economy  If   there’s a way to identify it, I’d be really interested in seeing it, but I certainly haven’t seen it in   any staff analysis  The general presumption is that there are general equilibrium effects running   around   I’ll point out—and I sort of made this pitch before—that, to the extent that some theories   about the effects of our asset purchases rely on market segmentation, that’s something that, in   principle, is amenable to direct observation and verification  We should be able to document that   these institutions face this impediment from participating in that market as opposed to this   market  Surely the facts about that are out there, and relying on indirect econometric evidence   alone seems weak to me  This is just by way of a suggestion for future staff research   June 22–23, 2010 137 of 213             I was questioned as to the benefits of reducing our mortgage-backed security holdings   rapidly  I’ve admitted before that, for me, the benefit is chiefly in the nature of political   economy  If there are some political economy considerations on the other side that would make   us resist moving to all Treasuries in an expeditious way, I’d be interested in hearing about them    But I don’t know of any   Again, I support further study of asset sales and a program as suggested by President   Hoenig  I don’t see why, if we adopt a program like that, we can’t independently vary our   Treasury holdings in the natural way, either to maintain the current size of the reserve balances   in the system and our assets or to have them trace out a path higher than they would trace out if   we just sold the assets  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Plodding along  [Laughter]     Another kind of update  This being the first instance that I can recall of   a noteworthy athletic event occurring during an FOMC meeting, I thought I’d let you know that   the US won 1 to 0  [Applause]     I won’t say how I found out     The Tealbook reports that you estimate that the extended and emergency   unemployment benefits are boosting the unemployment rate by approximately 1 percentage point   right now  That effect has increased over the last 18 months  Some of this effect, as you report   in footnote 5, represents workers who you believe would otherwise be out of the labor force, and   some represents workers who would otherwise accept job offers  I was wondering if you’re   willing to take a stab at the decomposition   August 10, 2010 17 of 160               Thought I’d give you the opportunity     I just wanted to ask a follow-up to President Fisher’s question  He   asked whether you thought financial conditions were more supportive of economic growth  I’m   wondering whether growth prospects are more supportive of financial conditions  That notion   popped into my brain the first time I saw that phrase, and I’ve been meaning to ask you about   this, particularly since, in the intermeeting period, some of the changes in financial market   conditions seem plausibly related to improved prospects for growth, such as equity markets,   declining risk premiums, and the like   August 10, 2010 20 of 160               If I could just follow up—the term premium plot that President   Kocherlakota referenced would seem to indicate that the bulk of the change in the 10-year rate is   not expected interest rates, but rather it’s this term premium  More broadly, my general   impression about the intermeeting period is that we’ve seen a broad shift in asset allocation by   investors towards some riskier assets—into longer-term Treasuries, corporate debt, equities    That broad shift into riskier assets could suggest a little more confidence  I don’t think of that as   an autonomous, exogenous shock; instead, I think of that as related to expectations  I’m just   wondering if that’s an accurate view about financial markets over the intermeeting period     Thank you, Mr Chairman  There’s no getting around the soft tone of   the incoming economic data since the last meeting  The boost from the inventory cycle is largely   behind us  Housing market activity fell more after the tax incentive expired than many were   expecting, and the revised NIPA data show that consumer spending has not been as robust as we   thought over the last five quarters  Against that backdrop, the disappointing employment reports   have raised concerns about a second dip or even deflation     I have lowered my expectations for second-half economic growth, and I do think the risk   has increased that growth is going to be even soggier than I expect  But I believe the economy is   still on an economic recovery path  And while we need to be realistic, I think we should avoid   encouraging pessimism out there   Even though payroll employment has fallen short of expectations, I think the labor   market continues to slowly heal  Aggregate hours and average work week ticked up last month,   consistent with the upward trends in those series since the first quarter  And I think   interpretation of the labor market data needs to take into account the presence of those extended   and emergency unemployment benefits I was talking about before   As I said, the Tealbook estimates that these have raised the NAIRU by about a percentage   point over the last 18 months, so it’s now a percentage point higher than it otherwise would be    Taking that over 18 months, it translates into 70,000 jobs per month  If they all came out of the   labor force, that would be no difference in payroll employment  But if they were all people who   otherwise would have taken a job, it would represent 70,000 more per month in payroll   employment growth  Something in that range, or close to that, seems plausible to me, because   we’ve been hearing from several contacts in our District about the effect of unemployment   August 10, 2010 38 of 160             benefits on labor supply  For example, one of my directors runs a petroleum wholesaling   business in West Virginia, where they hire a lot of drivers to shuttle diesel fuel to Marcellus   Shale drilling sites in West Virginia and Pennsylvania  He says that his human resources   director is about to tear her hair out  The company was getting a fair number of applicants after   the special unemployment benefits expired, but, after they were reinstated, people started turning   down her offers and saying they’ll get in touch when their benefits run out again  As a result,   they’ve actually had to turn down some contracts  To me, this suggests we should temper our   expectations for payroll employment growth as long as these extended benefits are in place   In manufacturing at the national level, we’ve seen robust growth over the first half of the   year  While the national and regional purchasing manager types of indexes have come off their   recent highs, they generally remain in positive territory  For our District, for example, the   composite index for manufacturing was 16, well into the positive territory, for shipments it was   22, and for new orders it was 13  Interestingly, for the number of employees it was 15, up   substantially from recent months  The service sector index ticked up to 10, although retail   indexes remained flat   A contact of ours in the retail commercial property field reports improving property sales   and says he was pleased to close recently on a large syndicated credit facility, which is consistent   with some other reports of credit placements recently  He says vacancy rates are lower now in   their properties and that retail failures have pretty much run their course, although he cites a host   of factors that are keeping retailers from committing to new capital expenditures  A director   involved in the residential real estate market in the suburban Washington, DC, area in Maryland   reports that buyers are sitting on the sidelines waiting for the next home purchase tax initiative   program, which suggests the possibility of some latent strengthened housing demand that we’re   August 10, 2010 39 of 160             not measuring  I should qualify this by mentioning that we’ve had trouble confirming this report   elsewhere in our District, however  So it could be that the people around Washington, DC,   know something that makes this strategy especially attractive   Here’s a sign of the times  The CEO of one of the largest peanut companies in the United   States reports that sales of cocktail peanuts are down, but peanut butter is up  [Laughter]    Overall, then, I’d characterize the anecdotal reports from our District as still mixed   Inflation is one area where the NIPA revisions have been favorable  Both overall and   core PCE inflation are now about ¼ percentage point higher year over year, and the Tealbook   forecast carries that higher pace through to year-end  Moreover, as some others have noted,   expectations measures declined a little bit, but they are within recent ranges  My personal view   is that we’re not anywhere near a sustained deflation right now   I think it’s striking that there has been so much commentary about the extent to which   uncertainty is dampening spending commitments, particularly by businesses  We’ve been   hearing these anecdotal reports going back to the beginning of the year about a litany of looming   policy initiatives that make business planning difficult  And you know the list—health care,   financial reform, the tax code, and the like  I was inclined to discount these complaints at first   because of the obvious partisan agendas they might reflect, not to mention just plain whining,   and because the future path of economic conditions can be genuinely more difficult to forecast at   this part of the business cycle  So uncertainty is bound to be large at a time like this   But the persistence and pervasiveness of these reports have me taking them a bit more   seriously  I think these are factors that could plausibly be restraining growth  From a business   point of view, it’s essentially a fundamental growth issue, even if some of them represent policy    From our point of view, they’re not policies we control, so they’re essentially fundamental   August 10, 2010 40 of 160             factors affecting economic growth prospects, and, to echo the spirit of President Fisher’s   remarks, they seem to be to be likely to be relatively impervious to a change in the cost of credit   of, say, another 20 basis points  But, looking on the bright side, while overall uncertainty may be   elevated, at least we know where Lebron James is going to play basketball       Finally, I want to comment on the impressive rally in US Treasuries   over the last several months—for example, the 10-year note has come down 1 percentage point   and is well under 3 percent now  I think this ought to factor in to how we think about the stance   of monetary policy  In particular, I think this indicates that the stance of our monetary policy has   eased substantially in the intermeeting period  Consider normal economic circumstances  When   we’re away from the zero bound, if the demand for money were to shift, and we were not to   offset that decline in the demand for money, and the federal funds rate and other interest rates   fell, we would judge that to be easier monetary policy  That’s why we direct the Desk to hold   the federal funds rate constant   The staff has been encouraging us for more than a year now to think of quantitative   easing as having its effect via interest rates, like the 2-year, 5-year, 10-year rates, and so on    What we’ve seen is a broad shift in demand; that is, economic conditions have changed in a way   that has shifted the demand away from the shorter-term and more liquid assets towards longer-  term and less liquid assets  And we have not offset that by commensurately reducing the assets   in our portfolio in a way that keeps longer-term interest rates—which is how the staff has been   telling us to measure the effect of quantitative easing—from falling   So I conclude that, relative to that benchmark, policy has eased since the last meeting    And notice that, in the fed funds rate example, it doesn’t depend on why the demand for money   August 10, 2010 41 of 160             has shifted  We would say that policy is easier if we let interest rates go down when the demand   for money shifts   Now, it’s true that the fall in mortgage rates has increased prepayment speeds, and that   has reduced our MBS holdings more rapidly than we had expected  But that hasn’t added   enough to the public’s holdings of longer-term assets to offset fully the increased demand for   those longer-term assets  In essence, the demand for duration has gone up, and we haven’t offset   it with an increase in the supply of duration that we took off the market in order to stimulate the   economy  I mention that because, obviously, we’re going to be focusing on whether further   stimulus is warranted today, and I’d argue we’ve provided a lot of further stimulus already    Thank you, Mr Chairman     Right  In the fed funds example, if that represents expectations, then we   have this choice about the extent to which to follow through  I think that’s facing us now     Well, cocktail peanuts are sort of a high-end good, you know, and   they’ve fallen in the recession     But people are eating more peanut butter   August 10, 2010 42 of 160               Brian, you said that when you found out about the amount of   prepayments that would come on these three settlement days, you would buy Treasuries ahead of   August 10, 2010 91 of 160             time  You said something about smoothing, but this would introduce fluctuations in total reserve   balances  Why don’t you just do reverse auctions the day of the settlement and announce them   in advance?     I guess I’m asking why you made the decision not to bunch them on the   settlement days     The first factor doesn’t apply to Treasuries  You can do that any day of   the week, right?   August 10, 2010 92 of 160               Just one more question?     This has to do with duration  You’re going to reinvest in securities with   5½ years duration?      So a security that’s about to be prepaid has an implicit duration that’s   pretty short, right?  Is this going to increase our duration on net?  That is, how is the duration   going to evolve?     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I don’t think economic growth prospects   have deteriorated enough to warrant a change in our plans  We have always thought this   recovery would be slow by historical standards, and the data have borne that out  The corollary   of a slow recovery is that unanticipated fluctuations around a low mean growth rate will at times   generate fairly sluggish numbers  When those fluctuations are large enough, a policy response is   appropriate, but I don’t think we’ve crossed that threshold yet  The Tealbook has been pegging   2010 economic growth at 3 percent for quite a while  Relative to that expectation, 2½ percent   growth in the second half isn’t bad enough in my mind to suggest we need a change in course    So I came into this meeting favoring B2 over B1, which, I guess, means that I oppose the current   version of B, and I favor what I’ll call “B classic”  [Laughter]  That is, alternative B without   paragraph 4   I talked a little bit earlier about why I think the fall in interest rates represents an easing in   policy in a very real sense  The theory of the case has always been that our quantitative easing   program—I think we’re calling it that now—is affecting the economy by removing duration   from the market  The fall in interest rates is a rise in the price of duration  So what are we going   to do?  We’re going to make duration scarcer?  I suggest that, by keeping our policy stance   unchanged, we’d accommodate the increase in the demand for duration by selling assets rather   than removing them   August 10, 2010 102 of 160             Another way to think about this is to consider the question  What would it look like if we   kept quantitative easing in place for too long?  To answer this, I’ll reference the discussions we   had last fall, when some of us were saying that we should cap the asset-purchase program,   because it was in danger of going too far, that is, of buying too many assets  Well, what would it   look like if we went too far?  Banks would want to shed reserves at existing interest rates    They’d be unable to do so, because we’d be forcing them to hold these reserves  Some fall in   interest rates would be required to induce them to hold those reserves voluntarily   Last year, the response was, “Well, if this were happening, we’d see an increase in bank   lending”  Well, we’re not seeing an increase in bank lending  We’re seeing banks buy assets—  somebody is selling them to them—and somebody is lending money by buying corporate debt    So we’re seeing lending going up  We’re seeing private sector borrowing going up  That   suggests to me that we could be seeing something like the effects of quantitative easing in place   for longer than we intend   I’ll give you an anecdote  I talked about shifting demand curves for money  One   institution in my District was scolded for quarter-end window dressing; that is, within the   quarter, they did $70 billion worth of arbitrage between the agency RP market and interest on   reserves  Now that this is shut down, their holdings of reserve balances have effectively been   reduced by $70 billion –for some reason having to do with SEC enforcement  Picture four years   ago, with a $70 billion increase in excess reserves sloshing around in the system, and ask   yourself what that would do   That’s just one example  Now, there may have been other offsetting increases in the   demand for reserves somewhere, but I sort of suspect not  That’s the kind of thing that we have   to be aware of as we proceed  Some dramatic pullback of banks from willingness to hold all the   August 10, 2010 103 of 160             reserves we have out there at existing interest rates is going to shift the demand curve for money,   that is, make policy more stimulative, and it could take us off course   Let me mention one final thing, and that’s the pace of sales of assets when we exit  We   discussed that earlier this year  There was a great hesitance to consider a pace of sales greater   than a certain amount  If we’re still going to be unwilling to sell assets at greater than some   certain pace because of the fear of disrupting the market, then we’re taking an action here that   could affect us for five, six, seven years  All the way out, it’s going to increase the path of   reserves  That makes me really hesitant to take a step like this  So, as I said, I favor B classic,   that is, alternative B without a paragraph 4     I know, but the path of reserves is higher all the way out compared with   the case in which there is a constraint on the maximum pace of sales     How about “To maintain,” as the motivation     I was a participant in the December 2004 discussion—a member   actually  I’ve always been curious about this disconnect and expressed to the Chairman at the   time that it seemed to me more logical to have a broader reporting   I wasn’t aware of Scott’s interpretation of the Federal Reserve Act  Personally, I can’t   see why it would preclude reporting on participants’ policy views   The widespread understanding of anyone who has paid attention to this issue, including   people outside the Fed, is that participants’ policy views are not reported in the minutes—they do   not appear  Are we changing that or finding a way to finesse it?  I ask because this overlap   strategy leaves open the possibility that a participant may express a view orthogonal to members’   views while the minutes remain silent on that     Right     The intention is that the expanded content would be in the general   discussion, not in the policy section     I welcome this change  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The commentary from my directors this   month was quite striking  If we tally up the individual anecdotes, you find more positives than   negative reports, and the overall picture you get if you just look at the anecdotes is one of modest   improvement in economic conditions  Our directors are speaking with increasing concern and   frustration  I’d call it bordering on anger about the restraining effects on business sentiment of   uncertainty about potentially adverse government policy changes  In addition to the usual   culprits—health care, environment, and tax policies—this month we heard for the first time   September 21, 2010 42 of 151             worries about forthcoming cuts in defense spending, a particularly important sector in our   District  Now, we’ve been hearing these complaints for months, and there’s been a lot of public   commentary about them  At first, the logical thing is to think of fear mongering and perhaps   political agendas at work, but they’re widespread and persistent, and that’s what strikes me   The national economic news since the last meeting has also been mixed  While   uniformly positive would have been much better than mixed, I read the current reports as   alleviating fears of a double dip and confirming the August outlook for generally sluggish   growth going forward  As a result, I find myself very comfortable with the Tealbook’s forecast   of output growth—a bit slow for the remainder of the year but rising steadily to just above   4 percent by the end of next year  The data so far this year have been consistent with this   outlook for sluggish economic growth  Consumer spending has been rising pretty steadily at an   annual rate of about a 2 percent  It is likely to continue to expand at that pace   Although the labor market is still weak, private payrolls are gradually expanding,   averaging an additional 95,000 jobs per month since the beginning of the year  Business   investment in equipment and software has been expanding briskly as well, and, while it might   not contribute as much to economic growth going forward, I think the fundamentals look pretty   good there   Inflation remains pretty steady at 15 percent overall on a year-over-year basis  That lines   up with my own inflation objective  Various measures of inflation expectations remain about   where they were at the last meeting  I don’t see any evidence of a sustained disinflation  So   with regard to our inflation mandate, I think we’re doing just fine   All in all, my take on the real economy and inflation and where they’re going is basically   the same as it was at the last meeting  Of course, the strength of the recovery does remain the   September 21, 2010 43 of 151             issue  When you compare the first four quarters of this recovery to the first four quarters   following the two deep postwar US recessions—’74 and ’81–’82—you see that real GDP   growth falls short this time by about 3 percentage points  If you look at the components, you’ll   find the shortfall is attributable to slower growth this time in consumption and residential   investment  The latter is perfectly understandable, given the overbuilding of the last two   decades, and I don’t think we should be looking for housing to make any significant   contributions to economic growth in the next few years, even if interest rates were noticeably   lower  So I think our aspirations should be calibrated to not expecting recovery in housing   Slower consumer spending growth in this recovery can be attributed in part to the fact   that the saving rate hasn’t fallen this time the way it did in other recoveries, following deep   contractions  Elevated saving seems driven by debt reduction and limited confidence in the   strength of income growth rather than by high interest rates, I think  So it seems unlikely to me   that lower Treasury yields would do much to discourage saving or slow the rate at which   consumers are paying down debt   Another factor dampening consumption growth is the moderate pace of employment   growth  A significant pickup in consumption from its current modest pace, thus, would seem to   require a pickup in new hiring  As I indicated in my regional comments, though, I’ve been   struck by the widespread reports of firms being unwilling to commit to new hiring or new   investments until there’s a bit more clarity about some of the policies that could affect them in   the future  Eventually this current heightened level of uncertainty will dissipate, obviously, and I   think at that point hiring will expand more rapidly  But until then I think economic growth is   going to be limited by forces that are largely beyond our ability to offset  Thank you, Mr   Chairman   September 21, 2010 44 of 151               Did you say the transmission mechanism was damaged?     Okay  I mean, I didn’t hear those exact words  What are you trying to   describe there?     Okay     I’ll talk later     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Inflation is low and reasonably stable at this   level  There is a modest recovery in place—it’s slower than we’d like it to be, but the economy   is still expanding  I think it’s worth noting that inflation is now at a level that characterized most   of the 14-year period between the Treasury–Fed Accord in 1951 and 1965  That level is low by   the standards we have set since then, but I think that provides good evidence that an inflation rate   between 1 and 1½ percent doesn’t have to imply a high probability of an impending deflationary   spiral   I understand the geekiness provided to us by Presidents Bullard and Kocherlakota on   liquidity traps  I understand the logic of that quite fully—I just don’t think it’s a present danger    If the prospect of sustained disinflation from where we are now or deflation were to emerge, I   would strongly support expanding the monetary base, because, as the Chairman rightly   emphasized, no matter where one stands on the efficacy or potency of monetary policy in the   present environment for real outcomes, we all agree that we can engineer any arbitrary inflation   or deflation we want with the tools at our disposal and on the balance sheet  But I don’t think   we’re anywhere close to seeing sustained deflation or disinflation break out   Now, real growth is disappointingly low  Unemployment remains stubbornly high    That’s true  I’ve tried to make the case that those outcomes are likely due to an array of real   factors outside our control and beyond our ability to offset  So I think if we get something close   to the Tealbook forecast for growth for the remainder of the year, we should count our blessings   and stick with our current policy stance   I don’t favor moving now, and I don’t think I’m going to favor expanding our balance   sheet in November unless, as I said, something very unexpected happens on the deflation front    And that seems unlikely to me  I would favor alternative B, but for the language in paragraphs 2   September 21, 2010 89 of 151             and 4 that strongly signal our openness to moving in November  I think those are going to act   like ringing a bell for markets, and they are going to take this as pretty much a signal that action   is coming in November   Now, Mr English talked about boosting consumer and business confidence  When we   took action in August, I think we saw that it had the opposite effect and that it was one of those   occasions on which our action to provide more stimulus was read as a signal that we’re more   worried about the economy, and they should be more worried about the economy than they had   been  You mentioned, Mr Chairman, that you didn’t want to move today because you wanted to   avoid a repeat of that by preparing markets for the move  I don’t quite see the logic behind the   notion that preparing markets will make our move any less a negative signal about our views   about the strength of the recovery going forward  So I just don’t see this as likely to boost   confidence or unleash aggregate demand  None of my contacts are mentioning a lack of   confidence that our balance sheet is large enough right now   More broadly, the language in alternative B heightens the prominence of our mandate in   the statement  And I think we ought to be very careful about doing that  First of all, we haven’t   talked about what inflation rate we view as consistent with our mandate or price stability in three   years  And the way the language in alternative B is worded now, it doesn’t say “Committee   members judge”  It says, “The Committee judges”  It clearly marks this as a collective   judgment that we stopped short of doing three years ago  Now, we do report in the Summary of   Economic Projections our individual forecast for longer-run inflation and what that’s consistent   with  But, as I said during our deliberations back then, if the Committee votes on an objective,   I’ll sign up for that, and I’ll participate in this meeting as if that were my objective as well  But   September 21, 2010 90 of 151             we haven’t gotten there yet, so I think this conveys a bit more about our deliberations than we   have actually engaged in   My deeper objection—and here I will add my own geekiness to the conversation—is that   we really don’t care about unemployment, and we really don’t care about inflation  These are   shortcuts  These are reduced forms  What we care about is the economic welfare of the   American public  That’s what we care about  In economic models, one can write down policy   functions that treat the policymakers as if they were maximizing a two-argument objective   function, and those seem to fit really well  But I think it’s worth reflecting on two things  First,   we were actually given three mandates, the third being moderate long-term interest rates—I think   that’s the way it reads  And we’ve apparently used our own discretion to jettison the third   mandate  No one comes clamoring and complaining about it, for sure, but certainly that reflected   a substantive economic judgment that the best contribution we can make to low and moderate   interest rates is to keep inflation low   I think a similar case can be made about unemployment as well, namely, that our tools do   not have a symmetric relationship to unemployment and inflation  I think there is a danger in   elevating the mandate this way, and especially in taking action at this time, both as a general   matter and in this particular case  To me, it ties us too closely to having responsibility for   economic growth  This reaches beyond the extent to which we should have responsibility for, as   you put it Mr Chairman, nominal measures  I think we need to give that very careful thought   and avoid the risk of taking responsibility for the rate of GDP growth and the pace at which the   unemployment rate comes down   I’m going to insert a little more geekiness here  Take the Taylor rule, for example  This   and other models frame policy as if it were responding to deviations of inflation and deviations   September 21, 2010 91 of 151             of unemployment from targets  In New Keynesian Phillips curves models hit by real shocks, the   interest rate one needs to keep inflation stable varies in a way that’s correlated with the   unemployment rate  So the apparent responsiveness to deviations in the gap emerges just   because the noninflationary interest rate itself varies with real conditions  I think there’s a real   substantive issue here about how we treat the mandates in our communications  Thank you, Mr   Chairman     I understand that     Yes, I support what President Bullard said  I’d also point out that this   statement is going to be read in the context of reports last week of economists predicting   essentially what this does and what we plan  And I support fully, of course, what Vice Chairman   Dudley said about the communications after the last meeting     Right  It’s on the terrace in the Martin Building     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I, too, applaud all the staff’s work  I think it   was a great idea to work hard at this juncture to try to move towards some coherent change in the   framework around our monetary policy actions   I’m very sympathetic to the idea of a mandate-consistent inflation objective, and I think that   putting the objective in the statement or in our communications, as in statement 2, could really help    We were on the verge of adopting a numerical objective for inflation four and a half years ago    Events intervened, so it would be great to find a good opportunity to get back to that and to cross the   line to making it explicit   October 15, 2010 25 of 62             I’m against a price-level target at this time  I think it’s sort of complicated  I think it’s hard   to communicate, and it’s hard to prevent secondary accounts that would boil our decision down to a   statement of, “Well, they want to increase inflation for a couple of years”  I think that’s inevitably   going to be the headline version of how a price-level target would be communicated  Also, it would   look sort of opportunistic, and it would convey a sense that we have a regime where we move our   near-term inflation rate target around a lot, and I think that would be detrimental to our credibility   As for putting some numerical information about an unemployment rate in a public   communication of ours, I strongly object  I don’t think we’re ready for that, I don’t think it’s a good   idea, and I think it’s dangerous for some of the reasons that Presidents Bullard and Kocherlakota   have articulated  I think that, even with the qualifications that you articulated this morning in your   speech, Mr Chairman, and that are in the statement, it would inevitably be viewed as a target equal   in stature and importance to our inflation target but somewhat above the “moderate long-term   interest rate” objective that is part of our mandate as well  I think that the language that’s in the   proposed statement about the unemployment rate is confusing and potentially highly misleading in   very dangerous ways  It describes it as “sustainable in the longer term”  When I think about   “sustainable” inflation rates—that’s where we use the term, after all—I think of a longer-run   average inflation rate  Yet I don’t think people think of this unemployment rate, 5 to 5¼, as the   longer-run average unemployment rate  I think what you have in mind is full employment—the   language that was used in the 1963 Economic Report of the President  From the data, it doesn’t   look as if it’s going to be easy for us to sustain an unemployment rate of 5 percent—the   unemployment rate gets down there, but in recessions it goes up again  It’s also not clear to me that   we need to talk about the unemployment rate in our statement  Our mandate says “maximum   employment” after all  A lot of other things go into the unemployment rate, as others have noted   October 15, 2010 26 of 62             Let me take a crack at articulating something I tried to convey at our last meeting  This   notion of a sustainable longer-run inflation rate seems to me to be motivated by the NAIRU idea;   that is, the NAIRU is a latent variable to which the unemployment rate returns, and it’s slow   moving—maybe it responds to demographic factors or productivity growth or the like, but it does so   only over long time horizons and in a smooth and gradual way  But I think it’s important to   recognize that this slow-moving characteristic is an assumption that’s imposed on the model—  maybe there are some technological assumptions that lead to it—and it’s not verifiable or testable   within that framework, because it’s a latent variable   If you relax that assumption, as the New Keynesian Phillips curve models do—the ones   built on preferences, endowments, and technologies—you find that this latent variable, the NAIRU,   responds to all the shocks that affect business cycle fluctuations in output and inflation  What’s   important to recognize is that there’s a bunch of theory built into the way the NAIRU has been   constructed, and it is theory that is very, very open to debate, and I don’t think we’ve seen enough   by way of staff analysis of alternative approaches  The approach built into this NAIRU idea is one   that goes back to Samuelson and Solow and to the models that, I think, got us into trouble in the   1970s  I thought the debate about this was sort of settled in the 1980s, so I’m surprised that it   lingers for so long in our thinking  As I said, I think this is a somewhat dangerous and misleading   idea, because it’s going to lead people to believe that we need to reduce the unemployment rate   rapidly to its longer-run sustainable rate  I don’t think it’s going to be easy to communicate the   sense that that’s something that we don’t expect to be able to get to for four or five years   Let me emphasize that, for me, this isn’t a matter of not caring about unemployment  I think   unemployment is a problem  But I’m with President Bullard on this—and I think it’s the consensus   in the field—namely, that our best contribution is to keep inflation fluctuating around a level that’s   October 15, 2010 27 of 62             low and stable  Inevitably, there’s theorizing when you make the transition from economic models   that allow you to evaluate the well-being of people to a reduced form, such as thinking of policy as   pursuing an objective of low inflation and unemployment  I’m not against theorizing, and I’m not   against basing what we do on some theory  But we ought to be explicit about it and put our cards   on the table  I don’t think we’ve had enough time to do that, and I don’t think the staff is focused on   that step of the movement from maximizing welfare to the point where we say, “All right, here’s   how we’re going to operationalize the mandate Congress has given us”   My preference would be to leave any numerical discussion of the unemployment rate to the   SEP, as we do now  I found myself drawn to the idea of an option that wasn’t on the table—you   might call it 15—where we’re explicit about our inflation rate but not numerically explicit about the   unemployment rate  If being explicit about our inflation rate is something that needs to be held   hostage to being explicit about the unemployment rate, then I’m with President Kocherlakota and   say that we just ought to defer that step for the time being and communicate about inflation as we do   now  After all, we’re very, very close to having articulated the target rate as 2 percent or a little   under that   On LSAPs, I agree with President Bullard  Let’s drop the L or else add an MSAP to our   arsenal  If more accommodation is needed, the arguments President Kocherlakota articulated are   quite persuasive to me  I think it depends on what we’re worried about and what we’re trying to   achieve  If we’re worried about preventing a deflationary spiral, then the size of our balance sheet   in the next couple of months is probably much less important than what people believe about the   future path, and, in this case, the far future path, of our policy  In the model where people are   forward-looking and we have perfect credibility, it’s sufficient to convince people that we will not   let the money supply decline in a way that’s consistent with deflation, at least relative to how the   October 15, 2010 28 of 62             demand for money evolves  I’ve always viewed quantitative easing as operating at least as   importantly through the channel of convincing people that we’re focused on the quantity of money   and not going to let it decline, as through the portfolio balance mechanics that the staff has spent so   much time quantifying  If we do go down the path of asset purchases, I do like the idea of the type   of small-scale program that President Bullard outlined  I think that has the advantage of conveying   that we’re engaged in more rule-like behavior, that is, that we’re engaged in a consistent pattern of   behavior, rather than acting on our own discretion and moving opportunistically   I’ve sort of expressed my preference about the proposed statements  I do like the idea of   press conferences—I think you’d be great at it, Mr Chairman  I do not think we’re ready at this   time for other social media, like Twitter or Facebook, for communicating our monetary policy, but   maybe down the road we’d want to consider it  Thank you very much     Summary first, press conference, then minutes?     With the release     Sounds good     Thank you, Mr Chairman  It looks to me as if one could say that the   main effect of the asset-purchase program on real growth for the US acts through the value of   the dollar  I say that because the effect of the program on, for example, 2011 economic growth   is 03 percent  That’s about the amount by which the forecast changed from the last Tealbook to   this, and you sort of invited us to equate those two; the change in the contribution of net exports   to real growth is 03 percent, and, for all the other components of GDP, the contribution changes   by a tenth of a percent or less and they all net out   November 2–3, 2010 36 of 238               Thanks     Mr Chairman, this was useful information about the effect of LSAPs on   the outlook  I’d just note the contrast between the two-page box we got and the wealth of detail   we get about alternative scenarios that vary by things we can’t control, and I would appreciate   fuller information at future decisionmaking meetings     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Reports on economic activity in the Fifth   Federal Reserve District remained mixed in October, suggesting not much of a change in the   November 2–3, 2010 55 of 238             outlook on net from the previous report  The manufacturing index moved back into positive   territory last month, with shipments, new orders, and employment all ticking up  Several   individual manufacturers tell us that they are operating at or near capacity after having sharply   reduced capacity in 2008 and 2009  And a few of these are indicating that they are nearing the   point at which they will need to add workers  Our service sector survey remains a bit more   downbeat; although the indexes have not deteriorated further, they remain in negative territory    We did see some improvement in shopper traffic in big-ticket items, however, and the responses   to our expectations questions improved significantly last month as well  We continued to hear   complaints about policy uncertainty, but uncertain demand prospects are also clearly a factor    We actually did hear a couple of contacts say they are hanging on until after the election, so,   perhaps, some economically relevant uncertainty is dissipating as we speak  [Laughter]   The data on the national economy since the last meeting also suggest little change in the   outlook  Consumer spending keeps advancing, perhaps as rapidly as can be expected, given the   balance sheet repair that many households have undertaken  On the softer side, the rebound in   manufacturing has clearly slowed, which could lead to questions about the sustainability of   business investment  But I still think the fundamentals for business investment outside of   structures look reasonably promising, particularly in the information processing category  On   balance, I think the erosion in the outlook that occurred over the summer appears to have come   to a halt, so my outlook hasn’t changed much since September  I continue to expect slow   economic growth, about 2 percent in the second half of this year, gradually rising to about   3½ percent by late next year, bringing the unemployment rate down to about 9 percent then   The most striking macroeconomic development since the last meeting was that the   general public has become fairly firmly convinced that we are going to initiate another program   November 2–3, 2010 56 of 238             of sizable asset purchases at this meeting  This has resulted in a dramatic fall in Treasury yields,   as Brian Sack noted, and that has brought inflation compensation back up to a range that might   be characterized as more towards the center of the range it has been in over the last five or six   years   Other news on the nominal front includes a pickup in nominal GDP growth to 44 percent   year over year for the third quarter, from 39 percent the previous quarter  You cited nominal   GDP growth at the last meeting, Mr Chairman  And there has been a pickup in M2 growth to   83 percent over the last two months  So I think the overall inflation picture provides even less   reason to ramp up stimulus right now than it did a month or two ago   On the real side, the Tealbook estimates that a $600 billion asset-purchase program will   only make the unemployment rate 03 percentage point lower at the end of 2012  This is a   strikingly small number, in my mind, and it makes the benefits of such a program look really   small relative to the risks  But I’ll wait until the policy round to talk about risks     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I have three questions—two for our   Manager, and one for the staff  Brian, when you were discussing panel 2 and the proposed   distribution of the purchases under alternative B, I think you said that you wouldn’t necessarily   exactly hit these, depending on what offers were shown  I wanted to find out a little more about   what you meant  The base case would be that we’d go to the market with a certain amount of   buys in each CUSIP, and that’s what we’d buy, and we’d let the market determine the price    You obviously have something else in mind   November 2–3, 2010 121 of 238               I know how you do it with triparty RP operations across the three   tranches, so you’re going to have some similar mathematical construct about the yield curve to   tell you how to judge prices and offers across the yield curve, right?     The great achievement of the 1951 Accord was to free prices in the   government market from our fixing them  Do you feel like you might be in danger of kind of   pegging the yield curve spreads?     But the two are intertwined in your methodology, right?  I assumed that,   in some sense, the idea of alternative B was  here’s an amount and here’s how we’re going to   buy it across the curve, and we don’t know how the yield curve is going to react  There are a lot   of empirics about that, and for a couple of years we’ve been wrestling with the question of what   effect these things have on 10-year securities versus 2-year securities  You’re supplementing the   Committee’s choice with some judgment, and you’re saying that the broad program is going to   have its effect, but you’re just going to tweak it around the margin  How do you draw the line   there?     Okay  So across the boundaries there’s no linkage?     So 54 year maturity versus 55, you’re not going to make a relative   value judgment across that?     Yeah, I know, but they aren’t, see?     Okay, so you’re not going to make that judgment     Okay, and how much of this is going to be transparent to the market?     Yes, but what about the spline?  The bidders are going to understand   after a while that you’re not taking it pro rata, that you’re making judgments, right?  What are   you going to explain about how you do this?  The triparty market knows how you do this     Why don’t you give it to them?     That’s useful  Here’s my second question for you, Brian  You said that   you thought that the pace in the forecast under alternative B was—I think I heard this right—  about at our capacity to make purchases while avoiding disrupting market functioning  I   wondered if you could help the Committee understand what the nature of market dysfunction   would constitute if we were to exceed that limit  If we were to stray accidentally and do too   much and it created market dysfunction, what would that market dysfunction look like?  What   would it consist of?     I’m sorry, I had a third question     Because we’re talking about policy options, even though the effect of   the policy was discussed yesterday by Dave Wilcox, I just want to ask another question about   that, and, in fact, this question is inspired by something you said yesterday  I really appreciated   your very extensive remarks at the end of the day yesterday  It was very beneficial to hear from   you in that amount of detail your thinking about a wide variety of issues related to this   I’ve never seen the Committee presented with any analyses of asset-purchase programs   that were not accompanied by an equal-sized expansion of the monetary base  It’s easy to   imagine something like that—we did it in the 1960s with Operation Twist where we sterilized   purchases of long securities by selling short securities—picking some point at the short end of   the term structure, where yields aren’t equal to the interest rate on reserves, and selling there an   amount equal to what we buy at the long end of the curve  You’ve never presented us with an   analysis of that  Moreover, in all of the empirics aimed at assessing the effect of the LSAP, all of   them have announcements where it was widely understood that those purchases were going to be   accompanied by an increase in the monetary base of equal size  So I’m wondering what   information you could give us to disentangle or differentiate between the effects of asset   purchases and the effects of expanding the monetary base and what the staff’s view is about the   difference   November 2–3, 2010 126 of 238               I recall those discussions, and I had some discussions with bankers as   did other folks at the Richmond Fed  Did you do this in August or September of last year?     The discussions with the banks that I’m familiar with indicated that in   their liquidity management operations they did view the margin of substitution between reserve   balances and short-term Treasury and agency securities  At the yields during the summer, they   viewed it as an attractive option to reduce their holdings of reserve balances and move into   Treasuries and agencies  In the event, we kept increasing reserves  Lo and behold, yields on   Treasuries and agencies fell in the fall, which is what you’d predict would have to happen to   make them willing to hold the reserves involved     Right, but obviously there’s a whole chain of unsegmented markets in   those types of securities that would transmit that out the yield curve, so it’s not inconceivable   that that could be having an effect  Governor Duke raised the question of what banks are going   to do with all these reserves, so I think it’s legitimate to consider whether the monetary base   could be as much of a factor in the effect of this program as the longer-term yield, which is just   the point I wanted to explore     I’d mention another thing  You wouldn’t expect the QE channel to be   limited to bank lending, right?   The decrease in corporate yields could just as well occur because   you’re pushing people out through a series of markets—you’re making yields such that they   want to move out, and that pushes yields down in other markets  So it might not be bank lending   where rates are pushed down  It could be working in markets where the borrowers are more   creditworthy, which tend not to be intermediated in our economy  And bank security holdings   have been going up lately as bank lending has been going down     I just take my anecdotal evidence from the large institution whose   liquidity management operation we’ve had a fair amount of interaction with  There is a   meaningful margin of imperfect substitution between bank reserves and other short-term liquid   securities that they hold as part of their liquidity management operations     We could just say we haven’t adopted price level targeting     Thank you, Mr Chairman  As I said, I appreciated your remarks   yesterday afternoon  During those remarks, you noted that many of us, if not all of us, are   nervous about this policy, so please count me in the nervous camp  In fact, count me in the too-   nervous-to-support-alternatives-B-or-A camp  I will explain why I’m nervous and then comment   briefly on the language that we might use if we elect to move today   First, as I mentioned yesterday, I don’t believe the benefits of further monetary stimulus   would be terribly large  In a nutshell, I think inflation is not too low, the risk of deflation is quite   small, and very little additional real growth would result  I don’t need to elaborate, because   these notions are consistent with points that several others around this table and I have been   making for some time, namely, that it looks as if economic growth is slow now for reasons that   monetary policy can and should do little to ameliorate  In addition, I find it disconcerting that,   according to the Tealbook, something like two-thirds of the improvement in the growth outlook   seems to be attributable to the net export effect of the reduced value of the dollar  Given the   climate of international discourse regarding currency valuations—and I recognize that some   around the table are more expert in this area than I—my sense is that it wouldn’t be helpful for   us to be seen as stimulating economic growth primarily through currency depreciation    Moreover, the growth effects in that channel could be dampened to the extent that other central   banks adjust their policy in response—a factor that I understand isn’t taken into account in the   box on pages 4 and 5   Second, I think the risks of providing further stimulus at this time are substantial  The   fact that the effects are likely to be so small adds to those risks  While inflation has downshifted   over the last two years, to be sure, I seriously doubt whether we would be considering more   November 2–3, 2010 137 of 238             quantitative easing if it weren’t for the elevated level of the unemployment rate  So, in that   sense, I think it’s fair to say this is mostly about unemployment, and I think that’s how markets   are going to read this  More quantitative easing right now would imply more influence over the   unemployment rate than we actually have, and would promise more improvement in   unemployment than we are capable of delivering  The precedent this sets would bias our   reaction function toward unemployment, both in our actual reaction function and in the public’s   perception of it  As a result, people are likely to expect increasing monetary stimulus as long as   the level of the unemployment rate is disappointing, and that’s likely to be true for a long, long   time   This asset-purchase program is predicated on the notion that inflation expectations are   stable enough that we have the leeway to provide additional stimulus  This may look like a   pretty safe bet right now, with inflation low and expectations near the center of recent ranges    But if economic growth doesn’t seem to respond rapidly enough to our efforts, as I suspect will   be the case, we inevitably will be tempted to risk an inflation uptick by doubling down on the   program size  Moreover, the path we are taking today could put us in a difficult quandary in the   not unlikely scenario that inflationary pressures build up before unemployment is judged to be   acceptably low  Inflation expectations could be much more difficult to restrain then, if we are   seen as having tilted towards unemployment   For me, this poses unacceptable risks to price stability and to our credibility  Those risks   might not materialize this quarter, they might not materialize next quarter, or next year, given   where inflation is right now, but we know that there will come a time in this recovery when the   amount of reserves we are supplying right now would be too much and would set off an   acceleration of inflation  When that time approaches, unemployment could well be higher than   November 2–3, 2010 138 of 238             we and many others would like to see it, and, at that point, I fear today’s decision and the   expectations it encourages will come back to haunt us   I have a comment on the language in alternatives A and B, paragraph 2, which I offer up   in the spirit of how to provide stimulus, if you must  It has to do with the second sentence in   paragraph 2, which describes unemployment as elevated and inflation as somewhat low relative   to levels consistent with the dual mandate  I think we all agree with the obvious point made by   President Bullard at our last meeting, namely, if we’re conducting monetary policy in a way that   is ideal, evaluated against our statutory mandates, then it will be the case that unemployment and   inflation are at times different from their target values—that is, their long-run average values or   the value to which they would converge over time in the absence of further economic shocks    And that seems like a pretty clear and generally accepted point about how we do policy  The   second sentence in A2 and B2 seems to imply that the current levels of the unemployment rate   are inconsistent with our mandates  I don’t think it’s true that the current levels of   unemployment are inconsistent with us conducting a policy in a way that’s optimal vis-à-vis our   mandates  We’re obviously debating what to do to continue to be optimal relative to our   mandates, but this isn’t just a semantic point  This language encourages people to view us as   failures or as having fallen short whenever unemployment is even moderately high, and that’s   essentially a view of policy as a series of static, one-time problems  We disposed of that   viewpoint several decades ago, as you know  Instead, the viewpoint that President Bullard was   sketching, the modern one, is that economies are hit by shocks  There are important   intertemporal interdependencies, which means that you set policy over time such that the   economy responds in a way that is optimal against our goals  In other words, with no shocks, the   convergence back to steady state would be at an optimal pace  You can debate what an optimal   November 2–3, 2010 139 of 238             pace is, and that is something that is at the heart of the judgment of what monetary policy is   about  But it’s about the pace of return to those average long-run values or ideal values, it’s not   about the level against those ideal values   We should find a way, I believe, in minutes or testimony, to convey the sense of—and   here I will use some geeky language—what optimal policy means in a stochastic equilibrium,   which is what President Bullard was talking about  Until then, though, I suggest we end the   second sentences after the word “low,” so that it reads, “Currently, the unemployment rate is   elevated, and measures of inflation are somewhat low”  That does the job  It deletes the clause   pulling in our mandate, but the first sentence of the paragraph prominently mentions our   mandate  Moreover, the third sentence is the one that characterizes our assessment of policy in   terms of the pace at which we’re getting back to where we want to be, namely, that progress is   too slow  With that suggestion, I thank you and conclude my remarks, Mr Chairman     Right  It does the job     It just doesn’t seem to me that, given the third sentence, we need to be   judgmental in the sentence that talks about levels of unemployment  “Over the longer run” with   the unemployment rate, as I said last time, is kind of problematic     Yes, I know  Is this the long-run average?  I don’t think so, right?  In   the absence of shocks, it would converge to something that’s at the lower end of its range, so it’s   a concept that needs more explanation  And I’m not sure why you need to talk about the   mandate a second time in the second sentence     My point was that we don’t want to lead people to believe that, if   unemployment is ever high, it’s because we have failed and are doing bad policy  You’d agree   with that, wouldn’t you?     What does it mean arithmetically?  If you had to write it down   arithmetically, what would “over the longer run” mean about the unemployment rate?     You mean the natural rate     Well, that’s not uncontroversial     No  I’m not saying we’re at the natural rate, but, I mean—   November 2–3, 2010 199 of 238               Well, “objectives” is pretty broad, isn’t it?     We care about risks, because it’s a risk to achieving our objective  It   should be tautological here     Financial stability?  Well, that’s one of our objectives now, right?      Well, I’ve changed my mind on this  This would add yet another   reference to our mandate, and I think we mention it, what, five or six times?  We’re   perseverating   November 2–3, 2010 203 of 238               Thank you, Mr Chairman  Brian, you wrote us a memo on   December 10 about SOMA’s holdings of foreign exchange assets and euro-denominated assets,   and among their holdings are these reverse repo investments  You talked about the six countries   whose sovereign debt we accept as collateral for those, which include Italy and Spain  In a chart   you showed that the fraction of collateral we get that’s Italian and Spanish sovereign debt has   increased recently and explained that the margin we take is 2 percent across the board, which is   comparable with what the ECB does—there’s a table in the back that shows ECB and Bank of   England haircut rates   But there’s also a table that shows the London Clearing House collateral rates, and   they’re all below 2 percent—well, half of them are below 2—but Italian and Spanish haircuts are   above 2 percent, at 28 and 31 percent  Do you think that’s why we’re getting more Italian and   Spanish sovereign debt?  And do you think it’s prudent for our haircuts to be below the market   haircut?     So for the term repos, it’s marked to market daily, and the haircuts are   applied daily?     Okay  I can appreciate that a daily change is small and that Spain and   Italy aren’t Ireland and Greece, which we don’t accept  But if private sector counterparties think   December 14, 2010 10 of 127             that a higher haircut is warranted, would it do tremendous violence to front run your big   framework review with some adjustments to collateral requirements in the meantime?     Is there any cost to graduated haircut schedules?  Is there any   disadvantage to doing that?     We have market practice to point to     I would just speak in favor of the arrangement the staff brought us  It is   a renewable thing  I doubt the staff has ever given our counterparties reason to believe that   renewal was questionable or problematic  It never has been, but it does give us the opportunity   to reevaluate the terms, reevaluate amounts, and retain that flexibility  So I, for one, would be   more comfortable with the six-month arrangement   December 14, 2010 18 of 127               Thank you, Mr Chairman  Our last District survey, which came out in   late November, showed gains in manufacturing and services but continued weakness in retail    Price trend indicators, both current and expected six months ahead, have all moved up notably   over the last couple of months  More recent anecdotal reports also suggest that District   economic conditions are improving but are still weak by historical standards  For example,   we’ve seen a few encouraging signs in commercial real estate in the District  Vacancy rates   appear to have topped out for office and industrial space, though the picture is mixed for retail   space, and residential real estate sales are declining, but prices seem to be holding up   At the national level, confidence in the economic outlook has picked up noticeably since   our last meeting  Perhaps most important is the steady expansion in real personal consumption   expenditures after they bottomed out in the second quarter of 2009 and increased at an annual   rate of less than 2 percent over the rest of that year  Since then the growth rate in consumption   has steadily risen  It has averaged more than 3 percent over the last four months  The gains   we’ve seen in personal income and the stability of the personal saving rate are also encouraging   signs  Of course, the November payroll report was disappointing, but I agree with the Tealbook   that it seems inconsistent with the broader array of labor market indicators  On top of that,   consumer confidence readings suggest a return of some of the outcomes we saw last spring  So   unless the holiday season is quite disappointing, I think we should enter the New Year with   momentum in household spending, and that should help broaden confidence in economic   prospects   The outlook for residential investment still looks bleak to me  The Tealbook quite   notably has slashed its forecast for housing starts in light of the large inventory overhang, and I   December 14, 2010 53 of 127             think they have a more realistic path now  It must have been difficult to keep econometrically   based forecasts from returning to recovery patterns much more like history, and I think   estimating the magnitude of overhang relative to some sort of desirable stock of housing is   inherently difficult  So I think they have a more realistic forecast right now   Core inflation measures have fallen, certainly, in recent months, but measures of overall   inflation, which is what we really care about, have moved in the opposite direction recently    Moreover, survey measures of inflation expectations remain stable, and TIPS-based measures   have reversed most of this year’s decline  As a result, I still think the downside risk to inflation   is relatively small   The Desk added more than $100 billion in Treasuries to the SOMA portfolio since the   November meeting  Let me just say that I find it hard to attribute much, if any, of the increase in   the outlook to the quantitative easing at this point, so I agree with others who have made that   point  Part of the way we think about the effect of these purchases involves their effect on the   yields of the assets we’re buying  Longer-term rates have moved up notably over the   intermeeting period, but they declined notably before the last meeting, as President Bullard   noted, in anticipation of our actions  As a result, it’s hard to know how many basis points of   easing we created or saved through this action   The other way we think about the effects of asset purchases is in terms of Governor   Duke’s question from the last meeting, which was, essentially  What will induce banks to hold a   higher level of reserves?  Either yields on alternative liquid assets will decrease, or deposits will   be created through lending or asset acquisition or both  It’s probably too soon to get a   quantitative handle on this channel, I think, but it’s interesting to note that our most recent asset   purchases began in the midst of a modest revival in money growth  So I think it’s going to be   December 14, 2010 54 of 127             worthwhile to keep a careful eye on bank balance sheets and monetary aggregates in the months   ahead     Thank you, Mr Chairman I still oppose the asset purchase program we   decided on at the last meeting  So I personally would favor scaling the program back as in   alternative C  However, I can understand why those who supported the asset purchase program   at our November meeting would be reluctant to back off right now  The economic outlook has   improved somewhat since the last meeting, but probably not enough to convince many of you to   switch camps  So I won’t bother trying to persuade you to do so   What I would like to do is to make some comments in anticipation of discussions we may   face at upcoming meetings in the new year in light of what’s happened in the last couple of   weeks to the long rate, and this is by way commenting on essentially our reaction function  An   intermediate objective of our asset purchases was to reduce longer-term rates  So the recent   increase in those rates presents us with something of a problem, which we may face fairly often   going forward, namely, how should we react to increases in long rates  The answer depends on   just why long rates go up, obviously  As a general matter, if long rates are driven up by a rise in   inflation expectations to levels above those consistent with price stability, I think we would all   agree as a matter of principle that monetary policy should shift to a less accommodative stance    In the present case, obviously, the rise in nominal Treasury yields since the November FOMC   December 14, 2010 86 of 127             meeting has been virtually all real  Inflation expectations haven’t risen much over that time   frame, although they did rise between September and November   If long rates are driven up instead by a significant strengthening in the economic outlook,   we should applaud that strength and simply point out that higher expected growth requires higher   real interest rates  If we got enough strengthening, that would indicate that monetary stimulus   should be scaled back, but, in any case, I don’t see a reason why additional economic strength   would warrant additional stimulus  As I said before, I think the strengthening in the outlook has   been modest so far  So it is unlikely to have been the only reason for the run-up in yields   A third possibility is a little more disturbing, and it is that long rates are driven up by   increasing fears about long-run fiscal balance, in other words, that future debt issues are expected   to crowd out private investment and drive up real rates  The rate response to the announcement   of the tax deal certainly suggests that anticipated fiscal implications could have contributed to the   recent rate increases  In this case it would be clearly inappropriate for us to try to counteract the   increase in rates with an expansion in our purchase plans or by avoiding a reduction in our   purchase plans that we would otherwise have been inclined to make   Now, I believe we would want to be clear that we will not alter policy to accommodate a   deficit-driven increase in Treasury rates  I think there are dangers in the other direction, as well    In the perhaps unlikely event that the Congress and the Administration move forward next year   to substantially reduce the path of future federal deficits, we may be pressured to keep federal   financing costs down  Moderate long-term interest rates, after all, are one of our three supposed   mandates  Obviously, we would want to resist that, but we could find ourselves being perceived   as thwarting the Congress’s attempts to resolve the nation’s fiscal problems   December 14, 2010 87 of 127             I want to point out that the broader point is essentially the one that Eric Leeper was   making at the Jackson Hole conference  Eric and Chris Sims and many others have been making   the same point for many, many years, and it’s about the danger of letting monetary policy slide   into a stance of passively accommodating fiscal policy, which, in our current case, is at   significant risk of being dysfunctional  Eric Leeper argued that even before we switch to a sort   of passive mode, expectations that such a switch might occur in the near future or even several   years down the road could well have inflationary consequences today  Indeed, the story of   monetary policy in the late 1960s, a period when inflation drifted upward unchecked, is largely   about monetary policy becoming subservient to fiscal policy  I think this could be a real problem   for us soon if the public perception of a politically weakened Fed leads markets to question our   willingness to act independently of fiscal policy  I know these dangers are well understood by   this Committee, but I think it’s going to be useful to try and anticipate how we would respond   publicly should that challenge face us in the future  Thank you very much, Mr Chairman     We submit projections for various meetings, but we also talk in public   about the outlook, and I’m assuming that that’s fair game, namely, that I can report my   projection in public and submit the same projection     Brian, how do the daylight repurchase agreement procedures that you   settled on to implement this differ from collateralized daylight overdrafts that all the Reserve   Banks make available to domestic banking institutions?  And if they differ, why?     This is a question for Ayşegül  The notion of mismatch depends   critically on the notion of heterogeneity among workers and among worker–firm matches  In the   literature on income inequality, there has been a fair amount of effort devoted over decades to   the measured dispersion of income across workers  A lot of that work uses detailed demographic   data to explain some of those differences, but there’s still a fairly substantial amount of variation   across workers’ incomes that’s not attributable to any observable characteristics  My   understanding is that the magnitude of that dispersion has increased, that is, the amount   attributable to unobservable characteristics has increased  I also have the impression from this   mismatch literature and from the excellent introduction given by all of the staff papers that the   number of observable characteristics of workers and firms that is used in these investigations is   much smaller than in the inequality literature, where you have fairly extensive demographic data    Therefore, you’d expect the heterogeneity that is unmeasured by the econometrician to be much   larger here than in the inequality literature results  In your investigation, you’ve failed to find   evidence for mismatch, but of course, there could be mismatch that you’re just not measuring    So I wonder if you’d be willing to characterize your sense of the extent to which available data   sources, like JOLTS and the others that you’ve exploited, are able to capture heterogeneity that   might be relevant to mismatch or the extent to which there’s unmeasured heterogeneity floating   around that leaves us uncertain about the conclusion     That’s interesting  I have another question, Mr Chairman  The   presentation is titled “Briefing on Structural Unemployment”  At one point in the discussion,   you connected this to the NAIRU, and at another point there was discussion of a category of   change in unemployment that was ruled out of your change in structural unemployment on the   grounds that it was cyclical  This has me puzzled as to whether there’s any reason to care about   structural unemployment other than for its implications for policy dynamics and the NAIRU  Do   we have an independent interest in some concept called structural unemployment, or is this all   about the NAIRU and I should just go back to thinking about economics the way I usually do?     I see     You have this EDO model that’s in the class of post-1970s general   equilibrium models, many of which have the property that any shock affecting economic activity   affects the NAIRU, and thus, you would expect the NAIRU to fluctuate at a cyclical frequency    I’m wondering whether that property of that model has influenced the staff’s thinking about this   January 25–26, 2011 29 of 282                Well, in that effort, there are two objectives that I would assume you’d   be interested in  One is just the pure forecasting, and the other is policy advising  I think the   implications are very different from models like your EDO model, in which the counterpart of   NAIRU could be as high as 89 percent (which is where I think the St Louis Fed has it and   which is also close to my estimate—no matter what my staff said [laughter]) and from models   where your reference level of unemployment—what you call structural unemployment or   NAIRU—is, by design, filtering out business cycle frequency influences  The urgency of some   of our discussions around here obviously depends on that     What other shocks?     I understand the difference in the results you get from different models,   but at a previous meeting you explained to us that you had EDO, a self-contained, general   equilibrium model, and then outside of EDO you estimate a statistical trend to capture potential    So when you tell the story told by EDO, you’re talking about the story told by the combination   of EDO and your ad hoc statistical trend for potential  Am I right about that?     Thank you  I’m glad we cleared that up  [Laughter]     I agree, as well, with everything you said and with what President   Kocherlakota said  Just to cast this in a different light, let me note two things  First, the   exclusion of cyclical from a definition of “structural” is to some sense a priori  And what we’ve   learned from the models we’ve developed and explored and done a lot of research on since the   1970s is that that’s a poor assumption and that there are a lot of models in which that just isn’t   true  I think that is part of the fault line here  Second, I would point out the distribution of   estimates of how much room we have  We’re at 9½ percent unemployment, and we have   estimates that we’re anywhere from 4¼ percentage points to 06 percentage point away from our   mandate-consistent unemployment rate  There’s a substantial difference in the sense of the   urgency one would attach to conducting policy in a way to reduce unemployment  So it’s   consequential for policy      Right  But there’s nothing in a statistical approach that connects that,   without any other assumptions, to what we can do with policy  Right?   January 25–26, 2011 47 of 282                It’s exactly analogous to a deferred tax asset in US corporate   accounting, I believe     I’d just like to qualify that point  Given the current magnitudes, that’s   true as a practical matter, but it’s not a universal principle  For example, we could run out of the   ability to reduce reserves and reduce the base if our asset values fell  So, in theory, it could   impede our ability to withdraw stimulus, but, at the current magnitudes, we’re pretty far away   from that, right?     Thank you, Mr Chairman  My question for you, Brian, has to do with a   couple of things related to the difference between the path that our asset purchases induced for   the asset side of our portfolio and the path that reserves and the monetary base have taken  The   discrepancy has been pretty large in the last couple of months  For example, in December we   bought a lot of assets, but reserves went up just $2 billion and the Treasury general account went   up a ton  Then, in January, we had AIG repaying the New York Fed—as an aside, I’d like to   congratulate the New York Fed on the repayment of the AIG credit—which is almost a   $50 billion reserve drain  Then, in February and March, with the Treasury running off the SFP,   it’s going to add $200 billion  Then, it wasn’t clear from your documentation what the Treasury   is planning with the TGA   I have a granular question  What’s the Treasury thinking about the TGA?  They used to   peg it at $5 billion back when we sterilized stuff  It’s sort of a pain  At the magnitude of our   balance sheet, this is, perhaps, not likely to be material, but it’s bordering on a material effect on   our reserve position  When we get to the point where we’re running off reserves, maybe a   couple of years from now, we could get into situations where the management of the TGA makes   a material difference in what happens to reserve balances  So I’m wondering how we should   January 25–26, 2011 65 of 282              think operationally, in the Committee’s deliberations, and whether the Treasury is giving you   any more color about its intentions for the TGA and whether it’s worthwhile to try to influence   Treasury to provide us with a little more surety about its TGA strategy     Part of my question was motivated by the discussions we had in   December 2008 and January 2009 about the fact that in the past the SOMA had a one-for-one   relationship with reserve conditions and the funds rate, and yet we were embarking in early 2009   on programs that would break that relationship  I thought we agreed to take a cohesive approach   within the Committee, even though, as a governance matter, there were separabilities in the   governance of some of those things  We sit around here and talk about adding $600 billion to   assets under the assumption that it’s going to add $600 billion to reserves, and it turns out that,   under some scenarios, reserves are going to go up $800 billion because of the debt limit  So   there’s a bit of a disconnect in focusing on just the asset side, and that’s what I was suggesting   that we could be thinking about going forward     Thank you very much, Mr Chairman  A hard act to follow, so I’ll stick   to business  The data we’ve seen over the last couple of months is notably better than we were   expecting just two or three months ago  The cumulative effect for me is much more confidence   that the recovery is firmly in place and has picked up speed   What we’ve seen in the Fifth District is consistent with this assessment  I’ll start with the   household sector  Nothing is more central to the recovery than the revival of consumer   spending, and, in our surveys, the diffusion index for retail sales has been notably weak   throughout most of the recovery and, as recently as November, stood at minus 16  In December   it swung to plus 25, and the reading for January improved further to plus 33  Our broader service   sector index has shown improvement similar to that of the ISM nonmanufacturing index at the   national level  It rose to plus 21 in December, and that’s the highest level in several years  It   came to plus 12 in January, which is still a positive reading  I won’t recite more of these District   numbers, but, like the other regional diffusion indexes, our manufacturing measure was strongly   positive for December and January—I think we’ve heard similar reports from Philadelphia and   other Districts   Our anecdotal reports this month also support a more confident view about the recovery    One noticeable swing in recent months is current reports from some of our banking contacts,   who are reporting improvements in loan quality and the emergence of new loan activity  More   January 25–26, 2011 115 of 282              broadly, outside of banking, we’ve also heard noticeably more positive reports and fewer   negative reports than in the recent past   Turning to the national economy, I agree with the Tealbook that we’ve entered the new   year carrying more pace than seemed likely a few months ago  Several developments stand out    Consumer spending growth has picked up and now looks more solid than it once did  Labor   markets are improving  Private employment continues to expand at a somewhat increasing pace    Initial unemployment claims continue to fall  The NFIB hiring plans index surged, and real   disposable income is on an upswing  In addition, I think investment in nonresidential structures   has not been quite as weak as some of us had anticipated, and that suggests we may have reached   a bottom in commercial construction now   All in all, I think a more bullish view of the outlook is warranted  In my projections, I’ve   written down 39 percent for GDP growth for 2011—spurious precision, perhaps, but close to the   Tealbook’s forecast  Obviously one wants to be careful about reacting to the data in marking up   one’s outlook, but I think the improvement in the outlook is unmistakable   The inflation outlook is also firmer now, I think, than it was several months ago  The   Tealbook estimates that PCE inflation was 23 percent over the three months ending in   December  Measures of near-term inflation expectations, both TIPS-based and survey-based,   have moved up by roughly a percentage point since the summer—a fairly substantial move  The   surge in energy and commodity prices obviously has played a role, but our experience with such   surges in the past several years suggest that they’ll show up soon in core inflation as well  I also   think there’s little doubt that deflation risks are notably reduced now and fairly minimal   In sum, I think this recovery is looking less in need of monetary stimulus than it did a few   months ago  Personally, I seriously doubt that our asset purchases have made a material   January 25–26, 2011 116 of 282              contribution to the improvement in the outlook over the last few months  If we continue to get   economic reports consistent with stronger growth—two reasonably healthy payroll employment   reports, for example—then I think at the March meeting we’re seriously going to want to   consider scaling down our purchase program  Thank you very much, Mr Chairman     Thank you very much, Mr Chairman  From the comments during the   economic go-round, I think everyone acknowledges the extent to which the prospects for   economic growth have improved over the last couple of meetings, although there’s also wide   recognition of the need for a bit of caution about how exuberant one gets about them  I’m in the   camp of doubting that our asset purchases made a huge contribution to the improvement,   notwithstanding your observations, Mr Chairman  I say that because I personally doubt that   January 25–26, 2011 156 of 282              changes in long-term yields have been very important to firms’ investment and hiring decisions   or to consumer spending decisions, which seem to have been at the core of the improvement in   the outlook  The way in which growth has strengthened has reduced my assessment of the likely   benefits of our asset purchases  I also doubt that we’ve had that much effect on yields so far  At   the same time, I think the stronger outlook brings forward the time when we’re likely to want to   remove monetary stimulus  To my mind, then, it has raised the risk that continued balance sheet   expansion will prove excessive, in the sense that it sets back the starting point for us to remove   stimulus   Let me note a couple of points  One is that bank reserves have not changed much at all   since we began this asset purchase program  We’re about to see a $450 billion increase over the   next two months in bank reserves, so that undergirds my sense that we haven’t seen much effect   yet from what we’ve done, and we could well see a lot in the next couple of months  The second   point has to do with inflation, and I think you were correct, Mr Chairman, in your comments   about the importance of being careful with this surge in commodity prices that’s coming from   overseas and affecting our headline inflation rate  Our experience over the last couple of decades   has been that there is a measurable effect on core inflation from these energy price surges, so   that’s another justification for some caution about inflation going forward   For me, the case for continuing the program is eroding a bit  I don’t think it’s reasonable   to scale it back right now—in any event, we’ve done nothing to prepare markets for such a   change, as is our well-established custom  It does seem to me, however, that there’s a reasonable   chance of data coming in over the next couple of months that are consistent with stronger   economic growth  And I think you’re right to highlight the employment report—if we were to   get very strong employment reports in the next couple of months, I think that would change the   January 25–26, 2011 157 of 282              whole tenor of the outlook markedly, both in markets and within our Committee, and I think   we’d seriously want to consider adjusting our asset purchase program in March   In light of these thoughts, I see value in preparing markets for that possibility—not   promising, but preparing them for that possibility through your testimony and through the   minutes reflecting our concern about that possibility  I actually liked the original version of the   last sentence of paragraph 3 of alternative B, despite the fact that it seemed to imply that we   didn’t review our program in December  We used the future tense there and the present tense   here   I also have concerns about other parts of the statement  Paragraph 1 of alternative B   seems more downbeat than I think we are around the table  I think paragraph 1 in alternative C   does a much better job of capturing where we are on the outlook  In particular, this litany of   factors restraining household spending seems a bit discordant, because, as you said, the big news   in the fourth quarter was that consumer spending was stronger than we thought  Therefore, I’d   advocate substituting the first paragraph of alternative C for the first paragraph of alternative B   I have one more thing  I applaud your initiating conversations and further discussions   about an explicit numerical objective for inflation  I would just add this observation about these   four words, “or a bit less”  In the past, I’ve brought up my brother-in-law sitting in front of   retirement planning software and calling up his brother-in-law who is on the FOMC and asking   him what number he should put in for inflation for the next 20 years  And I’m wondering what   I’d tell him if our objective was “2 percent or a bit less”     Even though I’ve advocated 1½ percent, I’d be happier with 2 percent   than with “2 percent or a bit less”    January 25–26, 2011 158 of 282                It makes it seem that the category of nonresidential structures is what   has improved     Though it is still insufficient     That’s rocking  [Laughter]     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I, too, want to thank the subcommittee for   putting in time and effort and good thinking to help us on this  I strongly support an effort to   come to a mutual understanding about the standards of integrity we expect of each other, and I   think that’s really worth doing   I’ve been wrestling with this since the subcommittee sent out materials for us to review    I thought I had a grip on a number of principles, but I realized I hadn’t thought deeply about   what they’re grounded on  I think it’s difficult to draw bright lines, and that’s what I am struck   with in reading what you have distributed  Let me take this phrase as an example  “individuals   January 25–26, 2011 214 of 282              whose purpose may be to generate direct or indirect trading profits”  I’m often at receptions   around the District, where I talk to people who are members of the public  As someone else   remarked, virtually any of them could have a portfolio on which they could make a decision that   might reflect what they thought they gleaned from what I said  I think we all know what we’re   trying to capture—the Macroeconomic Advisers of the world—but the net is drawn too loosely   The other issue is predicting monetary policy, and that stuck in my head for a bit,   because, if you look at this from a broader perspective, we’ve been on a three-decade journey   towards greater transparency, towards fuller communication  I think we talk a lot more about   our individual views than we used to  I haven’t gone back and compared speeches, but my   general sense is that, over the last 20 years, members of the FOMC—Governors and   Presidents—say more in public about their own views than they used to  We used to be much   more guarded  Central banks around the world over the last 20 or 30 years have become much   more forthcoming, and I think there’s a really good reason for that  I think that we all understand   that we are more effective the more the public understands about how and why we do things    We want people to understand our reaction function, so, in some sense, we want people to be   able to predict monetary policy  That creates an inevitable tension  Obviously, if markets expect   a move of 25 basis points, and somebody tips them off that it’s going to be 50, that’s a problem    But, explaining macroeconomics to somebody presumably doesn’t prejudice a decision and helps   what we’re doing going forward  Between those two poles there’s going to be some fuzziness;   for example, the elements of macroeconomics that you choose to enlighten people about can   convey information about your views—in fact, this is a time-honored Fed communication   practice that we use to hint about one thing or another   January 25–26, 2011 215 of 282              This is a hard issue to resolve, and it draws me strongly to the idea of dealing with it in   terms of principles rather than prescriptive, detailed, legalistic rules  Along the same lines, I   think that centralized reporting is going to absorb a lot of time and effort on a small fraction of   cases that are sort of blurry; for example, people will be spending time trying to figure whether   they should report something or not, and it’s not likely to be worth the effort  I think what we’re   going for should be a mutual understanding of the general principles involved, which are   selectivity of access and inappropriate disclosure, or the perception of those two things   I think what President Bullard said is really important  Imagine that we adopt a formal   policy on communications  Imagine that it’s also secret  So we adopt a secret policy on   communication—well, that doesn’t seem right  I think we’re going to be drawn towards   releasing our policy  And I think President Bullard is right that we want to frame it in the broad   context of the value we see of communicating to American citizens  I also think First Vice   President Moore is right that we’re perceived as cozy with Wall Street when the reality is that we   spend a ton of time with the citizens around our Districts   In sum, I think it would be useful to have that come through in a statement of what we   think our communication is about, and how we do it with integrity  I would urge the   subcommittee to think about it from both the positive side and the negative side and try to craft a   philosophical statement that starts things off and says something like, “Yes, communicating to   the public is important, because they need to understand what we do, why we do it, how we do it,   what goes into our thinking,” and so on  Then, “At the same time, there are some things we need   to keep confidential for the integrity of the process  Here is how we constrain that”  But put that   as part of a broader, more positive message about communication  These are my initial thoughts   on this, and, at this time, it is all I have to offer   January 25–26, 2011 216 of 282                A trade organization     How is that different from a Chamber of Commerce?     The context is that our supervisory staff frequently meets with boards of   directors of banks we supervise     Occasionally, these are large, prominent firms  The Reserve Bank   President is invited along  There are times when I accompany my staff for a particularly   important meeting     Right, but it can happen that one is quizzed about macroeconomic   information  It hasn’t happened to me though     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Brian, the markets group did a nice piece on   the effect of the increase in the FDIC premium on funding conditions  My understanding is that   that’s likely to discourage several large institutions in the United States in how they conduct   arbitrage of borrowing in the RP market, and that they are planning to reduce their reserve   holdings with us  Also, I understand that a large part of the increase in reserve holdings in the   past several weeks has been among US affiliates of foreign institutions, and that they seem to   be funding that increase with borrowings from their parent  I was wondering if you had any   insights into this trend, which seems likely to continue, and whether you think that it is going to   have any impact on how the effect of the FDIC premium plays out in US funding markets and,   in particular, the shift to funding these reserve holdings of foreign institutions through parents    There’s this rabbit hole, and you wonder from where the parents are funding the increased dollar   March 15, 2011 13 of 165              holdings  And is that affecting the US money market?  Does that end up being funded by   money market mutual funds that are holding an increasing share of foreign bank paper?     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I would like to ask more on the staff’s   thoughts on this dilemma about oil price futures projecting a return to low rates of change, and   yet they keep getting it wrong  Just as a context for this, a stylized characterization of the four   years from the end of 2003 to the end of 2007 is that core ran 2¼  We kept seeing energy price   increases  We kept thinking they were about to flatten out, but they didn’t, and we ended up   with overall inflation of 3 percent averaged over four years  You might judge that something of   a failure, at least a disappointment  So what kind of scope do you see for the line of reasoning   that would say, “The futures markets may say this, but let’s act as if they are going to get it   wrong and reduce the target core we want to try and run on a sustained basis, just to leave room   for an upward trend in the relative price of energy”  We get these financial stability reports, by   the way, that routinely question the market’s assessment of a whole range of asset classes  Why   don’t we do that with the oil futures prices as well?     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Our Fifth District contacts have struck a   tone of greater optimism in the comments we’ve heard over the past several weeks  Consumers   seem to be more confident  For example, sales of ski passes have doubled at a Virginia ski   resort, and advanced bookings at coastal resorts are coming in strong  Several auto dealers have   experienced an uptick in business as well  One dealer reported allowing more customers to walk   away over price negotiations, confident that other customers will be willing to pay the price they   want  In fact, most business sectors are improving, and they convey a real sense of firming   demand for their products that goes beyond mere inventory restocking  We have also heard of   expanding capital budgets to undertake investments that were postponed during the recession and   early stages of the recovery  Even in the commercial real estate sector, some companies are   revisiting expansion plans that had been set aside, and although decisions may still be several   months off, they’re making preparations for work to begin later this year or early next year    Finally, we hear that many businesses have started hiring workers or expect to hire relatively   soon to meet their increased orders   News from our contacts was even more heavily dominated this time by reports of rising   commodity prices stemming from increased global demand, and while some are absorbing   increased costs through reduced margins, many are passing through these higher prices or have   plans to do so in the near future  The ability to pass these costs along seems related to a lack of   competition in some instances or, in other cases, the sense that the entire industry is making   similar moves despite fear that demand may be affected  As an example, our sources in the   textile industry report that they have had to raise prices even though customers resist, and they   cite industry expectations of substantial demand destruction  Two aluminum extruders reported   passing along their higher raw material costs, and while one of them cited some competitive   March 15, 2011 53 of 165              pressures that might limit further increases, the other stated that the loss of competitors in the   industry during the recession had diminished overall capacity by 20 to 25 percent, which made   them more optimistic about being able to pass along cost increases   Domestic oil price developments since our last meeting and the uncertainties emanating   from both the Mideast and Japan seem to have tempered the near-term growth outlook a bit, but I   agree with the Tealbook in seeing little effect beyond the near term  A wide array of signs   continue to indicate a broad acceleration in economic growth under way  Household spending   continues to show, I think, decent momentum despite horrendous weather and a sharp climb in   energy prices  Business investment in equipment and software continues to show strength  Both   of the ISM indexes are at lofty levels; payroll employment is picking up pace as well   As for inflation, the core numbers remain quite modest  Year-over-year core PCE is up   just 08 percent  If you’ll forgive me, I’ll commit the sin here of mentioning the three-month   inflation rate  Three-month core inflation has been rising and is now 1 percent  I think we   should be mindful of the risk that core inflation increases quite rapidly in the near term    Anecdotal reports about the desire to pass on input price increases to customers are ubiquitous; a   lot of us have talked about this around the table today  Of course, just wanting to pass on price   increases doesn’t mean firms will actually try to do so, or, even if they do, that they’ll be   successful in making the prices stick  I think that’s reflected in a lot of the uncertainty many of   you have conveyed about your firms’ prospects, whether they think they actually can pass on   those price increases  But if consumers and firms expect widespread price increases, we may see   it happen  If they expect widespread pass-through, it may actually come to fruition  Indeed,   we’ve seen one-year-ahead inflation expectations in the Michigan survey rise quite sharply since   last year, up from 27 percent in October to 46 percent for this month  And in the last two   March 15, 2011 54 of 165              months, short-term TIPS breakeven spreads have risen beyond what I think would be implied by   energy prices alone   I think that current expectations about commodity price pass-through could be shaped in   part by the experience of 2003 and 2004, when the 12-month core inflation number rose from   14 percent near the end of 2003 to 2¼ percent in the space of just nine months, a relatively sharp   acceleration  Then, as now, the economic recovery had been disappointingly slow for some   time, but it was gaining firmer footing toward the end of 2003  Then, as now, disinflation had   been the FOMC’s major policy preoccupation just a few months earlier  Then, as now, energy   prices had been rising fairly rapidly, driven by a surging growth in emerging markets  And then,   as now, the Greenbook, as it was then called, was projecting that the energy price surge would be   temporary after which inflation would fall back down to around 1 percent mainly because of the   large output gap they saw as weighing down on inflation  The Greenbook estimate of the output   gap in late 2003 was minus 2 percent, and a negative gap was expected to persist over the eight-  quarter forecast horizon  Instead, we saw core inflation ratchet up pretty rapidly and remain   about 2¼ percent for the rest of the expansion, and what is worse, as I mentioned earlier, overall   inflation averaged 3 percent for the following four years, from the end of 2003 to the end of   2007   From a business’s point of view today, you can see why this might be an opportune time   in the business cycle to push through price increases  They’ve been hunkered down for several   years now  Demand has been relatively low  Their margins have been compressed  They’ve   been squeezing out costs  A lot of spare capacity has been eliminated from their industry  When   overall industry demand picks up, it’s plausible that the elasticity of demand for their output will   fall, and they can expand margins again  So in that context, I think it’s worth considering what   March 15, 2011 55 of 165              the typical business is hearing about the overall inflation outlook that might influence their   expectations about how widespread such pass-through is going to be, including what they’re   hearing about inflation from us  But I’m going to save that discussion for the policy round    Thank you very much, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  As I said earlier, I see parallels between our   situation today and the unexpectedly rapid increase in core inflation in 2003 and 2004  In late   2003, the recovery was disappointingly slow  We were expecting persistent slack to hold down   inflation, perhaps to lead to outright deflation  Energy prices were surging  Flat futures curves   led us to believe energy prices would level out  Our estimates of economic slack led us to   believe that core would remain low  Instead, as economic growth picked up, core inflation rose   March 15, 2011 93 of 165              rapidly, from under 15 percent to 2¼ percent  That pickup in inflation turned out to be   persistent  Core inflation remained around 2¼ percent and bounced right around there for the   next four years, and that set the stage for our inflation outcome over that four years, which turned   out to be not that great—3 percent overall headline inflation   As I said earlier, in assessing this risk, I think it’s useful to consider the perspective of a   typical business person trying to figure out their pricing strategy  On the one hand, core inflation   has been running relatively low in the last couple of years  And if they’ve been paying attention,   they’ve probably heard of Fed officials emphasizing their commitment to price stability  On the   other hand, their firms’ experience coming out of the last recession, although many years ago,   may be present in their mind and may suggest that now’s the right time to expect an increase in   inflation  They are no doubt aware that the Fed has been purchasing securities and flooding the   banking system with liquidity  They may have come across some fringe commentators or   bloggers or maybe even some political figures ranting about hyperinflation right around the   corner  In the reporting on QE2, they may have picked up that the Fed wants the inflation rate to   be higher than it is now, and they may have not been exposed to the excellent statements you’ve   made, Mr Chairman, making very clear that we do not intend to overshoot an inflation rate of   2 percent  So there may be a substantial number of business people who have absorbed ideas   suggesting there’s a substantial risk of higher inflation ahead  Some of the ideas they’ve   absorbed may be not well founded, but they might affect inflation nonetheless  I recognize that   the risk that core inflation ratchets up is always with us, but what I’ve tried to do is make the   case that at this time in the business cycle, that risk is more present for us, more pressing, and   ought to be considered substantially more urgent now than is typically the case  I think this risk   poses very difficult challenges for us  We should, of course, do anything we can through   March 15, 2011 94 of 165              statements and communications to enhance our credibility and get the message out about our   expectations regarding inflation  But actions often speak louder than words  And I think we   need to be prepared to take actions to keep core inflation under control in this episode   For today, I feel an irresistible attraction to alternative C, but I can support the status quo   with the economic updating in alternative B at this meeting  At our next meeting, if core   inflation were to continue to rise, if we were to see another very strong employment report or   other signs of stronger-than-expected growth, I would strongly support reconsidering ending the   asset purchase program earlier  Beyond that point, my best sense is that we’re going to need to   take action sometime this year, either initiating asset sales or raising the funds rate by the end of   the year   As for tapering, it strikes me as excessive fussiness about the timing of purchases, and the   challenges to communication suggest we just follow through, if that’s what we’re going to do, on   a pre-decided schedule  Thank you, Mr Chairman     The three-month rate rose to 1 percent     Took some imagination  [Laughter]     We use the same language again in paragraph 2  “measures of   underlying inflation”  You know, making that variation—     Can I respectfully suggest we change the word “transient” to   “transitory”?  It has a less ephemeral connotation, and it is I think a more broadly used term      I wonder, given President Kocherlakota’s comment, whether there   would be some hesitance to take actions in between press conference meetings, and I am not   quite sure what the answer to that is, but I think it is worth considering   The other thing is, why 215 pm?  Why not on the hour?  I have always wondered this   about the statement  Is there something magic in markets about quarter after?     Alignment to the stars  [Laughter]   March 15, 2011 137 of 165                Oh, three o’clock, right, when the bond markets close       Okay, great     Yes  I think it’s easy to overestimate the problems caused for us by   diverse views being expressed in public  I have a clear sense that over the last 10 years, the   sensitivity of financial market prices to any one individual Committee member’s statements,   other than the Chairman of the Committee, has steadily declined, and I think that’s because we   all speak more often about our views  The answer to sensitivity to individual bits of information   is sometimes more information  That is to say, the more we’re all speaking, the less markets are   moved by any one communication of ours   I’d strongly support this press conference, and I think there are going to be some   subtleties about it that are going to emerge in practice  I think we’re going to have to resist the   urge to wait to do things at just these quarterly meetings  I think when we want to do something,   we’re going to have to have the courage to go ahead and do it  I think noon the next day is the   right balance  I think it’s right to give clear airwaves to the Chairman, but I also think it   wouldn’t be right to impose too much of a burden on him to communicate for several days on   behalf of other people’s views  I think his articulating faithfully the range of views is fine, but   this outlet of people being able to contact other Committee members relieves some of the   pressure on him to be very faithful about everyone’s views all the way around the table  So I   support this   March 15, 2011 142 of 165                I don’t share the perception that the institution has been damaged, but   this has been illuminating for me  I think one could anticipate the press calling all of us for   March 15, 2011 143 of 165              interviews for Thursday at 1201  I think it’s conceivable that some people will accept, and then   something like that might emerge, and I think that’s something that maybe we should talk about   and deliberate about  I mean, I think the equilibrium we have now is that we don’t race to the   end  We wait for our regularly scheduled appointments with the public in order to say what we   have to say, and that has some attraction, I think     Those are different?  [Laughter]     You mean, you might get laughed at     At noon     Yes, a couple of questions for Brian  If the debt ceiling is resolved on   time, have you been in conversations with the Treasury about the pace at which the   Supplementary Financing Program will be reinstated?     Okay  My second question has to do with MBS sales  In discussing the   Treasury sales, you noted the large difference between the magnitude of our holdings and the   magnitude of their sales and holdings  And you said that Fed sales, because they would involve   April 26–27, 2011 10 of 244              such a large amount, could have implications for market pricing and market functioning  In   preparing for this meeting, I looked at the November transcript where I asked you about the pace   of our purchases, and what sort of factors you thought would motivate limiting the pace of our   purchases  You said essentially two things  One was operational capabilities, and the other was   the potential for affecting market functioning  You were careful to distinguish between the   pricing effect, which, as you noted, was presumably the desired effect of the policy, and what   you called market liquidity  And what you described was that we didn’t want to create too much   of a one-sided market by buying too much, resulting in lower trading volumes between other   parties and higher bid-asked spreads and all   So going in the other direction and selling things, do you think about the effect on market   functioning the same way?  I mean, it’s unlikely to result in a one-sided market, right?  We are   putting more things out there, and a lower trading volume seems unlikely because there is going   to be more float out there  How do you think about the potential market-functioning effects,   apart from the pricing effects?  The broad motivation for this question, obviously, is, how fast   could we conceivably think about selling our assets?     Can I follow up, Mr Chairman?  I want to learn more about this concern   about market functioning  The way I thought about your comments in November was that—for   the standard market microstructure model—marketmakers commit some capital based on   expected returns and expected deal flow  If we are buying a lot, I can see why the market would   shrink and the number of marketmakers ought to shrink  But my intuition about flipping that   around and applying it to a situation where we are selling would be that the number of   marketmakers would increase and spreads would fall  Do you have some other model in mind,   or am I missing something in applying the standard model to this?     Okay  You took pains to reduce the uncertainty about the pace of our   purchases, and I’m assuming you did the same thing for the sales, too  So the uncertainty around   our sales can’t be large, can it?     That seems like a price effect—that they’re uncertain where the price is   going to be, as we are—and that seems like a policy consideration as opposed to market   functioning   April 26–27, 2011 13 of 244                Thank you, Mr Chairman     Can you repeat?  You used a tradeoff number—I just want to make sure   I have it right—that a certain number of billion dollars is equivalent to a certain number of basis   points  Was that of the fed funds rate’s worth of easing?     Does it mean if we sold $16 trillion it would be like having a 4 percent   fed funds rate, leaving the IOR rate at 25 basis points?     Attributable to?     Right  I’m just doing the math  If we got down to $1 trillion on the   balance sheet, if we sold all our assets, that would be the equivalent of 4 percentage points?     But the market wouldn’t work the same, right?       Thank you, Mr Chairman  My preferred strategy for removing policy   accommodation, like several others of you, would involve using the funds rate target supported   by movements in the interest rate on reserves as the primary instrument of monetary policy  I   think asset sales should begin quickly, and I’d advocate that they should proceed at a pace that’s   significantly more rapid than any of the options shown in the staff’s memo  I think that at   approximately the rate at which we purchased assets is a good benchmark  The pace of sales   should be more or less predetermined, and while we should reserve the right to alter the pace in   light of incoming information, I think as President Williams said, the bar for such alterations   should be set on the high side  I’ll explain my preferences before I touch on the four “Exodus”   questions   Our asset purchase program was designed to address problems in credit markets and to   ease monetary policy, with short-term interest rates at their lower bound  Credit markets seem to   be functioning reasonably well right now, and the zero bound doesn’t interfere with using   interest rates to remove policy accommodation   The arguments for using asset holdings as a policy tool, thus, aren’t symmetric, and they   have less force when interest rates are rising  So for me, our large-scale asset sales program—  and I’m assuming we’re going to refer to this as the LSAS?     For me, the LSAS should be designed primarily to return our portfolio to   normal as rapidly as possible and to help facilitate, as best we can engineer it, the use of the   April 26–27, 2011 54 of 244              federal funds rate target as a policy instrument, and not to use our sales program to make short-  term, contingent adjustments to monetary conditions   Now, it is true that heroic work has been done by the New York Fed staff and others as   well to try to estimate the term structure effects of LSAPs, but I think we should be careful not to   place too much weight on those estimates  They’re not very precise, and the identification   assumptions are open to serious questions  As a result, I don’t think they provide a really strong,   reliable basis for using the LSAS as a substitute for interest rate policy or constructing a policy   menu in which asset sales trade off against interest rate increases   As I said, I think asset sales should occur at a relatively rapid pace—specifically, about   the same pace at which we purchased assets, around $100 billion a month  I see several reasons   for doing so  First, I haven’t heard any objections or any convincing stories or theories or   evidence about how a well-communicated program of sales would impede market efficiency  I   am sure that the more rapidly we sell things, the more rapidly prices might fall or adjust, but I   think we’ve all come around to the stock view rather than the flow view  Price effects, I think,   are separate from the efficiency effects that I was discussing with the System Open Market   Account Manager earlier   Second, I see high levels of reserve balances as exacerbating the uncertainty about the   effects of our policy rate on the economy, and this is evident in the Desk survey  It showed   significantly more variation in what the average view of the spread would be with high balances   than with low balances, and I would assume that the uncertainty around those estimates is larger   for high balances than for low balances as well  I think high reserve balances are likely to push   down other interest rates relative to the interest rate on reserves, and as the Manager said, the   zero bound undoubtedly limits that effect; I don’t think we have a good sense of just how strong   April 26–27, 2011 55 of 244              that limiting effect is  So it seems likely that the magnitude of the effect of high reserve balances   on other rates relative to the IOER is going to be different; it’s going to change as we increase   the interest rate on reserves  Related to policy uncertainty is that I think the high level of   reserves amplifies the ever-present risk associated with ex post policy mistakes  With   $1½ trillion of excess reserves, banks essentially have many months of rapid loan growth that’s   prefunded, and they could draw on that if they view lending opportunities as evolving more   favorably  Now, this would quickly become apparent, of course, but I don’t think we can rule   out the idea that inflation expectations would become unhinged simultaneously with an   explosion in lending   Another reason I prefer a rapid pace of asset sales is to get us out of the credit allocation   business  This obviously has the most force with the MBS  Our MBS purchases were unique;   they were exceptional and motivated by an assessment that the functioning of those markets was   in some sense impaired  Whatever one’s view about that assessment of market functioning,   those unique and exceptional circumstances clearly have passed, and I think we should   acknowledge as much by selling those assets quickly  One way to drain reserves without having   to rapidly reduce our asset holdings is for us to issue our own short-term debt, and I want to   acknowledge the hard work the staff has done to design, build, and test systems for conducting   reverse repos and selling term deposits  But I think these are very unattractive tools, and I   strongly oppose using them  Issuing new short-term debt in order to reduce reserve balances and   in order to avoid having to sell longer-term debt to effect a similar reduction in reserve balances   constitutes a really excessive fine tuning of our intervention across the term structure  It sets the   precedent of essentially running a hedge fund, issuing—that is to say, shorting—some securities   in order to go long on some other securities  This is more credit allocation to the extent that we   April 26–27, 2011 56 of 244              use this to avoid having to sell MBS  And if it’s Treasuries we’re avoiding selling, this amounts   to offsetting the term structure of the debt issued by the Treasury  Either role strikes me as   fundamentally inappropriate for an independent central bank  We should issue monetary   liabilities funded by a broad, evenly weighted portfolio of Treasuries and leave it at that  I   understand that it’s possible market rates will not track the IOER closely if we raise interest rates   before asset sales have made much of a dent in the balance sheet, but if this occurs, let’s   accelerate asset sales rather than issue our own debt   Let me briefly address the four questions  Should our first step be to stop reinvesting   MBS proceeds?  I say yes   Should we stop reinvesting Treasury proceeds?  Here we’re asked to think about   reinvesting Treasury proceeds or not, and I prefer to think of this in terms of the size and   composition of our balance sheet  Given a path for the size of our balance sheet, how do we   want to achieve that?  My preference is for a corner solution in which, for any given reduction in   asset holdings, we achieve it through MBS sales, and under that principle, the next step after   halting MBS reinvestments would be to sell MBS rather than stop reinvesting the Treasury   proceeds   Should asset sales be predetermined or preannounced or highly contingent?  As I’ve said,   and with due respect to others like President Plosser who have argued for a more contingent   approach, I would prefer a relatively predetermined pace  Of course, nothing we do is   predetermined, but I’d envision the funds rate being our main tool and there being a fairly high   bar for deviating from a preannounced pace of sales   Should we start selling before or after we raise the funds rate?  I’d prefer to move fairly   quickly in winding down our balance sheet  I think we ought to move quickly toward selling   April 26–27, 2011 57 of 244              assets along the LIFO lines that President Bullard and others have suggested and sell them at a   fairly rapid pace, barring some unforeseen dramatic worsening in the outlook   So, question 4, do you agree with each of the following statements?  Yes     Would it help to say “after in the sequence?”     I find myself very sympathetic to Governor Tarullo’s points  On this   last issue, which seems to be the one where it comes to a head, do you worry that just mentioning   the views of a majority might lead a stampede of opinion to focus on that and treat it as if it’s a   decision?  And the constructive alternative would be to mention that there are a range of views    The majority seems to favor, but there are those who have other views and we haven’t decided   April 26–27, 2011 90 of 244                Oh, okay  Mention the other views as well     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Reports from our contacts indicate that the   Fifth District economy continues to grow  Our April survey released this morning indicates that   manufacturing is expanding, though not quite as broadly as before  Our respondents remain   quite optimistic about future conditions, though, and many have plans to hire in the first half of   the year  Several firms told us of difficulty finding adequate workers, because they preferred to   collect unemployment benefits or can’t pass drug tests  Service-sector activity is expanding   April 26–27, 2011 131 of 244              more broadly now, and our retail index swung strongly into positive territory this month with big   gains posted for sales revenue and shopper travel  Expectations for demand over the coming six   months improved noticeably as well   Commercial real estate markets continued to show signs of improvement in some areas of   our District  While vacancy rates are mixed across the District, strong markets such as   Washington have been able to attract financing and investment  Several contacts have noted the   availability of construction financing for federal buildings, educational institutions, and medical   facilities  They called this the “feds, eds, and meds sectors”  And the data center market is said   to be exploding   Commentary on inflation pressures was once again widespread, as many of you have   remarked as well  Price growth picked up in both our manufacturing and services surveys this   time, and is at or approaching the all-time highs for those series that they reached in 2008    Manufacturers report passing on cost increases to industrial users but indicate difficulty passing   them on to retailers   It’s worth noting that the current wage index has picked up in both manufacturing and   nonretail service sectors, and the manufacturing wage index number is the second highest on   record  At the national level, in response to softer data, the Tealbook has lowered its near-term   forecast for GDP, and I think that makes sense  It seems reasonable to pull down projections for   consumer spending in light of the energy price increases and other gloomy news, although I   haven’t pulled down my forecast quite as much as the Tealbook’s  In addition, the Tealbook has   written down a lower trajectory for residential investment this time, which I also wholeheartedly   endorse  The first-quarter numbers for housing managed to underperform my already minimal   expectations, and I continue to expect housing activity to remain at exceptionally low levels for   April 26–27, 2011 132 of 244              an extended period  In fact, my housing forecast looks more like the Tealbook’s fed funds   forecast—[laughter]—for that matter, my fed funds forecast looks more like their housing   forecast   On the other hand, the outlook for exports and business investment in equipment and   software looks pretty good at this point  I’d part company with the staff with respect to second-  half core inflation; they have it, I think, settling down, and I have trouble dismissing the many   anecdotes we’ve heard from firms that are having their margins squeezed and are expecting to   raise prices later this year  We’ve gotten those reports for several months now, and they come   from various-sized firms and various industries and various locations around the District, and   they are reminiscent of what we were hearing in 2004 when core and overall prices did   accelerate appreciably  My best guess is that we’ll see a relatively permanent step-up in core   inflation to near 2 percent  I don’t view this as inconsistent with our reads on the expectations of   the public regarding inflation beyond the near term, and those appear to be reasonably well   anchored at this point  And I think that is going to temper the extent to which a significant part   of firms’ cost increases are incorporated into final prices, and that should keep core from rising   much above 2   But I don’t think we can take those favorable expectations for granted  I think we need to   be sure to validate those expectations  They rest on some presumptions about our actions and   statements, our reaction function  So we are going to have to make sure our actions and   statements in the coming year do validate those expectations  In my view, this is going to   require that we return policy to a neutral stance more promptly than the Tealbook assumes   Two final comments  One, President Kocherlakota very aptly noted that the policy rules   to which we make frequent reference leave out changes in inflation expectations, because when   April 26–27, 2011 133 of 244              we apply them in the models we leave out any doubt in model agents’ minds about the likelihood   that we are going to stick to that policy rule  There is empirical work done by a former colleague   of mine, Marvin Goodfriend, an essay from about a decade and a half ago called “Monetary   Policy Comes of Age” in which, for the period after Volcker and Greenspan, he documented   instances in which longer-term bond rates rose by a substantial amount in a very short amount of   time, more than could be attributed to a change in expected real rates, and from which the   Committee inferred were changes in inflation expectations  And the Fed reacted strongly to   counteract that and to tighten policy by more than we otherwise would have  I think that’s the   place to look for guidance as to what magnitude of response one ought to presume in a reaction   function like that   Finally, in response to President Evans’s remarks, I would like to disavow any unhealthy   preoccupation with endogeneity or exogeneity [laughter] and ask you to consider an experiment    Start a DSGE model projection with initial conditions in which slack variables are less than they   really are—say, in your last period, say the fourth quarter—because of a configuration of shocks   that lead them to be less than they otherwise would be, and in which marginal costs are   commensurately lower  My conjecture is that you would get a higher inflation forecast, and I   think that experiment could motivate commentary to the effect that slack will keep inflation low    As you can see, there is nothing essential about endogeneity or exogeneity there  I don’t think   that thought experiment is inconsistent with anything you said, so the attribution to exogenous   shocks versus slack—I just don’t see the distinction there   Now, I haven’t seen your group’s research, and it’s been a little while since I reread   Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans, at least a few weeks—[laughter]  But more to the point, my   guess is that agents in that model and in your paper—back to my other comment—have   April 26–27, 2011 134 of 244              100 percent confidence in a reaction function  I don’t believe real-world agents are quite that   confident  For evidence, you could look at the five-year, five-year forward last year when in the   summer we had this fall in inflation expectations, and it seemed inconsistent with us being   believed with 100 percent probability to be following a constant rule   I will say, though, to President Evans’s credit, he has given me a brilliant idea  I think I   am going to ask my staff to do research extending my JPE article     What you say is exactly true  The inflation dynamics run off marginal   cost  There is this link that one can draw in many models, a one-to-one relationship between the   level of marginal cost and the level of the variable that seems to accord with the notions of slack     Okay, great     So we should act naturally     Which part?  Paragraph 2?     Wouldn’t “inflation” without a modifier be presumed to refer to   headline, and a modifier be presumed to be required to refer to something else, like core or   underlying or forecast?     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I believe there are reasonably strong   arguments for choosing alternative C from a certain point of view and not providing further   stimulus at this time  The recovery seems well established, and price stability often requires   preemption, especially at this time of the business cycle  Despite those arguments, though, I can   support alternative B  We’ve encountered enough speed bumps in this recovery to make cutting   back on stimulus perhaps less urgent right now  In addition, in our discussion of exit strategies, I   didn’t hear any convincing reasons to doubt that we could withdraw stimulus at a fairly rapid clip   if need be, and I take it as a corollary of doing whatever it takes to provide sufficient stimulus   that we stand ready to withdraw stimulus at whatever pace is required to keep inflation well   contained as the expansion unfolds   Regarding language, I did, indeed, make three suggestions regarding paragraph 2(b), two   of which were adopted in this draft  The motivation was to provide, similar to President   April 26–27, 2011 177 of 244              Kocherlakota’s suggestion last time, more connection to real life in our description of inflation    It just seemed to me “currently putting upward pressure on inflation” was more consistent with   an overall inflation rate that hadn’t risen yet and was threatening to, and yet we’d had so many   months of inflation well above what we want that it was worth acknowledging to the public that   we understand that inflation is, indeed, too high right now, and why   And about relative price changes, President Evans, I understand that when oil prices go   up much more rapidly than other prices, it’s a relative price change, but if it brings the average   up, then it’s inflation as well, and you can’t deny that  I mean, if there aren’t offsetting declines   in other prices that keep the average constant, one is equally entitled to call it an increase in   overall inflation as well   I also was concerned about this language about underlying inflation  I think it’s widely   interpreted as a code word for core inflation, and I had two concerns about sentence 2  One of   the main ones is that rather than relying on the notion of overall inflation converging to what we   think of as underlying inflation over time, why not communicate that we think the rise in   inflation is transitory; why not come out and say, “We expect inflation to decline soon”?  It   struck me as more clear to say it that way  The other thing is that sentence 2 is one of the five   places we refer to the mandate in this statement, and we say underlying inflation is low relative   to what the Committee judges—I’m not sure we’ve ever spelled out underlying inflation and   made clear that it’s our forecast and not core  My concern with sentence 2 is that it’s open to   misinterpretation that our interpretation of the mandate has to do with core rather than overall   inflation  Evidently there were countervailing concerns about sentence 2  I’m anxious to hear   what they were     Mr Chairman      On the seesaw pattern of referring to low inflation and high inflation—  my suggestion would have eliminated references to inflation in sentence 2, which would   eliminate the up-down     Which medium run, past or the future—going which way?     Yes  I heard you (President Evans) say something about inflation that   made me wonder if we understand inflation in the same way  You said it’s not inflation if it’s   not a broad and uniform increase in prices     Well, so, relative prices change at the same time inflation goes up  Does   the change in relative prices negate there being inflation?  If half the prices go up at 40 percent   and the other half don’t change, do we not have 20 percent inflation?     If I could just add to that  Betsy is right and you’re right, I think, that   we need to take a systematic look at the language that we use to communicate about inflation  I   don’t think we’re far apart at all on the facts  I think we all understand it  It’s choosing the   language to communicate what there is a consensus about   April 26–27, 2011 213 of 244              I think, broad brush  The recovery is continuing, we know inflation is high, and it’s   going to come down  Those are the three things we want to communicate with the statement,   and to go back to the context of price stability is to rely on people comparing context of price   stability and high current inflation and realizing, oh, they’re saying it’s going to come down  I   mean, to me, it’s an oblique and, to my mind, unnecessarily indirect way of stating, “We expect   inflation to come down”  So I just wanted to get that point in     Yes, I’m not against putting in “headline”  I mean, I think over time   we’re going to want to drop that  We could use “overall” just as well     What’s “underlying inflation,” in this context?     Forecast is going to return to—?     It doesn’t say what our forecast is going to do, what we expect our   forecast to do, which is different than what we forecast inflation to do     Yes     Thank you  I, too, want to commend the staff  This is an excellent use   of your time and energy, and I found it very useful  These might not be at the ideal state we’d   want them to be at and are certainly not ready to fully supplant FRB/US in our arsenal, and I’m   not sure we’d ever want to  But to me they look like they provide a really excellent complement   to what we have, and I would encourage you to keep working at this and give us some practice   with it   June 21–22, 2011 23 of 282              I think you’re right about the advantages of this  I agree with what President Bullard and   President Evans said, that the coherence of these models offers a tremendous advantage  They’re   internally consistent  There’s a clear narrative that emerges, and you can take the narrative to the   real world, and you can say, “All right  Do I see this element of the narrative in the real world?”    One way to think about these models is as an artificial world  It’s like Second Life or these   online universes, only you guys haven’t done the graphics engines yet  [Laughter]  The way to   work with them is this interplay between looking at the model, seeing what it’s telling you,   looking at reality, going back and maybe changing the model or reinterpreting the model—and I   think that practice with that is what’s going to both improve the model and give us a better sense   of how to use it   In reading the memos, I found myself in unfamiliar terrain because we’re used to talking   about macroeconomic conditions and the macroeconomic outlook using a certain kind of   language, but we’re not used to saying “marginal efficiency of investment”  I mean, you don’t   see Larry Meyer saying “marginal efficiency of investment” or “risk premium shocks” very   often  So I think, while we know how useful these models are, it’s going to take some practice in   terms of thinking in the categories that the models lead you to think within   I have a question, and this is more for Dave Reifschneider than you, but your reaction   would be useful as well  It has to do with this limitation you cited, that they’re not large scale   yet, and it made me think back to an article Chris Sims wrote many years ago about the Board’s   forecasting procedure  He said that it’s articulated at such a disaggregate level that you can   compare model behavior in individual sectors with industry analysts, and you get this interplay   between model and industry analysts  Now, you don’t have the chemical industry per se or   June 21–22, 2011 24 of 282              anything at that level of detail, although in certain cases, like housing, you do have individual   sectors  I was just wondering how much of a limitation you think that is   That said, I commend you guys for doing this  I think it would be useful for us to see this   on a regular basis, like two or four times a year, and to get this kind of a package  Maybe we   wouldn’t need to spend as much time on it because you’ve introduced us to the structure, but we   could take a little time to work it into our practice  I think that would be really valuable  I’d just   emphasize one thing, and this harkens back to discussions we had about two years ago  There   really isn’t an alternative to models  This goes with what President Bullard said  The advantage   of these things is that you put the cards on the table  If you have a narrative, if you are telling a   story, if you think you know or have a sense of what’s likely to happen, you’ve got a model in   your head  These at least have the benefit of putting everything about it on the table and   checking that it’s an internally consistent model  With that, I’d be interested in a response to the   question about scale     I view the Vice Chairman’s proposed language change about “the   smallest balance sheet consistent with” as attractive because it is attempting to commit to   avoiding the kind of credit allocation that would come from expanding our balance sheet at a   given funds rate, which is one of the major concerns  In your straw poll, I was wondering if you   could find a way to have that be an option     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I prefer last in, first out, and never using   reserve draining tools  Otherwise, I can support this [laughter], and I’m not troubled by the   timing references  I think we’re trying to say what we agree on, and I think the timing references   that are in there are things you can agree on  The ones we couldn’t vote to put in were ones we   didn’t agree on  So I can support the adoption of these principles even though I’d prefer   something much different     For what it’s worth, without the timing references, specifically “four to   five years“ regarding normalization of our balance sheet, I find myself in President Bullard’s   camp of being unable to really support this   We’ve talked for a while about wanting to   normalize our balance sheet, and we’ve talked for a long time about wanting to do that relatively   expeditiously, and to me, if all that’s left is the sequence, and I don’t support the sequence, I   couldn’t support this   June 21–22, 2011 55 of 282                Yes  It’s a key element     Yes, some definite number     Help me understand this strategy  Do you place greater value on the   upside option, given the occularity about the AIG offer, than the market, or do you think that   these are underpriced?  The market prices are going to take into account the carry, right?  So this   June 21–22, 2011 63 of 282              change in strategy should be present-discounted-value neutral  So I’m wondering whether you   have a different idea than the market about the value or you see a higher value than the market   on the upside option, given the appearance and the optics relative to the AIG offer     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Just to follow up on this, are you   approaching that task with a principle in mind that you don’t want our actions at the Desk to   blunt the market effects of a nonpayment event?  To some extent, anything we do there is   essentially ameliorating the consequence of a fiscal action and implicates us in fiscal action  I   wonder how you’re thinking about that  I understand that, at the same time there’s a concern   about market functioning as well   June 21–22, 2011 68 of 282                Do you view a CUSIP swap as beyond the pale?     Okay  But there would be a securities lending operation, right?     Obviously, you understand the importance of the appearance of   maintaining distance from funding a fiscal crisis with our balance sheet  But back to President   Lockhart’s question, it strikes me that August 1 is probably not the time for us to figure it out    Because market participants have a long history of watching our actions in securities lending and   June 21–22, 2011 70 of 282              market operations, communicating to them before then our stance regarding this might be useful   in order to avoid putting us in a box where we’re forced to act in a way we don’t want to in order   to forestall a discontinuity  I’d urge you to put effort into this as up front as possible and, if   consultations with the Committee are needed that those be done earlier rather than later     Does the federal government have enough payment-delay options   outside of the Treasury redemptions, these weekly notes, to be able to get through to the 15th?     Yes  I just want to make an observation on the discussion following   President Bullard’s question, relating that discussion to our DSGE presentation  You cite low   expected income growth as a cause for sluggish consumption growth  In all those models,   though, it’s all together  You don’t have business and consumer confidence floating around as   an exogenous variable  The economy is on some path, and consumers and businesses are   expecting some path, and their income expectations are geared off of that  So from that point of   view, looking at the household sector might lead you to look somewhere else, right?  If their   income prospects look poor, then you might peel back the onion  Maybe it’s hiring prospects   that are poor, and for some reason they are not getting hired  I wonder about your reflections on   that sort of perspective     I was wondering whether some impediment to hiring would necessarily   show up as lower consumer spending growth     Just following up on our earlier discussion—I understand the need for   stabilizing the market, but at the same time, would it make sense to contemplate a bright-line   policy, like “We will not take a defaulted security”?     I would just point out that the ECB seems to have drawn a pretty bright   line, but this is a very different situation     This is obvious, but we are facing a couple of decades of fiscal   stringency  If they actually cross this line, our behavior is going to set a profound precedent   here  So the usual time consistency considerations tip the scale a little bit toward a solid   contingency plan     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Since the last meeting, we’ve continued to   see a flow of soft economic reports  Retail sales, payroll employment, personal income, and   national and regional manufacturing indexes have all been disappointing  It looks to us like a   temporary soft patch in an otherwise recovering economy, and information from our District   contacts supports that idea  Survey respondents have been mentioning the Japanese earthquake   and tsunami, and most expect the effects to dissipate  This month we’ve heard reports of   increased sales from manufacturers that are active in global markets as well as those supplying   stronger sectors of the domestic economy, such as energy, transportation, and medical research    June 21–22, 2011 123 of 282              And the composite index for Fifth District manufacturing, which fell sharply by 16 points in May   to a reading of minus 6, actually ticked up 11 points at least so far in our preliminary numbers,   which are almost all complete, for our June report that’s due to be released next week some time    Reports from our region are consistent with this recent sluggishness being more of a temporarily   lull than a protracted slowdown   There are a number of one-time factors you can point to that can plausibly explain the   soft patch being temporary  In addition to supply disruptions related to the Japanese disaster,   there’s the run-up and recent easing in gasoline prices and the spate of adverse weather  Others   have mentioned these around the table  Soft patches are not unusual in growing economies, and   some potential sources of strength remain  The fundamentals for export demand continue to   look reasonably promising, and business investment demand continues to advance despite   relatively modest overall sales growth  This is the second major soft patch in this recovery, and   that makes it even more disappointing  When the recovery began in mid-2009, some economists   hoped it would be relatively rapid, comparable in pace with the recoveries following other deep   recessions, like the two that Larry Slifman showed us earlier  We did see a decent pickup in   GDP growth in early 2010, and that prompted discussions of our exit strategy  In the fall,   though, disinflation and a weakening growth outlook prompted our QE2 asset purchase program    But as the year ended, consumer spending firmed and the pace of employment gains increased,   and that provided some grounds for optimism that economic growth was finally picking up, but   now once again we’re seeing slower growth than we had hoped   It’s easy to see why you would have expected a more robust recovery two years ago    Real GDP in the US has shown a remarkable tendency, going back over 140 years, to return to   a simple trend line corresponding to 3 percent annual growth  The exceptions, of course, are the   June 21–22, 2011 124 of 282              Depression and the period in World War II where it went above that line  But other than that, it   generally goes back to that line and sticks remarkably close to it  That suggests that sharp   declines are going to be followed by growth more rapid than trend—that is, significantly above   3 percent growth  But as the staff presentation makes clear, that’s not what we’ve seen; that’s   not what we’ve gotten so far  Real GDP growth has averaged just 2¾ percent over the last two   years, and the level of employment is almost 5 percent below its cyclical peak  In contrast, two   years after the big recessions of ’73–’74 and ’81–’82, which Larry Slifman showed earlier, real   GDP growth had averaged more than 5 percent per year, and employment was about 4 percent   higher than the previous cyclical peak  We seem to have had the worst of both worlds—a sharp,   deep recession, as in the pre–Great Moderation era, together with a sluggish recovery, more   typical of the Great Moderation era   Obviously, if real GDP grows only around 3 percent, it will never catch up with that trend   line  In that case, real GDP would trace out a parallel trend line that lies significantly below the   one we’ve been on or around for 140 years  Even if growth gradually rises toward 4 percent   over the next year or two, as in the Tealbook, it will still look as if our economy has experienced   a downward shift to a new, much lower trend line  Now, admittedly, this type of large, highly   persistent step-down in real GDP happens very rarely in the historical record, but for several   decades now, many other developed economies have been tracking a trend line that’s lower than   ours—parallel but lower than ours  If you plot per capita GDP for OECD countries, the ones in   Europe and Japan, which suffered in World War II, have come back growing more rapidly than   ours but seem to have converged to a trend line that’s at a parallel level below ours  One   explanation that’s been offered for the level difference between per capita measures for Europe   June 21–22, 2011 125 of 282              and the United States is differences in tax and regulatory regimes that increase the cost of doing   business in those countries   It’s also been suggested that the United States could now be in the midst of a transition to   a more European type of policy mix  This would be consistent with the widespread anecdotal   reports we we’ve been getting for a year and a half about regulatory and tax changes that   discourage business expansion  It’s also consistent with our earlier discussion about sluggish   consumer spending growth and was the motivation for my question about whether some   impediments to hiring like regulatory and tax policy could be resulting in lower income growth   which, of course, shows up in lower consumption growth  If policy changes are having such   macroeconomic effects, we may need to accommodate ourselves, since they’re outside of our   control, to a persistently lower path for per capita output for some time to come  Now, there’s   certainly no conclusive evidence or proof that this is the case, but I think it’s hard to rule out this   disheartening possibility, given what we know  It’s worth noting that to the extent that economic   growth is being held back by the evolution of tax and regulatory policies in the United States,   there would be virtually nothing monetary policy can do to correct the problem  Moreover, if we   misdiagnose the problem as a deficiency of aggregate demand and adopted stimulative monetary   policy to try and correct it, we would just raise the inflation rate and have little lasting effect on   growth   The current economic weakness is occurring alongside of a reversal of disinflation  Last   year, year-over-year core PCE inflation declined from 1½ percent to 07 percent from April to   December but then reversed—it’s risen to 1 percent  And over the past three months, core PCE   inflation has been running at an annual rate of about 23 percent  There isn’t much to suggest, as   President Pianalto argued, that this increase was driven by transitory factors  In that case, I agree   June 21–22, 2011 126 of 282              with President Pianalto  This looks like a fairly persistent step-up  In this connection, I think the   evolution of the forecast on page 33 is pretty interesting  It shows that since last fall, the core   inflation forecast has been steadily revised upward, but the forecast for real GDP has been   revised down a little bit on net  The GDP forecast was revised down through September, and   then in November, under the assumption of the QE2, it was revised up  However, since then it   has been revised down again, and that’s consistent with the notion that perhaps QE2 had very   little lasting effect on economic growth but, if anything, just raised inflation  It also suggests that   further stimulus aimed at pumping up real growth would be futile and would risk raising   inflation too high     I thought it was neoclassical  [Laughter]     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support alternative B  I especially support   the language we’re using to talk about inflation  This plain-talk approach is more direct and   more likely to be understood by a broader range of American citizens  It should provide us with   a flexible framework for being clear about what we think has actually happened to inflation and   what we think will happen to inflation  I think this will, in turn, encourage us to be more   forthcoming about whether we’re satisfied with the inflation outlook, and if we’re not, what we   intend to do about it  All of these things should contribute to stabilizing inflation expectations  I   should note that such benefits are similar to those often ascribed to the adoption of an explicit   numerical inflation objective, but I would caution against thinking of our new language as being   a substitute for being explicit about our inflation objective  So I agree with President Pianalto  I   think we ought to strive for greater clarity about our intentions  That greater clarity would be   achieved by taking the step of agreeing on an explicit inflation target, and what we’ve moved   toward in the statement about inflation makes it even more important that we take that step  I   think we’re going to have a hard time talking within the new style of language about where   inflation ought to go without agreeing among ourselves about where it ought to go   On the language changes that have been proposed so far, some strike me as very good  I   think the changes we made last time were in the nature of avoiding the use of latent variables,   and I think of “momentum in the labor market” as one of those  So I very much support   President Plosser’s suggestion that we reword that sentence in terms of observables  It is, after   June 21–22, 2011 187 of 282              all, the paragraph that talks about the present and the past, and momentum certainly has a   connotation of persistence that you would think doesn’t belong in the paragraph about backward-  looking conditions  Similarly, I support the suggestion of President Williams  I think that “the   current degree of monetary policy accommodation” is a latent variable—you know, I’m not   against us using latent variables in our theoretical constructs in our conversation, but I think we   ought to be really careful about foisting them on the public  I don’t think there’s any loss of   clarity to adopt his suggestion and just be clear that we’re going to keep the funds rate low and   so on  I think downside risks have increased, but in my mind, that consists of a greater   probability that growth is going to be around 3 or 2½ percent for the next couple of years, and I   haven’t heard a lot of compelling argumentation around the table that the risk of a downturn has   increased a lot  Now, I recognize what these two-state models give you  The closer you slip   down, the odds of a falldown are higher  But I think of most of the increase in downside risks as   the risk that economic growth is going to be lower on a sustained basis  This is related to what   President Kocherlakota was noting about potential  One thing that we didn’t really talk about   during the DSGE presentation yesterday was that all of those models have the property that   potential is determined by stochastic trends  That’s a technical term, but it means essentially that   the trend rate of growth fluctuates over time, and so it can fall to 2 percent  It is inconsistent   with what President Plosser said about the possibility of permanent downward shifts in potential    The idea that there is gigantic slack is based on essentially the statistical equivalent of this   3 percent line through 140 years of history  The DSGE models have been formulated to fit the   data, and they’ve found that to fit the data, you need to allow the trend and the level of potential   to move around in this way  For anyone who thinks slack is really large, it’s important to be   careful about why you believe that  Think carefully about the basis for that, against the   June 21–22, 2011 188 of 282              alternatives that seem to fit the data pretty well  That concludes my comments, and as I said, I   support alternative B with those changes     Well, if you look at the deviations from that trend in the postwar era,   you see periods of 2, 3, or 4 percent that are away from trend for several years at a time  So, yes,   140 years is really impressive, but you can be below that for quite a while and still get back to it   in time to make the next 140 years at 3 percent  That’s the point     Yes     You brought up risks, and I agree with President Kocherlakota  I think   introducing downside risk is going to be taken as a bigger worry than I think we collectively   have about the possibility of a contraction in economic activity     I second the motion on the floor     Wait  That means the clock starts, and it could take five years after that?     The purpose of the clause in the first sentence of paragraph 6—about   minimizing the extent to which the SOMA portfolio might affect the allocation of credit across   sectors—is to announce our purpose for getting out of agencies, right?  It’s not about this   disruption     Now, you all know I have asked our Manager many times over many   meetings about this notion of disrupting the market  I agree with President Hoenig, it’s unlikely   that market participants are going to view us as slacking from our solicitousness about disruption   to the market  It’s kind of a squishy topic, though, and I’ve never really gotten a lot of specifics   about what those disruptions mean  And I was kind of confused by the memo we got about this,   because it sounded a lot like the flow effect, which I thought we had cast aside over the course of   June 21–22, 2011 219 of 282              the first purchase program in preparation for the second  So I’m still confused about what these   disruptions mean  We’ve done a lot of analysis  We’ve seen a lot of scenarios  And in almost   all of them, we do it in something like this time period of three to five years  The staff very   kindly threw in some more-rapid scenarios to make me feel good  I wasn’t able to persuade the   rest of you that that was the best policy, so let’s put down what we know  There are all sorts of   things where you could preserve some optionality and degrees of freedom by holding back   information  But this is about clarity  It’s about helping the markets have some degree of   predictability about what we do  And I’d say, go ahead and put the number in     Either one would be fine with me  I think President Dudley is   persuasive     Mr Chairman, did you say you were interested in feedback on these   processes?     I would remark that I received a couple of inquiries last week from   banking industry participants in our District, wondering if they should do contingency planning    I advised them that they should always be doing contingency planning  But I was hamstrung,   being unable to give them more guidance to shape their planning  And I’m sure this is   something that’s dawned on everyone involved in this process this time around, but more timely   guidance to the banking industry is one potential opportunity for improvement  You know, I’m   not in a position to judge how that would trade off against other considerations that molded the   planning in this event, but I’ll just register that     Thank you, Mr Chairman  In times like this, when we’re faced with a   relatively novel set of circumstances that pose policy questions for us, I think it’s useful to go   back to some principles that can guide us  I applaud President Kocherlakota’s memo on that   For me one stands out, and that’s neutrality, that we stand apart from the market   determinations of the relative values of different Treasury securities, and I was really glad and   August 1, 2011 29 of 53              welcomed Bill English and Brian Sack’s second memo in which they carefully spelled out that   that’s something that they assumed in what they had proposed   The proposed responses here turn on whether there are problems in market functioning    With the relative frequency with which strains in market functioning or problems or dislocations   are mentioned in here, you might expect me to, again, as you’ve heard me do many times in the   past, question the staff on the meaning of “market dysfunction”  Well, I’ve decided to abandon   all such attempts  I’ve come to the conclusion that what the staff means by “market dysfunction”   is that the price and quantity of some particular security have moved in ways that make some   market participants unhappy—perhaps very unhappy  And I’m going to act on that basis   Brian’s description is consistent with this  All he really said was that spreads would go   up, which is to say, selling would get you a price that’s pretty adverse relative to the price you’d   get if you were buying  For me, that kind of description of market functioning doesn’t raise any   issues of market efficiency per se  It doesn’t really rationalize, on efficiency grounds,   intervention  Now, it may have significant distributional implications  For example, RP rates   going up obviously make dealers unhappy; they tend to borrow at RP rates  But obviously,   people who still have money are willing to lend in the RP market and are better off; they’re   going to be happier with RP rates going up  So it doesn’t seem obvious to me why we should   intervene to prevent spikes in RP rates if fed funds rates are well behaved  The issue comes up   with money market funds—fire sales, the possibility of sales at inappropriate prices  The phrase   “appropriate prices” was used in Bill English and Brian Sack’s memo   I can picture a plausible case to be made about a particular market that, for some reason,   some barrier to entry into transacting in the market creates enough market segmentation to   warrant coming to the conclusion with some analysis that prices fall below fundamentals  But   August 1, 2011 30 of 53              the T-bill market is the last market in the world that I think such an argument would pertain to    Virtually everyone in the world can buy T-bills  You know, I haven’t seen the staff ever make a   case that prices are inappropriate  I’m not quite sure what they would rely on for making such a   case  And if that’s true, then merely having prices change to me isn’t a rationale for intervening,   even if you can describe it as a problem with market functioning   Related to this is the question of haircuts, which I think is tricky here  In the discount   window discussion, the presumption is that we use market-based prices, which our current   procedures do, but haircuts are also part of the terms of trade when you make a collateralized   loan  Haircuts have moved in markets on Treasuries, and our procedures for establishing   haircuts are based on an incredibly longer-run moving average of price volatility  They have the   effect of keeping our haircuts away from, at times like this, what’s happening with market   haircuts, and I’d be much more comfortable with discount window policies in which haircuts   were capable of mirroring market movements in haircuts the way our price and valuations   appropriately mirror market changes in valuations, and that to me is a discrepancy I can’t   understand   About the particular responses—outright purchases—I’m glad that Bill and Brian   clarified that  But if they’re going to take Treasuries in outright purchases at market-determined   prices, then I’m puzzled as to why in their first memo they would say that they would expect to   see a larger share of defaulted securities being offered to us than nondefaulted securities, if the   prices we’re taking them at are genuinely market prices  But that needn’t detain us   Rollover issues—I think the secondary market is okay; you know, direct from the   Treasury is sort of a shortcut anyway  Securities lending—again, I think haircuts ought to be   August 1, 2011 31 of 53              more market-matching than not  I’m okay with RPs, and again, the issue of the discount window   having to do with haircuts   Reverse RPs and RPs, particularly number 7—substantial pressure in RP markets might   have “detrimental consequences for broader market functioning”  I can picture market-  functioning problems having to do with settlement or computer pipelines or some other thing,   but that’s not what we’re talking about  We’re just talking about prices changing here, and I   don’t see a rationale for us intervening there   Money market mutual funds I think should be left on their own  I don’t see a reason for   us to intervene there  I’m tempted to say they should go to Treasury for more insurance the way   they did the last time   Again, I agree with President Plosser about 9 and 10 in the last group   Those are my comments, Mr Chairman  Thank you very much     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll start with some remarks about the Fifth   District economy  Recognize that all these are based on reports received before last week’s   financial market events  The indicators we have suggest Fifth District economic activity has   softened in the past couple of months  Our manufacturing index came in right about at   breakeven in June and July, and that’s a level that’s retraced much of the improvement it showed   earlier in the year  In the services sector, our Fifth District retail index returned to positive   territory, but our nonretail services index remained above even as well  Of the two, the retail   index has been more volatile, and comments from retailers in the District continue to suggest a   high level of consumer caution  For example, we heard from a supplier of waffle ingredients that   while sales at the stores he services are up, average waffle size has taken a hit  [Laughter]    Presumably, that means people are ordering smaller ice cream cones and waffles on average    Construction, both residential and commercial, remains fairly weak in most of the Fifth District    Government contracts seem to be the primary source of new, nonresidential work in our District,   August 9, 2011 39 of 162              and the construction industry is one where we often hear that uncertainty about long-range fiscal   policy has a direct effect on them, damping their willingness to invest in equipment or to hire   young workers who would need a few years to attain proficiency  Measures of current price   pressures in the Fifth District have eased a bit in recent months; expectations about future price   trends have declined a bit in services but remain elevated in manufacturing  So the overall   picture we get from the indexes and our contacts resembles what President Lockhart reported   about the Sixth District  The economy’s still growing, but it softened a little bit recently,   especially in the manufacturing sector  Caution is widespread, but the mixed tenor of comments   is very similar to recent months, and we didn’t see any signs of an imminent collapse in activity    However, as I said, these all came from before recent financial market events   At the national level, there’s no question the outlook’s deteriorated  The GDP revisions   were disheartening  They showed that the contraction was deeper, and the recovery slower, than   we had previously thought  One reading is that they increased the odds that we’re not returning   anytime soon to the trend line that characterized growth in per capita income in the 20th century    Nonetheless, what the revision means for economic growth might be hard to discern  I think it’s   striking that the Tealbook showed so much confidence in its estimates of the output gap that it   translated the GDP revisions, I guess, about one for one in revisions in estimated potential   output  We’ve discussed the notion about output gap at several recent meetings, including   during our presentation on DSGE models in June  And how one thinks about the output gap is   obviously closely related to the question of whether monetary stimulus is capable of increasing   real activity, or offsetting declines in real activity, to any measurable extent   I don’t want to recapitulate that debate, but I want to mention a little bit of recent research   at the Richmond Fed that has to do with the elevated level of long-term unemployment coming   August 9, 2011 40 of 162              out of this recession  The work is by Andreas Hornstein, and it’s based on work by Robert   Shimer that used data on short-term unemployment, as well as total unemployment, to estimate   rates at which workers enter and exit unemployment  And Shimer, who’s focusing on short-term   flows and short-term fluctuations, found that variations the rate at which workers exit from   unemployment predominantly accounted for variations in unemployment  But Shimer’s   framework doesn’t allow for the negative duration dependence—the negative association   between how long you’ve been unemployed and the rate at which you get out of unemployment    Specifically, his model significantly underpredicts long-term unemployment and overpredicts   short-term unemployment  What Andreas does is write down—I won’t call it a model—  essentially an accounting framework that allows for unobserved heterogeneity in the   unemployed  He allows two types in this framework, and if you use more data, you can allow   more types  And he does that  But one type has a lower rate of exit from unemployment and is   more prone, thus, to long-term unemployment  And the other has a higher rate of exit and thus is   more prone to coming in and out of the labor market more quickly  The entry and exit rates of   these can vary independently over time  They don’t have to be proportional or anything  And he   allows for the short-term unemployed to change types and become long-term unemployed at a   rate that can vary over time  He uses the data on short-term unemployment, less than 5 weeks,   and long-term unemployment, 26 weeks or more, to essentially infer all of these transition rates   from the data we have   He confirmed Shimer’s finding that fluctuations in unemployment are due mostly to   fluctuations in exit rates rather than entry rates  But unlike Shimer, he’s able to match, more or   less, the elevated level of long-term unemployment  The interesting part of his analysis is that it   nests two alternative explanations for the negative duration dependence—the negative   August 9, 2011 41 of 162              association between how long you’ve been unemployed and a low exit rate  One explanation is   that exit rates simply go down because of the time you spend unemployed  For example, skills   are lost the longer you spend outside the workforce or there’s some scarring effect  You might   call this pure duration dependence, and he captures this with the flows between types—if you   start as a good type, you might end up on long-term unemployment  You might change types   while you’re unemployed  The other source of duration dependence is through unobserved ex   ante heterogeneity  When workers become unemployed, some have relatively high exit rates,   some have relatively low exit rates  Over time, the ones with the low exit rates are a higher   fraction of those who have been unemployed for a long time, so it’s essentially a composition   effect  His model allows for both types, and he uses the data to just tell him which type of   negative duration dependence is going on  What he finds is that the transition between types is   negligible, so pure duration dependence, just pure time being unemployed, doesn’t seem to be   empirically important  Duration dependence instead appears to be more attributable to ex ante   heterogeneity among those entering unemployment  Some enter the pool of unemployed less   likely to find jobs, and they become a larger fraction of those who remain unemployed for a long   time   So, why is this relevant?  Well, I emphasize that this is an accounting framework, so this   isn’t a fully fleshed-out model of the economy  But the most natural interpretation of ex ante   heterogeneity is that it’s related to the characteristics of the worker, and the natural thing to think   about is skills and labor market mismatch that is brought about by structural change in the   economy  And the idea here is that differences in exit rates reflect differences in the degrees to   which workers’ skills are a good match for employers’ needs  According to Andreas’s   calculations, fluctuations in entry and exit rates for the long-term unemployed have accounted   August 9, 2011 42 of 162              for three-fourths of the fluctuations in unemployment in the United States over the postwar   period  Moreover, the rise in unemployment in 2008 and 2009 is predominantly attributable to   the increase in the rate at which long-term unemployed entered unemployment and to the   decrease in the rate at which they’ve exited unemployment  And as I said, between-type   transitions are negligible and have made virtually no contribution to the increase in   unemployment in this recession  The takeaway is that the rise in long-term unemployment in   this recession seems plausibly related to more labor market mismatch—“more ex ante   heterogeneity” is the more precise way to say it  Whether that’s skill mismatch or not is   obviously just an interpretation of the data  Others have made that argument, I realize, but the   unique contribution of Andreas’s work is that he allows for the possibility of pure duration   dependence and finds that its contribution is negligible   A digression of this sort might seem a bit odd in the midst of the apocalyptic market   behavior of the past few days, but I think it’s still important for us to focus on understanding   fundamentals  A couple of times this morning, “our profound ignorance,” I think, was the phrase   used about key aspects of how our economy behaves  My guess is that the recent market   movements were substantially driven—it’s just a guess—by concerns about growth prospects    That seems to be the likely leading candidate  I found it surprising, but the work I described has   bolstered my belief that unemployment is disappointingly high and economic growth is   disappointingly low for reasons that are related to economic fundamentals rather than insufficient   monetary policy stimulus—or insufficient fiscal policy stimulus, for that matter  Right now, the   European growth outlook has worsened in light of the political difficulty of constructing a   sustainable fiscal regime for the euro area  Amid all of this gloom, I think we can take some   comfort from inflation trends  Inflation seems to be headed toward a range of 1½ to 2 percent,   August 9, 2011 43 of 162              and I think it’s worth pointing out that that’s quite a bit different—and, I think, better—than the   situation we faced last year at this time  And I think that has obvious relevance to our policy   discussions, and I’ll leave my comments there  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Yes  The sentence that appeared yesterday, “Financial conditions have   become more restrictive”—I can understand the equity markets’ behavior contributing to that   characterization, but how do you think it’ll be interpreted against things like mortgage rates and   other rates that have not risen and, if anything, have fallen?  Treasury rates, of course, more   broadly have fallen precipitously     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I think we find ourselves in uncharted   waters, and that’s a phrase we’ve been using for four years now  But we’ve again veered farther   away from the charts we have  I welcomed Governor Tarullo’s opening of this round, which I   interpret as an appeal for humility and openness to question how we know what we think we   know about things  My question, as you know, is whether monetary policy can have a big effect   on economic growth right now  I think the key question for us is, why is growth so low?  And   I’d just remind you that our traditional approach to this—loss functions like the one President   Evans referenced—rests on a dichotomy between the determinants of longer-run trend growth   and fluctuations around that, where technologies and preferences and population growth are   viewed to influence the former, but policy is the tool that moves around things in the meantime    And I don’t think we really know that that can never change  The 20th-century trend growth in   the United States is remarkably constant, but it’s also a fact that many other advanced countries   with access to the same technology as us, and presumably the same types of human preferences   involved, have converged to growth paths that are markedly lower than that in the second half of   the 20th century  And it’s not obvious to me that we’re not capable of shifting from the path we   were on in the 20th century to one more like Europe’s, and it’s not obvious they can’t shift up    Given that, I think we should be circumspect about taking measures of the output gap, measures   of the unemployment gap, as measures of how much further policy has to go  My sense of things   is that further monetary stimulus at this point is unlikely to change real outcomes very much at   all  If you look back at QE2, we didn’t have much of an effect on economic growth  The effect   August 9, 2011 124 of 162              we had was temporary, and we got a more sustained increase in inflation  This is the classic   prediction of what happens after a monetary policy impulse  I think that in hindsight August is   likely to be a Romer date  You look at the impulse response after that, and it looks like the   classic thing  temporary effect on real activity, sustained effect on inflation   So I think we should be sitting pat  I think we should avoid encouraging people to look   to us, to look to monetary policy, to fix economic growth problems  And so I favor   alternative B  And I guess a lot of options have been put on the table  I strongly oppose putting   in numbers for unemployment  I share President Bullard’s discomfort with putting in a calendar   date as well, just for the reasons he said  I don’t think we can be sure that we’re not in the   situation in which Europe found itself in the ’80s, and that we’re not going to see unemployment   well above 8 percent for a decade or more  And it’s through no fault of monetary policy  So I   don’t want to hang our hat on unemployment  I don’t think we should  That concludes my   remarks  Oh, and about the two-day meeting, can I get back to you when I see my BlackBerry?    [Laughter]     Excuse me  Could you explain how this is taken out of the TIPS?     I’ve got you  It’s a different basis     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The difference between the maturity   extension program and an equivalent-sized quantitative easing is that with the quantitative   easing, we issue more reserves, and with the maturity extension program, we force the private   September 20–21, 2011 14 of 290              sector to absorb, instead of reserves, more two-year securities  With our policy guidance, two-  year securities are trading roughly under 20 basis points, and so they seem like virtually perfect   substitutes for reserves  I’d be interested in the Desk’s insight into the differences between those   two  How much different would it be for us to force them to hold more two-year securities than   it would for us to force the market to hold more reserves?     Just an observation, Mr Chairman      CNBC this morning aired a discussion of our possible policy tools,   including this “trigger strategy” idea  They referred to the unemployment rate trigger as a target    So I think the discussion has begun, and I think we’re behind the curve on that if we’re going to   try to convince the public that it’s not a target     I understand what we mean about it  I’m just reporting that—     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Coming 11th in the order, I just note that   President Kocherlakota’s dictum has the corollary that you would expect those coming late in the   order to speak less rather than more  I’ll note as well that that’s sometimes true, not always    [Laughter]  But actually in this case, it will be true  I’m going to just work through the questions   briefly and allude to points that many others have made that I agree with   I think quantitative effects of balance sheet tools are very hard to assess  I applaud the   staff’s presentation of the term structure model, where assumptions of how things are put   together are pretty transparent, but estimates on those models have their natural weaknesses  I   think it’s a great step forward, but they’re obviously sensitive to modeling assumptions, and   that’s particularly true with implementations of the habitat model, which, on theoretical grounds,   is a bit tenuous  And I’d note that one thing left out of the whole discussion is the question of   whether there’s habitat within a maturity class  This goes to President Fisher’s point about the   relationship between the 10-year Treasury and the 10-year corporate bond  There’s nothing   about habitat theory that rules out an imperfection in arbitrage across those two securities, which   further loosens the connection that Treasuries have  Other assessments of effects of balance   sheet tools rely on program announcements, and these are obviously contaminated by the effects   of what our announcement says about the future of the economy—and so by the effect of   downward revisions in private growth and inflation forecasts  I think those are hard to get a   handle on as well   To me—and this is a casual empiricism—last fall’s policy initiative seems to have had   only a small and relatively transitory effect on real economic activity, and in contrast, I think it   probably had a more sizable and longer lasting effect on inflation  That colors my sense of what   effect a maturity program or another LSAP would have   September 20–21, 2011 77 of 290              I’m persuaded by President Rosengren’s views that a reduction in the interest rate on   reserves is unlikely to horribly gum up financial markets as we know them  We should view that   as feasible and put it on the table, but I agree with President Lockhart that it doesn’t look like it   is likely to have gigantic effects  It doesn’t look as though marginal changes in borrowing costs   are going to have a notable effect on marginal willingness to spend now or invest now   Quantitative information about a long-run inflation objective, I think, would be very   useful  I’m still very much for an explicit numerical objective for inflation  I find myself very   resistant to the idea of including explicit numbers about unemployment  I’m not convinced we   can do justice in a sentence or two in the statement to the distinction between the role of our   unemployment forecast and our inflation objective in monetary policymaking  We forecast a lot   of things  Putting an unemployment rate forecast in the statement in very close proximity to a   statement, first ever, of our jointly agreed inflation objective, even if it’s identified the way we   tried to in A(2), is inevitably going to lead to some confusion, and it’s going to be hard to make   that distinction  I don’t think the idea of a dual mandate should prevent us from stating an   objective for inflation alone without mentioning what we think unemployment is going to do in   the same paragraph  As I’ve pointed out before, we in fact have three legislative goals, the third   one being moderate long-term interest rates  We’re actually doing quite well on that  [Laughter]    I don’t think we get enough credit for that  So why don’t we factor that into our communication   plans?  But in any event, the economics and history are very clear that central banks are held   responsible for inflation in a way they aren’t and shouldn’t be for unemployment because that’s   what central banks can directly control and can directly influence  And as you’ve said, Mr   Chairman, keeping inflation low and stable is the best contribution we can make to—and I’ll add   moderate long-term interest rates and—maximum employment   September 20–21, 2011 78 of 290              About this trigger-strategy reaction function idea, I think including a reference to an   unemployment rate there is a very bad idea for the reasons I’ve just described and for reasons   that others, President Bullard and Governor Tarullo, have mentioned  But this problem about   confusing it with the target is even more problematic in paragraph A(4) because we are directly   linking it to our policy in a way we don’t in paragraph A(2)  As I said, I was stunned to see the   discussion on CNBC this morning, where people were talking about the possible things we   would do today, including this idea of setting numerical triggers, and they were referring to it as   our unemployment target  Now, we could presumably push against that, but I think that’s a   signal of how hard we’d need to push and what kind of communication challenges we’d have  I   could support contingency language on inflation and a reaction to that, but I’m persuaded that it   would be better to explore other options and pursue those—like President Bullard’s suggestion   of an inflation forecast, like the idea many have suggested of including information on our   projections for interest rates in the SEP   Let me comment on something that you put on the table, Mr Chairman, the idea of—I’m   not quite sure what words you’d find satisfactory—temporarily tolerating a higher inflation rate    I think President Plosser is very articulate about these reasons, but I’ll mention a couple of things   in addition  This sets a precedent that will be with us for decades and be relevant to people’s   interpretation of our policymaking for decades to come  We’ve come to be viewed as wanting   inflation to be 2 percent, but I think that to officially temporarily abandon that for a time is just   going to make it harder for us to get back to the place where people think we’re focused on   2 percent  I am persuaded that it’s just going to be very hard for us to do this with credibility and   to limit ourselves to just a percent or two if what we’re really pursuing is unemployment  I   understand this symmetry argument that inflation went down to 1 percent, and we didn’t act as   September 20–21, 2011 79 of 290              though our hair were on fire, and so I guess we shouldn’t at 3 percent  But there’s a difference   here because when inflation was 1 percent, we weren’t trying to drive it further in order to reduce   employment growth, and to use that as an argument for being willing to take actions to drive   employment growth up when inflation is above 2 and it shows no sign of going down, I think, is   a very different matter  So we should be very cautious about that  I don’t see a way to pull that   off, given where we are now  Those are my comments, Mr Chairman     Mr Chairman?     If I may respond to the good Governor Tarullo  The reason I keep   mentioning our triple mandate is to note that we have read out the objective of moderate long-  term interest rates precisely because the best contribution we can make to moderate long-term   September 20–21, 2011 104 of 290              interest rates is to keep the inflation rate low  That’s despite the fact that the opposite is true in   the short run—that we can, in the short run, raise interest rates by raising short-term interest rates   to reduce inflation  So exactly the same logical relationship between moderate long-term interest   rates and inflation exists with respect to unemployment and inflation—namely, fighting inflation   may not reduce unemployment in the short run, but in the long run, we all recognize it would be   our best contribution  The Congress can put anything they want in a mandate  It’s up to us to   construe it  They can ask us to pursue maximizing the postseason performance of the Boston   Red Sox, but we’d have to construe what that meant     I could just agree that there is that division  I think the division about   this issue reflects different visions for how monetary policy affects inflation and unemployment    And if you think one is more accurate, you like that language; if putting inflation-only accords   better with your vision of how monetary policy affects the two, you prefer that formulation; if   you prefer a more symmetric approach, it’s because your vision likely reflects a different view of   how monetary policy interacts with the economy  I’m just reading it the way I see it   September 20–21, 2011 105 of 290                Thank you, Mr Chairman  It’s been some time since I immediately   followed in the go-round my friend and colleague from Boston  I’m tempted to lead off by   quoting Monty Python  “And now for something completely different”  [Laughter]     Since our last meeting, the flow of data and reports from our Fifth   District contacts have confirmed the view that the economy is experiencing an extended period   of slow growth, one that’s more persistent than can be accounted for by the temporary factors   that many of us were emphasizing just a few months back  An array of factors appears to be   impeding hiring and investment  We continue to hear about the difficulty of attracting skilled   workers in certain regions of our District  We also hear continuing comments about the chilling   effects of US regulatory policy, as well as caustic complaints about the quality of US political   leadership  Some contacts have been able to cite compelling examples of regulatory changes   that are inhibiting economic activity  Others, however, just see uncertainty about US financial   and fiscal and regulatory policy as having a general broad damping effect on confidence in future   economic growth and on demand for their goods and services  And so I think it’s difficult to   disentangle how much tangible effect these things are having  More broadly, the uncertain status   of European rescue schemes and the resulting financial strains seem to be depressing spirits and   weighing down US equity markets and sentiment measures   Whatever the mix of causes, the slowdown is clearly apparent in the information we’ve   received from our District contacts  Our survey indicators have retreated broadly since early in   the year, with both our manufacturing and service-sector indexes now dipping into negative   territory, as have many other Reserve Bank surveys  I do not see any evidence yet, though, of an   outright contraction in activity, although it’s certainly a little more possible than it was several   September 20–21, 2011 127 of 290              months ago  Like the Tealbook and many other forecasters, I think the most likely outcome is   for economic growth to continue at a slow pace with some modest acceleration next year  Our   surveys haven’t gone deeply negative, as they do when the economy contracts  And while our   anecdotal reports clearly reflect a general despondence, they still include a few bright spots    Tourism and hospitality have been strong in a number of regions, for example  Several new   manufacturing operations have been announced in various places   I think the inflation outlook is going to play, or ought to play, a critical role in our policy   deliberations at this meeting  When we initiated our second LSAP program a year ago, inflation   and inflation expectations were low and threatening to fall further  The situation is quite   different this time around  Headline inflation has run well ahead of our implicit target since the   beginning of the year  Core inflation has increased since last year, is now running around   2¼ percent, and, as yet, hasn’t shown any signs of abating  The current Tealbook projects an   immediate decline in inflation, but I don’t find the case very convincing  Every Tealbook this   year has forecast a decline in inflation during 2011, and inflation has surprised on the high side   every single time  The Tealbook’s disinflation forecast pays homage to that old chestnut “the   considerable amount of labor market slack”  It’s really hard for me to take the simple Phillips   curve logic very seriously anymore, especially in light of the behavior of inflation over the past   year, when inflation surprised on the high side despite quite large slack the way it’s   conventionally measured  As I pointed out in March, we expected considerable slack to bring   inflation down in late 2003 and early 2004 following what we thought was a temporary oil price   surge  Instead, core inflation ratcheted up to about 2¼ percent and stayed there for several years    I think it’s quite plausible to think that that’s what’s happening again—a relatively persistent   upward movement in core inflation despite a considerable amount of labor market slack   September 20–21, 2011 128 of 290              President Bullard’s memo, by the way, contains an excellent discussion of something   that’s relevant here  In our standard models, the slack that is relevant for inflation dynamics and   policy is the difference between current employment and the efficient level of employment—that   is, the level that would prevail if all prices were flexible  This is not the same as the gap between   the current unemployment rate and what’s called NAIRU, which, by construction, is an estimate   of the level of employment that would prevail in the absence of shocks and if all prices were   flexible  As President Bullard points out, the efficient level of employment fluctuates with   shocks that hit the economy, and this makes intuitive sense—that current inflation dynamics and   current policy shouldn’t ignore the history of shocks we’ve received over time that have gotten   us to where we are now  Thus, the amount of labor market slack in the United States could be   rather low right now, and that accords with the idea that many people have advanced, and the   intuition that many people sense, that there’s little monetary policy can do to increase real   activity right now   The case for declining inflation also relies on the fading of transitory factors, such as the   surge in energy and commodity prices  But there are transitory factors on the other side as well   that are temporarily depressing inflation  For example, the lodging component, admittedly not a   biggie of the CPI, fell at an annual rate of 19 percent last month; it seems poised to rebound   going forward  More notably, owners’ equivalent rent has been accelerating and appears likely   to contribute to higher inflation, at least compared with earlier in the year  The point here is that   there will always be transitory relative price changes, and you can always find some that are   about to subside and some that are about to rise   Popular accounts of the increase in inflation since 2010 also emphasize the run-up in   energy and commodity prices, which is attributed to the pressure of rising global demand in the   September 20–21, 2011 129 of 290              presence of inelastic supply  I find it hard to rule out, however, the possibility—I’m not sure   how strongly to take this—that our second LSAP played some role in this, partly through the   decline in the dollar as the program was beginning, but partly as commodity prices responded   more quickly and sharply to the monetary stimulus than the sticky goods and services prices    This is a common feature of standard models that allow for goods and services with different   amounts of stickiness built into them  It’s the flexible price goods whose prices respond to   monetary stimulus more rapidly and more strongly  It’s also easy to imagine portfolio   rebalancing, shifting funds through a chain that drives funds into commodity markets  It’s   certainly difficult to quantify such a decomposition at this point, but as I said, it’s difficult, I   think, to rule out such effects   What about the real side?  Looking back over the past year, my sense is that our last   LSAP program had only a small transitory effect on real activity  For a couple of months around   the turn of the year, we saw some better-than-expected data on economic growth and spending    But on net, the growth outlook for 2011 and beyond has been marked down substantially since   last fall  So looking back over the past year, my reading of our last LSAP program is that it had   only a negligible and fleeting effect on real activity but instead showed up mainly in the form of   higher inflation  That assessment, along with the significant difference in the inflation outlook   from a year ago, is going to strongly shape my thinking about policy alternatives and whether we   want more monetary stimulus at this point  Thank you, Mr Chairman     No, you don’t detrend them     Not “just”     Right   September 20–21, 2011 147 of 290                I would just suggest to the staff that it might be useful to supplement   that with a more microeconomically focused investigation into who holds what, and what   relevant margins of substitution, for which investors, link the IOER, the market funds rate, GC   collateral RP rates, and short-term Treasury rates  Obviously, there are players that can’t   participate in all markets  Pair-wise, you can figure out where some participate and define what   those margins of substitution are  I think this would help us understand how changing IOER   would pass through to six-month bill rates, for example, and other relevant borrowing rates  In   addition, I think it would be broadly informative to monetary policy operations     Right, exactly  Same thing on the other side     I was going to support that  It has the look of cherry-picking the statistic   you’re looking at  We don’t want to get caught shifting which one we are focusing on or   appealing to from meeting to meeting     We set the precedent there to focus on less than 12 months of inflation,   right?  “Are we going to stick to that?” is the question we need to ask ourselves     I have a couple of questions about the mortgage-backed securities thing    First, for the record, I think I know the answer to this question  In your staff presentation   yesterday, I didn’t recall any mention of dysfunction or dislocation in the mortgage-backed   securities market  I take it you don’t have any to report on, or if there are, I’d appreciate hearing   that     So the staff’s view is that, compared with not doing the MBS   reinvestment, this would likely lower the MBS spread by some measure?     So doesn’t this mean that Treasury rates would be higher than they   otherwise would be because we’re taking less Treasury out of the market?     If we’re able to reduce the MBS spread, there’d be some other   borrowers in the economy that would face higher cost than otherwise, right?   September 20–21, 2011 199 of 290              Does the staff have a sense of the differential effect on spending?  Is lowering mortgage   rates going to result in enough spending to counteract the reduced spending on the part of the   people for whom borrowing costs are going to go up because of this?     Bill, on the sources of uncertainty, do you think you know better than   the market about those things?     It’s real risk  I mean, it’s risk to us, too     Okay     If I could respond, the stress in the housing market isn’t among people   who are going to be capable of refinancing at a slightly lower rate  These are people that have   good credit now  The distress is somewhere else     I just point out that if the Treasury yield difference is little or none, then   we have this miraculous ability to reduce spreads everywhere, sector by sector, with no cost to   anybody in the economy, and that can’t be the case     If you look at budget constraints and resource constraints, there’s a   certain amount of savings going on, and it’s getting channeled to a certain amount of resources   that are going to a certain amount of borrowers  From that point of view, if we increase the   resources going to some borrowers, it has got to come from somebody     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Real growth has obviously been much   weaker than we had hoped for, or that we view as desirable  But as I said yesterday, I think the   inflation outlook is central to our policy decision today  A year ago inflation was running around   1 percent, and it looked as if it had the potential to continue falling  That made it very attractive   to provide more stimulus to aid the real economy, and if that also increased inflation, it was for   the good  I understand the rationale for intervention a year ago  But now inflation is 29 percent   year over year, and 21 percent over the last three months  Core inflation is 2¼ percent over the   last three months and the three months before that, and survey measures of inflation are ticking   up  I understand what is going on with TIPS yields, but it is a mixed picture on inflation   expectations   September 20–21, 2011 211 of 290              As I said yesterday, the balance of evidence suggests to me that our asset purchases   initiated last November contributed to the rise in inflation, but had little or no effect on real   growth  So my sense is that the alternatives—A or B—to the extent that they have material   economic effects, are going to push up inflation and do very little for economic growth  And   with inflation running above what everyone articulates as their preferred rate, I do not think we   now want or need more monetary stimulus  Accordingly, I support alternative C   I understand how raising inflation would reduce real rates and provide stimulus for the   real economy  But I do not believe we could publicly acknowledge allowing inflation to rise and   still keep inflation expectations from rising even further from time to time after that  I do not   believe we would have an easy time reversing course and bringing inflation expectations down   again without significant real costs  Even if I was wrong about that, and we could easily raise   and lower inflation, we would have set a precedent that would permanently limit the credibility   of our commitment to price stability, because always in the back of a market participant’s mind   would be the notion that in 2011 we raised inflation deliberately, and we could do it again  That   will affect our conduct and our ability to meet our objectives for years to come  A strategy of   tolerating a bit more inflation in an attempt to reduce unemployment bears, to me, more than a   passing resemblance to the strategy pursued in the late 1960s and 1970s, and that was, obviously,   such a dismal failure  I found it disturbing to have heard this notion entertained  I think it is   agreed in hindsight that policymakers then placed excessive emphasis on unemployment,   excessive blame on commodity price increases as opposed to their own policy errors, and   excessive faith in the sluggishness of inflation expectations  Now, some of you no doubt view   there as being a substantive distinction between the strategies we pursued then and the notion of   September 20–21, 2011 212 of 290              tolerating higher inflation, higher than it is now today  I would love to understand it, because I   don’t get the distinction at this point   I fully appreciate that unemployment has been painfully high for an excruciatingly long   time period, and that high unemployment is associated with substantial losses in well-being for   many Americans, relative to an alternative world in which we came into today’s meeting with a   much lower unemployment rate  I understand the compelling urge to do something, even if there   are legitimate doubts about how much of an effect monetary stimulus can have at the zero bound,   which is the circumstance we find ourselves in  But if monetary stimulus is effective at the zero   bound, what are those effects?  Are they real, or are they on inflation?  I don’t think there is any   question that we should be more confident that monetary stimulus is going to affect inflation   than it is going to affect real growth  That comes from a reading of monetary economics going   way back  It is the effect on real growth and the non-neutralities of monetary policy that are the   really hard things in macroeconomics and that have divided us and divided the profession from   time to time  I think inflation is one thing that we know monetary policy can affect if it affects   anything   As I said, I support alternative C  On the off-chance that the Committee gravitates to   alternative B—[laughter]—I have a couple of observations to make  First, about the inflation   language, I agree with Vice Chairman Dudley that we should keep forward-looking statements   out of paragraph 1, and that the movements we made to doing that are sound  If we have   something to say about what we expect inflation to do, let’s keep that grouped in paragraph 2   with everything else about the future  “Appears to be moderating” is a welcome addition to that    Under questioning, we can direct people to the three-month rate  At this point, I don’t think we   September 20–21, 2011 213 of 290              want to enshrine the three-month rate in the statement  I’m a little hesitant to do that without   thinking that through a little more   Halting our transition to a Treasury-only portfolio is a terrible idea  My head has stopped   spinning right now, but— [Laughter]     This takes us into the realm of fine-tuning sectoral spreads, and it begs   questions  What about small business lending?  What about municipals?  There are plenty of   sectors where there is distress, urgency, and a need  People are going to ask, “Well, you’re   helping out the housing market, why aren’t you helping out our sector?”  That’s the reason we   have stayed away from this stuff until the crisis, and we should keep on that track by getting out   of the business of subsidizing housing  This perpetuates this really corrosive political economy   in our country of tapping government resources to subsidize the housing market  I should think   we would be a little averse to that, given the damage that caused in the last crisis   About President Bullard’s point on announcing $400 billion versus $45 billion, I think   that is a cogent point  I will make the observation here about quantitative easing  We apparently   are viewing, according to our Vice Chairman, quantitative easing as off the table because of the   political backlash we got last year  That’s my sense     Too strong?  Okay     The bar is high  Right  I have sour feelings about setting a higher bar    We have had two instances of naked political intimidation in the last week, and I think we all   September 20–21, 2011 214 of 290              gravitate toward the notion that we set policy the way we see it  I’d like to believe that we do   that     I wasn’t sure I quite understood the extent to which the political   backlash would affect the efficacy of the policy without affecting our subsequent actions?     Would that work through beliefs about our future actions or not?     Those both seem like our future actions     I’m glad to hear that  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Would “appears to have moderated” be more consistent with Dudley’s   dictum regarding the first paragraph?     This removes the phrase “maturity extension program”     We’re going to have to figure how to communicate our name for this   program     This is a question more generally about what conversations we’ve had   with the US Treasury and what we’ve gleaned from those about their debt management  Are   they going to react?  Do they pledge not to offset us?  What do we know?     They’re going to continue extending the maturity of what they issue   while we’re trying to reduce the maturity of what’s in the hands of the public     How does the magnitude of what you expect to be subsequent extension   of the maturity of what’s in the hands of the public due to their issuance compare with what   we’re doing with the maturity extension program?     Right  You’re telling me that there’s a fair amount of uncertainty about   what they’re going to do   SEVERAL  No  Not really     Go to 70 or not?     But you don’t know what their strategy is?     This contrasts notably with the first Operation Twist in which   cooperation was fairly clear with the Treasury  We understood what they were doing with their   portfolio and what we were doing with ours     Not every Reserve Bank is on it     I want to thank Governor Tarullo for sharing with us that the Board and   New York staff are working on liquidity     Yes, thank you, Mr Chairman  I wanted to ask about the optimal policy   under discretion  You say that you assume the Committee aims for a target of 2 percent  I am   wondering, does the policymaker choose what inflation rate we desire in the long run?  Or do   you hold that constant?     In a sense, there is some commitment     Thus the quotes around “discretion”  So the Taylor rule is not time-  consistent, and it describes what we do pretty well, right?  Is that true?   November 1–2, 2011 10 of 282                Right  The extent to which the Taylor rule captures how we behave   now, is it your judgment that we behave with some greater level of commitment than is   embodied in your optimal policy with discretion?     I have one other question, Mr Chairman, if I could  You have an   objective function that you carry across these scenarios and across models that has the   policymaker minimizing this weighted sum  On the unemployment side, it is the deviation of   unemployment from a u* that is fixed, that is a constant  Am I right about that, or is it the   Tealbook’s NAIRU?      Is it the natural rate that is adjusted for the extended unemployment   benefits?     In the model EDO, you start from preferences, endowments, and   technologies, and, principally, you could derive the right loss function, right?  And it wouldn’t   have the same property that the u* is some fixed, smooth thing  Am I right about that?     There is this dichotomy here, right?  The change in the unemployment   insurance, the richness of those—it is a kind of a shock, right?  You guys take that on board for   NAIRU, but you don’t take on board any of the other shocks that have hit the economy in the   past few years  Have you guys thought about that dichotomy, that contrast?     That results in a figure that is really smooth, and the vision you’d get out   of EDO is that every quarter’s TFP shock should affect the natural rate  There is still a bit of a   bucket of left-out shocks there  Thank you     Perfectly fair     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I am going to organize my remarks around   the questions  The first one is about flexible inflation targeting  In the question, it says “the   central bank pursues an explicit inflation objective, maintains the flexibility to stabilize   economic activity, and seeks to communicate forecasts and policy plans as clearly as possible”    When you define it that way, flexible inflation targeting is a big tent  The main reason we are   not in the tent right now is that we don’t have an explicit inflation objective  It is an implicit one,   and that could be easily remedied  In fact, I would be in favor of doing that  You asked about   that, Mr Chairman  I have long been on record as favoring adopting a numerical objective and   communicating forecasts and policy plans as clearly as possible  When that is constructive, we   should do that  I am in favor of that as well  I am willing to support describing our policy   framework in terms of flexible inflation targeting  Now, under that definition, it is an awfully   big tent  I am sure that some of us worry that it would include the possibility of taking   stabilizing economic activity too far  I’m sure some of us worry that it would not take stabilizing   economic activity far enough  That is, by way of supporting President Evans’s observations,   about the reality that we have different visions around here  But when you are evaluating these   frameworks, I think it is legitimate to evaluate them from the point of view of what they do for   our credibility, and in particular, the credibility of our commitment to price stability  The same   thing is true with these frameworks  My general observation is that they could cause us trouble   if they are viewed as opportunistic maneuvers to give us the license to raise inflation more  It is   going to be critical to formulate things very carefully   November 1–2, 2011 42 of 282              The second question asks about the staff’s memo on alternative frameworks  With all   due respect to the obviously huge amount of work and thought that went into the staff’s memo,   for me, it doesn’t provide the kind of quantitative work that I would want to see if we are   evaluating a change in framework  I think a framework is something we adopt once and for all, a   relatively permanent change in how we approach policy  That means we are going to use it to   guide policymaking over the course of many years and several business cycles, hopefully small   ones, but several business cycles ahead   What kind of analysis would you want there?  You would want to know how the strategy   is going to do in a range of circumstances in the future  What the staff did was give us a   quantitative analysis of the first few years of the transition dynamics from where we are now to   our new regime, starting from where we are today  There is some mention of how average   inflation is higher in the alternative frameworks, but there isn’t any quantitative information   about the performance over a complete business cycle or how it does on average, the   unconditional moments of performance under different frameworks  I think we ought to ask   about the variability of the average level over the long haul of inflation, output, consumption,   household welfare, things like that, if we are going to switch policies  That perspective could   well lead to a different ranking of alternative frameworks than one based purely on the short-run   transition dynamics—a fairly general point  I am not asking for anything unusual  This is the   standard way we have in economics of evaluating alternative policy rules, assessing their average   behavior over time     I mentioned earlier this question about how you calculate optimal policy rules  The staff   has invariably had one argument of a loss function the deviation of output or unemployment   from a smooth statistical trend that represents the natural rate, a concept like NAIRU  We have   November 1–2, 2011 43 of 282              talked about this many times  President Bullard had a very cogent memo on this several months   ago  We know that is wrong if there are shocks to the economy  And it is wrong in the sense   that in the standard models we have, you have got household welfare right there  You can derive   what the right loss function is for the policymaker to use  When you do that, you don’t get   anything like NAIRU going into the loss function  You evaluate unemployment and output   against something that varies with the shocks to the economy  The shocks affect what is feasible   and what is desirable in the short run, and it is the natural and intuitive thing that you would   expect to get  Monetary policy, if you do it right in those models, maximizes household welfare   over time, and that translates into attempting to stabilize activity around the level that would be   most desirable, taking into account all of the shocks we know have hit the economy  Sure,   models differ, implementing this can give very different results, but I am struck by the absence   of u*, even in the DSGE memos  The first thing I want to know about every one of those models   is  What is u* in the current quarter?  We don’t get that out of the DSGE models, and that ought   to be a standard part of the reporting from those frameworks   The third comment on the second question is that, for me, the practical difficulties of   implementing any of these alternative frameworks are prohibitive  Commitments are simple in   models  They are very easy to achieve  Even complicated and very conditional commitment is   something we all recognize  They are essentially completely credible by assumption, no matter   how complicated  Real life—as we have learned doing policy over the years—is very   complicated  The process of communicating what we intend and getting enough of the people   understanding it and acting accordingly can be time-consuming and fraught with risks, given the   inflation fight of the early ’80s, an obvious example, and going from the ’80s to the ’90s, another   example, where it took some time to get inflation down from about 5 percent to 2 percent  The   November 1–2, 2011 44 of 282              public’s inflation expectations seem pretty well anchored where they are now around 2 percent    I’m not sure it would be easy to dial those up and down on a year-to-year basis  I think that is   what is at stake here   Changing inflation expectations, even if we could do that, just doing it once sets a   precedent that is going to color interpretation of our commitments for decades, because we will   have set the precedent that, yes, we say we want the inflation rate to be 2 percent  “They did that   back in the ’90s and the ’00s, but then they changed it on us  They raised their target to 2½ for a   year or two, and so they could do that again”  Forever after, there is going to be a little extra   variability in inflation expectations, a little less precision on the public’s part in their   understanding, and a little less commitment and credibility on our part, just by setting the   precedent, even if we could  To be fair, the staff’s memo acknowledges these difficulties, and   these are all in the realm of the kind of learning that has to go on when you make a choice to   adopt a new framework—you have to go down the path of convincing people you’ve got a new   framework and getting them on board with acting accordingly   The second question also asks about numerical triggers for inflation or unemployment    President Evans was passionate about that  I said at the last meeting I think they are a bad idea    I don’t think it is going to be easy to avoid having them translated for us by the media to the   public as the Fed’s inflation and employment targets  It is hard for me to see how we are going   to avoid the use of the word “target” in the media relative to these things  If the issue is   convincing people that we are willing to tolerate inflation of around 3 percent, inflation averaged   3 percent for four years between ’04 and ’07  We have done a great job of demonstrating our   willingness to tolerate 3 percent inflation  We had 4 percent inflation for half a year earlier this   November 1–2, 2011 45 of 282              year  I don’t think it’s that much of a problem for us, that people don’t think we are going to let   headline inflation go above 2 percent   The third question is about price-level or nominal income targeting—a lot of the same   things apply  Adopting either of these proposals would be relatively complicated to explain to   the kind of people that attend our speeches  It may be easy for a Goldman Sachs economist to   understand, but I think about the people I talk to—it just seems hard  I often run these things by   my “brother-in-law” test  You know, my brother-in-law sitting in front of his PC with the   retirement planning software, and it prompts him for the inflation rate he would like to assume   for the next 10 or 15 years  I should warn you, I actually don’t talk to him about this—that   would be a violation of our communications policy  [Laughter]  But I try to imagine—it is pretty   easy with this guy—and nominal income targeting doesn’t fare very well  To put in an   assumption for the inflation rate, he needs to forecast real GDP, and he is going to call me  A   framework where he has to call me flunks the test  [Laughter]     He’s a doctor  I won’t say anything more  [Laughter]   Price path targeting does a bit better, except for the times when the price level is well   below the target path, and then you’d have to do logarithms  Again, he would call me    [Laughter]  I think it would be really hard for him to figure out what number to put in that   software, and that is a test for simplicity and clarity that I am attracted to   The fourth question  What should we do?  I found the document we drafted earlier this   year compelling  It explains the relationship between unemployment and inflation—as best we   can forge a consensus on it within this group—and does a very good job of embodying that   consensus about the relationship  Recasting that document as an explanation of the Federal   November 1–2, 2011 46 of 282              Reserve’s flexible inflation-targeting framework seems like an ideal approach  Using that as a   vehicle for slipping into the public domain our commitment to a numerical inflation objective   seems to me like the best approach going forward  Let me leave it at that  Thank you     Yes     Yes, I think robustness has a lot to recommend it      Thank you  I have two questions  Brian, as this chart shows, we’ve   been buying a lot more nominals than TIPS, and under the same theory that lengthening our   maturity of our portfolio twists the curve, that would also affect the breakeven spreads  Do you   think that’s happening?  And do you have a quantitative estimate of how much?   November 1–2, 2011 102 of 282                You gave us an estimate of the effect on the 10-year yield, but it would   be nice to have an estimate of this as well   The second question is about Treasury debt issuance plans  Is there anything you can tell   us about what you know about their plans for next year and the extent to which they may be   contemplating or may have embarked on a path that would to some extent offset what we’ve   done?     Thank you     Yes, a question about MF Global, and then I want to follow up on a   question from President Fisher  MF Global is insolvent, I take it?  Is that our best information?     Okay  Do you view how it has played out as inefficient ex post?     About Richard Fisher’s question about corporate debt spreads—this   actually came up at the last meeting  We are operating under this habitat theory, and there is this   question  Is 10-year corporate debt in the same habitat as 10-year Treasuries?  Or is it in a   separate habitat, and its yield doesn’t move?  And the data look like it is in a separate habitat, but   you are saying that there was some offsetting move and some expectation   November 1–2, 2011 114 of 282                The question I want to ask is about 2-year versus 10-year corporates    Do you view the impediments between those two markets as similar to the impediments between   2-year Treasuries and 10-year Treasuries?  Or are they in the same habitat?  And, in particular,   does the fact that a corporation can operate in its own debt make it different from Treasuries?    And would that short-circuit the effect you want to have on the shape of the yield curve in the   Treasury market?     The intuition in habitat theory is the costliness or riskiness of arbitrage    A corporation can scoop up its own debt pretty easily     Which chart are you talking about?     It would be hard to pick a consensus trigger out of that or a threshold  Is   that what you take from this?     You can make them into three clumps     Maybe not  I don’t know     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The incoming data since the last meeting   have generally confirmed my previous views about the outlook  Growth picked up a bit after   November 1–2, 2011 160 of 282              having slowed in the first half in response to several temporary factors  I was particularly   pleased by the strong growth in final demand in Q3  I think 36 percent was more than a lot of   economists expected   Certainly, some of the rebound represented the passing of the effect of energy price   increases and supply chain disruptions that held down spending earlier in the year  I’m struck,   though, by the disconnect between household and business spending and the general   despondence expressed on surveys and in conversations with our contacts  Given the news and   commentary on the debt ceiling negotiations and European debt crisis beginning at the start of   August, I might not have been surprised if falling confidence had led to a general free fall in   spending in August and September, but instead, both retail sales and business fixed investment   made decent advances last quarter  Consumers and firms seem to be expanding their spending   based more on their individual economic fundamentals than on broader, more media-driven   worries  Having said that, these fundamentals are by no means ebullient, and there still seem to   be serious impediments to a more robust pace of economic expansion  I’ve talked before about   what seems to me to be restraining the recovery, and I don’t have much to add  I was impressed   with President Lockhart’s account   The only thing I will add is that we continue to hear new anecdotal reports related to   these impediments, and I’m going to share two with you  One is from an employment agency in   West Virginia saying that unquestionably the biggest problem in hiring skilled and unskilled   workers was the inability to pass a drug test  Other firms in the area have reported the same   thing  We’ve gotten some reports, not quite as prevalent, outside of West Virginia  Many say   that the problem has gotten worse recently  I asked someone to look into this to try to get a sense   of whether this has become a bigger problem recently  Apparently the big increase in the   November 1–2, 2011 161 of 282              prevalence among firms of drug screening was in the late 1980s and early 1990s in response to   new, low-cost screening tests and some new federal regulations that were related to safety  So it   doesn’t look as if we’ve had a technology shock or rapid decline in the cost of drug screening or   anything like that  Now, illicit drug use, though, is more prevalent among the unemployed  Of   those who are unemployed or not working, 173 percent are drug users, compared with   79 percent of full-time workers  So forget the worries about full-time workers  The increased   incidence of unemployment by itself would increase the frequency of bad drug tests  One   suspects that usage increases the longer one is unemployed  You also expect the other   causality—that usage would cause a lower exit rate from unemployment, but I’m not aware of   any data on that, so I can’t really say I’ve been able to document that  There also may be a   regional component to this  Industries in which screening is more prevalent are mining, utilities,   and transportation, and they’re much more prevalent in the West Virginia economy  That might   be why it’s more of a problem in West Virginia  Now, usage doesn’t appear to be higher than   the national norm in West Virginia—we checked that  But we do hear widespread reports about   hard drug use, OxyContin and methamphetamine, in Appalachia and other rural parts of our   District—in particular, Appalachia  And there could be a demographic angle to this  Some of   our contacts say that drug use is more of a problem with the younger generation, versus alcohol   being the predominant problem among older workers  Obviously, demographic characteristics   associated with higher drug use are also associated with higher unemployment  Drug abuse and   the hardship involved in unemployment aren’t really laughing matters; it’s hard to pin this down   quantitatively, but it strikes me that there could be something meaningful there as a contributor   to impediments to labor market functioning   November 1–2, 2011 162 of 282              I’ll pass on just one other comment, and this is from a business owner who notably—it   became quite obvious in our advisory council discussion; he’s a member of one of our advisory   councils—is a staunch Democrat  We asked at the very end of the council, “What’s your number   one worry about your business going forward?”  And he said, “Obamacare”  He has a brewery   and a 56-employee restaurant, and he said he was thinking of “playing games,” as he put it, to   get his employees down under the 50 mark, where a bunch of things kick in  We’ve heard   similar concerns from others in our District, and this could be a widespread concern, obviously,   among small businesses   So those are my two anecdotes of the meeting  I realize anecdotes are murky as   evidence  You have to look for an accumulation of these things, see if there’s a tenor to them    But we’re struggling to understand what’s impeding growth, and what you can torture out of the   macrodata is fairly limited at times, so I think it’s useful to buttress our understanding with these,   judiciously interpreted  My best guess is that no one single problem is holding things back  It’s   a combination of a bunch of things that people have mentioned at many of our recent meetings   My growth projection is relatively guarded, like the Tealbook’s  I think growth is most   likely to rise, but only gradually over the next few years  I wrote down 3½ percent for 2014, but   without much conviction  I put significant probability on a soggier path  I think growth could   well average more like 2½ percent for the next few years   I’m less pessimistic on inflation, but I don’t see a lot of evidence of a decline anytime   soon  Headline inflation numbers remain high  The PCE figure for September was 29 percent   year over year and 33 percent over the previous months  It’s true that the core index was flat for   September, but that was largely due, as President Pianalto said, to volatile components, like   apparel and autos, that were high earlier in the year  I think it’s too soon to say we’re seeing a   November 1–2, 2011 163 of 282              downward trend in core inflation in the data so far  Futures markets prices for Brent crude   indicate only modest reversal of the run-up in prices that started in late 2010  As a result, I see   little chance that a decline in energy prices is going to help us out by dragging down the headline   inflation numbers and maybe passing through to core  I expect core and headline inflation to run   around 2 percent, maybe even a little bit higher, going forward  I think that’s an inflation   outlook that, according to our SEP responses, most of us would be pretty happy with  I, of   course, put down 1½ percent for my SEP response under appropriate policy  So I’m one of those   people with diverging forecasts and SEP responses   All in all, the outlook for the real economy is disappointing, to be sure, but I remain in   the camp that ailments are largely beyond the power of monetary policy to correct  Thank you,   Mr Chairman     Get them off the street?     I think a lot of people use in their homes     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’m willing to support following through on   our maturity extension program, which I opposed at the last meeting, but I’m willing to support   that   As I said in the economic go-round, I think the forecast for inflation—people’s around   this table and my own—is good, one that I’m very pleased with  The risks around inflation are   heightened  If you look at a picture of inflation over the past several years, you’ll notice the   significant increase in volatility this past decade over the decade before, and I think that volatility   is likely to be with us for some time  It is possible that the broader inflation trend could   moderate a bit, as in the Tealbook and many of your forecasts, but I worry that a forecast of   moderating inflation relies overly much on the effect of slack, whose downward effect on   inflation has disappointed us several times in the recent past  I think inflation could accelerate,   and it could do so rapidly  I don’t see that on the horizon right away, but it’s well within the   realm of possibility  I’d note the continuing buildup of bank balances and the huge amount of   reserves, and I’d question whether two-year Treasuries are any less effective as inflationary   tinder than bank balances  So it’s conceivable that with the spark of a commodity price increase   or an oil price increase of a substantial magnitude, we could get a broader acceleration of   inflation   Growth is certainly extremely disappointing, but as I’ve said and many others have said   around here, it’s a fairly nonmonetary phenomenon  I think the natural rate, thinking in those   November 1–2, 2011 221 of 282              terms, is fairly high and fairly close to the unemployment rate we have  Further stimulus on our   part could well affect growth, but I can’t see it affecting growth without also pushing inflation   up  It’s one thing, when inflation is running below where we’d like it to average, to be willing to   run that risk for the sake of stimulating employment, but it’s entirely different when inflation is   where we want it  And it’s one thing to tolerate shocks that temporarily push headline inflation   well above where we’d like it, in a situation where we have good reason to believe that that   effect will reverse shortly and we’ll get back down to where we want it; it’s quite another thing   to attempt to deliberately engineer an increase in inflation trends  I just don’t think that our   ability to manage the movement upward in inflation and a controlled movement downward   warrants as much confidence as I’d require to get over the hump to support that  It would be a   terribly risky maneuver to attempt   Looking forward, I think the more stimulus we provide, the quicker we’re going to have   to be ready to take it out  The deeper we get into this, the quicker we’re going to have to move   to take it out  So I worry that we’ll face a situation with rising inflation and terribly   disappointing growth still, or growth picking up but still disappointing on the labor market   side—a dilemma that will be tough for this Committee to grapple with, that will really expose a   lot of differences of opinion in this Committee   On the statements, I think “significant downside risks” was a mistake, in hindsight  I   believe that markets already thought there were significant downside risks, they read our   statement as gloomier than they already were, and they read it as gloomier than we really were    So I’d favor dropping the word “significant”  I realize that the past few days’ events in Europe   may make that a discordant, dissonant move; therefore, I could support leaving it in as well    Thank you very much, Mr Chairman   November 1–2, 2011 222 of 282                I found Vice Chairman Dudley compelling, so I agree we should leave it   in  Going back to the old language makes sense   November 1–2, 2011 235 of 282                You could say “somewhat significant”  [Laughter]     “Notable”?     Will these be sterilized?     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’m going to respectfully recommend that   we don’t pursue this course for many of the same reasons that President Bullard expressed  I can   understand how funding can suddenly dry up for a financial institution, as in the case of   MF Global  I can understand how funding pressures can emerge for a broad set of market   participants  But I don’t see us in a situation where there’s a deficiency of liquidity supply  Just   look at our balance sheet  There’s plenty of liquidity in dollars available in the marketplace    What I think we see is a deficiency in the willingness to lend to particular institutions, largely for   the reason that they’re viewed as riskier  What we know both from public sources and from   supervisory sources suggests that that reluctance in the marketplace lines up pretty well with   differences in the riskiness of those counterparties  I don’t see any evidence that it doesn’t   reflect a difference in concerns about creditworthiness  And so this doesn’t seem like a matter of   market efficiency or functioning  It seems as though intervention here would be distributional    More broadly, I think some financial strains are consistent with a well-functioning set of   markets  MF Global is a great example of that  I don’t think that’s a case where we should have   intervened, and I don’t see MF Global’s demise as a failure of market functioning, apart from the   fraud they committed relative to the use of funds  More central bank credit is always going to be   seen as positive for markets  So I don’t think the fact that markets would view this as positive is   an argument for doing this  A farm bill is always positive for agricultural land prices, but it’s not   an argument that you want an infinitely large farm bill   November 28, 2011 30 of 40              My predecessors have a long history of dissenting on foreign exchange operations  The   reasoning is that, like other central bank credit actions, they essentially involve fiscal policy,   they’re distributional, and they’re essentially end runs around constitutional appropriations   policy, and that entangles us in political controversy  I think that, as I said, applies to virtually   all central bank credit extension  That’s why we’ve declared, as a Committee, our intention to   get back to a Treasury-only balance sheet as soon as we can  And I’d argue that this dynamic   has contributed to the hostile political environment that we currently face  More broadly, an   expansion of central bank swap lines is going to send the message of an implied backstop   commitment that I think is too large  It’s counterproductive  It will contribute to financial   instability rather than reduce it   So I remain respectfully opposed to additional swap arrangements to support our   provision of liquidity in foreign currencies  I agree with those who highlight the political risk   that would be associated, I think, with offering these central bank swaps on terms that are more   advantageous than those we offer at the discount window to domestic borrowers  I would urge   you, Mr Chairman, if we go down this road, to consult with your colleagues and ask them if a   straight 75 basis points would be acceptable, rather than 50 over OIS  Thank you,   Mr Chairman     Yes, I’d like to follow up on this point  It says “initiated by the   appropriate Reserve Bank”  That seems to parallel the discount window and the way it works,   and that Reserve Bank is essentially in charge of lending to an institution in its District  But this   is an open market operation?  Would this be administered through New York?  And, more   broadly, should we go down this path?  Do you have in mind any protocol for deciding on an   individual institution in a given District outside New York?  What if the Reserve Bank doesn’t   initiate it?     Would this just be with banks, or could it be with any affiliates?     On exhibit 2, chart 12, the middle option is “Provide SOMA Guidance”    Because I’m not familiar with that from past Committee discussions, I’m assuming you put it in   there to reduce the information content of the questions you posed to market participants     Is “Provide SOMA Guidance” the wording that you gave them or is   there something more fulsome?  I’m not quite sure what it means     Guidance would have something to do with timing, right?     I think the measures you’ve taken to reduce implicit signaling are   worthwhile, very good  I applaud you on that     Thank you very much, Mr Chairman  Over the past couple of months,   incoming data have been consistent with the gradual improvement in US growth that we had   expected for the second half of the year  At the same time, deteriorating conditions in Europe   have damped the outlook for future growth in the US   Recent reports from our Fifth District contacts are certainly consistent with gradually   improving activity now  We have heard of several positive developments in manufacturing, for   example  Two new tire plants have been announced for South Carolina, and the resolution of the   NLRB complaint against Boeing has removed a cloud over a project that is expected to add   significantly to employment in the Charleston region  Machine tool orders for the Southeast are   said to be up substantially over the past year  A director from central Maryland reports gains in   activities there  And the West Virginia energy sector continues to boom  Reports from retailers   December 13, 2011 61 of 198              in our District have improved quite noticeably in the past couple of months  At a gathering a   week and a half ago, a number of retailers were quite positive about holiday season sales based   on early results they had seen through the Thanksgiving weekend   On the less positive side of the ledger, housing remains depressed pretty much throughout   the District  Uncertainty about the magnitude and distribution of federal spending cuts continues   to weigh on business and commercial real estate in the DC area  And we have heard that   revenues at K Street lobbying firms are down significantly due to the end of earmarks, although   one could argue this actually belongs on the positive side of the ledger   On balance, I would say that our anecdotal reports line up pretty well with the national   data that show a pickup in growth since the first half of the year  Overall, the tone of reports is   noticeably less gloomy than in August, and for what it’s worth, we have even heard a couple of   references to green shoots  I have to explain to people, though, that that is likely to jinx the   recovery  [Laughter]  We shouldn’t do that   Inflation indicators from the Fifth District are somewhat mixed  Measures of current   price trends from our surveys have generally ticked back up in the past two months, as have our   wage trend measures  Expected price trends have come down in the past few months, but they   are still at or above the levels we generally saw from 2006 to 2008   At the national level, the Tealbook marks down 2012 growth by ¼ percent, essentially   due to the deteriorating outlook in European growth  I have no reason to question the staff’s   revision; it seems sensible to me  Such a forecast certainly gives one pause regarding downside   risk  This would not be the first time a contraction in one major trading area turned into a   broader downturn in global growth   December 13, 2011 62 of 198              Perhaps more noteworthy is the downward revision of ¾ percent to the Tealbook’s   projection for growth in 2013  I am not sure I fully understand the reasons behind the staff’s   revision, but 2½ percent for that year would not at all surprise me  Indeed, it seemed reasonably   plausible back in the late spring, before the recent weakening in Europe  Growth at that rate   would be consistent with the shift in our assessment that has taken place over the course of this   year, toward the notion that there are more-persistent impediments to growth   Another feature of the Tealbook projection is the imminent convergence of inflation to   around 1½ percent  Granted, we have seen very low inflation readings for the past couple of   months, and commodity and energy price trends appear to be quite favorable  But on a 12-month   basis, we are still much closer to 3 percent than to 2 percent   When we see several months of inflation above average, we are usually very careful to   give balanced consideration to the hypothesis that it is a transitory bulge in inflation versus the   hypothesis that it is a harbinger of a permanent acceleration  When we see below-average   inflation we need to be equally balanced  The current slowdown in inflation could just be   transitory, as was the acceleration we saw a year earlier  Thank you very much     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support Alternative B  I don’t see a case   for changing our policy stance at this meeting, and if the data come in reasonably close to what   the Tealbook is forecasting, it’s hard for me to see a case for changing policy at the next meeting   either   In the interest of time I won’t elaborate on this, but I have one comment about   communications  I think you did a service over the summer, Mr Chairman, by discouraging the   notion that monetary policy should be held solely responsible for the economic recovery  You   were wise to point to other nonmonetary factors restraining growth, and you succeeded in   reducing public expectations for us to act whenever growth disappoints  Going forward, we need   to reiterate that message because the downward revision in the medium-term growth trend   suggests a higher likelihood that growth will disappoint from time to time  One sign of the need   for continuing to discourage overinflated estimates of the potency of monetary policy appeared   on page 1 of the Wall Street Journal this morning  In an unfortunate and unfair article, it focused   on your legacy as Chairman, paid virtually no attention to inflation—apart from the brief passage   that President Evans just cited—and instead took the stance that unemployment and growth were   the sole relevant criteria for evaluating a central banker’s performance  Again, I think we need   to continue to explain that monetary policy has only limited capacity to stimulate real economic   growth in these circumstances   I agree with President Kocherlakota that the old B5 would be better than the new B5  I’m   reminded of questions I’ve heard many times about language change in this Committee  Why   are you changing it?  Why now do you change this language?  Have we not been following   financial developments?  The answer is we have been, and it will draw, as President   Kocherlakota suggests, unwarranted attention to financial market developments and their   December 13, 2011 101 of 198              influence on our policy  I’d be with President Kocherlakota in favoring the old version of B5    Thank you, Mr Chairman     Mr Chairman, you deserve a better birthday than you’ve had so far    [Laughter]  And in an attempt to contribute—     —to that end, I would like to suggest that the Federal Open Market   Committee, both members and participants [laughter], not to mention the accompanying staff,   sing you “Happy Birthday”  With your pleasure  Shall be begin?  [Singing and applause]     Now, isn’t that better, Mr Chairman?     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I think this proposed consensus statement is   a very healthy and constructive step forward for the Committee  It resolves some lingering   uncertainty about our framework and our objectives in a way that will enhance our credibility   and our flexibility as well down the road  It does a number of important and useful things  It   acknowledges our three-part legislative mandate  It states that we pursue these three objectives   December 13, 2011 135 of 198              in a balanced way  It sets out our numerical working definition of price stability  It notes that   clarifying our inflation goal can help us improve outcomes with respect to employment, and it   lays out why setting an explicit goal for maximum employment is not a good idea  It states that   deviations of inflation from our goal and of employment from maximum employment are what   guide policy, taking into account the complicated dynamics involved   The trickiest part of writing a statement like this is the part about employment and   unemployment  Paragraph 4 is not what I would write if I were holding the pen and describing a   statement of my framework for monetary policy  But I suspect that if I did that, it would produce   a statement that would not command universal agreement around the table  The subcommittee   document does manage to thread the needle and create a statement that I view as not in conflict   with the way I think about matters  In thinking about the views I’ve heard expressed about   employment and inflation and monetary policy over the years around this table, I can see how it   would be consistent with any other reasonable point of view about this   To be clear, for the record, I interpret maximum employment as corresponding to   something like the natural rate in a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model  Recognizing   that there are some degrees of freedom in how one chooses to define that in any given model, I   take it to correspond to something like the efficient level of output that would be ground out,   with a rate of employment that varies with virtually all the shocks that hit the economy from   period to period  This is a very different concept from the long-run unemployment rate that the   Summary of Economic Projections questionnaire asks us for  That is a rate to which   unemployment would converge under appropriate policy in the absence of shocks  After the   effects of all these shocks have worn off, it’s what we’re going to converge to in an ideal,   shockless, deterministic, steady state  There’s no reason, in my mind at least, that the two should   December 13, 2011 136 of 198              be identical, and it may not be obvious to the casual reader, but the subcommittee did a masterful   job of carefully not equating the two  It cites the SEP projection, but it doesn’t say that that’s the   same thing as maximum employment  It calls it longer-run normal employment, and that’s a   great device and the one that really creates the inclusiveness of this formulation  I should note   this isn’t literally maximum employment, but NAIRU isn’t literally maximum employment  We   see projections in which unemployment falls below NAIRU all the time  So we’re going to have   to take little liberties with that maximum part, and this statement does this in the right way  I   think we do have the latitude under the act to interpret maximum employment in the way that   makes the most economic sense to us and that construes the Congress’s objectives appropriately    We have the latitude to define price stability as 2 percent, even though some people might argue   that price stability means zero   I have three suggestions for improving the statement  In my view, these would all   preserve the inclusivity of this document  The first concerns paragraph 2  In the third sentence,   the phrase “at each point in time” appears in  “Therefore, the Committee’s policy decisions at   each point in time reflect its longer-run goals, its medium-term outlook, and its assessments of   the balance of risks”  The phrase “at each point in time” would have too strong a connotation of   purely discretionary period-by-period decisionmaking  It seems to imply that we let bygones be   bygones and don’t care about maintaining our credibility  I don’t think that’s how we actually   make policy because in practice we often find it necessary to take actions that are not time-  consistent  That is, they don’t maximize our objective, ignoring everything that’s happened in   the past  We do occasionally fight against what we’d like to do in the short run in order to   preserve or restore our credibility  There are numerous episodes of that over the past three   decades   December 13, 2011 137 of 198              Because monetary policy outcomes have to do with expectations about the future   monetary policy decisions that are made, the standard way of thinking about monetary policy is   in terms of rules  The standard way of operationalizing that is as an algebraic function that links   monetary policy instruments to assorted variables, but that’s an algebraic convenience    Monetary policy consists of a pattern of reactions to economic variables over time, and I view   our policy as consistent with that  It may seem like we come in here with a blank sheet of paper   every meeting and decide anew, but we’re doing that against the backdrop of what we know   markets think our pattern of reaction is  We take into account whether we’re going to be   consistent with this, not consistent with that, and whether an action is going to change market   perceptions about our pattern of reaction in the future  We take into account the direction and   magnitude of a change that might take place and how that would affect current outcomes today   and in the future   Earlier in the drafting process, I suggested a couple of sentences to add to paragraph 2 to   try and cast our policymaking as more rule-oriented, but without implying a strict adherence to   an algebraic formula or a predestination of any strong sort  My suggestion was to add at the end   of paragraph 2, “At the same time, prices and economic activity are influenced by expectations   regarding the future conduct of monetary policy  Therefore, Committee policy decisions over   time should form a consistent and well understood pattern of reaction to changes in economic   conditions”   Reflecting on that suggestion, it occurred to me that it’s tangential to the main point of   this document, which is to articulate an explicit inflation goal and explain how that relates to our   mandate  I came to understand a cogent rationale for omitting it  But at a minimum, we would   improve this passage if we deleted the phrase “at each point in time” In fact, an improvement on   December 13, 2011 138 of 198              that might be to substitute for “at each point in time” the word “consistently”  The sentence then   would say that the Committee’s policy decisions “consistently reflect its longer-run goals,” et   cetera   My second and third suggestions have to do with the first sentence of paragraph 3  It   says that we have “the latitude to specify a longer run goal for inflation”  I see two ways to   improve this  One is that, in this setting, the word “latitude” has a connotation similar to the   word “license” in that it sounds like we’re saying that the act allows us to do whatever we want    The way I think of it is that regardless of what the act says, we have the technical ability, that is,   it’s feasible for us to specify any longer-run goal for inflation  I don’t think the act authorizes us   to set any longer-range goal, but it would be better to have the word “ability” in there rather than   “latitude”   The other way it occurs to me to improve the sentence has to do with the following part    “The Committee has the latitude,” or ability, “to specify a longer-run goal for inflation”  We can   specify goals for whatever we want  We talked about this last time, the Red Sox post-season   success and the like  What’s really true is that we have the latitude to specify and achieve a   longer-run goal for inflation, so I’d suggest we add “and achieve” after “specify”  Those are my   suggestions, but I can sign onto the statement without those changes  Again, it’s a broad,   inclusive approach that masterfully spans the legitimate range of views we have about how we   are to think about operationalizing our goals   As for the dots, including our policy projection—it’s a great idea  I wonder though, why   not dots for all of them?  It seems opportunistic to only use dots here, because that makes us look   more dovish than we would if we just used the box, but I endorse including that  And I endorse   December 13, 2011 139 of 198              asking a question about the balance sheet to improve the exposition  I thank you very much, Mr   Chairman     Mr Chairman?     I want to clarify, in light of Governor Tarullo’s very thoughtful   comments, my intentions  I described the consistency of my interpretation with the draft  I view   it as intellectually dishonest for me to publicly claim that mine is the only interpretation  I have   talked in public about differences of views, and for me this provides a great framework for   describing those differences of views  I don’t want anyone to be left with the impression that my   intention was to publicly claim interpretive hegemony     Great  Thank you     I’m not sure what “losing market access” means  Do you mean they   wouldn’t like the price they’d get?     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’d like to follow up on the point that I think   President Lockhart was driving toward, and this was sparked in my mind reading the memo and   coming across the phrase “prevailing market prices” so many times  There are a number of   things in 1 to 5 where we’re doing things at prevailing market prices, and at issue are particular   October 16, 2013 29 of 50    CUSIPs where the payment has been delayed or defaulted in some way or another  The first   question that arises in my mind is whether our actions—our willingness to take them in RPs, or   whatever—would affect prevailing market prices  Now, if it wouldn’t, because the market for   those things is so large and ours is tiny, I’m wondering why we would do it  And if it would,   then I think there is this issue   There are a lot of different cases to piece out here, and I started thinking about this in   terms of what principles I’d start with, with this whole endeavor, to guide our choices  And one   of them is that we really ought to be ensuring monetary stability, in the sense that we’re   accommodating significant shifts in the demand for money, like we did on 9/11, where there was   a $100 billion shift in the demand for money in one day, and we accommodated it   But then I think—and Bill English mentioned this in his presentation and remarks—  preserving the measure of independence we won in 1951, and I mean specifically avoiding the   subservience of our monetary policy objectives to the Treasury’s financing needs, is important,   too  And I’m wondering whether intervening in a way that affects the relative price of the   defaulted CUSIPs would risk raising the appearance of our essentially buffering private-sector   market participants from the effects of the Treasury’s default  And while that’s not forbearance   that benefits the Treasury directly, it does, to some extent, insulate markets from the effect of its   action in a way that implicates the kind of issues that came up in ’51 and that Bill alluded to  So   I’m wondering, is there something in between our intervening in the way that 1 to 5 describe in   the CUSIPs that are defaulted and our staying away from those CUSIPs altogether?  If our   actions won’t affect prevailing market prices, and if we stay away that won’t affect prevailing   market prices, then I’m not sure what the value of our intervening in those CUSIPs is   October 16, 2013 30 of 50      If I could, Mr Chairman, follow up  I wasn’t basing this on the   assumptions of an Arrow-Debreu environment  I was just reacting to the staff who seem to be   asserting that our actions with regard to particular CUSIPs wouldn’t affect the prevailing market   price  There could be externalities, there could be operational issues that make that valuable, but   that is not really the case that the staff made on this  It was that it’s innocuous with respect to the   market value of these things, and so I’m sort of puzzled about the rationale to intervene and   whether there is some other way to go here with respect to these CUSIPs     Yes  I wanted to follow up on Governor Stein, and on this whole   6/7/8/9 question  For me, 7 is consistent with our broad monetary stability objectives  A broad   rise in RP rates, across the spectrum of red-zone and non-red-zone securities, would suggest an   increasing demand for liquidity that we’re ideally situated to supply  We did this on 9/11  We   just fixed the RP rate and offered to intervene at whatever quantity people wanted  Moreover,   we did this strange thing  We usually keep a spread between Treasury-only, agency, and MBS   RP rates, and we flattened that out and just took them all at the same rate  We were making a   judgment there that we were willing to squash those spreads  And the same question would arise   with regard to these “red-zone CUSIPs,” I guess we could call them  So, subject to the proviso   that there’s some delicacy about that, I’d support 7   The same for 6 too, I think, but “undesirable from a policy point of view” was a phrase   that had me scratching my head  I thought we wanted to get rates low, but the broader question   here has to do with transitory versus permanent, more persistent changes, because a rate that   spikes for a day or two is not going to really affect our monetary policy objectives in any   meaningful way  You know, we are thinking about things flowing through longer-term rates and   monetary policy being transmitted that way  Yes, some people would lose some money if rates   go up or down by a lot in one particular day or not  But I think it’s for something that’s expected   to persist for a couple of days that we would want to intervene  I don’t think we’d want to   intervene just for something that we were sure was only going to last a day  I think President   Kocherlakota’s comments are germane here, and I think going down this path is consequential   October 16, 2013 45 of 50    enough that I would like to see some check-in with the Committee on this  But I would be   willing to delegate if that’s the broad group’s view   About 8 and 9, I was going to use the phrase “beyond the pale”  Governor Stein invites   us to put ourselves in the position of a state of the world, ex post, in which things are really bad    And back to President Kocherlakota’s observation that our willingness to intervene in these red-  zone CUSIPs reflects an underlying assessment on our part that the government is not going to   default  Well, if this is a bad state of the world, like Governor Stein describes, there would be a   difference of views between us and members of the financial public on that  Otherwise, the price   declines would be arrested, and yields wouldn’t go up so much  So if it’s really a disaster for   those red-zone CUSIPs, it must be that a lot of the market participants don’t have the confidence   that President Kocherlakota suggests we should act on in buying these  I think that raises   delicate questions, and I don’t think that ex post is the sole perspective you want to consider that   from  I think you want to ask the question of, what do you want markets to think we are going to   do in that situation?  And you want to look at things from an ex ante perspective  This is sort of   a general proposition  From that point of view, it strikes me that Governor Powell’s   “loathsomeness” is really germane here  So I’m opposed to 8 or 9
