3  Thank you My presentation begins on the third page of the handout you  received   It seems that everybody is talking about house prices, and the upper panel of  your first exhibit shows why  House prices, adjusted for general inflation, have risen  at a rapid pace in recent years and did not even pause during the last recession  Indeed, the real rate of appreciation has increased, and the most recent readings have  been at annual rates greater than 7 percent  By comparison, the average annual  increase in real house prices during the past 30 years is only about 1¾ percent   The next two panels illustrate some of the eye-popping gains that have been  recorded in selected metropolitan areas  For example, as shown in the middle left  panel, real house prices increased about 16 percent in San Francisco and 30 percent  in Las Vegas during the four-quarter period ending in the first quarter; as shown to  the right, the most recent gain was 13 percent in New York and 20 percent in Miami     Rapid price appreciation has sparked debate about whether housing has become  overvalued, and the popular press is filled with stories suggesting that it has  As  summarized in the lower left panel, anecdotes suggesting that the housing market is  overheated include those about increased speculation, purchase decisions that are  perhaps too dependent on rosy assessments of future appreciation, and increased  reliance on novel forms of financing without full recognition of the associated risks    Although these anecdotes are suggestive, they do not provide a benchmark for  valuing housing  Two approaches that do provide a benchmark are listed to the  right  One is to ask if housing is affordable for a typical family  Some analysts have  argued that prices are too high relative to incomes, while others say low interest rates  have kept required monthly mortgage payments affordable  Another approach is to  ask if house prices are properly aligned with rents  I have pursued both approaches  in my research, and have concluded that rents provide a preferable benchmark for  valuing housing I will therefore focus my prepared remarks on this approach      As summarized in the upper left panel of your next exhibit, a strength of this  approach is that it employs a standard asset pricing framework, such as that often  used in studies of stock market valuation  In this framework, rental payments in the  housing market are analogous to dividends in the stock market  Seen this way, the                                                     June 29-30, 2005 5 of 234  price of a house should reflect the appropriately discounted stream of expected rents;  high prices could be justified by high rents or by low carrying costs, which include  interest payments, net taxes, and depreciation  But if prices appear unusually high  relative to rents and carrying costs, one might conclude that housing is overvalued     As highlighted to the right, I have implemented the framework using repeat- transactions price indexes from the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight  [OFHEO] and Freddie Mac and the tenants’ rent index from the consumer price  index  I made several adjustments to these series to address some of the  shortcomings of the published data  As you will see in Dick Peach’s presentation,  he and I disagree about the best way to measure house prices  I would be happy to  discuss the issue during the question period     That said, the red line in the middle panel shows the estimated price-rent ratio  for the stock of housing, and the black line shows the estimated real carrying cost of  housing The first point to note is that the measured price-rent ratio is currently  higher than at any earlier time for which we have data  Moreover, the run-up in  prices appears to be far greater than can be explained by carrying costs, at least if we  use the historical relationship between the two series as our guide  Although theory  suggests a tight link between carrying costs and the price-rent ratio, the data suggest  that the actual link is more tenuous  At the simplest level, while the price-rent ratio  is at a historical high, the carrying cost is not at a historical low  More formally,  regression analysis suggests that prices are about 20 percent too high given rents and  carrying costs      One might reasonably ask what this potential 20 percent overvaluation portends  for house prices  The lower panel summarizes the historical experience on this  question  The panel shows a scatter plot of the price-rent ratio (on the horizontal  axis) and changes in real house prices over the subsequent three years (on the  vertical axis); the panel also includes a fitted regression line  As I mentioned a  moment ago, carrying costs are only slightly correlated with the price-rent ratio   Thus, their effects can be excluded from the chart without materially affecting the  results   The downward slope of the regression line summarizes a key finding When  house prices have been high relative to rents, subsequent price changes have  typically been smaller than usual  For example, on the right side of the panel we can  see that in the second quarter of 1979, the price-rent ratio stood above 24, and real  prices decreased 7 percent during the subsequent three years  Near the other end of  the scale, in the third quarter of 1970 the price-rent ratio stood just above 19, and  real prices increased more than 5 percent during the subsequent three years   However, as is readily apparent from the chart, the relationship is loose  Most  notably, in the first quarter of 2002, the last observation for which we have a reading  for the subsequent three-year change in house prices, the price-rent ratio stood at 22   Although the regression suggests that real prices should have been about flat since                                                               June 29-30, 2005 6 of 234  then, real prices actually increased more than 20 percent, and the price-rent ratio rose  to about 27—literally off the chart     To give an impression of what has happened in local markets, the upper panel  of your next chart summarizes housing-market conditions for four metropolitan  areas  San Francisco, New York, Chicago, and Miami  The panel displays the  deviation of each city’s price-rent ratio from its long-run level in the second quarter  of 1979 (the red bars), the fourth quarter of 1989 (the black bars), and the first  quarter of 2005 (the green bars)  The numbers above the bars indicate their height   The first two episodes represent previous peaks of the price-rent ratio at the national  level The third episode is where we are now   The numbers below the red and black bars show the performance of real house  prices in each city in the three years following each episode  For instance, as shown  by the red bar, the price-rent ratio in San Francisco was 7 percent above its long-run  level in the middle of 1979  During the subsequent three years, real house prices  there fell 5 percent  At the end of 1989 (the black bar) the price-rent ratio in San  Francisco was 15 percent above its long-run level, and real prices there fell  12 percent during the subsequent three years  The most recent reading for San  Francisco indicates that the price-rent ratio is now further above its long-run level  than in either 1979 or 1989     The price-rent ratios suggest that housing is overvalued in the other three cities  as well, but to differing degrees  Although the price-rent ratio in New York is  elevated, housing does not look much more overvalued there than it did in the late  1980s  House prices appear elevated relative to rents in Chicago as well, but it is  Miami that stands out as the most overheated of the four markets shown here     The evidence that I have shown you so far suggests that rents provide a loose  tether for house prices; prices deviate from their long-run relationship with rents for  extended periods, but not indefinitely  However, to provide a forecast of house  prices, we must consider both the long-run relationship between prices and rents and  the short-run dynamics among prices and other economic factors  The middle left  panel of your exhibit lists several factors that affect real house-price dynamics in the  short run  In particular, the Board’s staff has found that a basic model should  include lagged changes in house prices, as well as changes in real income, real  carrying costs, and the unemployment rate  This basic model does not take a stand  on whether housing is overvalued  Alternatively, our error-correction model adds to  the basic model the lagged level of the price-rent ratio and the lagged level of  carrying costs  It therefore provides a formal way to model short-run dynamics  around a long-run equilibrium level  The estimated coefficient on the lagged price- rent ratio is negative, capturing the idea that there is a long-run relationship between  house prices and rents and that price changes are restrained when prices are high  relative to rents                                                                  June 29-30, 2005 7 of 234  The middle right panel shows the implications of these two models for the four- quarter percent change in real house prices at the national level during the  Greenbook forecast period  The basic model—in green—suggests that house prices  will decelerate in the coming two years, but that they will still rise faster than their  long-run average of about 1¾ percent per year  Thus, even a model that ignores the  long-run relationship between the levels of prices and rents predicts a slowdown in  house-price appreciation Still, housing would become slightly more overvalued  relative to rents at the end of the forecast period     The error-correction model—in red—calls for prices to decelerate more in the  coming two years, with real prices actually edging down a bit in 2006  In this  scenario, housing would be about 15 percent overvalued at the end of the forecast  period Note that the June Greenbook forecast—the black line—lies between the  two model simulations    To sum up, the statistical evidence that I have presented today provides support  for the view that the price-rent ratio can be a useful tool for summarizing housing  valuations  The price-rent ratio is currently very high by historical standards,  suggesting that housing might be overvalued by as much as 20 percent  Historical  experience suggests that the change in real house prices going forward will be  slower than in recent years  Unfortunately, the evidence cannot rule out either  further rapid gains in house prices for a time or a more rapid correction back to  fundamentals  Just as the price-dividend ratio is an imperfect tool for forecasting  stock prices, the price-rent ratio should be considered only a rough guide to  valuations in the housing market Thank you      Sir, I can address that a bit  Actually, Morris Davis, who is an economist   here at the Board, has written a paper on that very subject, and—      Just about a year ago, exactly    Okay I can tell something from the tone of your voice  [Laughter]  In any   event, the idea there was to look at house prices and construction costs and to try to back out as a   sort of mechanical operation—not an easy one—the value of the land  He shows that land prices   have increased very rapidly and that the land share of the property values has gone up over time  As   you mentioned, we know something about farm prices  But besides those two things, there really   aren’t—     Loosely speaking, what we’re trying to do is to get a sense of changes in the   price of a typical home—what has been happening to that price over time—adjusting for quality  I   guess I’ll start with my concerns about the constant-quality figure, and then I’ll address Dick’s   concerns about the transactions price index that I used   One reason I worry about the constant-quality number, and Dick alluded to it, is that it’s a   constant-quality price index for new homes, and new homes typically are not built where existing   homes are already situated  You can see that when you drive out of any city, basically  The big   developments are on the outskirts of the cities, and those outskirts are moving further out  I   recognize that cities can be multi-centered and so forth, but new homes—while not always built on   the cheapest available land—typically are built on the cheapest available land  And the constant-  quality price index for new homes has only crude controls for location  So I don’t think that index   is able to fully handle that issue  That’s why I like the repeat-transactions price index  As Dick   mentioned, it basically matches up addresses over time and looks at the price changes    Yes     Well, as Dick pointed out in his briefing, there are data on improvements    So I use those data and divide that by the stock of housing and subtract it off  But on the other side   of that argument is the fact that while many homes get additions made to them, all homes are also                                             June 29-30, 2005 27 of 234  deteriorating somewhat over time, which will bias things in the other direction  And we have data   on that  So, improvements are affecting price appreciation one way, and depreciation is affecting it   the other way  Once you take both into account, the net effect is only a few tenths a year  Now,   these things can cumulate over time, but I use data on improvements and on depreciation to remove   those biases from the published data  So, there are problems with the published data, but we don’t   have to make do with the published data   Likewise, there’s a transactions bias  Homes that appreciate more tend to transact more, and   that’s going to bias upward the published price index that I start with  But there are studies on the   size of this transactions bias  Dick provided some data on it  I’ve taken estimates of the size of this   transactions bias and removed it from the published data  So, I start with the published data, but I   make various adjustments  One last point is that because the price index is based on mortgages   purchased or securitized by the GSEs, it’s going to miss FHA and VA loans and also jumbo loans   There is a published private sector price index put out by Case and Shiller that actually goes   to deed-level data, and they look at all home purchases  They do a repeat-transactions method, but   they look at all purchases and throw out only refinancings and exchanges among families  That   index actually shows faster appreciation since 1999  That would seem to suggest that the homes   with jumbo loans may be appreciating faster and that by leaving out jumbos I am perhaps biasing   things down   So, my final takeaway from this is that there’s no perfect way to measure house prices  All   these measures have their various flaws  But I think that a properly adjusted repeat-transactions   price index—one that uses not just the published data but makes adjustments for the   shortcomings—is a better way to get a read on what’s going on in the housing market                                                     June 29-30, 2005 28 of 234    I think it varies substantially across locations  I think Morris found it to   have become quite high; he estimated that the number had moved up above 50 percent                                                  June 29-30, 2005 29 of 234    Right    Yes What you do is get the depreciation rate, and that’s relative to the   structure  It actually doesn’t make too much of a difference exactly how you do it  But, again, I got   land share numbers from Morris Davis, and one can basically tamp it down year by year     Yes My price series and my rent series are both indexes to start with, so   they are unit-less  Again, leaning on my colleague, Morris, we get a base-year estimate of rents for   a constant-quality unit We get the base-year dollar price and then multiply by that    Actually, it’s not  But it doesn’t make any difference  [Laughter]  I could   easily have done it with the owners’ equivalent rent, but I would have had to cut off all my pictures   in 1983 because that’s when that series begins  I went with the tenant rent strictly for the length of                                               June 29-30, 2005 31 of 234  the time series  But if you look at the relative levels of these two series over time, while the growth   rates do differ a little bit, you’re talking about really small potatoes—on the order of 2 percent     Absolutely  As an aside, but regarding that particular point, I’ve been   working one day a week at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and I have access to the confidential   underlying micro data that they use to build up the CPI  So, some of my work is trying to get at just   these types of criticisms  But from the underlying data, I have been able to look at rent appreciation   for different segments of the rental market, trying to see—with home ownership rates going up—   where the homeowner market is stealing, so to speak, from the rental market and how big the biases   are And it does look as if the higher end of the rental market has been showing somewhat smaller   rent increases over time, suggesting that that’s where it’s coming from, but not dramatically     Let me note just one last thing  The pictures are going to look the same as   those Dick showed, whether we look at house prices relative to income or to rent  So, even if the   rent series might have this problem or that problem—and it does have problems—house prices have   grown quite dramatically using the adjusted data that I used relative to incomes as well     We do have those data  There’s an index that gives price per square foot   and rent per square foot for apartments nationally and in various cities  And it shows a marked   increase in the price-rent ratio     It doesn’t go back as far—it only goes back to 1986—but since 1996, yes     It’s quite a steep increase     These apartment price data and rent data are by square footage  I guess I   could make a calculation, but I don’t have those data here     It’s basically a value-weighted measure     I’ll leave the monetary policy aspect to my colleagues  But let me make a   couple of points about land use restriction  Certainly, land use restrictions, environmental   restrictions, and those types of things have played a role in the rapid rise in house prices  That   certainly is a factor  I mentioned in my briefing that I like to compare house prices to rent—and this   is one of the reasons—as opposed to comparing them to incomes  If increased regulation boosts   house prices, people are just going to have to pay more out of their income for housing because of   the regulations put in place  But land use restrictions should affect rents as well  So, it should drive   up the cost of buying a home, and it should also drive up the cost of renting a home  It can be a   significant factor, but it should be in both of those elements   And this is somewhat of an aside, but I find it interesting  I talk to a lot of builders as part of   my day-to-day work here, and I’ve asked them about this very issue  They say definitely that land   use restriction is a big concern for them  But I also went back and looked at newspaper articles   written in ’86, ’87, ’88, and ’89, and it’s truly remarkable how the view back then was that housing   prices could never fall because, as people were saying left and right, there was no more buildable   land left due to environmental regulations and land use restrictions  They were saying that right up   to 1989 when house prices leveled out in nominal terms  I’m not saying these things aren’t real—   the builders say they are real—but they’re certainly not new though they may be new in their   effects  But just to get back to the point, I think they should be captured in the price and the rent   data    If you look at the housing affordability picture—basically relating house   prices and interest rates and income—it has been moving around in a fairly stable and favorable   area for the last, say, 8 to 10 years     As you know, mortgage rates have been moving up and down but on   balance they have flattened out a bit over the past few years, if you compare, say, 2003 to now  So   what has been happening over that time period is that affordability is edging down to the lower end   of the range in which it has fluctuated for a while  There’s nothing scary about it, but affordability   has been moving down Certainly, we can take this argument a little further  If mortgage rates stay   pretty stable and disposable income keeps rising at reasonable rates, affordability is going to start   looking worse and worse if we keep getting the house-price gains that we’ve been seeing  That’s   not necessarily an argument for overvaluation or undervaluation  But it is an argument for the view   that the recent increases in house-price gains are not sustainable  If rates flatten out, affordability   will start to deteriorate fairly significantly    If rates flatten out; that’s because we would not be getting a kick any more   from lower rates  House prices can go up and housing remains affordable if rates are lower  But if   they flatten out and stay flat, one might think that it’s going to be hard for house-price gains to keep   humming along the way they’ve been going  That’s going to start to eat into affordability     I’m sorry, then                                                June 29-30, 2005 52 of 234    It’s going to make housing significantly—     I certainly wouldn’t want to say the breaking point is here or there  But   again, going back to some of the conversations I’ve had with homebuilders, for what it’s worth, they   indicate that they’re not going to be too worried unless we see an increase—and one that occurs   fast—on the order of 100 basis points    Yes, but that’s based just on talking to some builders, as opposed to any   firm statistical analysis  So I would be very cautious  I would certainly hesitate to draw a firm   conclusion about a particular increase being a tipping point or a breaking point    Did you want to start on rents?  That will give the others some time to think                                     June 29-30, 2005 55 of 234  I’ve looked at the rent side of the picture  As to this idea that perhaps prices are getting too   high relative to rents, I’d argue that they’re going to come back in line  Now, maybe rents are going   to be doing some of the correcting, as it were  The work that I’ve done gives just a little hint of   evidence that maybe rents do a bit of the correcting  So, what we might see going forward is rent   growth slightly higher than it otherwise would have been  But statistically speaking, it’s basically   no different from zero  Statistically, it doesn’t look like rents do any of the correcting  What really   seems to be happening is that rents go up at some rate determined by economic conditions and then   prices move around them     I do not, certainly not with respect to the rents  I would like to say also that   I agree with the comments that financial innovations could very well be a justifiable reason for   house prices to be higher than usual relative to other prices  I do think some things are different   But I don’t see anything to suggest that we have to be worried about rental inflation and, as a result,   overall inflation     That is my opinion on the matter  If you put a new home into place on a   plot of land and follow that over time, the value of the structure might rise, reflecting an   improvement to the house, or it might deteriorate  But as for the land, once the house is built, it falls   into existing house land That’s what it is from then on  And if the value of that package of land   and structure is going up and you think the value of the structure is not, it’s coming in through the   land   If you flip to the very last page of the handout, page 33, the lower panel shows levels of the   repeat transactions prices in red, levels of the constant-quality price index for new homes in green,                                                  June 29-30, 2005 71 of 234  and an estimate of construction costs  That basically reflects the cost of a bundle of construction   materials over time—a certain amount of lumber, a certain amount of—    If you look at the pattern of the green line, the constant-quality and the cost   line move roughly together  Obviously, the constant-quality price index has increased more rapidly   recently, because that index does capture partially, I think, increases in land prices  But I think that   the gaps between the three lines are telling us quite a bit about what’s going on with regard to the   price of land sitting under the entire stock of housing       There’s a difference between refusal and inability  [Laughter]     Well, that’s exactly what Morris Davis—    Absolutely  As I said, this is what I think is going on  In my view, that’s   what is capturing land prices     In my prepared text, no, I didn’t  But I can go over them briefly  Would   you like me to—                                              June 29-30, 2005 72 of 234    Yes I made an adjustment for improvement rate and depreciation rate    And there are actually two types of transaction biases I made adjustments for  One is the fact that   homes that have greater appreciation tend to transact more and, therefore, they show up more in the   repeat transaction database  So I made an adjustment for that  Also, two economists at OFHEO   wrote a paper showing that there’s another kind of bias—basically the high-end homes tend to   appreciate faster than the low-end homes—and that’s biasing the OFHEO as well  So I made an   adjustment for that  Those are the three main adjustments that I made to the repeat transactions   price data
