8351,2008-01-29,"  Thank you  To support the Financial Stability Forum’s  Working Group on Market and Institutional Resilience, as noted in the top panel of  exhibit 8, supervisors from France, Germany, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and  the United States formed the “senior supervisors group” in late October  Participating  US supervisors included the OCC and SEC as well as the Federal Reserve  The  group’s goal was to develop a common understanding, through a series of interviews  with selected firms, of how the risk-management systems of core financial institutions  performed during the financial market turbulence  The top right panel of exhibit 8  shows the 11 banking firms that supervisors interviewed  This effort was not a  complete review of all firms and events  For example, we did not meet with Bear  Stearns or Morgan Stanley as part of this effort  Rather, it was designed to inform  supervisory authorities about the general effectiveness of risk management at global  financial institutions  The supervisors have prepared a paper detailing their findings,  which will be conveyed to the FSF and released publicly  The bottom panel lists  some observations about the firms’ overall performance  Most large financial  services firms, while affected by market developments, generally avoided significant  losses  Although most firms’ risk-management processes worked as intended, there  were some definite outliers  Some firms recognized the emerging additional risks and  took deliberate actions to limit or mitigate them  Others recognized the additional  risks but accepted them  Still other firms did not fully recognize the risks in time to  mitigate them adequately  Moreover, the risk-management practices varied by firm  and by strategy, as did the range of outcomes to date  I should note that the primary  risk-management weaknesses observed here are not new  They have been observed  in past episodes and are thoroughly discussed in existing risk-management literature  and supervisory guidance       As noted in the top panel of exhibit 9, the senior supervisors group identified four   primary factors that differentiated the organizations that suffered larger losses from  those that did not (1) the effectiveness of senior management oversight of balance  sheet, liquidity, and capital positions; (2) the effectiveness of communications among  senior management, business lines, and risk-management functions; (3) the  sophistication, diversity, and adaptability of risk measures utilized; and (4) the  attention devoted to valuation issues  With respect to senior management oversight,  as indicated in the bottom panel of exhibit 9, the more effective firms were more  disciplined in measuring and limiting these risks in advance of the crisis and proved  to be more agile in reducing exposures or hedging when the crisis occurred  These  firms focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet with strong capital and liquidity  positions throughout the entire organization  Senior management of these  organizations had established adequate capital and liquidity buffers that could sustain  the firm through a period without access to the market for funding  They have  created and effectively enforced internal pricing mechanisms, capital allocation  methodologies, and limits that provided effective incentives for individual business  line managers to control activities that might otherwise lead to significant balance  sheet growth or contingent liquidity demands  Conversely, the less effective firms  were not as focused on the overall strength of their balance sheet across all legal  entities and thus operated with more limited liquidity and capital buffers  These   January 29–30, 2008 184 of 249    organizations had weaker controls over their balance sheets and were more focused  on earnings growth or defense of a market leadership position  These firms did not  have limit structures that were consistently or effectively enforced, which allowed  business lines to grow balance sheet exposures rapidly and increase contingent  liquidity exposures  They did not properly aggregate or monitor off-balance-sheet  exposures across the organization, including the exposure to contingency back-up  lines of credit to ABCP programs and generally did not have in place effective  financial controls, including capital allocation processes, commensurate with the  business strategy      The top panel of exhibit 10 provides additional detail on the importance of   effective communications among senior management, business lines, and risk- management functions  The more effective firms emphasized a comprehensive,  firmwide, consolidated assessment of risk  Senior managers of these organizations  were actively engaged and had in place a disciplined culture and well-established  processes for routine discussion of current and emerging risks across the business  lines, risk management, and the corporate treasury function  Senior managers at these  organizations collectively made decisions about the firm’s overall risk appetite,  exposures, and risk mitigation strategies rather than relying solely on the judgment of  business lines  They were able to effectively leverage the assessment of risks from  one business line to consider how subprime exposures, for example, might affect  other businesses  As a result, the more effective firms had a more timely and well- informed perspective on how market developments could unfold  In some cases,  senior management had almost a year to evaluate the magnitude of the emerging risks  from subprime mortgages on its various business lines  This, in turn, enabled them to  implement plans for reducing their exposures while it was still practical and more  cost effective to do so  Conversely, less effective firms were siloed, did not  effectively share information across business lines on emerging risks, and were  comparatively slower in taking actions to mitigate exposures as each business line  had to assess and consider emerging risks on their own without the benefit of views  or actions taken by other business line managers       With regard to the risk measures utilized, as shown in the bottom panel, the more   effective firms used a wide range of risk measures and analytical tools to discuss and  challenge views on credit and market risk broadly across different business lines  within the firm in a disciplined fashion  These firms have thought more thoroughly  about the interplay of their risk measures than the other firms and used a combination  of different risk measures and scenario analysis to understand risk exposures  It also  appears that the more effective firms had committed more resources to risk- management and management information systems  As a result, they had more  timely and scalable management information systems and in large part did not have to  create new management reports to understand risks and exposures  Conversely, the  less effective firms were too dependent on a single quantitative risk measure, and they  did not utilize scenario analysis in their decisionmaking and tended to apply a  “mechanical” risk-management approach  Management information systems also   January 29–30, 2008 185 of 249    were not as scalable, and there was a need to develop a number of ad hoc reports to  help senior management understand the risks and exposures of the company       The top panel of exhibit 11 elaborates on the fourth factor that proved critical,   which is the attention devoted to valuation issues  The more effective organizations  were more disciplined in how they valued the holdings of complex or potentially  illiquid securities  They employed more-sophisticated valuation practices and had  invested in the development of pricing models and staff with specialized expertise   These organizations were skeptical of and less reliant on external ratings and  emphasized mark-to-market discipline in their businesses in ways that others did not   Less effective organizations in some cases did not have key valuation models in place  prior to the market disruption, relied heavily on third-party views of risk, and tended  to have a narrower view of the risks associated with their CDO business as mainly  being credit risk and did not actively seek market valuation information  The bottom  panel explains how supervisors are planning to address the specific deficiencies  As I  mentioned earlier in my presentation, the risk-management deficiencies identified  during this exercise are not new, and existing supervisory guidance addresses these  issues  Therefore, supervisory efforts will include addressing risk-management  deficiencies at each company through the supervisory process and re-emphasizing the  importance of strong, independent risk management through a series of speeches,  industry outreach, and possible re-issuance of existing guidance  In addition,  supervisors plan to complete the work already under way within the Basel Committee  on Bank Supervision to update liquidity risk management guidance to strengthen  industry practices  A review of existing Federal Reserve guidance on market and  liquidity risk management is under way to ensure that it effectively outlines the need  for banks to use a number of tools to include multiple ways of viewing quantitative  and qualitative risk analysis, including VAR, stress tests, and scenario analysis   Finally, supervisors plan to develop, on an interagency basis, guidance related to the  management of the originate-to-distribute model to ensure that banking organizations  effectively manage the credit, market, and operational risks of this activity  I will  now turn it over to Art Angulo to discuss related regulatory policies      I might add one thing to that  In interviews we did with some firms, one   point that they made was that stress testing was informative and important, but a next step they’re   trying to take is what it would take to cause that stress event to happen for different types of assets    So they are trying to anticipate—not so much that they just assume a 10 percent drop but how they   would get to a 10 percent drop  What would be the events that would cause that to happen?  Then   they think that through in a more systematic way  I know some companies have learned what their   highly rated things are that are viewed as stable-value assets elsewhere on their balance sheets and   are thinking about how those could start to unwind or to deteriorate   January 29–30, 2008 191 of 249     I might add that we are trying to look at this  It’s not just an issue of   guidance, but we are going back through the supervisory process in terms of what we’ve learned   through these interviews and challenging our beliefs and prior assessments  "
