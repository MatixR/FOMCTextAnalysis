8325,2008-09-16,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  In our forecast, we do show a downgrade in   real activity in the near term since the August meeting  Downside risks to the economy we see as   September 16, 2008 54 of 108    still very considerable, and I would probably say that they really have increased quite a bit  I’ll say   a few more words about that  I’ll also talk about the inflation front  We have long thought that   inflation in the medium term will moderate, and we’ve been taking some comfort from recent   developments that have been cited already   On the weaker economic outlook, we see the intensification of adverse growth coming from   many things mentioned already  the unemployment rate increase and the likelihood that consumer   spending is going to be negative  I would put great stress also on indications that world demand is   slowing abruptly, as Nathan mentioned  I think that all three of these things are occurring in an   environment in which we have massive correction, adjustment, structural change in autos, housing,   and financial intermediation  That adjustment is really interconnected—one has effects on the   others  As part of this—particularly in the financial sector, I would say—in our senior loan officer   survey we’ve seen indications that, even as rates in, say, the mortgage markets start to ease a bit,   nonprice terms may still be tightening  President Pianalto talked about other areas in which   borrowers are facing much tougher terms  As financial institutions feel their capital is   constrained—and there’s plenty of evidence that balance sheets are constrained across much of the   financial sector—those kinds of nonprice rationing measures probably will become more evident    Second, as we discussed earlier, we’ve seen that credit losses, which thus far have been largely   confined to the financial sector and increasingly their shareholders, run some risk of spilling over to   other kinds of investors, who to date really have not felt that impact, such as money market fund   investors, as mentioned earlier  In addition, the three big corrections that we have seen in autos,   housing, and financial intermediation are not limited to the United States  In particular, as you   know, several G-10 countries are facing very difficult situations in their housing markets, not much   different from us; and the financial intermediation adjustment is truly a global correction   September 16, 2008 55 of 108    On the inflation side, as I mentioned, we have acknowledged that we’ve seen elevated rates   of inflation  But the recent developments—as we’ve seen in inflation expectations discussed earlier,   in energy and other commodity prices, the unit labor cost developments that President Yellen   discussed, and the year-over-year changes in import prices—are all pointing in the direction of some   moderation of inflation and moderation of inflation expectations  In particular, we have looked at   inflation expectations as measured by financial markets and feel that the decline that we see in those   expectations cannot be explained simply by the drop in energy prices and technical factors but look   larger than that  We would attribute that to indications, again, that global demand is slowing   Coming into this meeting today, we favor alternative B  I would associate myself with the   comments of President Stern and President Evans, that if we were, in fact, going to make a move   today, it would be better to make a large move of 50 basis points  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
8411,2008-12-15,"  Thank you  Again, I’d also like to thank the staff for the excellent notes    It’s useful to start out with our near-term goals, as most of us have done, to provide stimulus and   support for the economic recovery and to prevent too large a fall in inflation  The root problems, I   think, are worth focusing on for a second  insufficient global demand, hurdles to economic activity   from a severely impaired financial system, and as I’ll report tomorrow, behavior that is influenced   by confusion and fear among businesses and households that are tending to reinforce the downward   trend of the economy   December 15–16, 2008 79 of 284    That environment, I think, gives us some goalposts to look for in terms of framing the   strategy  I find very appealing Marvin Goodfriend’s characterization of the duality of the central   bank’s policy  We have a monetary and what he calls a credit policy at the same time  In normal   times setting the fed funds rate influences financial conditions, especially credit markets, in a fairly   predictable manner, and this Committee from time to time has discussed where overnight rates and   financial conditions have diverged  In these times, we’re observing a major disconnect between   overnight rates and financial conditions that is reflected in huge spreads but also in a lack of   transactions and in nonprice rationing in markets   So coming back to the question of what some of our goals are  To address the problems that   we see, communication is really the essential element, and we should be aiming for maximum   impact in whatever actions we take and also in our communications  I think, therefore, that we   should bring rates down now as far as we think we can take them  But the more important decision   is articulating what we are going to do going forward, why we are doing it, how long we are   planning to do it, and under what conditions we would stop doing it  Some of the confusion that is   out there about what the Federal Reserve has been doing reflects the fact that our operations really   cover two very different kinds of things  On one side we are expanding liquidity and supporting the   recovery of financial markets by the CPFF, the MBS purchases, and the upcoming TALF  In other   facilities we are preventing catastrophic market outcomes through asset disposition, such as the   Bear Stearns transaction, AIG, and the recent transaction we’ve had with Citi  In addition, there are   a lot of technicalities and legalities to these facilities that make it hard for the general public to   understand what we are doing  So more fundamentally we need to communicate what we want to   accomplish, and that importantly involves our commitment to price stability, as many have said here   December 15–16, 2008 80 of 284    in the sense of keeping prices in the medium term rising in line with our 1½ to 2 percent preference,   and our commitment to a resumption of sustainable economic activity   When I turn to look at what kind of facilities we should be thinking about going forward,   once interest rates are down to their minimum level, there are really a few things that I would   highlight  First, in many ways we could influence expectations about short-term policy rates   through our long-term debt purchases, as many have said  In particular, when we try to lean against   expectations expressed in the yield curve that rates are going to rise soon, and we’re seeing some of   that today, we can intervene in markets that directly affect major elements of aggregate demand, and   I would see that as a very important role of our agency MBS program and also the CPFF to address   where firms are really being starved of working capital  Because of its structure, the TALF   provides a very broad umbrella under which we could do intervention, again, where we see credit   markets failing and economic activity impeded by the lack of finance of a wide variety  I think that   we should look at the CPFF and the TALF more as backstop facilities that provide the credit we   need but also build in a kind of exit strategy so that, when spreads come down, there is an   opportunity for the market basically to tell us, “You can wind this down now”   We need to communicate the criteria by which we are choosing these markets  We have   mentioned these three big market segments  I think simpler is much better than having something   that’s very complicated or having many, many facilities  As part of this, the crucial thing is to   provide to the marketplace some kind of conditional commitment  If we don’t feel that we’re ready   yet for the inflation target, certainly between this meeting and the next we really need to think about   what kind of conditional commitment we could make—what conditions in the marketplace would   lead us to feel that our work was largely done   December 15–16, 2008 81 of 284    I would also note, though, that the historical notes made the excellent point that the risk is   that we withdraw stimulus too quickly—that we believe the patient is healing when, in fact, the   patient is merely stabilized  So our commitment must be both ambitious in its level and compelling   as it is communicated to the public  I think we need to return to the expository approach that the   Fed and then-Governor Bernanke took during 2002 and 2003, by which we carefully laid out the   elements, the foundation, and the expected outcomes of our approach in that period  As valuable as   it was in 2002-03, it is even more valuable today, when confusion and anxiety are shaping behaviors   that will amplify the downward forces in the economy  I also endorse the recommendation that   many have made to think about a press conference  The need for reassuring communication to the   public is, I think, very great   I would add two more thoughts  Of course, it is really crucial that we are coordinating our   policy with Treasury, and there are many ways in which we do that today—certainly, we need   coordination of fiscal and monetary policy  I frankly would like to see more of our asset-disposition   activities taken on by the US government so that it would be easier for us to describe the facilities   that we have as supporting the market and restoring market functioning  I also believe, as I’m sure   that many of you do, that we will probably need some kind of agreement with the Treasury vis-à-vis   our exit strategy  I particularly underline the real possibility, which several have mentioned here,   that we may want to raise interest rates well before the markets are really fully healed or fully   sustainable by themselves  We’ll need to be able to negotiate that in the sense of both the path we   take and the understanding we have with the fiscal authorities   Then just to conclude here, I also very much want to endorse the point that President   Rosengren made about needing to fix the banking system and doing it sooner rather than later    There really is no ability for the economy to function without a strong banking system  Certainly I   December 15–16, 2008 82 of 284    believe that you are hearing, as I am, of many instances in which the rationing that is going on   through the banking system right now is reaching a destructive potential  In that kind of world, I   think we need to turn our attention to that  The Federal Reserve is one of the most important   supervisors in our country and in the world, and I think we can do a lot to lead to the very tough   actions that need to be taken there  Thank you     Thank you  I thought I would make a couple of points that underscore   the substantial increase in the downside risks that we incorporated into the forecast that you all   received on Friday  That change was really encouraged by our economic advisory panel, which   suggested that the downside risks were much larger than we were estimating at the end of   November   First, we have been meeting, as of course all of you do, with small business people  Bill   Dudley put a panel of investors together, too, and I have a couple observations out of that and our   discussions with community bankers  One is that the cutbacks in financing are very real  There is a   December 15–16, 2008 127 of 284    lot of evidence that the banks are going in and looking at lines and cutting them back to both   investors and the small-business community  The small business community is also on the   receiving end of much tighter financial management at their larger customers—that is, the people   they’re supplying—as those firms are not paying their bills or are extending the terms on which they   pay their bills to a much greater number of days  That has induced a hunkering-down mentality on   the part of the small business owners  The other sobering thing they pointed out to us—and this is   very much in line with Governor Duke’s comments about the community banks yesterday; we hear   the same thing—is that small businesses and the community banks can hold out for a while but not   forever; margins are getting squeezed, and financing is getting squeezed  The precautionary actions   that the small businesses are taking will help them for a while, but they can’t hold out for more than   six or nine months   That is a particularly sobering statement for us in the Second District because, despite the   fact that we are at the epicenter of the financial industry in New York—a major driver for the   Second District economy—we have only just barely started to feel the effects of layoffs and   reductions in activity in the city  Our regional leading indicator index went down very, very sharply   in the month of October, but that is still to be realized in the economy  In particular, when we have   looked at past episodes, the declines in incomes that we have suffered in the region have ranged   between 4 percent and 10 percent in the financial industry when we actually get into one of these   adverse periods  That decline is usually spread over three or four years, so we are really talking   about something that could last a good bit longer than six to nine months in our District   Second, we do a survey of inflation expectations that is in many ways similar to the   Michigan survey, and our survey results are almost completed and are very similar to those of the   Michigan survey  But we do ask one question that isn’t asked there, and that is about the longer   December 15–16, 2008 128 of 284    run—that is, the 2010-11 outlook for prices and inflation  From that we can impute a risk of   deflation, which was 6 or 7 percent in early October and is now 12 percent  So that risk of deflation   seems to be growing even in the kind of population that is surveyed by the Michigan folks  Thank   you     Yes, thank you  Like others, I see the circumstances as requiring the   most action we can take  Therefore, I would favor alternative A somewhat over alternative B, but I   could live with either  I think that alternative A has the advantage, which President Bullard   described and others have referred to, that it does signal a significant change in what we’re doing   and draws attention to it  If anything, it probably provokes more dialogue with us as a central bank,   which I think at this point is a good thing   Turning to the next paragraph, I’m a bit concerned that inflation is, in fact, moderating very   quickly  This morning’s number for the total CPI is 11 percent  That would lead me to ask   whether we are expecting inflation to moderate or are, in fact, seeing inflation moderating  This   point is similar to President Stern’s  That would also lead me to leave in the bracketed point about   the future and the concern there because I think it’s better if we put it on the table than have people   say, “Don’t they see that as a problem?”  To that end, I also want to endorse the kind of broad   strategy statement that President Lockhart put forward  I actually came into the meeting with a very   similar sentence from my staff, really talking about what our goal is  I think it does help to set the   stage for what follows here, and this was a focus on improving conditions in financial markets or   financial intermediation and ensuring a recovery in output and maintaining low inflation     I think that President Lockhart was proposing that it follow paragraph 2,   perhaps in its own paragraph  We would raise the question of the risk of too low inflation but then   have the next paragraph really speak to what our goals would be, and I thought the sentence that you   had sounded good     Then continuing with this, I would comment on the next paragraph  I’m   very sympathetic to the idea that President Lacker was putting forward—that we somehow need to   talk about our expectations about the size of the balance sheet  I was going to offer one suggestion    Perhaps for the “entail the use of” phrase in the first sentence of paragraph 4 we could substitute   “sustain the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet at very high levels”—something that would   indicate that we expect the balance sheet to remain really large but doesn’t talk about whether we’re   increasing it from today  Just a thought  I would leave in the sentence on the longer-term   Treasuries in large part because we have already talked about it publicly and the language here gives   us the opportunity to evaluate and does not necessarily commit us to those purchases in the future    In any case, we would need to explain whether or not we’re going to purchase longer-term   Treasuries, having raised it already   On the directive, I would say that I am comfortable with the directives as written  There   might be room, if we found the right language for the size of the balance sheet, for inserting that   sentence in here, for example, whatever we take from the first sentence of paragraph 4  I also think   that, as part of this monitoring that the System Open Market Account Manager and the Secretary   will provide for the Committee, there really is the opportunity to develop much better disclosure of   what the Committee is doing, what our balance sheet looks like, and what actions we’re taking—  some kind of ongoing monitoring that could be shared with the public that I think would also be   very helpful in explaining what the Federal Reserve is actually pursuing in the near term and what it   is doing with the balance sheet   I was really impressed by something that President Lacker said yesterday, which is that—  and I paraphrase—we are in uncharted waters but we are groping our way forward  I think that it is   a great metaphor for where, in fact, we are  Some of these questions—such as what specific   December 15–16, 2008 198 of 284    forward-leaning language we’d like to put in our statement over time and how we think about the   monetary base versus the credit policy type of actions that we’re taking—are all things that I think   we will continue to learn about and explore  What I had put forward is that, as we come to   understand them better, we have an opportunity to communicate with the public and help them   understand better what we are, in fact, doing  Thank you very much     I think that, if we see the risk of institutional factors, like the way the   prime rate is linked to rates, really getting in the way of good policy, we have an obligation to work   with the banking community, work with other regulators if necessary, and work with the SEC if   necessary to clear those institutional obstacles  So I wouldn’t let the institutional things be   something that gets in our way, rather they would be something that we can really help overcome   where we see problems  That link could be changed, and we may want to work actively with the   banking community to make sure that it happens  "
8437,2009-01-16,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I believe it would be very helpful under the   current circumstances to adopt an explicit numerical objective for medium-term inflation of   2 percent for PCE inflation, given the real risk of deflation and the likelihood that deflation fears   will become an important part of the public’s concerns about the steep global downturn that we are   now in  In some ways, as many have noted, it would be a small step  The analyst community and   much of the public already believe that we have an implicit objective of 1½ to 2 percent, and our   effective reaction function probably also reflects that  We could emphasize that continuity with our   past practice if we adopt such an objective  But it is also a large step, as the Chairman himself noted   at the start of the discussion  The implications of such an explicit objective in the current   circumstances for our behavior are very important and not necessarily easy to explain—for   example, that we would be willing to accept some inflation above our objective for some time—and   really requires a carefully crafted speech or even a series of speeches, as well as that political   dialogue I note again that, much as the Chairman’s speech earlier this week really laid out what our   current monetary strategy is, such a speech or series of speeches could be very useful                 January 16, 2009 51 of 69  What would give that kind of education campaign real power is a unified FOMC behind the   speech  Being unified means a wholehearted endorsement and a consistent message from all of us   about the explicit objective, right down to the chosen number  The normal, healthy debate during   benign times can produce great anxiety in stressful times like these, and it would be a large step   because, to be effective, this move could not be portrayed as temporary or until the crisis seems to   lift  It would be a real advance in our practice, consistent with where we have been headed to   date—others have noted this in a discussion earlier on this same topic—and also where overall   central bank practice has been heading  Of course, it would be correct to evaluate the success of   such an objective sometime down the road   I would also like to see us keep it simple for the most effective communication, as many   have noted  So I would see that as a medium-term objective of around 2 percent for the PCE;   inflation at a flexible horizon, and here we would be thinking on the longer end of medium, as   President Yellen described it, maybe leading into the longer term; and overall inflation, not core    We do have a lot invested in PCE as what we believe is the right inflation measure, and I would   advise continuing  We would have an opportunity to relate that PCE inflation target to an   equivalent in the CPI—for example, a CPI of 2½ percent with a PCE inflation target of 2   If we go ahead with long-term projections, which I would recommend, an explicit objective   obviates the need for participants’ long-term forecasts of inflation because in the medium term we   would all be working toward and would expect to meet the shared objective  In such a framework,   though, participants’ views on the long-run values of GDP growth and unemployment would be of   great use to the public  Thank you  "
