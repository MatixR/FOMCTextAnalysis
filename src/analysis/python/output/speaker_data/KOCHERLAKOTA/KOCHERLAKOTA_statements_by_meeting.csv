8654,2009-11-03,"  Thanks a lot  I am honored to be here    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I want to begin by thanking the   Chairman for his generous introduction yesterday  It is an incredible honor to be a participant in   this discussion, and I am looking forward to working with all of you, both today and in the   meetings to come   In the Ninth District, real economic activity is stable but subdued  Unemployment did   fall considerably in Minnesota from August to September, from 8 percent to 73 percent, and        November 3–4, 2009 96 of 201  Minnesota has a majority of the population in the Ninth District  However, unemployment   remained elevated in the rest of the District, although I should say that unemployment has been   low in the Ninth District relative to national averages elsewhere, except in the upper peninsula of   Michigan   The information from our directors about their local communities is consistent with this   mixed picture  Our directors report that our consumers remain cautious about spending  One   reported that shipping was dormant in Duluth through much of the summer before picking up in   late September, which, if you are familiar with Duluth, you know is very late in the shipping   season for them  The directors generally agreed that things had stopped getting worse, but they   also agreed that they did not actually see them getting that much better   Nationally, an advance estimate of third-quarter GDP growth was better than expected at   3½ percent  This increase followed four quarters of negative growth  As a consequence, output   is well below its trend levels, if we assume that trend grows at 3 percent per year beginning in   the fourth quarter of 2007 Of course, 2007 represents a peak, so you may not want to draw your   trend line from that point  Given that, it is worth noting that output remains well below a   3 percent trend line that begins at the end of the 2000–01 recession  The Greenbook predicts that   GDP will rise 39 percent per year over the next two years  Based on our Minneapolis model’s   forecast, I believe that prediction is optimistic, if anything  But even if it were right, GDP will   be well below this 2000–01 trend line of 3 percent through the end of 2011  Of course, it is an   important question whether this discrepancy is attributable to a fall in the efficient level of output   or to the effect of price and wage rigidities  I will leave that question open  Unemployment has   stabilized in the past three months  However, it remains extremely high by historical standards     November 3–4, 2009 97 of 201  at nearly 10 percent I agree with the Greenbook that it will remain elevated through 2011  The   employment–population ratio remains at a 25-year low   There is good news Inflation remains low  Inflation expectations, as measured by Blue   Chip forecasts or TIPS spreads, also remain low  However, I am concerned about a tail risk in   inflation The size of government debt held in the private sector has increased over 30 percent in   the past two years  There is a positive probability that fiscal imbalances of this kind will give   rise to significant inflationary pressures  The news is also good in financial markets  Spreads in   the interbank lending market have tightened considerably  The spread between jumbo mortgage   loans and conforming mortgage loans remains elevated but has fallen sharply since the first part   of the year House prices are stabilizing and, if you believe the Case–Shiller numbers, may   actually be rising in much of the country    So, overall, I would say the real side of the economy is recovering somewhat  The trend   in GDP is well below historical norms, unemployment is well above historical norms, and this   characterization seems likely to continue well into 2011  Inflation is under control and is   expected to remain so, although the size of the government debt remains a possible large risk    Financial markets continue to improve, and I see them as being much stronger than a year ago    Thank you, Mr Chairman    Basically, when you have large government debt, as you   know, there are going to be two ways to pay it off  There is a third way, which is not to pay it        November 3–4, 2009 98 of 201  off [Laughter] But let’s keep to the two ways of paying it off  One is to pay it off by real tax   collections, and the other way is to monetize I think private markets will be concerned about   whether or not we will be monetizing, and that will influence inflation expectations and the   realization of inflation    Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Ninth District economic   conditions are only slightly changed from September  Nationally, economic conditions are only   slightly different from what was forecast in the September Greenbook  Given these observations, I   believe that the FOMC should follow a policy that is consistent with its statement in September, that   is, alternative B   I’m sympathetic to President Lockhart’s concerns about the change in language—about   becoming more specific about what economic conditions mean  I’m not sure what has changed   economically since September for us to make those changes in wording, and I’m worried that   market participants might be trying to figure out what we have seen to make us make those changes    I was very happy to see and impressed by the thoughtful discussion in the Bluebook about future   scenarios and language  I think we need to do more of that going forward   I was concerned, like many others around the table, that the discussion seemed to de­  emphasize the use of asset sales as part of our exit strategy, and my own view is that we should be   considering such sales seriously, probably well before we begin to increase the interest rate on   reserves  Asset sales can have significant benefits  Some of these have been stressed by earlier   speakers  One benefit is, I think, just purely financial  Our holdings of agency MBS and agency                                      November 3–4, 2009 159 of 201  debt imply that we’re heavily involved in the market for home loans  When financial markets were   functioning poorly, this involvement could be readily justified  Now financial markets are   functioning much better It is good time for us to reconsider our involvement in housing finance    Some questions we might ask ourselves along those lines are, “Would holding our portfolio to   maturity really enhance the liquidity of these markets? Would sales actually do more to help   liquidity in these markets?”   Another benefit, which has not been so much stressed by earlier speakers, has to do with a   concern of mine about controlling inflation risk  On the other side of the balance sheet, our asset   holdings imply that banks are holding large amounts of excess reserves  These reserves represent   an inflation risk generated by potential changes in household expectations  My logic here is fairly   simple  If households believe that the price level is about to rise, then they will demand more-liquid   deposits in order to make their transactions  The fact that banks are holding so much in the way of   excess reserves means they can readily accommodate this extra demand for deposits because they   have the ability to do so  The extra deposits in the hands of households become extra money   chasing the same amount of goods, which generates inflation  In this way, excess reserves provide a   vehicle for household expectations about inflation to become reality   If you think about this in this quantitative way, the inflationary potential in the system is   extraordinary Banks are currently holding over $1 trillion in excess reserves  With a reserve   requirement of 10 percent, sufficient household demand can generate $10 trillion in liquid deposits   in the hands of the public  Such extra deposits would put enormous pressure on the price level   Why might households expect inflation?  The government debt in the hands of the public has   expanded over 30 percent in the past two years  This debt, as the Chairman and I discussed earlier,   can be paid in only two ways by the Fed’s printing money or by the Congress’s collecting taxes  If                   November 3–4, 2009 160 of 201  the public starts to believe that the Congress will not collect the required taxes, then the price level   must rise either today or in the future  Again, excess reserves allow these changes in household   expectations about fiscal policy to translate very directly into inflationary pressures   Now, I want to be absolutely clear  I am not arguing that large quantities of excess reserves   imply in any way that we’re guaranteed to have high inflation  This argument can be wrong   empirically and theoretically  But my concern is that the large quantity of excess reserves makes   possible a high inflation outcome  Like market participants, like the people around this table, I   currently view this outcome as being of very low probability  Recent events have suggested,   though, that our conduct of policy should take account of exactly these kinds of low-probability   adverse outcomes   So I believe that we need to reduce the amount of excess reserves in the system  It is clear   that we can do so by selling off some of our existing assets  The Bluebook suggests using   temporary absorption techniques such as reverse repos or term deposit facilities  These approaches   certainly work toward ameliorating the kind of problem that I’ve described  However, I’m less   confident about their ability to eliminate the problem entirely  These short-term arrangements seem   much more vulnerable to sudden shifts in household expectations of the kind that I’ve sketched    I’m stressing the benefits of asset sales, and they certainly have costs as well  My point is simply   that I think that, going forward, we need to do some systematic comparisons of the costs and   benefits as opposed to simply downplaying their role in our exit strategy  Thank you, Mr   Chairman    Yes                               November 3–4, 2009 161 of 201   I spoke against it, too    For me it would be helpful to hear an explanation why it is   now suddenly so useful to be so specific as opposed to in the past  That is something I don’t   understand  "
8682,2009-12-15," Thank you, Mr Chairman  Brian, what is the Desk’s   position, if any, on the effect of the term deposit facility and reverse repos on short-term interest   rates? Suppose we start running a term deposit facility  What kind of effect do you foresee that   having on the level of short-term interest rates?  Or is it just going to be totally disconnected, or   do you think there is going to be some pass-through or what?                 December 15–16, 2009 25 of 247   So you’re not worried about these programs basically being   an influence on short-term interest rates beyond the IOER rate  That’s what I would be   concerned about You’re just saying we are moving the fed funds rate closer to the IOER rate    That’s fine with me  I’m more worried that they’re going to be a separate influence on short-  term interest rates beyond the IOER rate    Well, the description of the TDF involved an auction, so   sometimes it can be hard to know exactly what price you’ll get out of that, I would guess    Yes I’m going to follow up on some of the things President   Plosser was saying What we could do is raise the interest rate on excess reserves; we could   offer this term deposit, which strikes me as like offering a certificate of deposit, a CD, to a bank,   and they can lock in their funds—that’s offering a high interest rate on a particular kind of   illiquid asset; or we could sell off MBS, but we’re worried about raising the rates there  So I   guess we’re going to defer all of this until January, and we’ll sort it all out at that point  But   there is this question about which interest rate we’re going to be manipulating at a given point in   time  I’m not seeing clearly why this is the right interest rate to manipulate as opposed to the           December 15–16, 2009 39 of 247  IOER rate or just selling agency MBS  That’s the part I’m not following  But, again, maybe this   will be cleared up in January    Just to follow up—if I’m a bank, why would I put my   reserves into this account unless it paid a higher interest rate than the IOER rate?  Because it’s   less liquid    Okay So, at least as far as I can see, it’s not just fine-tuning   that gap between the fed funds rate and the IOER rate  It’s actually playing with the various   aspects of the term structure in some fashion  And maybe that’s the right way for us to proceed    Thank you, Mr Chairman  In the Ninth District, real   economic activity has begun to recover, but slowly  The basic sense among our directors and our   Small Business Council is that the deterioration in conditions has ended  Figures confirm this   sense Regional unemployment has stabilized, although at elevated levels  However, our   directors also expressed some skepticism about the degree to which this turnaround can be   sustained without ongoing government interventions, such as the first-time homebuyer credit    Our Small Business Council expressed strong concerns about policy uncertainty related to taxes,   health care, and cap and trade   Nationally, the revised estimate of third quarter GDP growth was 28 percent  This   increase is better than the preceding four quarters of negative growth  Nonetheless, output is   well below its trend level if we assume that that trend grows at 3 percent per year, beginning in   the fourth quarter of 2007  The Greenbook predicts that GDP will rise by over 4 percent per year   over the next two years  Based on our Minneapolis model’s forecast, I believe that this   prediction is somewhat optimistic  But even if the Greenbook were right, GDP will be well   below this 3 percent trend line through the end of 2011           December 15–16, 2009 75 of 247  In terms of labor market conditions, the November employment report was heartening    National unemployment has started to decline, and employment seemed to stabilize in   November  However, unemployment remains extremely high by historical standards, and I   agree with the Greenbook that it will remain elevated through 2011  The employment-to­  population ratio remains at a 25-year low   The inflation front is more promising  Inflation remains low  Inflationary expectations,   as measured by Blue Chip forecasts or TIPS spreads, also remain low  My own expectations are   similar  Nonetheless, I am concerned about a tail risk of a low-probability but high-inflation   outcome  The size of the government debt held in the private sector has increased by more than   30 percent in the past two years  This rise in the debt can only be funded by future tax increases,   spending cuts, or higher inflation  Any uncertainty about the Congress’s will to exercise the   required fiscal restraint translates directly into uncertainty about current or future inflation   There is also good news in financial markets  Thanks in large part to interventions by the   Fed, key liquidity measures like TED spreads have returned to normal  Indeed, the option-  adjusted spread between agency MBS and Treasuries has fallen to near historical lows  This   improvement in financial markets has significant consequences for policy  Liquidity disruptions   last fall served to segment financial markets in unprecedented ways  In that environment, the   LSAP played a valuable role by lowering risk premiums in the agency debt and MBS markets    However, the return to normalcy in spreads across financial markets indicates the degree of   market segmentation is, at a minimum, greatly reduced  Without such segmentation, the impact   of reducing our holdings of agency MBS or Treasury debt on their yields is likely to be muted  I   would, at a minimum, be supportive of not reinvesting the proceeds from the LSAP either from   the agency securities or from the Treasury debt     December 15–16, 2009 76 of 247  Overall, the real side of the economy is recovering somewhat  However, detrended GDP   is well below historical norms, and unemployment is well above the historical norms  And this   characterization seems likely to continue well into 2011  Inflation is under control and is   expected to remain so, although the size of the government debt represents a possible large risk    Financial markets continue to improve and are much stronger than a year ago  Thank you, Mr   Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  In our November statement, we   committed to maintaining a target range of zero to 25 basis points for the fed funds rate as long   as the economy continued to exhibit low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends,   and stable inflation expectations I believe that those conditions are still in place, and so I am   happy to maintain the fed funds rate in that target range   Also, for the reasons ably described by President Plosser, I support committing ourselves   to plans for ending the liquidity facilities as is done in both alternatives B and C  I do not see the   utility of our buying the extra $150 billion of agency MBS and $15 billion of agency debt in   alternative B, but I am willing to support the thrust of the alternative, because our language in the   November statement about the LSAP signaled a strong commitment to those extra asset   purchases   With that said, I am concerned that alternative B is so silent about our plans for the   balance sheet beyond March I would recommend changing the last sentence of alternative B to   read, “The Committee will continue to evaluate the size and composition of its holdings of   securities in light of the evolving economic outlook and conditions in financial markets,” so   that’s basically changing from “purchases” to “holdings”  This change would communicate to   the public that we may choose to reduce the balance sheet by failing to reinvest or by selling   assets My own view is that we should begin such a reduction in the second quarter of 2010, at   least by failing to reinvest and, more desirably, through additional sales   Why do I favor reducing the balance sheet?  Well, first, the benefits of our interventions   in these markets have fallen greatly  I am convinced from evidence offered by the New York   Fed that the LSAP had big benefits in late 2008 and early 2009, but during that period financial        December 15–16, 2009 111 of 247  markets were functioning poorly  Risk premia in particular markets became largely   disconnected from one another  But as pages 12 and 13 of the Bluebook emphasize, these   conditions have greatly ameliorated, and investors can more readily substitute across various   financial assets  In these circumstances, reducing our positions will have a muted effect on   yields The benefits, therefore, of our big balance sheet have been greatly reduced, and our big   balance sheet is not without cost  It confronts us with the low probability possibility of high   inflation Banks have $1 trillion of excess reserves  These reserves represent an inflation risk   generated from potential changes in household expectations   The logic here is simple  If households believe that the price level is about to rise, they   will demand more liquid deposits in order to make their transactions  One of the five memos for   the inflation dynamics session we’re going to get is by Simon Potter and other coauthors, and it   indicates how increases in government debt can lead to exactly those kinds of changes in   household beliefs Given those changes, banks can readily accommodate the extra demand for   deposits because they’re holding so many excess reserves  The extra deposits in the hands of   households become extra money chasing the same amount of goods, which has the possibility of   generating inflation In this way excess reserves are a vehicle for households’ expectations about   inflation to become reality   One way this chain of events could take place is for banks to make additional loans    However, their doing so would mean that they would be significantly changing the risk   composition of their portfolios  My own belief is that deposit creation would be fueled instead   by households and firms selling banks relatively illiquid but relatively riskless securities like   corporate bonds, municipal bonds, and Treasuries  Households and firms now own about   $4 trillion in such securities, which is enough to expand demand deposits by 600 percent  This                       December 15–16, 2009 112 of 247  expansion, obviously an extreme case, would put enormous pressure on the price level  I’d be   the first to say that this inflationary chain is only a possibility, and I agree with market   assessments that it currently has a low probability of occurring  But one lesson I have taken   away from the past five years is that our conduct of policy should take account of exactly these   kinds of low-probability adverse tail events   The staff is currently exploring the use of reverse repos and term deposits  These   facilities have potentially useful ways to accommodate transient reductions of excess reserves    In contrast, asset sales are a more effective commitment to a permanent reduction in our balance   sheet This difference means that, at a minimum, asset sales are a useful complement to term   deposits or reverse repos As I say, I would like to see shrinkage in our balance sheet beginning   in the second quarter of 2010, but now I think it’s worthwhile for us to start to foreshadow that   possibility by changing the language of alternative B as I have recommended to refer to holdings   of securities as opposed to simply talking about purchases  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Yes, sure The last sentence of paragraph 3, alternative B—I   want it to read, “The Committee will continue to evaluate the size and composition of its   holdings of securities in light of the evolving economic outlook and conditions of financial   markets”    That’s another beautiful name  [Laughter]    Thanks, Mr Chairman  I was impressed with all of the   papers It was obvious that a lot of work went into them, and I’m very appreciative of that   I wanted to talk about two messages I took away from the Philadelphia–Richmond paper    It’s more commentary than questions  One is the discussion that President Lacker and Chairman   Bernanke were just having about the difference between old thinking and new thinking, or old   Keynesian and New Keynesian models, about gaps  I think this difference is that just looking at   a statistical trend as a way to figure out what potential output is or efficient output is can be   misleading  Just to cite the current example, output right now is about 8 percent below trend as   measured from December 2007  The question is How much of this fall is efficient?  How much   of this represents a deviation from potential output?  The theme that comes out of the   Philadelphia–Richmond paper—and it’s basically a theme of all work on monetary economics   for the last 15 years—is that there’s really no way to answer this question without a model   The second message that comes out of this paper is that measuring an output gap can be   hard I think that, at times, the paper, or the presentation, seems to imply that this is somehow a   new problem with New Keynesian modeling when, in fact, it’s pretty much an old problem,   which is true in all economics—we can come up with observationally equivalent models that, in   this case, will give rise to different measures of output gaps and then different implications of   optimal policy  I think the Chicago paper points this out—that this is not something special to     December 15–16, 2009 158 of 247  the New Keynesian approach to thinking about monetary economics, but rather it’s something   that’s present in all macroeconomic models   In fact, I think the New Keynesian approach actually helps us with thinking about sorting   across models because it brings so much more auxiliary information to bear compared to older   approaches; for example, it requires consistency between household-level and firm-level   expectations and observed data, and there’s consistency between asset pricing and firm   investment decisions  All of these kinds of restrictions are valuable sources of information that   make it easier to use data to distinguish among existing models  The point is that I think the   Philadelphia–Richmond paper is right that these newer models don’t fully solve this   identification problem—what are output gaps, what’s the right thing to do at any given moment   in time?   I think there are two parts to trying to respond to this problem One is that we use a wide   range of models, and this is something you see in the Bluebook—several models are considered    We might even think of expanding that range of models  And then there’s supplementing that   with good judgment, which is what the Chicago memo, I think, is trying to argue; that is, if we   bring enough good judgment to bear, we can actually sort through some of these issues  That   can be very helpful   The second part, which is something that’s more common in other parts of   macroeconomics, is to use microdata as an auxiliary source of information beyond macrodata    The EDO model, which is used at the Board, is one step in this direction because it uses sector-   level data, but there are lots of other kinds of microlevel data that can be very informative  For   example, there’s this issue about whether or not inflation is backward-looking, that is, for   example, whether, when firms set prices, they look backwards or not in terms of indexation            December 15–16, 2009 159 of 247  Well, we have lots of microdata on price setting Mark Bills at the University of Rochester and   Pete Klenow at Stanford University have basically spent the last decade on this issue  The ECB   has commissioned studies in a wide range of countries to do this in Europe  It would be great to   supplement some of our thinking about just building aggregate-level models with information   from microlevel data  Likewise, a lot of times the questions hinge on these latent or   unobservable things in the macro model which we could actually try to get information about   from microlevel data, for example, questions about firm financing costs, questions about the   marginal efficiency of investment  There can be uses for microlevel data to try to supplement   what’s in the macro models   So by and large, I like the Philadelphia–Richmond paper and presentation, but I think   they came across as far too negative about the state of play  I think that we’ve made enormous   progress in the last ten years in bringing models to bear that are useful for policy analysis, while   at the same time they embed the ingredients of modern macroeconomics that have been proven   useful in other contexts    But the model is trying to account for all variability in the   data, so it’s going to say something about the answer to Governor Kohn’s question about what   has happened What is the model going to say?  Some shock has taken place according to the   model What is the shock that has happened in the last two years, or what is the constellation of   two or three shocks that have happened in the last two years?    But in the Philadelphia model that you use?    Right    Narayana Rao Kocherlakota  [Laughter]  "
8710,2010-01-26,"  Yes  I was wondering  There seemed to be a presumption in   the memos that we would require aggressive sales in order to reach a point where we could feel   confident in the connection between the interest rate on excess reserves and the fed funds rate—  getting our reserves low enough to where we would feel confident about that connection  So I   am going back and looking at an old memo  It goes back to December 9  Some of these   estimates might be out of date  It is by Keane, Remache, and Sack on reinvestment policies    One of the policies prescribed there—or thought about there, I should say—is redeeming all   Treasuries, agencies, and agency MBS, and under that, by the end of 2010, reserve balances fall   to less than $900 billion, and by the end of 2011, which is the Greenbook’s estimate of how long   we will wait to raise rates, reserve balances fall to $626 billion  So it seemed just by   redemptions alone—because this is without using sales, without using any reserve-draining   techniques—that we can really get pretty close to this $850 billion point, where we start to see   some slope in the graph  Are you saying that we have to get well below $850 billion, or am I   just misreading something in this?      But I guess my question is really, at the end of the day, how   far down do we have to get reserves?  It seems as though redemptions are getting us down only   to, say, $700 billion or something roughly like that by early 2011, mid-2011  How much further   do you think we have to be down to have some confidence about being able to move market   interest rates?     I am starting at 2017 and working back  [Laughter]     Thank you, Mr Chairman  On primary credit, I support the   staff’s recommendation for normalization, and on the TAF, I also support the staff’s   recommendation on normalization, with President Rosengren’s emendation  I think it would be a   January 26–27, 2010 60 of 260    great idea for the Chairman to float these ideas in his appearances on the Hill, but I also agree that I   would like to forestall announcements until our March meeting   So I turn to our long-term strategy and talk a bit first about interest rates  I think that   communication in the short run is going to be safest if we target the interest rate on excess reserves    But the reality is something we are going to have confront, which is that we don’t really understand   the details and the connection between the interest rate on excess reserves and market interest rates   at the short end of the yield curve  So we don’t know, if we raise the IOER rate by 200 basis points,   what is going to happen to the fed funds rate  Maybe that does not matter to us, but we don’t know   what is going to happen to one-month Treasury bill rates or two-month Treasury bill rates either    And that source of disconnect is a source of at least discomfort to me  I agree that markets will   correctly—and I think rightly—infer that, when we raise the IOER rate, we are tightening  But how   much we are tightening will be a matter of lack of clarity, and it’s a lack of clarity because we just   don’t have the experience to know what that is going to say  So there is going to have to be some   learning by doing in this process, and my own guess, if I had to bet right now, would be that the   spread between the fed funds rate and the IOER rate would stay roughly constant if we raised the   IOER rate for a fixed level of reserves  That’s purely guess work, and we’re going to learn a lot   more about that as time goes by   So let me turn then to the balance sheet  I circulated a memo on a reverse taper exit strategy    What I wanted to accomplish here was to put a concrete proposal on the table, and then the concrete   proposal is supposed to indicate that I think we can try to return to normalcy in terms of our balance   sheet in five years—“normalcy” meaning excess reserves around $25 billion and a balance sheet   consisting only of Treasuries of varying maturities  And I would be inclined, as President Plosser   would be, to have those Treasuries at the short end as opposed to the long end  Without sales we   January 26–27, 2010 61 of 260    cannot get there  So my own preferred strategy that I described here is to use redemptions of   anything on our balance sheet right now—Treasuries and MBS and agency debt—in combination   with what I would describe as very modest rates of sales   So I will give you some idea of that  You know, just this week while we were tapering, I   think we bought—Brian can correct me if I’m wrong—about $16 billion worth of MBS  So I am   proposing that we sell $5 billion to $10 billion per month for six months beginning in the second   half of 2010 and then ramp it up to an alarming rate—using it as a joke—of $15 billion per month in   2011  So basically going very slowly in this process and being ready to reverse if we start to see   large price effects from these kinds of sales  I think the challenge here, the concern that the staff   raises about sales, is that, if we start to indicate our willingness to sell, the market is going to be   concerned that we want to sell $1 trillion in a month or over a relatively short period of time, and I   think this is a communication issue  We have to be ready to communicate that this is not the case  I   don’t think this is an impossibility by any means, and I describe in my memo one way to   accomplish that communication   What are the benefits of doing this?  The main benefit here is not that it’s going to enhance   our control over the fed funds rate  That’s not what I am aiming for  It’s that I’m concerned about   the connection between the size of our balance sheet and inflation and inflation expectations  I   think we see the evidence for these concerns in the data that Brian presented earlier  If you look at   the break-even inflation rate, as we are used to doing, it is going up  But if you look for the price of   skewness in inflation, which is sort of the price of heavy-tailed risk, which is more what I am   concerned about, you start to see that going up as well over the last few months   Those are my concerns  I think we can accomplish the desirable goal of getting rid of MBS   on our balance sheet by the end of 2015, what I would call normalization, so that we have excess   January 26–27, 2010 62 of 260    reserves down below $25 billion by the beginning of 2015 without using undue amounts of sales   and without sales imposing huge effects on prices   The last point I will make is that there are a lot of estimates of the price effect of sales  One   of the things we have to be very cautious about is that we don’t want to use data from this period of   chaos, as Vice Chairman Dudley referred to it earlier, of late 2008 and early 2009 to make   inferences about what the effect of sales would be  And so we have to try to use data from the latter   part of 2009 or pre-crisis data to make that inference  There are a couple of memos from the New   York Fed that have done that  One is by Raskin and Sheets, and the other is by Kimbrough and   Madar  If we have any opportunity to talk, I will probably expand upon these points later  But the   basic punch line from these memos is that essentially in these normal times buying $100 billion   worth of MBS puts downward pressure on yields of about 3 basis points  So that means $1 trillion   translates into about 30 basis points  I don’t think this would be a huge tax on the market, especially   for spreading this out over an exceptionally long period of time  But as I say, I’ll expand upon those   points probably in my policy remarks  Thank you, Mr Chairman       Mr Chairman, I think you, as usual, ably summed up   everything that people have said  The one question I had was about redeeming Treasuries and   using the proceeds to buy short-term Treasuries, while at the same time draining reserves  It   seems as though we are somehow in the position of both borrowing and saving at the same time     I am just going to follow up quickly on what President Evans   was saying about hiring  If you look at the hiring rates in JOLTS, the job openings and labor   turnover survey, hiring rates have been flat basically since March, and the help-wanted index   data that you are showing us here are pretty similar on that  Until we see that pick up, I do not   see how we are going to get to a 263,000 gain in employment     So it won’t happen again  [Laughter]     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I will focus my remarks on only   four elements of the current economic situation—conditions in the Ninth District, national labor   market conditions, the inflation outlook, and conditions in financial markets  The first two feed   into my thinking about policy on interest rates, and the last two feed into my thinking about the   balance sheet   Economic conditions in the Ninth District can be summarized with a three-word phrase,   which actually President Hoenig used  “wait and see”  Businesses see economic conditions as   stable but not improving greatly  There are few plans for capital expenditure  There are some   complaints of difficulties in getting credit, but many businesses do have cash, and they are   choosing not to expand  The basic story is a simple one, which we just heard from Presidents   Hoenig and Pianalto  Businesses have unused capacity, but they also have a great deal of   uncertainty about future demand  They are waiting and seeing whether demand will actually   return to the levels that warrant further expansion   January 26–27, 2010 143 of 260    Data for the Ninth District are consistent with this description of an economy that is   stable but not improving  Unemployment in Minnesota, which contains half our population, has   ranged between 74 percent and 76 percent over the past four months  This may sound low to   some of you around the table, but unemployment in Minnesota was 48 percent in December   2007  In Wisconsin, unemployment ranged between 84 percent and 82 percent from September   through November but has jumped up to 87 percent in December; unemployment was, similar to   Minnesota’s, around 45 percent in December 2007  In a similar vein, employment fell sharply   in the Dakotas and Montana from November to December   Let me turn, then, to the national labor market  These are figures that are all familiar to   us  The unemployment rate in December was 10 percent, which is more than double the   unemployment rate in December 2007 at the start of the recession  Unemployment has been   roughly stable over the past three months  The employment picture is similar  Employment in   December 2009 is nearly 6 percent lower than in December 2007, and it has been essentially flat   the past three months  Given these figures, it is no surprise that the Greenbook predicts that   unemployment will still be 95 percent by the end of 2010 and 82 percent by the end of 2011  I   agree with this forecast and, indeed, believe that it may well prove to be too optimistic  So I   think the risks are on the upside  I believe that there is a lot of work to be done before we can   say that we are fulfilling the employment side of our dual mandate   I turn next to the outlook for inflation  Both realizations and expectations of inflation   remain within desired ranges  There has been some upward movement in the break-even   inflation rates encoded in TIPS bonds  However, inflation expectations and realizations remain   below 25 percent for both five- and ten-year TIPS bonds  My own outlook is for inflation to   average less than 2 percent per year over the next three years  However, it is important to keep   January 26–27, 2010 144 of 260    in mind that expectations alone, as one summary statistic, do not tell the full story about   inflation  I have argued at previous meetings that our large balance sheet combined with the   large federal debt implies that we face a low probability risk of high inflation  So I am worried   about a tail event in inflation  It is always hard to find ex ante evidence of this kind of tail risk    So let me just cite two pieces of suggestive confirming information   If you look at the euro-dollar options market, prices of options in euro futures imply that   there is a positive but low probability that the dollar will decline more than 24 percent against the   euro over the coming year  Those same prices put a zero probability on the event that the dollar   will increase against the euro more than 12 percent  So there is an asymmetry in the prices of   these options  That exactly suggests the kind of tail risk in dollar inflation that concerns me  I   think better evidence—which I just learned yesterday—is that these premiums were skewed   toward the higher long rates that Brian Sack showed us in his presentation, which have gone up   quite a bit  That, again, is evidence of people wanting to pay for protection against that kind of   tail-risk event in inflation  That is a concern to me that I link directly to our balance sheet   Let me turn, finally, to the condition of financial markets  And here the news is   excellent  Interbank loan spreads are low relative to historical norms, as are corporate bond   spreads  Financial markets are functioning—this is putting it mildly—much better than they did   in late 2008 and early 2009  This fact has important consequences for our discussion of policy,   which will be taking place soon, I guess  There are many forms of relatively riskless debt   available for investors  When markets are functioning poorly, cross-market arbitrage across   these various instruments is very difficult, and so it ends up as a bunch of segmenting markets,   where different assets are essentially traded in distinct, relatively small markets  Intervention in   a given one of these markets can have big price effects as a result  When markets are   January 26–27, 2010 145 of 260    functioning well, these roughly substitutable assets are traded in a single well-integrated market    Selling even $1 trillion of assets over a five-year period into this large market is likely to have   only modest effects on prices relative to buying a bunch of assets in the situation in which these   markets were distinct from one another  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support alternative B    Unemployment remains high, and inflation and expected inflation both remain subdued  In my   judgment it’s too early to remove the “extended period” language as is done in alternative C  At   January 26–27, 2010 177 of 260    the same time, I do not believe the benefits and further expansion of the LSAPs outweigh the   costs, and so I do not support alternative A   I support the use of the term “holdings” rather than “purchases” in alternative B  I think   this is consistent with the hope that the Chairman offered in his remarks at the end of the   economic go-round for a gradual and steady normalization  We want to be careful to deliver   information smoothly about our plans as opposed to in lumps, and I think switching to the word   “holdings” is beneficial along those lines   Right now we have three different tools at our disposal for thinking about draining   reserves or managing reserves—the term deposit facility, reverse repos, and sales  The first two   are relatively untested  I think we feel relatively confident that the price effects will be relatively   small on those  But there are still some doubts about whether or not they will work logistically   to the scale envisioned, and the Bluebook acknowledges as much  In terms of sales, we know   how to do that, but there are concerns about what the price effects will be, and I will talk about   that momentarily   Yesterday I was heartened in some ways, but I became concerned about the divide   between the Committee’s attitudes toward the use of “sales” and the beliefs of market   participants about those attitudes  Yesterday we heard that many on the Committee are willing   to consider the use of sales of MBS as a tool of balance sheet normalization  There is certainly   heterogeneity about what the timing of that is going to be, but I think we definitely heard that   there was a desire to get in the long run, which I took to mean before 2037, to an all-Treasury   balance sheet  In contrast, the New York Fed survey shows that market participants significantly   discount this possibility  I think our goal for the use of those surveys is to tell us what market   participants believe, and the job of our communication is to try to shape those beliefs   January 26–27, 2010 178 of 260    So we need to use language to shift those beliefs  I think “holdings” represents a gentle   way to start to move in that direction  One thing I should say, which is sort of obvious, is that   “holdings” is a very flexible kind of language  It is designed to tell people only what our tools   are, not to tell them what we’re going to do  In particular, it doesn’t preclude the possibility of   further purchases if we do see deterioration in economic conditions   Now the main concern that the Bluebook raises about including the term “holdings” is   that it could lead to significant increases in agency MBS yields and mortgage rates  So let me   talk a little about that  I want to begin with a point that I raised earlier in the economic go-round,   which is that financial markets are functioning much better than they did in late 2008, early   2009  I think the problem that creates is that we have big purchases that took place in that   period  It’s very tempting to use those data as a source of information about what the price   impact of sales is going to be  But markets were very different at that point, and so it seems very   problematic to use that kind of experience to infer the likely price impact of our sales when   markets are functioning as well as they are now  So to get a good measure of the price impact of   sales today, we need to use pre-crisis data or data from the latter part of 2009  I am aware of two   such studies, both done by the Markets Group at the New York Fed  One is by Matt Raskin and   Clara Sheets  They used an event study methodology to document that, after March 2009, each   additional purchase of $100 billion of agency MBS led to a 3 basis point fall in yields    According to this estimate, an announcement that we were trying to sell $1 trillion of agency   MBS—presumably over an extended period of time, not in a week—which would lead to a 30   basis point increase in yields   In contrast, they also estimated the price impact before March 2009, between November   ’08 and March ’09, and the price impact was twice as large, consistent with what I’m saying that   January 26–27, 2010 179 of 260    markets were not functioning well in that earlier period whereas they’re functioning better now    Of course, I will add that actually the period they study that I have mentioned, March ’09 to   November ’09, includes a part of the period when you might think that markets were not   functioning that well, so that even that might be an overestimate   There’s another study, which I won’t go into so much detail about, by Kimbrough and   Madar from the Markets Group  They estimated an MBS pricing model using pre-2007 data,   and they estimated that our current $11 trillion of MBS are depressing MBS yields about   20 basis points  Neither of these studies is perfect, as the authors are quick to admit, and I am   not reporting standard errors because I don’t think there were standard errors reported in those   papers  I’m sure they are huge  It’s comforting that they arrive at roughly the same estimate   These yield increases strike me as modest, but there are significant overestimates of the   impact of introducing the word “holdings” into the statement  The estimated increase I am   referring to is a measure of the impact of a wholly unexpected announcement that we will sell   our entire portfolio of MBS  The sales are not wholly unexpected  It is clear from the New York   Fed survey that some market participants do put some probability on this possibility  And I think   that the word “holdings” does not serve to indicate that people were increasing the probability of   selling all of our portfolio to 1 but rather increasing the probability of some sales above 0  In   fact, as I indicated, I would recommend that we use a reverse tapering approach in which we   start very gradually over a rather extended period   So to sum up, using the word “holdings” instead of “purchases” gives us more flexibility   to manage excess reserves effectively and to respond to changes in economic conditions  I think   the best possible estimates indicate that the impact of such a change in wording is likely to be   January 26–27, 2010 180 of 260    small on MBS yields, and so I support alternative B with the word “holdings”  Thank you, Mr   Chairman     It must be true then  [Laughter]   January 26–27, 2010 190 of 260      Yes  Thanks, Mr Chairman  My concern is that I thought   that yesterday we had a very good, very productive discussion, and I agree with you that my   sense of the sentiment of the table was that there was some support for a gradual reduction in our   balance sheet, faster than would be warranted through redemptions alone  A lot of heterogeneity   in views about timing  I remain concerned about the message that’s on the table in some vague   sense getting out there  And this term “socializing” that Governor Warsh uses is a great one, and   I’m sympathetic to the idea that changing this one word is a rather blunt way to try to accomplish   January 26–27, 2010 207 of 260    this  I’m on board with that  What are the other vehicles that we have at our disposal for doing   that?      So let me ask a pointed question  Should the New York Fed   website still refer to it as a buy-and-hold program?     The New York Fed website has a bunch of frequently asked   questions about the agency MBS program, and one question is, Do we face any risk of loss on   this program?  And the answer given is, “There is no default risk,” which I agree with totally    And there is no capital loss  But we might face interest rate risk, but we don’t really face interest   rate risk because it’s a buy-and-hold program     But I think at the end of March we might be evaluating   purchases and we might be evaluating sales of various kinds  “Holdings” might not be the right   word  Maybe “portfolio” is a better word  But I think at that point we might want to indicate   that more weapons are available   "
8735,2010-03-16,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’m going to echo some of the   things that have been said already  I, too, share President Fisher’s concerns about the fraction of   the MBS that’s shown in the projections  I was glad to hear the Chairman’s affirmation that we   want to be moving into an all-Treasury portfolio ultimately, well before 2040  I recognize the   March 16, 2010 26 of 146    communications issue, and I’ll offer some suggestions later today about how we might think   about the communications challenges  But I think it would be useful for the staff to provide us   with some alternative paths for the structure of the portfolio would look like under alternative   sales patterns  So that’s actually a comment, not a question   And I’ll offer yet another comment, on the RCAs  I would feel much more comfortable   with this proposal if I had a really strong sense that it would fix the problem at hand, and I just   don’t have that  I do not have a sense that we know how the GSEs will change their behavior   and how the depository institutions that will enter into the contract would change their behavior   when this kind of contractual change appears  Until we have that, I’m not sure why we’re going   forward with all of this work  I felt the proposal is backwards  It seemed as if we’re going to do   all of the work first and then engage the GSEs and their possible counterparties as needed to   determine an interest in entering RCA agreements  It seems wrong to me  It seems as if we   want to figure out what’s their interest level, and, given their interest level, what’s going to   happen as a result of that in the market before we do all of the work  So that was my concern   about RCAs   In terms of the redemptions, as President Hoenig said, I’m all in favor of reducing excess   reserves  The staff seems to feel the passive redemptions have small price effects that happen   once  I’m not sure I understand it fully, but that’s great  So let’s do it that way     Yes, thank you, Mr Chairman  I think my own concern about   the public discussion—your testimony, some of the statements that have been made by the other   Presidents—is that a lot of this is about the short run, notwithstanding what I said in my memo  I   think your testimony did summarize what I took away as the sense of the Committee, which was   that people want to wait  Personally, I disagree with that, but it was my sense of what people on   the Committee thought  Having said that, I think that there hasn’t been quite enough emphasis in   public about the longer run, that there’s going to have to be a fair amount of active selling at   March 16, 2010 33 of 146    some point, if we want to be out of MBS by 2020  So that would be my concern about the public   statements     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll focus my remarks on four   elements of the current economic situation conditions in the Ninth District, national labor   market conditions, the inflation outlook, and conditions in financial markets  The first two feed   into my current thinking about our policy on interest rates, and the last two feed into my current   thinking about the balance sheet   Throughout the Ninth District, businesses generally report that they do not anticipate   making further cuts in production and employment  However, they generally do not see a need   to expand either in terms of capital or labor  The possible exception may be Minnesota    Businesses in Minnesota, especially those with foreign markets, report seeing increases in   March 16, 2010 63 of 146    demand in the latter part of 2009 and anticipate more increases in the first half of 2010  Some of   the Minnesota contacts report that temporary hiring in the manufacturing sector has increased,   although there are few, if any, plans to undertake permanent hires   Let me turn to the national labor market  Nationally the unemployment rate in February,   as we all know, remained elevated at 97 percent  I think the data on labor turnover from the   JOLTS survey continue to be troubling  The hiring rate began to fall in early 2007 before the   credit crisis and reached a historical low in early 2009  The January 2010 hiring rate remains   near this historical low  It’s true that employment losses have stabilized over the past several   months, but only because the separation rate has also declined to historical lows  Solid job   creation can only take place when the hiring rate starts to increase  One bright spot in the JOLTS   data is that the job openings rates did tick upwards in January  But my view is that we’re not   meeting the employment part of our joint mandates either nationally or in the Ninth District   I turn next to the outlook for inflation  Both realizations and expectations of inflation   remain well within desired ranges  Nonetheless I do continue to be concerned that our large   balance sheet, combined with the large federal debt, implies that we face a low-probability risk   of high inflation  One way to get a market measure of this risk is to look at the prices of options   that pay off if 10-year Treasury yields rise by significant amounts over the coming three years    These prices reveal that market participants see the risk of such an increase in Treasury yields as   being highly elevated by historical standards, although I’m happy to report that they have   declined significantly since I joined this Committee [laughter]   Finally I turn to the condition of financial markets  Corporate bond risk spreads and   interbank lending spreads are at normal or below-normal levels  Treasury and equity volatility   are at near normal or below-normal levels  Financial markets are now functioning much better   March 16, 2010 64 of 146    than they were in late 2008 or early 2009  As I emphasized at the last meeting, improvement in   the conditions of financial markets is an important consideration when we turn to policy  There   are many forms of long-term, relatively riskless debt available for investors  When markets are   functioning poorly, cross-market arbitrages are difficult—these different assets are essentially   traded in distinct and relatively small markets—so our interventions, either sales or purchases,   will have big price effects in these conditions  When markets are functioning well, as they are   now, these roughly substitutable assets are traded in a single well-integrated market, so our   interventions, either sales or purchases, will have only small price effects  Thank you, Mr   Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Brian, I have just one question  I   saw, in the Bluebook, that there is an analysis of the long-run scenarios for the balance sheet   under alternative A and under alternative B  I didn’t understand the logic of not including such   scenarios for alternative C  If you could, please talk through that one   March 16, 2010 89 of 146      In some sense those choices are also implicit under alternative   A and alternative B, and you’re opting for a no sales default across all three alternatives or   possible alternatives     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’m not in favor of alternative A    I see no evidence that further expansion of the LSAP would be appropriate at this time    However, I like elements of both alternatives B and C′  I like B because I believe the current   high rate of unemployment and low levels of expected and realized inflation support continued   use of the “extended period” language  On the other hand, I’m in favor of communicating our   exit strategy immediately as is done in alternatives C and C′  I don’t see a logical reason to wait   to start communication until we drop the “extended period” language  In terms of exit strategy, I   liked C′ better than C, without the language in blue type that’s included in C′  I indicated in the   economics go-round that I remain concerned about the inflationary risks of our large balance   sheet  Given those current concerns, I like C′ because it allows the possibility of sales beginning   before raising rates, although it does not necessarily require that Likewise, C′ is explicit about   our desire to run off maturing and prepaid securities   March 16, 2010 96 of 146    Putting these thoughts together, I support alternative B with the inclusion of a new   paragraph 4, which would be paragraph 4 of alternative C′  To be consistent with the rest of   alternative B, I would change the first sentence in paragraph 4 to refer to “an extended period”   rather than “for some time”   Keeping the Chairman’s admonition about time in mind, but having been in favor of C′, I   have to say something about the exit strategy  I will tax you with my thoughts on that, I hope   briefly  I think the Bluebook expressed some concerns that paragraphs like C′ 4 may generate   uncertainty about our exit, and so may lead to untoward asset-market volatility  I’m very   sympathetic to these concerns  The right answer is not simply to avoid the topic entirely, as is   done in alternative B, but rather to improve upon C′ 4 by being much less vague about our   intentions  For 2008 and 2009, the Committee was explicit about timing and quantities  We   should be explicit about timing and quantities during our exit   In my memo on reverse tapering, I offered one way to proceed  One thing we should be   actively considering is committing as much as possible to an end date and to a rate of sales In   the meeting last time, I think we said we all wanted to be out of the housing market and back into   an all-Treasury portfolio eventually  I would like to be explicit about what “eventually” means   and state that we anticipate not having agency securities in our portfolio at the end of a given   date—I’ll suggest 2016  I’m not wedded to 2016, but I strongly prefer it to be an end date in this   decade as opposed to the 2020s or 2030s or President Rosengren’s strategy, in which I think it   would take until 2040 before we got out of agency MBS  In terms of the speed of sales, I   recommend we explicitly state that, through the end of 2016 or whatever end date we choose, the   Federal Reserve would put a cap on sales  I’ll make another suggestion along these lines    $25 billion of assets in a month   March 16, 2010 97 of 146    I think the big concern among market participants about our sales procedure is that, once   we start selling, we’ll go crazy and start to sell everything in a very short period of time  I think   we should commit to not being that kind of actor in the marketplace  Now, I think that my   proposed slow rate of sales would have little in the way of price impact, given the kind of   financial market functioning we’re seeing right now  The results of the March 2010 working   paper by Gagnon, Raskin, Remache, and Sack were suggestive of such a notion  In March of   2009, a year ago, the Fed announced the decision to buy up an additional $750 billion of agency   MBS over the coming nine months  The working paper estimates the impact of this purchase on   agency MBS yields to have been about 30 basis points   I’m proposing selling that same amount of agency MBS, or less, over a two-and-a-half-  year period  If financial markets are functioning much better, I would conjecture that the price   effect of such sales would be considerably less than 30 basis points  As I said, I propose an end   date and a sales cap Those would both be satisfied by 2016 at a pace of $25 billion a month,   even if we wanted to wait to start to sell  If we begin sales in mid-2011, 15 months from now—  we’d like to start sooner—but if we wanted to wait that long and sell $20 billion of MBS per   month, that’s inside the cap, we will eliminate agency securities from the balance sheet sometime   in 2015  This cap on sales would also imply that we would normalize reserve balances to a   desirable level sometime in mid-2013  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
8759,2010-04-27,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  This probably was in the March   memo and I missed it  What’s the maturity of the term deposit facilities that’s being considered?     Thank you      Thank you, Mr Chairman  I want to add again to the praise   of the staff for the excellent job they did on the three memos—they were just outstanding   So these are the questions  Shall we shrink our balance sheet by selling, as in options 2   to 5, or should we wait until 2025 or later as in option 1, or should we sell MBS and buy   Treasuries, as in President Lacker’s memo?  It seems clear to me that the answer lies somewhere   in options 2 to 5  If we want to get back to an all-Treasury portfolio in the long run, we also   want that portfolio to be considerably smaller in terms of excess reserves   Why do we want a smaller portfolio?  I think figure 7 in the memo by Jane Ihrig and her   co-authors shows why  In that figure, the large balance sheet unmoors inflationary expectations   with deleterious macroeconomic consequences by mid-decade  There are reasons to be   concerned that this may end up being more than just a thought experiment  As I’ll discuss in my   later remarks, the 10-year, 10-year forward break-even inflation rate has risen by 65 basis points   in the past seven months, rather steadily, and now stands at nearly 3 percent   It is true that sales will have contractionary effects, and the Ihrig memo provides us with   estimates of their magnitude  The memo rightly describes its baseline estimates as modest, but   there are a couple of reasons why I believe that even these modest baseline estimates overstate   the true effects by at least a factor of two   First, the memo’s calculations are based on an estimate from a working paper by Gagnon   et al—apologies to Brian—that the LSAP program lowered bond premiums by 80 basis points    However, the Gagnon paper finds such a large effect of the LSAPs only if it ignores duration   heterogeneity  The more sophisticated estimates of the paper are more along the lines of 30 to   40 basis points  These lower estimates are also basically the same as the ones that I reported to   you earlier from different New York Fed research by Raskin and Sheets and by Kimbrough and   April 27–28, 2010 32 of 206                   Madar  But even those estimates strike me as being too high, because it seems likely the current   market prices already reflect expectations that the Fed will use sales paths at least like those in   options 2 to 4, probably not 5  In Minneapolis, we did the simple event study of the one-day   effect of FOMC speeches, testimony, and minutes on MBS prices over the past six months  The   biggest move came on March 25, when Chairman Bernanke’s exit strategy testimony made clear   that the Fed would need to engage in gradual sales at some point  His testimony is associated   with a change in MBS prices of six basis points  My own speech on April 6 had an effect on   MBS prices of exactly zero basis points  But I admit that this is a result that is consistent with   multiple interpretations  [Laughter]   To me, the benefits of avoiding the possibility of inflation scenarios like the one depicted   in figure 7 are worth the costs described earlier in the Ihrig memo  This is especially so given   that the true costs are, as I have argued, likely to be significantly smaller than the memo’s   estimates  So I strongly prefer options 2 to 5 with plans that don’t shrink the balance sheet in the   immediate future  I view the choice among options 2 through 5 to be second or even third order,   and I think that’s consistent with the results we have seen in the Ihrig memo  Nonetheless, I will   offer my views on that question  To oversimplify, we have two tools  assets sales and the fed   funds rate  I think the first tool is new, and the second is familiar  To me this argues that we   should use gradual, noncontingent sales to get our balance sheet and longer-run inflationary   expectations under control  We can then rely on the fed funds rate to do the final work of   shaping the macroeconomy   Along the same lines, my preferred communication plan would be to divorce balance   sheet normalization from our traditional fed funds rate choices, and I would also, I think, allow   for a fair amount of future flexibility  I would like to indicate relatively soon in the statement   April 27–28, 2010 33 of 206                   that  “the Committee’s goal is to normalize the Fed’s balance sheet both in terms of scale and   composition within the next five to ten years  In keeping with this objective, the Committee will   initiate gradual sales in early 2011, if economic conditions are appropriate”  I’m open to other   kinds of details in this communication, for example, saying we will initiate gradual sales shortly   after raising rates  The details of this communication would, of course, then depend on our   desired sales strategy  But I think the more important point for me is that we soon provide some   form of forward guidance about balance sheet normalization, because I think markets are longing   for that   I, too, was planning to speak about Treasury redemptions tomorrow, but, to sum up, I   want to shrink the balance sheet  This seems like a relatively fast way to do it  It is going to lead   to a contractionary increase in interest rates, but the Bluebook argues, and I think it is right, that   these effects are likely to be small, especially because I think there are more expectations built   into the market than even what’s in the Bluebook  Having said that, it’s critical, I think, given   where we are in terms of current unemployment and inflation, to use language to isolate this   move from any decision to increase the fed funds rate  But I’m pretty happy with the language   in alternative B in the Bluebook along these lines  So I’d be in favor of going ahead with   redemptions now     What’s the maturity structure on Spain’s debt?  How much is   short term; how much is long term?     Thanks     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The economy is improving in the   Ninth District  My contacts report that agriculture and natural resources remain significant   sources of strength in the Dakotas and eastern Montana  For those of you who are perhaps   interested in making a few bucks on the side, you can head out to Williston, North Dakota, where   April 27–28, 2010 114 of 206                   the oil industry is very hot  But bring a sleeping bag, because there are no rooms at the hotels or   anywhere else  Others have beaten you there  In Minnesota, large manufacturing firms, even the   ones engaged in residential investment, are beginning to see significant growth in orders  And   this is especially true if they have a global presence  However, we have heard two forms of   concern in the District  First, many of our small business contacts complain of not being able to   get credit  Second, we are still not hearing of plans to make permanent hires   I believe that this picture roughly coheres with the story of the national economy  Bank   lending continues to fall  Our local contacts, some with national operations, ascribe this decline   to multiple causes, including regulatory uncertainty, supervisory pressures, asset quality   problems, and low loan demand  Fortunately, investment, especially in equipment and software,   is, nonetheless, growing  Nonfinancial corporations are successfully raising funds in equity   markets and in corporate bond markets  The US financial system is working toward a recovery   in which banks are playing an unusually subsidiary role   With that said, small businesses traditionally rely on banks as a source of funds, and, at   the same time, small businesses have been an important source of employment growth in the   early part of the last two recoveries  Barring changes in financing or hiring patterns, these   elements imply that output will recover more slowly than in the usual recovery, and employment   recovery will be even slower   Recent realizations of inflation have been low, and my outlook for inflation is   correspondingly low over the coming year  Nonetheless, we should keep an eye on measures of   longer-run expected inflation  The Board’s measure of the 10-year, 10-year forward break-even   inflation rate, which is telling us about inflation in the 2020s, drifted up by nearly 30 basis points   April 27–28, 2010 115 of 206                   since the last FOMC, and is close to 3 percent  It has gone up by 65 basis points since   September   Our most difficult, but most important, job is keeping long-run inflation expectations   anchored  I thought, in terms of fulfilling our mandate, the scariest picture in the Ihrig memo we   looked at yesterday was, in fact, figure 7  That was the most significant deviation from our   mandate that I saw  And I see balance sheet reduction as playing the key role in that process of   controlling our long-run inflationary expectations  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  When I wrote this, we faced three   substantive questions  I think one of them has been taken off the table to a certain extent  The   first is  Should we weaken the extended period language?  The second is  Should we reinvest   maturing Treasuries?  The third is  Should we include any language about sales in the   statement?   In addressing these questions, I focused on four elements of our current situation    Unemployment is high; inflation is low; near-term expectations of inflation are also low; but   longer-run expectations of inflation have drifted upwards  These four elements led me to say,   first, that I do not think we should weaken the “extended period” language  Unemployment is   high; inflation and near-term expectations of inflation are both low; the recovery is in its early   stages  It is true that longer-run inflation expectations have drifted up, but what I was looking at   is inflation 10 years hence  I think the best way to correct that problem is to offer forward   guidance about the balance sheet and, as many of you have been doing, including the Chairman,   to counsel the Congress to exhibit fiscal responsibility   Should we reinvest our maturing Treasuries?  I guess we’re going to see more analysis of   that  My own presumption right now is that I would be inclined to do that, but I’ll wait to see   further analysis by the staff   April 27–28, 2010 146 of 206                   Finally, let me talk a little bit about sales  I was very struck with what Governor Warsh   said yesterday  I think that we should be conveying to the public the degree of consensus around   this table—no more than that and no less than that  I believe the way we should be   communicating is through the statement, not through the minutes or through our speeches or   through our testimony  We have actual consensus around this table about what we’re going to be   doing  I think we owe it to the public to convey that  And the right way to do it is through our   direct statement to the public   What would that look like?  Right up front, I would say it would not look like paragraph   4 of alternative C—I’m not arguing for that  But I think we should state clearly what we have   agreed upon, as I understood from the conversation yesterday  “The Committee’s long-run goal   is to normalize the balance sheet in terms of both scale and composition  In keeping with that   objective, it expects to undertake a five-year program of gradual asset sales once the recovery is   firmly established  The initiation and exact timing of these transactions will depend on market   conditions”   I think there is a fair amount of heterogeneity about when we’re going to start and how   we’re going to pace the sales, but I believe these three sentences that I’ve described encapsulate   the full range of opinion around the table  And if we have reached that conclusion, I think we   owe it, as I say, to the public to convey that to them and not to have it hidden away in the   minutes somewhere and not hidden away in different ways in our speeches, where the press ends   up focusing on the differences among us as opposed to the similarities   I was going to say one last thing about asset sales, and it’s in response to President   Rosengren’s statement about when we’re going to start  As I heard it, and others can correct me   if I’m wrong, it seemed that a majority of people did want to wait to start sales, at least at this   April 27–28, 2010 147 of 206                   moment, until after we start to tighten with other policies  But I don’t think that was a consensus   view around the table by any means, and I think it would be unwise for the minutes to show that   that kind of consensus had been reached  That’s my own perspective  Thank you, Mr   Chairman     I am in favor of redemptions, but it’s always good to have   more analysis, so I’m certainly happy to see more analysis  "
8783,2010-05-09,"  Thanks, Mr Chairman  I have just a quick question for you    In terms of these broad-scale interventions the ECB is contemplating, they are going to be   restricting themselves to euro-denominated assets  Is that your understanding?     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support giving you the authority   to enter into swap line agreements with the G-7  At times I’m a little confused by which central   banks you’re talking about, but I would be supportive of the central banks of the G-7 plus   Switzerland   I agree totally with President Rosengren’s opening remarks that we should be doing this   based on economics, not based on politics  However, the main political demand I’ve heard over   and over again is for more transparency  I’m delighted to hear that we’re contemplating being as   transparent as possible about these agreements, and I counsel you to follow up on that as much as   you can  Thank you  "
8808,2010-06-22,"  I’ll just say briefly now that in a few minutes I will speak in   favor of selling in general  But I think that’s a distinct policy decision we should contemplate   and discuss  Speaking for myself, I think this is a perfectly reasonable way to address this   particular problem     Brian, I have a couple of questions about market effect in the   last row of Table 3  One is that I couldn’t understand why the effect under option 4 was twice as   large as the effect under option 3  And, relatedly, I guess, what’s the source of those estimates?     Oh  That’s what I couldn’t figure out, right   June 22–23, 2010 24 of 213               Thank you     Sure  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll talk about the three   issues that are on the table  I’ll talk first about the coupon swap issue  On that, I think President   Lacker phrased it exactly right  We would be talking about whether or not we should be selling    The transaction is twofold—we’re selling and then buying  I think we basically committed to a   particular amount of MBS that we wanted to buy, and we should just stick to that  I think Brian   has outlined a way to get around what I see as a largely technical problem, so I’m happy to go   along with that  I think doing otherwise, as some have suggested, is essentially to undo the   commitment we made to get to the level that we were talking about  If the amount of money   involved were $100 billion as opposed to $9 billion, suddenly it wouldn’t be viewed as largely   technical   Let me move to President Hoenig’s memo, which I thought was excellent  In general,   I’m in favor of trying to put a cap on the amount of reserves that are out there, that is, the size of   June 22–23, 2010 43 of 213             the monetary base  I think this cap on the size of the monetary base coming out of the reserve   requirement puts a cap on the size of M1  That cap is a backstop that keeps the price level in   check, even if we, for some reason, fail to use our interest rate tools in a sufficiently aggressive   fashion  Maintaining a large monetary base essentially means that we’ve discarded this backstop   against the consequences of our own mistakes; I think experiences, for example, the Gulf of   Mexico, show the value of having good backstops, ones that actually work    We’ve talked about asset sales at great length, as President Yellen said  I’ll just say one   argument that occurred to me recently that I had not thought of before, which is about   communication  I think it’s going to be a lot more difficult to separate the communication about   interest rates and balance sheets when we’re actually starting to move interest rates  Right now,   we’ve got this commitment on the table—this “extended period” language—and I think it quite   rightly, I will add, given the economic conditions, says to markets that we’re at zero for a long   time to come  In those circumstances, it’s much easier to say, “Okay, we’re going to start to   reduce our balance sheet, but that’s not going to be spilling over into our management of short-  term interest rates”  That’s the main thing you have to worry about here—that spillover  These   5 to 10 basis point estimates—yes, it’s tightening  The term deposit facility test itself offered   people 27 basis points as opposed to 25—that was 2 basis points of tightening  Everything we   do to take out reserves in some sense will have some amount of tightening   I don’t think it’s this 5 to 10 basis points we’re talking about  It’s the spillover into short-  term interest rates that we’re worrying about  I think it will be much easier to control that   communication now, when we’ve got this strong commitment on the table  So I’d be very   comfortable with the gradual five-year program that President Hoenig suggested starting in mid-  2011  We’ve moved expectations about when we were going to start sales tremendously  If you   June 22–23, 2010 44 of 213             look at the June dealer survey that the New York Fed did, now I think about 50 percent the   respondents think we’re going to sell within the next two years  That’s a big change relative to   where we were in January of this year  So I think moving to starting to sell by mid-2011 would   have very little impact on long-term interest rates   Finally, consistent with my vision that we should have a smaller balance sheet, I like the   idea of holding only Treasuries in the long run, but I want to get our balance sheet down fast    Zero reinvestment, full redemption policy is consistent with that  I think communication is   critical to this  This is a Committee that has done wonders over the last two and a half years with   communication  I don’t view this as being a huge obstacle for us to overcome  I’ll sketch some   language tomorrow about how I’d like to proceed on that  I think we could use the minutes now,   Humphrey-Hawkins testimony along the way, and make a formal statement in the statement   about going to zero reinvestment in August  I think I’ve touched on all three issues  Thank you,   Mr Chairman     Thanks for the flattery   June 22–23, 2010 84 of 213               Thank you, Mr Chairman  Economic conditions in the Ninth   District continue to improve  Earlier in 2010, I reported to you that the prevailing attitude was   one of waiting to see whether recent increases in demand were sustainable  There is much more   confidence now that demand is back, especially among high-end consumers  Our business   contracts reported that they had enjoyed outstanding months in March and April, including a   large company that specializes in temporary hiring  However, there was some pullback in May    Shipping out of our main port, Duluth, is proceeding at a rapid pace  At the same time,   inflationary pressures in the District seem minimal  Firms report only modest or limited   movements in import prices   In terms of the national economy, my point forecast has changed little since April  I   expect GDP to grow at roughly 3½ percent over the next two years and inflation to remain low—  around 1 percent during the coming year—but then to bump up to average around 2 percent in   2011 and 2012  However, the level of uncertainty around my forecast has increased since the   last FOMC meeting  In terms of output, as the Tealbook points out, a European financial crisis   could adversely affect growth outcomes in the United States  Along those lines, I was glad to   see reports of a planned stress test of the large European financial institutions  I believe that this   exercise will do much to reduce the likelihood and severity of a European financial crisis if the   exercise is performed in an appropriate fashion   In terms of inflation, I remain concerned about the upside risks associated with increases   in the United States debt and deficit  But the recent low realizations of inflation have also led me   to be concerned about downside risk  As is conventional, the forecast in Tealbook Book A,   assumes that the FOMC responds to undesirably low realizations of inflation by keeping the fed   funds rate at zero for an even longer period of time   June 22–23, 2010 96 of 213             Both in our models and in the data, inflation and interest rates are actually tightly   positively related over the longer run  So the Tealbook’s policy rule has the potential to generate   a multiyear deflation, or liquidity trap, in which inflation is low or even negative for many years   and the fed funds rate is stuck at zero  This idea that conventional monetary policy can generate   self-fulfilling inflations at the zero lower bound goes back to the work of Benhabib, Schmitt-  Grohé, and Uribe about a decade ago  President Bullard referred specifically to this risk in the   two-headed dragon speech that he gave to the AEA in early 2009  As he pointed out there, the   history of Japan since the 1990s indicates that this possibility may be more than a purely   theoretical one  Now, at this point, these are just risks, and I think these risks seem to be under   control, as longer-term inflationary expectations basically remain in a range consist with our   mandate   In May, national unemployment was 97 percent, and private sector employment growth   was small  Like that of the Tealbook, my outlook for national employment/unemployment is   bleak  I do not see unemployment falling below 8 percent until after the end of 2011    Undoubtedly, some amount of unemployment corresponds to the existence of an output gap   created by wage and price rigidities  However, I see at least two other important sources of high   unemployment  Small businesses are typically an important source of job growth during   recoveries, but limitations of their access to bank credit are constraining their ability to create   jobs  In addition, businesses remain highly uncertain about the ultimate impact of health care   reform and taxation on employee costs   To summarize, over the next two years I anticipate a moderate recovery in output along   with low but positive inflation  The European situation and the recent near-zero realizations of   inflation have generated more uncertainty in my outlook  Unemployment is likely to be   June 22–23, 2010 97 of 213             unacceptably high for at least two to three years  My assessment of the root causes of   unemployment implies that it may well continue to be high as the output gap associated with   price and wage rigidities closes  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I favor alternative B  I agree with   some of the suggestions around the table that we need to be thinking about contingency planning   of various kinds  On the one hand, things could surely go better than we are currently expecting,   and we have to have a strategy in place not just about what we’re going to do, but also about how   we plan to communicate what we’re going to do  For example, the Chairman suggested   yesterday we might start talking about doing sales in six months, with an interest rate hike   somewhere in between—that might be one possibility  But I think we have to be formulating   June 22–23, 2010 138 of 213             plans now for these contingencies, because it could well be that in six months or nine months   we’ll be surprised on the upside and have to think that through   At the same time, I think we have to be thinking about what we would do in response to   adverse shocks, as President Yellen and President Rosengren have suggested  Should we go out   and buy more assets?  My guess is that that’s not going to be the best thing to do right now  I   think this was an effective strategy in late 2008 and early 2009, because markets were much   more dysfunctional than they are now  When markets are functioning well, you don’t have the   kind of segmentation necessary for a change in the composition of assets to have huge effects on   market prices  And you’re not going to be able to have a huge stimulus effect as a result  I think   the correct thing—although we have to think more about this—would be to try to commit as   much as possible to language like the “extended period” language  For example, the proposal in   alternative A says “will” instead of “likely” to warrant, which basically commits us to being   slower to tighten—in other words, our best response to adverse shocks would be trying to stretch   out the zero as long as we can   A much more difficult problem, is the situation where deflationary expectations start to   become hardened—a deflationary trap— as I discussed in the economic go-around  My own   assessment of the literature and my own thinking about this lead me to believe that we, the   monetary policymakers, have very limited tools at our disposal in this situation  I think it would   be great to have staff research on this, because it’s a very challenging problem  Without a lot of   monetary policy tools at our disposal, we would have to hope for a sufficient degree of fiscal   irresponsibility from the Congress [laughter]  The Japanese have tried the fiscal approach, and it   has not been successful for them  So I think it would be a very challenging problem if we got to   that stage  Thank you, Mr Chairman   June 22–23, 2010 139 of 213               It’s coming out of alternative A, though     It’s including purchases  "
8834,2010-08-10,"  Thank you, Mr  Chairman  Brian, I had a question about   graph 5 on the 10-year term premium  It’s hard to tell, but it looks as if the term premium is   falling a lot more than just the difference between the yields on 10- and 2-year Treasury   securities, for example  So my question is  How are you decomposing the difference in the   yields into a term premium and an expectations component?     Thanks     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I would say that the economic   recovery in the Ninth District seems to be on a slightly stronger footing than in the rest of the   country  Business contacts report that 2010 is a strong year that is making up much, although   not all, of the considerable ground lost in 2009  Sales slipped back some in May and June after   strong showings in March and April but have picked up again in July  Overall, there are few   reports of input price pressures  Businesses do report being leery about making permanent hires   because of concerns about future high taxes and other forms of policy uncertainty   The labor market situation in the Ninth District is still far from desirable but is looking   better than the nation as a whole  Minnesota has more than half the population in the District   and the employment rate there peaked at 84 percent in June of 2009  One year later it has come   down to 68 percent, nearly halfway back to the December 2007 level of 47 percent    Unemployment in the Dakotas is low, at below 5 percent, and, indeed, in both states there are   complaints of severe labor shortages  It is true that unemployment continues to drift upward in   Montana  It now stands at 79 percent and has been rising continuously since early 2007, and   labor conditions are still troubled in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan  Nonetheless, I think the   overall picture of the economy as a whole, and the labor market in particular, is considerably   better than in much of the rest of the country   Let me turn to the national picture, and here I’ll focus my remarks on three variables that   have affected my thinking about policy output, unemployment, and inflation  Real GDP grew in   the second quarter of 2010, but only at an annual rate of 24 percent, according to the first   August 10, 2010 55 of 160             estimate from the BEA  The BEA also revised real GDP downward from previous periods  So   real output fell by just over 4 percent over 2008 and the first half of 2009  In the past year—the   second half of 2009 and the first half of 2010—it has risen by 32 percent  Per capita GDP has   declined by close to 3½ percent since the fourth quarter of 2007, and it’s still more than 7 percent   below trend compared to that date  So, in this sense, while we have had a recovery, as President   Hoenig has emphasized, we have to say that it has been a modest one   Unemployment remains high at 9½ percent  In the past, I ascribed this slow decline in   unemployment to credit market conditions for small businesses and uncertainties related to taxes   and regulations, and those might well be factors that are important  Nonetheless, I’ve been   taking a fresh look at recent historical data from the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey,   and I’ve been forced to reevaluate my thinking  Tight credit and/or concerns about taxes and   regulations will presumably lead firms to post a relatively small number of vacancies and/or fire   a large number of workers, but they are doing the opposite  From July 2009 to May 2010, job   openings have increased by more than 25 percent  From July 2009 to May 2010, layoffs and   discharges fell by 25 percent  During this same period, the unemployment rate has actually   risen  I think these numbers may have important consequences for how we think about policy    Monetary policy works to reduce unemployment by lowering the incentives of firms to fire and   increasing the incentives of firms to hire  Yet firms are laying off many fewer workers and are   posting many more openings  Nonetheless, unemployment has not gone down appreciably, if at   all   My tentative conclusion is that the labor market is beset by an unusually severe form of   mismatch  Firms have jobs but can’t find appropriate workers  The workers want to work but   can’t find appropriate jobs  This mismatch may not be amenable to monetary policy actions    August 10, 2010 56 of 160             The Fed can do many things, but it cannot readily transform a construction worker into a nurse    [Laughter]  How much of current unemployment is due to mismatch?  The job openings rate has   risen to 24 percent and the layoff/discharge rate is down around 13 percent  These figures are   roughly similar to what they were in the fourth quarter of 2003  The job openings rate was a   little higher back then, about 27 percent  But in the fourth quarter of 2003, the unemployment   rate was close to 6 percent, not 9½ percent  To me, this obviously very rough comparison   indicates that as much as 3 to 3½ percentage points of recurring unemployment represents   mismatch that is unlikely to respond to additional monetary stimulus   I would add to some of the factors President Lacker mentioned about the extension of   benefits  I think there are reasons to be suspicious of that story; for example, if you look at   unemployment rates for new entrants, they also seem to be highly elevated   Let me turn to inflation  It has drifted downward  In the past six months, both core and   total PCE have averaged slightly above 1 percent  In the preceding two years, 2008 and 2009,   they both averaged between 1½ percent and 2 percent  As many around the table have noted, I   don’t find these numbers intrinsically alarming, as I don’t view inflation of about 1 percent as   being so low as to be inconsistent with our price stability mandate  Likewise, Blue Chip   forecasts, our own Minneapolis model, and the readings from TIPS bonds are all predicting   reinflation in 2011  Nonetheless, an extended period of time at our effective zero lower bound   may lead to a significant decline in inflationary expectations, and I think that this is another   longer-run concern to add to the ones that President Hoenig just mentioned  If we keep the fed   funds rate at near zero for a long time and economic growth prospects push up the real rate to be   positive, we will eventually have deflationary expectations and persistent deflation  We should, I   believe, engage in significant contingency planning to ensure that this outcome does not occur  I   August 10, 2010 57 of 160             think this is an accurate description of what’s going on in Japan  Unfortunately, I don’t believe   that asset purchases will be effective in this regard, but I’ll wait to say more about this later    Thank you, Mr Chairman     I have a question for you, Mr Chairman  When you say the   Treasury will offset what we do, is it going to take actions that will leave the duration in the   private sector the same?     I’m talking about the other action     Yes, in terms of the Treasuries     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I favor alternative B without   paragraph 4  I’m opposed to paragraph 4 of alternative B, because it recommends additional   purchases of Treasuries  Why do people want to do these extra purchases?  I think there are two   reasons  One is that they’re hoping to combat deflation or disinflation by doing this, and I don’t   think that this will be effective  I think the situation we’re in right now with our monetary base   is akin to something like the following  We’ve got a child and some cake  I think everyone   around the table would be happy if the child ate one slice of cake, maybe even two slices of cake    But those of us who are worried about inflation are worried about the child eating a whole cake,   and, actually, there are a dozen cakes in front of this child  This is the situation with reserves   right now  We’re talking about adding a 13th cake  It’s not going to add much  I’m not worried   about extra inflation risks from this 13th cake, but, at the same time I don’t think it’s going to   have much effect on disinflation  The only thing I will say about this is that it’s moving in the   wrong direction  The right direction in terms of controlling inflation risk, making sure that, as   President Lacker was saying, we’re able to follow the right kinds of policies to ensure that we   don’t have undue amounts of inflation, is to shrink the balance sheet   August 10, 2010 117 of 160             The other reason I think people are interested in doing this is that they hope it’s a way to   stimulate the economy  We are in a very poor situation in terms of the real economy—  9½ percent unemployment and very high persistence in that rate  This is not a good situation    Unfortunately, while I agree that our purchase of nearly $2 trillion of agency securities and   Treasury debt drove down the term premium and served to stimulate the economy in late 2008   and early 2009, I don’t think that further purchases now would be able to drive down the term   premium  We were able to influence the term premium in that period because liquidity problems   in the underlying markets made cross-market arbitrages difficult  Markets are not illiquid in   2010, so our ability to influence the term premium is going to be slight or nonexistent during this   period   I’ll give you one teeny piece of evidence along these lines from the very recent past  As   the Board staff’s work acknowledges very clearly, the evidence we do have is largely based on   the earlier period, when markets were impaired  On August 2, 2010, the difference between the   10-year yield and the 2-year yield was 243 basis points  On August 3, 2010, The Wall Street   Journal online had an article on predictions about what we were going to do, and it essentially   predicted that we might well engage in these kinds of purchases  On August 3, the difference   between the 10-year yield and two-year yield fell from 243 to 241—two basis points  The next   day it went back up to 242 basis points  So that release of information, in itself, which was a   surprise to me—I can’t say how much of a surprise it was to others—did not seem to have much   of an effect on markets   I think there’s useful analogy to be drawn  I’d say we all agree that we cannot stimulate   the economy effectively in 2010 by restarting the TAF or the CPFF  Those programs worked by   improving impaired market function in 2008 and 2009, and those markets are not impaired in   August 10, 2010 118 of 160             2010  It’s for exactly the same reasons that we should not be thinking we can stimulate   effectively now by buying more Treasuries  Governor Kohn raised a great point about   expectational effects, and I do agree that we should be able to have a stimulative impact by   influencing people’s forecasts of future short rates  But I would much prefer to do that through   language as opposed to actual purchases of Treasuries   What I hear around the table is a great deal of unhappiness with the state of the American   economy, and I share that absolutely  But I think what we should be resisting is the view that the   Federal Reserve is the right vehicle to fight this situation  We’re not  If this is going to be   fought, it’s going to have to be done by somebody else—we’re not the ones who have those   choices to make  But there are tools available  There’s work going on at the Minneapolis Fed   about how we can mimic negative nominal interest rates through cutting consumption taxes that   would stimulate consumption demand—that would be one way to proceed  But that’s not our   job  The right way to try to get around the fact that we’re at the zero lower bound is through the   use of other policy tools, not through monetary policy  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Mr Chairman     I’m sorry at this late a date to make one more suggestion     It seemed that there was some notion that it would be better to   think about this action as maintaining our holdings as opposed to suggesting a pattern of new   purchases  Well, one way to reflect that in the statement would be to drop the opening clause of   paragraph 4, “To help support the economic recovery in the context of price stability,” and   instead start with “The Committee will maintain the Federal Reserve’s holdings of securities”     The preceding three paragraphs certainly provide a lot of   motivation     Yes     Fine with me  "
8859,2010-09-21,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  David, do you have notions of   how well these judgment factors have improved your forecast historically?     Thanks     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I have talked to a number of   bankers and businesspeople in our District since the last meeting  These conversations have   circled around the same basic point, and it echoes much of what President Hoenig was just   referring to  Many businesses have resources available for investment, and many banks have   resources available for loans  Businesses are choosing not to use these resources to hire or   expand, and banks are choosing not to make loans  When asked why, they say the level of risk   associated with these new opportunities is too high to make them worthwhile  Instead, they put a   lot of those resources into financial investments  In other words, they foresee the risk-adjusted   September 21, 2010 51 of 151             returns on available 10-year business investments or bank loans to be smaller than the 1 percent   return embedded in a 10-year TIPS bond  If you think about a five-year horizon, it means that   they find the risks of five-year investments to be so prohibitive that they would rather invest in a   five-year TIPS bond that is paying 25 basis points   I think this is the fundamental question in the recovery  What is the source of the   perceived risk?  And I agree—President Fisher has emphasized this, and many of you have   mentioned this, as well—that some of this risk is attributable to uncertainties about the future tax   and regulatory environment  But I also believe that more must be going on  In my view, I think   households and firms are right to be uncertain about the likely performance of the US economy   over the next five to ten years  For example, the employment-to-population ratio has fallen to   585 percent, after being 627 percent in late 2007  Before this recession, it had not been this low   since late 1983  This change is mirrored in what is usually a more acyclical variable—labor   force participation—which has also reached a 25-year low   In my view, there’s a lot of uncertainty about the extent to which these changes in the   labor market are likely to reverse over the next five years  The issue is that these changes are in   many ways simply accelerations of existing trends  The employment-to-population ratio peaked   in 1999  Labor force participation peaked in 2000  The past decade, in some ways, can be seen   as one of labor market retrenchment that has accelerated over the past three years  With this   perspective, why would we expect significant increases in employment population or labor force   participation in the next three or four years?   There are other reasons for concern in the labor market  As I mentioned last time, over   the past two years the Beveridge curve has shifted to the right by 3 percentage points, meaning   that, for a given rate of job openings, unemployment is now 3 percentage points higher  Will it   September 21, 2010 52 of 151             shift back as the economy recovers?  Well, it’s far from clear  The good news is that it’s hard to   find any single microeconomic cause for this shift, and I can assure you that staff people in   Minneapolis have been looking for one, which gives one hope that it is not some transient fluke   But macroeconomics leads one to be a little less sanguine  In Minneapolis we looked at   Beveridge curves in the 1970s, and one of the things you have to do there is to recognize that   temporary layoffs were a significant part of 1970s unemployment and are essentially irrelevant   in the current recession  So we modified the historical curves by subtracting out the temporary   layoffs  Once we did that, we found there was about a 2 percentage point shift in the Beveridge   curve during the 1974–1975 recession, and that shift persisted throughout the recovery   What is the impact of this shift for monetary policy?  President Yellen is exactly right—  you have to be thinking about the entire equilibrium structure of the labor market  You really   need a full model of labor demand, and you need to think about how monetary policy will impact   that model of labor demand in a model in which you actually have unemployment  These kinds   of models are, at least by my reading of the literature, fairly scarce  The Shimer model to which   I referred in my speech last month would imply, unfortunately, a relatively high normal level of   unemployment  But again that model doesn’t have money in it  So how do you think about the   impact of monetary policy on unemployment in that context?  I’m not sure   I will just say that these issues leave me uncertain, and I think households and firms are   right to be uncertain about the medium-term performance of the United States labor market  In a   similar vein, I think they’re right to be uncertain about inflation  There are upside risks  The   fiscal situation in the United States might well lead one to worry about inflation over the next   five to ten years  Nonetheless, the Tealbook documents that the five-year inflation expectations   embedded in TIPS bonds have been drifting downward  There are at least two possible stories   September 21, 2010 53 of 151             for this downward drift in expectations  The first is conventional and may be due to expectations   of increased resource slack  The second is the one that President Bullard and I have been   emphasizing recently  This argues that if people expect that the nominal interest rate stays low   for a long period of time, their expectations of inflation will drift downward as the real interest   rate rises   Which story is right?  Well, we’d better get the right answer to this question, because if   we guess wrong, it has the potential to lead us into many years of low or even negative inflation   How can we begin to resolve these uncertainties about labor markets and prices for   households and firms?  I don’t think we can do so fully, but we can help by being part of the   solution as opposed to being part of the problem, by providing more clarity about our own future   choices  At a minimum, we need to be clear about our preconditions for any future   accommodation, the form that that accommodation will take, and, most importantly in my view,   what we expect that accommodation to be likely to accomplish  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’m basically willing to support   alternative B with some minor changes  I think that paragraph 4 in B seems to suggest strongly   that we will provide more accommodation in the next meeting  I think we should try to weaken   it slightly to indicate that we might not be willing to act  So, instead of saying “is prepared to   provide additional accommodation as needed,” I would prefer to say something like “be prepared   to act as needed to support the economic recovery”  But I view that as something of a minor   issue   Why not A?  I have problems with A, and it’s not that I doubt that the unemployment rate   is above its current dual mandate level  I would put that figure closer to 8 percent than 7 or 6¾,   but it’s certainly below 96 percent  My concern with A is credibility  What will the American   people think if they hear we’re doing A?  Are they going to expect this move to lead the   unemployment rate to fall by 1 or 2 percentage points over the next two years?  Do they think of   this as being the main governmental response to the unemployment problem in the United   States?  The estimate that Bill mentioned, the FRB/US estimate of the macroeconomic impact of   the purchases in alternative A1 and A2, is a fall of 02 percentage point of unemployment over   the next two years and an increase of 01 percentage point in inflation over that same period  I   think we should be clear about what we are hoping to gain by doing A if we go down that path; I   have a footnote to that effect in our statement that says, “Our best available economic models   estimate that our purchase will generate an additional fall in the unemployment rate of   September 21, 2010 101 of 151             approximately 02 percentage point over the next two years and an increase in the inflation rate   of approximately 01 percentage point over that same period, if all else remains constant”  We   could say “ceteris paribus,” if we wanted to be geeky And I would go on to say that future   purchases of a similar magnitude are likely to have smaller effects, but that’s just an option  But   I think we should be clear about what we’re actually hoping to achieve by doing this   We should do whatever is possible to meet our dual mandate  Here I disagree a little bit   with President Lacker in that I don’t think we get to make up our mandate—I think that it’s the   Congress’s role to tell us what to do   But we should be clear about what we view as our   limitations in meeting that mandate  Without that clarity, I think we can only be exposed to a   loss of institutional credibility   Now, as some others around the table said, I’m worried about the possibility of ongoing   disinflation  For me that concern is especially over the next year or 18 months, and I’m   concerned that simply announcing that we don’t want to have disinflation, saying that we’d like   to have prices go up, may not be enough to accomplish that goal  I’m concerned, in other words,   not about what price level we want to achieve, but rather about the policy instruments that we   have available to achieve what we want to  In your Jackson Hole speech, Mr Chairman, you   spelled out three possible tools  lowering the interest rate on excess reserves, offering stronger   forward guidance, and purchasing more Treasuries  I think the first two approaches have their   problems  They don’t seem to be on the table at this stage anyway, but they could generate this   deflationary steady state of the kind that President Bullard’s article, “Seven Faces of ‘The Peril’”   describes  So I think the option that’s on the table to try to confront disinflation is buying more   Treasuries   September 21, 2010 102 of 151             In terms of the staff estimates of the effects that Bill discussed, as far as I understand   them, they’re based on taking this portfolio-balance effect that’s been estimated in earlier work   and putting it in the FRB/US model  If we bought $2 trillion of Treasuries, it would generate—  and this is assuming total linearity in the response, which I think is far too extreme—40 basis   points in inflation  I don’t view this as a strong dam against significant disinflationary pressures    The usual intuition is that having banks hold more reserves—that is, if we put more stuff on the   balance sheet—it will put upward pressure on the price level and inflation expectations  But this   intuition is all about scarcity—that reserves are scarce and their associated liquidity advantages   are scarce  Instead, banks are currently holding $1 trillion dollars of excess reserves—reserves   are not scarce  I would say that if you look at the staff’s balance sheet forecast, they don’t see   reserves as being scarce until sometime in 2018  So trying to play off the scarcity of reserves is   going to be a very subtle device to work with  I don’t see these three tools as being highly   effective ways to combat significant disinflation  What should we do instead?  President Evans   talked about the Spanish Inquisition  Here it comes  [Laughter]     The problem with open market operations is that they require   the Fed to give up reserves for assets of equal value, given the current price level  These kinds   of exchanges put no pressure on the price level when the system is awash in excess reserves    What we need to do is give up the dollars for nothing, to do what Milton Friedman described as a   helicopter drop of currency  As the Chairman noted in his famous 2002 speech, this kind of   handout of nominal wealth has the potential to generate upward pressure on the price level   In my view we need to do some “blue sky” thinking about how the FOMC can best   approximate a helicopter drop  At the Minneapolis Fed, my research and legal staff have been   September 21, 2010 103 of 151             combing through the Federal Reserve Act and through a great 2004 working paper by David   Small and Jim Clouse in order to figure out how to do so  The outcome of that analysis is that   the Federal Reserve Act does provide ways for the Fed to approximate a helicopter drop  For   example, Section 10(b) puts few strictures on the quality of collateral that is needed to back   advances made at depository institutions for the discount window  By making nonrecourse   advances or advances backed by risky collateral, the Fed can implicitly inject—actually,   explicitly inject—nominal wealth into the economy  And by specifying particular kinds of   collateral, such as residential mortgages or small business loans, the Fed could potentially   stimulate particular kinds of real activity   This sounds radical—let’s get more radical  Section 14(b) allows the FOMC to purchase   some kinds of state and local government obligations  These purchases need not be in an open   market  By exploiting this option, the FOMC could pay face value for state and local   government obligations which, in fact, have credit risk  People talk about monetization of   Treasury debt  This is talking about monetization—serious monetization—of state and local   government debt  This, again, could stimulate inflation and, possibly, real activity   These ideas are still sketchy  We need a great deal of staff work to figure out their legal   and economic ramifications, and they come, obviously, with significant amounts of medium-  term and longer-term institutional risk  I will stress that I myself might end up opposing them   [laughter] once I see the initial staff work  But I would emphasize that, given the risk of   disinflation that we face and given that the tools we have at our disposal do not overwhelm us by   their potential, we have to be willing to explore all of these  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
8882,2010-10-15,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Like President Bullard, I want to   thank the staff for preparing two outstanding memos on these challenging issues  I was delighted to   see the thoughtful input from the Dallas and Cleveland Feds, especially because the lead author on   the Cleveland memo was my first PhD advisee at Iowa  I like to think of these memos as the   important initial responses to Governor Warsh’s call a few meetings ago for more input from   regional Feds other than New York   My remarks focus on the following limited question  If the FOMC were to undertake   further accommodation, how should it do so?  And how should it communicate about that   accommodation?  In particular, I will not discuss at this time whether it’s a good idea to undertake   further accommodation  Since I’ve joined these meetings, I’ve been consistently supportive of the   “extended period” language  At the same time, at meetings earlier in the year I expressed support   for shrinking the size of the balance sheet, and, in a similar vein, I argued in the Committee against   the August reinvestment decision  I would say that my attitude towards further accommodation   mirrors these past positions  I have significant reservations about any further use of asset purchases,   and I would prefer, instead, that any further accommodation be done through forward guidance  In   particular, I would prefer to be quantitatively explicit about what we mean by “extended period,”   and then implement accommodation by varying that quantity in response to shocks   October 15, 2010 19 of 62             Why am I concerned about quantitative easing—I was in Britain, and they like to call it   “QE”—as a vehicle of accommodation?  In my view, its risk–return tradeoff does not warrant its   use  First, its expected upside is limited  The theoretical baseline result in, for example, Eggertsson   and Woodford, is that quantitative easing has no effect on the economy other than through forward   guidance  On the empirical side, there is some evidence that the LSAPs can achieve modest short-  term reductions in the term premium  Now, these estimates are imprecise and may well be quite   short-term in nature  Even when we feed these estimates into FRB/US, these reductions imply, at   best, modest improvements in economic performance   Relative to these modest benefits, I see many possible risks  I’ll talk about five that came to   me, I would say, over the course of a minute—I’m sure by thinking more deeply, we could come up   with others  Here’s the first concern  The New York Fed has emphasized that the impact of LSAPs   is primarily related to the expected accumulated stock of purchases  I’ll add that I think that’s right    I believe that once we initiate any new LSAP, whether we use a small purchase or a large purchase,   there will be huge uncertainty about that expected accumulated stock of purchases  So that’s one   concern  Another concern is  How will other large holders of United States Treasuries react to our   move?  If they were to decide to sell much of their holdings, would that undo or even swamp our   attempt to remove duration risk from the market?  Third, how will foreign exchange markets react?    I realize that one benefit of this policy is some downward movement in the dollar  But there could   well be too much movement in the dollar  In fact, one could imagine the extreme outcome where   the dollar’s place as a reserve currency might well be in jeopardy  Moving to another concern, if we   have a $3 to $4 trillion balance sheet, can we effectively raise rates?  Will our new reserve-draining   tools work as we expect when we’re faced with an inflationary threat?  Finally, a large-scale asset   purchase exposes our balance sheet to interest rate risk  That is, in fact, the point of it, in some   October 15, 2010 20 of 62             sense—we’re taking duration out of the market and onto our balance sheet  That exposes our   payments to Treasury to interest rate risk and exposes taxpayers to interest rate risk  How will   taxpayers react to that extra source of risk that confronts them?   Those are five possible risks, and, as I said, if we thought more, we could come up with   others  I would say that there is tremendous uncertainty about all of these questions, so further   large-scale asset purchases seem to be an approach with limited upside potential and possibly large   downside risks   In contrast, forward guidance is a relatively low-risk alternative to LSAP  I talked to market   participants, and they seem to interpret the FOMC’s statement as saying that our plan is to keep the   fed funds rate near zero for six months  If we wanted to offer further accommodation, I would use   more precise language and change the last sentence in the fourth paragraph of draft statement 1 to   read, “…are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate into mid-2012”  We   can readily vary this length of time in a continuous way in response appropriately to shocks   As we build towards the November meeting, I think the staff has done an excellent job of   telling us about how a given amount of purchases of long-term securities maps into our   conventional monetary policy tool; specifically, a purchase of $150 billion of long-term securities   seems to map into a fed funds rate reduction of about 25 basis points  It would be great to have   some kind of similar equivalence between quantitative formulations of “extended period” and   conventional monetary policy  I would encourage the staff to help us understand that connection   better   Why do I like forward guidance?  First, unlike the LSAP, it has a firm grounding in recent   economic theory, such as that of Eggertsson and Woodford or Adam and Billi  Those papers show   that if a central bank is currently at the zero lower bound, it should respond to adverse shocks by   October 15, 2010 21 of 62             committing to future accommodation  I think this approach could go well beyond those papers—  the basic idea of using forward accommodation to substitute for current accommodation is likely to   emerge as a robust heuristic in a wide class of economic models, as long as participants in those   models are forward-looking  The second reason I like forward guidance is that we’re already using   this tool, so it would represent a natural extension to our current approach  All I’m doing is   suggesting is that we be more precise about what our language means  I think going to the LSAP   would introduce large policy uncertainties into an environment that is already rife with them,   whereas merely changing the length of time corresponding to the “extended period” language would   introduce far fewer uncertainties   I’ll close with some thoughts about communication  I prefer draft statement 1 with the first   version of paragraph 5  Echoing the thoughts we’ve heard from President Bullard, as well as, I   think those in President Plosser’s memo, I certainly could be persuaded in more usual circumstances   that we should adopt a quantitative inflation or price-level target—in fact, I would lean towards a   price-level target  In the current circumstances, however, we would need to include a corresponding   target for unemployment  I think such a target would be difficult to determine, given the range of   views in the Committee about this  Even more importantly, I think it would be politically   challenging ever to adjust this target upwards once we establish it   My second thought about communication is that I really like the idea of the Chairman   explaining the majority’s thinking in a press conference  As I’ve indicated in public remarks, I   think in August the markets failed to understand exactly our rationale for making the move we did    Eventually it became clear, but I think we could have clarified it in 15 minutes after the meeting  I   don’t see any reason why the Chairman has to be responsible for explaining minority views  But I   think it would be very helpful to explain the majority’s thinking in a press conference  As President   October 15, 2010 22 of 62             Rosengren pointed out, of course, this is easy for me to say, because I’m not the one doing the press   conference, but I have a lot of confidence that the Chairman will do a good job on this   One thing did not show up in any of the memos, but I think it’s really important in terms of   thinking about communication, and that is that we need to have some clear way of communicating   our best estimate of the impact of any further accommodation that we undertake  I originally   suggested this as a footnote to the statement, and later several of my colleagues told me that that   probably was not a workable idea, but I think the minutes would easily accommodate such   estimates  If we actually do undertake further accommodation, we could easily have a paragraph or   two that says something like, “staff estimates of the impact of that accommodation are as   follows…”  I think we need to be clear with the public about what we expect to achieve through   our actions, especially given that what we expect to achieve is rather limited  That would leave the   floor clearer for other actors in the policy space to get involved  To summarize, if we were to   undertake further accommodation, I would recommend that we translate the “extended period”   language into a precise number that we could then adjust in response to positive or negative shocks   as needed  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
8902,2010-11-02,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’m new, so I hesitate to speak on   this, but I think one thing we want to be careful about regarding the third issue is that the press   does tend to exaggerate statements  They’re always trying to read who’s on what side, and they   play that game  Nonetheless, especially when we face such difficult issues as we face now, I   think it is useful to hear reasonable dialogue and discussion about the matters confronting the   Committee  In your Jackson Hole speech, Mr Chairman, you laid out certain sets of tools that   are available, and, in my view, it has been good to have various members of the Committee   speak on it  President Dudley spoke on it; I’ve spoken on it; President Rosengren and President   Evans have spoken on it  I actually learned from reading these speeches, and I assume that the   general public also learns something  So I think there is a value to that, and we don’t want to kill   all of that just because some blog in the Wall Street Journal is counting out who’s on what side     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Brian, as I think about QE, I can   understand how it’s affecting spreads, so I can see why the break-even spread might go up as a   result of anticipated QE  I’ve been puzzling about why real yields have shifted down so   dramatically in response—we see this 50 basis point decline in the 5-year real yield and a   40 basis point decline in the 10-year real yield  This is actually going maybe the opposite of   what I would have thought  What is the staff thinking about that, that is, about why real yields   responded so dramatically?     It sounds to me that that’s more about the slope of the yield   curve, but it seemed like the whole level is falling, although I may be misinterpreting what’s in   the data  It seemed like the levels of real returns themselves are falling, and it’s not just that the   November 2–3, 2010 23 of 238             slope is getting shallower  In fact, I think you could argue that the slope has not gotten   shallower     Actually you probably could write something even if you   didn’t disagree     Thank you, Mr Chairman  This is a question that I hope will   prove helpful in preparing for our discussion in January about structural unemployment  One   piece of information that crossed my desk recently was that the percent of the labor force that   had been unemployed for more than 52 weeks was about 04 percent in 2007, and now that   number is 29 percent  So, when we’re talking about the modeling of the NAIRU, how do you   November 2–3, 2010 39 of 238             think about that group in terms of the kind of downward pressure they’d be putting on wages?  Is   there some special attention paid to them?  Well, I guess I’ll just throw that out as a general   question     I’m referring to the people who have been unemployed for   greater than 52 weeks  The reason to include them one for one in the NAIRU would be that   you’re thinking they’re the same as somebody who’s been unemployed for four weeks in terms   of what kind of downward pressure they’d be putting on wages  Presumably you don’t think   about them in the same way, but then how do you distinguish across these groups when you’re   thinking about modeling the NAIRU?     I’m not as convinced as you are that this is second order  It is   a very novel experience for the United States, fortunately, to have so many people unemployed   for so long  It just seems to me intuitively that that group would exert different kinds of   downward pressures on wages, because when employers make hiring decisions, they will view   those candidates very differently from those who have been unemployed for only 10 weeks   November 2–3, 2010 40 of 238               Thank you, Mr Chairman  Uncertainty remains a dominant   problem, if not the dominant problem, in the recovery  Uncertainty was a key factor in our   conversations with local business contacts about hiring, for example  It is true that both large   and small businesses in the Ninth District report doing significantly better in 2010 relative to   2009  As one contact put it, “as long as you’re not in construction, you’re doing great”  One   consistent theme was that sales are up some relative to 2009, but profits are up by considerably   more, and this local story is borne out in the national data  Basically, firms have experienced   sharp declines in unit labor costs  Nonetheless, relatively few firms in the Ninth District are   looking to expand their workforces greatly   This then raises the question  Why aren’t firms willing to hire more workers, given that   they are making so much more money per worker than they did a year ago?  They are uncertain   about the sustainability of their current high profits  Their uncertainty stems from at least two   sources  First, they see a significant risk that demand for their product might fall  Second, they   believe that the large federal deficit in the United States could well lead to higher taxes on labor   and capital  If they did make new hires, and a sufficiently large fall in profits materialized, they   would then have to fire the newly hired workers, and they found that process to be a painful one   November 2–3, 2010 72 of 238             in 2009  Basically, they see the possibility of firing costly enough to offset the current profits   from hiring   At the national level, asset prices reveal that uncertainty seems to be retarding investment   and consumption  Over the intermeeting period, the spread between 5-year TIPS and 5-year   nominal Treasuries widened, and this increase in the spread is a welcome indication that inflation   expectations, or at least inflation risk, shifted upward in the wake of the last FOMC meeting    But the levels of both nominal and real yields seem shockingly low to me  The real yield on   5-year TIPS bonds has basically fallen to around minus 50 basis points  The real yield on   10-year TIPS bonds is below positive 50 basis points  These low yields strike me as being   indicative of risk aversion, and large amounts of it  On the margin, banks perceive these low real   yields to be better than risk-adjusted returns on new loans of similar horizons  Firms perceive   these low real yields to be better than the risk-adjusted return on new investments of similar   horizons, and hiring would be one such investment  Consumers are willing to save at these   lower yields, because they foresee the possibility of adverse income shocks affecting them at   some point in the future, combined, probably, with an inability to borrow to insulate themselves   against those shocks   Others have been willing to talk about policy in this round, so I’ll talk a little bit about   policy myself  What can monetary policy do to alleviate these uncertainties?  At a minimum, it   seems that monetary policy should do its best not to add to the high degree of policy uncertainty   that exists already  And I worry that the options that have been presented to us by the staff don’t   really fulfill that objective  It is, as President Bullard has emphasized to us, desirable to have   conditionality in policy, but it is also critical to convey more about the policy reaction function   than is currently being done in the alternatives   November 2–3, 2010 73 of 238             I’ll mention two scenarios we could face in six months’ time, or maybe a little later, say,   in June of next year  In one scenario, the good scenario, employment has grown by 1 to   1½ percent by next June, so something like between 13 million and 2 million jobs have been   created  And inflation has risen—maybe it’s running about 13 percent over the first half of next   year  In that good scenario, inflation will still be low relative to desired levels, at least the   desired levels of some around the table  And unemployment will still be well above our   mandate-consistent levels, again, in the view of some around the table  The bad scenario is that   unemployment next June is at 10½ percent, and inflation has softened further to around   08 percent   I think we should achieve clarity among ourselves as best we can about what we would   do in these two kinds of scenarios  Would we want to have further accommodation in the good   scenario, or not?  Would we want to have further accommodation in the bad scenario, or not?  I   think we have to talk through those things, and I think it would be good if the minutes were able   to reflect something about what our conditionality is, even if we can’t reflect it in the statement   itself   I’ll close with one final dangerous comment—because it’s somewhat ad hoc—on   President Evans’s quasi-inflation nutter perorations  Let’s suppose we all agree that 2 percent is   the inflation target  The question for us is  How can we even go about achieving that?    Quantitative easing, according the Tealbook, Book A, provides about a 10 basis point increase in   the inflation rate over a two-year period  This isn’t getting us to 2 percent  So I think the   question for us is not just whether we all agree on 1½ percent, or 2 percent, or whatever the   number is  The question is  What are the tools we have available right now to get to that level?    Thank you, Mr Chairman   November 2–3, 2010 74 of 238               Mr Chairman     I’m sorry to interrupt, but in terms of the equivalency you’re   describing, my understanding is it’s about the expected stock of purchases     I also was going to say that the word “levels” has the   ambiguity that Bill is suggesting  The word “levels” is supposed to connote an interval, I think,   of some kind     That’s true     I would rather use “hog wild” somewhere  [Laughter]     Thanks  I was worried about the same point that President   Rosengren is addressing, because I think the clause right after that undercuts that ability to   adjust, right?     No, that’s fine       Thank you, Mr Chairman  I remain concerned about doing   more quantitative easing or doing another large-scale asset purchase  First, I perceive the   November 2–3, 2010 165 of 238             expected benefits of further—I’m going to keep saying “quantitative easing” because that’s what   I’ve written here—quantitative easing [laughter] to be small, especially in terms of inflation, but   also in terms of unemployment  The forecasts on pages 4 and 5 of the Tealbook Part A strike me   as consistent with this view  Second, I believe that quantitative easing may well have significant   downside risks  I will not go through these in great detail  Others have spoken extremely   eloquently about them  President Fisher, President Hoenig, President Plosser, President Lacker,   all elaborated on these risks at great length and, I’m afraid, in a compelling way   But I will talk about one risk  I think this is the most direct risk coming out of a large-  scale asset purchase, because it’s what the purchase is all about, namely, to take duration risk out   of the private sector and transfer it to taxpayers—that is what the heart of the LSAP is  We have   to be thinking about whom we’re taking risk from and whom we’re transferring it to  The   essence of the LSAP relies on a segmented markets view of the world, where there are some   people participating in bond markets and other people who have less access to it  The people   who are participating in the markets are the ones who benefit from this  The ones who are not   participating are the ones who don’t benefit  This follows up on President Fisher’s eloquent   description of the distributional consequences of our policies  Typically I would think the people   who are participating in asset markets are wealthier and more educated, while the people who are   not able to are less wealthy, less educated  In addition, while staff work has been thorough and   very compelling on the asset pricing side, the ultimate macroeconomic impact of this risk shift   has remained murky to me   Despite these concerns, and given your arguments yesterday, Mr Chairman, and given   the strength of consensus among the voters in the Committee, and I’ll emphasize the word   “voters” here, I’m willing to go along with alternative B  Let me talk about ways alternative B   November 2–3, 2010 166 of 238             could be strengthened  First, the word “unacceptably” in paragraph 2 seems to imply   considerably more control over the recovery process than we actually have—I think we’re taking   ownership for slow economic growth through that word  I would recommend the word   “disappointingly” or more simply the word “too”   Second, and more substantively, I would go along with President Pianalto’s   recommendation of moving paragraph 4 from alternative A into alternative B, and I liked her   rewording of it as well  In general, it strikes me that an LSAP is not necessarily the most   convincing tool that we have available  I think forward guidance, as in paragraph 4 of alternative   A, is a tool whose costs and benefits I understand better  I think President Plosser’s suggestion   of cutting the interest rate on excess reserves also is something that we should study more—  again, it could help us achieve our dual mandate  We’re not competing with huge benefits on the   table here—the LSAP is not going to take us down to 5 percent unemployment—so I think we   have to explore all the possibilities   My third suggestion relates to paragraph 5 of alternative B  It says we’re going to do this   regular review of the LSAP based on incoming information  I would like to suggest that, after   “in light of incoming information,” we add the phrase “about the rate of progress toward its   objective”  The idea is that, if we were in the lucky circumstances of seeing 13 million jobs   created over the next six months—which I think is unlikely, I have to admit, given my own   forecast—that might lead us not to do further accommodation  So I want to put the focus on the   rate of progress, not the levels   Finally, I really feel that this institution faces a credibility problem if we are not clear that   we expect we are going in the right direction, but we expect our movement to be “limited,”   “modest,” “small”—I don’t know what word you want to use  I have not heard anyone around   November 2–3, 2010 167 of 238             the table suggest that we’re going to be making striking progress toward our dual mandate by   adopting this program  I think we should be clear with the public about that, and the way we can   do that is in our communication through the minutes  Thank you, Mr Chairman     No, I suggested “about the rate of progress towards its   objectives”       That’s fine     Okay  Sounds good     What else do we care about?     Let me suggest another alternative, which would be to change   the word “concerning” to “including”     “The rate of progress towards the objective”  You had   suggested the phrase “concerning the rate of progress towards objectives,” and I’m suggesting   changing the word “concerning” to “including”     Without trying to get into the business of editing this—I will   get into the business of editing it  [Laughter]  I would just suggest that you lead with your   second sentence, which is about the justification for why it might go above the 35 percent; that   is, start by talking about the reasons for that, and then say explicitly, “in order to help maintain   liquidity and avoid dislocations in individual securities, SOMA holdings may exceed, on   occasion, the 35…”       Where is your op-ed?  "
8928,2010-12-14,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Our Public Affairs Department   has been gathering information for its 2011 Ninth District forecast  In doing so, they have found   a growing sense of optimism since the end of August  In general, it seems that businesses are   beginning to be more willing to think longer term, three to five years out  They’re beginning to   make plans to hire, increase space, and add equipment This optimism is widespread across most   sectors of the economy  Mining is strong, due to solid prices and increased demand  Farmers   had a great harvest in terms of prices and yields, and this spilled into warehousing,   transportation, food processing, and energy  More interestingly, both manufacturing and   services are looking to expand  However, the general level of optimism does not extend into   construction  A big caveat, of course, is sustainability  I’m describing a pattern that has become   apparent only over the past three months, and business attitudes certainly remain susceptible to   shocks of various kinds   At the national level, I will focus on an issue that preoccupied us a year ago  How much   slack is there in the economy?  Right now, we are following a highly accommodative monetary   policy, and this accommodative policy is consistent with typical rules, because current output is   so much lower than our typical measures of potential output  Hence, as we decide upon future   monetary policy actions, we need to have good measures of potential output   The Tealbook measures potential output largely by focusing on supply-side issues, and I   view it as essentially using a production function approach that tries to gauge maximum   December 14, 2010 29 of 127             sustainable production in the economy, given the existing labor force and capital stock  So its   measures would take account of changes in productivity or changes in the quality of the labor   force, but they certainly abstract from shocks to demand  This approach is definitely a common   one—common enough, I think, to be called the conventional one  But it may not be foolproof    Consider, for example, a 30 percent to 40 percent fall in home prices, along the lines that this   country has experienced  This shock is going to lower the wealth of many people  Let’s focus,   though, on retired people  Those people will demand fewer goods, and in so doing they will   lower output and employment in the economy as a whole  Using monetary policy to try to boost   output above this level would lead to inflationary pressures    I want to be clear about a couple of things  First, the issue I’m raising is entirely distinct   from my comments about the possibility of increased mismatch in labor markets, and I’m hoping   that we’ll get more clarity on the issue of mismatch at our next meeting  And I’m certainly not   arguing that potential output is always equal to observed output  Inflation and inflation   expectations adjust sluggishly to shocks, and this sluggish adjustment creates a need for   monetary policy interventions  What I am saying is that the right measure of potential output is   the level of output that would exist in a hypothetical world in which inflation and inflation   expectations were fully flexible  Once you define it this way, it’s clear that potential output has   to move in response to both supply and demand shocks   With this in mind, is there any systematic way to take account of shocks to demand when   we measure output gaps?  Many formulations of the Phillips curve provide a linkage between   inflation dynamics and output gaps  And this linkage is an attractive one, because it’s robust—  it’s robust to the demand shocks that I mentioned, and it’s robust to the mismatch possibilities   that I mentioned  In Minneapolis, we’ve been trying to use a particular kind of Phillips curve,   December 14, 2010 30 of 127             the New Keynesian Phillips curves, to impute measures of the output gap  These equations link   current inflation to inflation expectations and the output gap, which is really a marginal cost gap    Then, when we take measures of inflation expectations from the Cleveland Fed, we can compute   estimates of the output gap  We’ve done this using both simple New Keynesian Phillips curves   that ignore trend inflation and more sophisticated ones that take account of trend inflation    There’s certainly some heterogeneity of results, but, in general, the implied measures are less   negative than the Tealbook’s estimate of negative 6½ percent  I’d say that these measures   certainly are meant to be suggestive at this point, but my main message is that the measures of   potential output that are relevant for a monetary policymaker should take into account demand   disturbances, and ones that ignore demand disturbances are likely upwardly biased  The second   message, which I’ll deliver with considerably less force, is that, given the observed behavior of   inflation and inflation expectations, it’s possible that these biases may well be large   So as we consider changes to our monetary policy stance, I believe that we should put   some weight on these possibilities  For my part, as I’ll discuss in more detail in the next   go-round, these possibilities lead me to shade my estimate of the output gap from the   Tealbook’s, which is around minus 6½ percent, up to something closer to minus 4 percent   instead  Thank you, Mr Chairman     We all have it memorized, so that’s fine  [Laughter]     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I am in favor of alternative B, but   I would like to expand on that to talk about what we should be doing in the next few months    I’m going to talk first about how we should structure further accommodation or tightening, and   then offer some tentative thoughts about appropriate conditionality   When thinking about further easing, I find it useful to return to the three tools that you,   Mr Chairman, outlined last August in Jackson Hole  the LSAPs, forward guidance, and the   IOER  I would recommend against doing another LSAP for a couple of reasons  As I suggested   in October, I think that we have relatively little control over its effects  Its ultimate impact   depends on the accumulated stock of purchases that markets expect us to undertake, and that   dependence combined with its relative novelty leaves us at the mercy of outside influences    Indeed, even tweets from former governors of Alaska can end up affecting those expectations    [Laughter]   I like the other two tools better  The staff’s analysis on pages 7 and 9 of Tealbook Part B   indicate to me that forward guidance can be an effective way to provide further accommodation    I think President Evans spoke quite eloquently about that in his remarks  The work in the   Tealbook is based on the FRB/US model, but it seems to me that forward guidance would   emerge as a useful response to the zero lower bound in any economic model in which agents are   somewhat forward-looking and the central bank is, in fact, capable of commitment  These   statements I’m making about the efficacy of forward guidance do not necessarily apply to the   LSAPs, which do not have that same effectiveness in a wide class of economic models   December 14, 2010 95 of 127             I also like the idea of cutting the IOER rate, as President Plosser suggested last time    Now, I have to say that cutting the interest rate on excess reserves by 25 basis points is likely to   have only a slight effect on the economy, but it would have the additional benefit of solving what   I’m becoming convinced is a big communication problem for us  When I give speeches, I’ve   found that the public has a hard time understanding why we’re paying a positive interest on bank   reserves when we’re trying to stimulate the economy  They see a positive IOER rate as a sign   that we’re willing to subsidize the banks even at the cost of not fulfilling our dual mandate  So I   think that in addition to providing some stimulus, it would have an effect of helping solve this   communication issue   Having given some of my thoughts on the easing front, let me turn now to the tightening   front  My recollection is that last spring we reached a tentative consensus, though certainly not   unanimity, on how to proceed in tightening  I think it’s a good idea to reopen that conversation,   as Presidents Lockhart and Hoenig have suggested  My recollection of that consensus was that   we should begin by draining reserves, then raising interest on excess reserves, and then   beginning asset sales  I was happy enough with that consensus—I can be flexible about how we   would order things  I’ve heard some suggest that we could tighten by using the regular review   process in alternative B to curtail our announced LSAP, but I don’t think that’s consistent with   my recollection of our tentative consensus about the structure of tightening  So I don’t think of   the regular LSAP review process as being the right way to initiate tightening  Instead, I view our   statement in November as being a strong commitment to buy $600 billion of longer-term   Treasuries over the next eight months  I’ve thought of the regular review process as necessary,   given that we don’t really know the full range of downside risks of LSAPs because of their   relative novelty  For example, I thought there was a possibility, though not a high probability   December 14, 2010 96 of 127             one, that the dollar could have fallen to 50 euro cents, and, if it had, then I think we all would   have wanted to curtail the LSAP  I thought the regular review process was a way to make clear   to markets and the public as a whole that we stood on guard against such possibilities   Having talked about easing and tightening, let me turn to conditionality  As I mentioned   in the first go-round, my preferred estimate of the output gap is near minus 4 percent, rather than   the Tealbook estimate of minus 6½  If I take that number and plug it into the Taylor 1999 rule   on page 37 of the Tealbook Part B, I get something like minus 180 basis points  So let’s call it   between minus 150 and minus 200  Now, our target rate is between zero and 25 basis points and   can’t be negative  But suppose we assume that markets expected the accumulated stock of the   Fed’s purchases of long-term Treasuries will grow to be around $2 trillion  The staff estimates   in the last Tealbook would translate those $2 trillion of purchases into a reduction in the fed   funds rate of 250 basis points  All of this obviously has confidence bounds around it, but   anyway, that would be the translation  So, if you put that plus 25 basis points of our current   interest on excess reserves rate together with the reduction of 250 basis points, we get a policy   stance right now of negative 225 basis points  It’s a little low for me compared with my minus   180, but in the right ballpark, I would say   So going forward I don’t believe we should be adjusting policy to every change in the   output gap or realized inflation  I view it as being a little less continuous perhaps than President   Bullard sees it  But I do think we should be adjusting policy to sufficiently large changes in the   output gap or realized inflation in either direction, and I’m thinking right now that those would   be changes in the range of somewhere between 100 to 150 basis points  Thank you, Mr   Chairman  "
8955,2011-01-25,"  I guess what I took from the table—and you can certainly   build on this, Bruce—is that there was a considerable range and a considerable amount of   uncertainty about each of these points  Would that be a fair conclusion?     Thanks, Mr Chairman  I want to thank the authors for their   papers, and I want to thank Ayşegül, Jason, and Bruce, in particular, for their thoughtful   discussion  I learned a lot from all of the papers  I think what affected my thinking the most was   the treatment of the house-lock effect  Before I read these papers, I would have said that was   something to be really concerned about, but I came away convinced that it is probably relatively   unimportant   I’m going to say a few words—actually, maybe more than a few  I’m always asked,   “What’s the biggest surprise since you took over this job?”  I don’t give the true answer, but I’ll   give it now, knowing that it will not be revealed to anybody, because it’s FOMC-protected, for   five years  [Laughter]     I think this is not going to make the minutes     I think the biggest surprise to me was that I managed to be   referred to as the “godfather of structural unemployment”  Therefore, I think I have to say more   than a few words  First, I’ll say something about definitions  This term “structural” goes back   probably to the Cowles Commission, and maybe even before then  Its meaning really depends   on who you are and what you’re doing  “Structural” means the things you can’t affect using the   policy tool you have in hand  So if I’m the Congress, you know, what I can do to the   unemployment rate is a lot more than what I can do sitting here at the FOMC table  I’ll talk   about that in a second  I guess I heard two different definitions of structural unemployment, one   from Bruce and one from Jason  I really liked Jason’s  For us it’s about what we can do and   what amount of unemployment is amenable to accommodative monetary policy   So how do you think about that?  I think the shock that hit our economy in 2007 is   basically very much a demand-oriented shock  There was a fall in net worth, there was a shock   to borrowing capacity, and investment and consumption demand fell  With a purely classical   model, such as a model you’d draw in class, this is going to have very little effect on economic   activity, because what happens is the real interest rate just falls immediately and sufficiently to   ensure that investment and consumption return to their pre-shock levels  Now, this assumes   something about the shape of the supply curve, and I’ll come back to that in a second  But if you   have a vertical supply curve, that’s the way it’s going to work   Now, this is not the way the world works  Why is that?  Well, there are three reasons that   I can think of and probably more that others could come up with  One is related to the fact that   inflationary expectations have stayed pretty well anchored since 2007  And with the zero lower   bound on the nominal fed funds rate, this means that the real interest rate probably has not been   able to fall enough to return consumption and investment to their pre-2007 levels   January 25–26, 2011 37 of 282              The second problem is that the classical story ignores changes in the demand for labor, in   the willingness of firms to hire workers at a given real wage  Some of these changes in labor   demand are compositional effects that are lumped under the rubric of mismatch  The work   discussed today did a good job of going after this, but basically firms are looking for a different   mix of tasks relative to the skills in the labor force  Some of this is obvious; for example, we’re   probably not going to need as many construction workers in 2015 as we had in 2007  But some   of it is, I think, much more subtle  When we talk to firms, we hear over and over again that they   have been led to adopt changes in their production methods that will lead them to use a different   mix of workers going forward  But some of the changes in labor demand are more aggregative    President Fisher has emphasized this in his speeches; for example, firms anticipate higher future   taxes, and they’re concerned about regulation, health care legislation, and what kinds of costs   those developments will impose on hiring  These are all shocks to labor demand   Third, there are movements in labor supply, that is, the willingness of workers to supply   labor at a given real wage  And, again, there are multiple influences  Higher unemployment   benefits will deter labor supply  When I work, I work to spend today, but I also work to spend in   the future, so a decline in the real interest rate also leads to a fall in labor supply  In conflict with   that is the notion that a fall in net worth usually would lead people to supply more labor at a   given real wage  So I’ve identified three problems with the classical response of instant   adjustment  One is that the real interest rate doesn’t fall enough, and the other two are these   movements in labor supply and labor demand   Monetary policy is about the real interest rate  That’s our job, that’s our goal  Our job is   to get that real interest rate to go where it’s supposed to go  We cannot shift these labor curves    Even if we could get the real interest rate to where we want it to be, that is, even if we could   January 25–26, 2011 38 of 282              literally make it the minus 400 basis points, say, that the Taylor 1999 rule would call for, labor   demand and labor supply changes could still alter the unemployment rate  So, the   unemployment rate that will prevail in the absence of price and wage rigidities is what I see as   the natural rate of unemployment  The papers that were discussed are about trying to get at this   natural rate  I think they do a good job of going after two particular sources of why that natural   rate might have moved—the unemployment mismatch and the effect of extended benefits on   unemployment   Now, people’s takeaways from this can differ  You can clearly see that from our little   chart at the end  Taking into account the nonadditivity of all of these things, I would have said   about 2 percentage points of the increase in unemployment could be attributed to these two   sources  There are a lot of uncertainties, up and down, so I’m not going to argue that  And it can   change over time  We could think the long-term unemployed might lose some skills  Also,   unemployment benefits might be reduced  So those go different ways  It could be that the   natural rate will go up or down in response to those things   But the papers are not informative about the other sources of change in labor demand or   labor supply  We don’t know how much unemployment is due to firms’ concerns about future   taxes or regulation  And then there’s the question of the real interest rate effect on labor supply   that I mentioned earlier, namely, when real interest rates go down, people supply less labor,   because they’re working for today and saving for the future  Well, real interest rates have come   down 200 basis points since 2007, if you look at TIPS yields  But in the absence of price   rigidities, according to the Taylor 1999 rule, we would have probably lowered them another 400   basis points, some 600 basis points down   January 25–26, 2011 39 of 282              There are two sets of estimates about this real interest rate effect in the literature—the   micro estimates, and the macro estimates  I won’t even tell you how much of an effect on labor   supply you could get out of the macro estimates—the employment-to-population ratio would fall   by something like 700 basis points in response to the shock  I think the more plausible estimates   come from the micro data, and they would still imply that the employment-to-population ratio   would fall by 90 to 150 basis points   What’s the takeaway from all of this?  I think Dave’s discussion with President Plosser   and President Lacker really hit it  You cannot rely just on unemployment  However we try to   correct it, using very careful work as our guide to the existence of inflationary pressures, we’re   going to have to look at a lot of other indicators  I’ll talk about some of that later when we talk   about economics and policy   The second lesson is reflected in the Minneapolis Fed memo on improving data    Obviously, my staff members wrote it, and I really like what they did  We talk a lot about it, and   I think it’s absolutely true that unemployment imposes large losses on the citizens of this   country  But there are a lot of key questions that we are struggling to answer, and we struggle   because we don’t have the data  The right way to approach this is to collect the data  The data   might cost millions of dollars to collect, but it might end up saving the economy billions if we   have a better idea of how to treat unemployment  So the Minneapolis Fed memo provided some   ideas about what kind of data you might want to go after   I have to say that all of the careful work, with all of the other uncertainties that are   layered on top of it, merely convinces me that we’re going to have to look at a wide range of   things besides the unemployment rate, however corrected, as a measure of inflationary pressures    Thank you, Mr Chairman    January 25–26, 2011 40 of 282                I agree with this wholly, that is, that rationing shows up in the   labor market because the real wage is too high to hire more people  Indeed, I have this same   conversation you described having with your directors, and the response is, “Wages?  Wages   don’t matter  What matters is the quality of human being we’re hiring”  To be honest, I think   they think this because they have a nominal wage set in their heads for a particular job, and that’s   it, that’s the end of the story  The tenor of my remarks is not to say, nor do I believe I have ever   said, that sticky nominal wages are not part of the issue  I think that that is captured in our   ability to adjust the real interest rate  If we can get it down far enough, then basically the real   January 25–26, 2011 44 of 282              wage will adjust to clear labor markets as well  We have one instrument—with large-scale asset   purchases added on, et cetera     I’m sympathetic to that—you and I agree on the concepts    The question is the quantities, and, unfortunately, those are hard to come by, and I suspect it will   remain hard to do so even if I looked at the Gertler, Sala, and Trigari paper     I certainly agree with everything that you said, Mr Chairman    When I hear people talk about this, there’s a distinction between structural things, that is, things   that are moving more long term, and cyclical things, that is, things that are moving at a cyclical   frequency, or medium term, shall we say  I think some of the things that happen at a cyclical   frequency are not so amenable to monetary policy, and they pose challenges for us to correct   using our main instrument, which has been the real interest rate, so I’m not sure that’s the right   distinction   January 25–26, 2011 46 of 282              In the discussion today, the story was, “Well, mismatch is small, so that means there is   clearly room for monetary policy to be accommodative”  That step in logic is not clear to me,   because many other factors can move U* around  Let me note that I absolutely don’t want to   undercut the value of the work that was presented  The papers were very good, and I learned a   lot from them  It’s just that there are lots of other factors, that’s all     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll say one thing about the   remittances  I think it’s important not to view this purely as an operational issue or purely as a   communication issue with markets  I think we can all agree that it’s going to be solved    However, I think the challenge is communication with the broader public  We’re going through   a high revenue period right now, and it’s often advertised as, “Boy, the Fed is doing great!”  The   flip side of that is if remittances fall to $5 billion, then stories are going to be written about the   Fed saying that it’s facing challenges, that it has been running irresponsibly, and so on  I’m not   saying that this challenge should influence policy, but it should influence communication   January 25–26, 2011 63 of 282              My second point is also about communication  It strikes me that, when we ask questions   of the dealers, we, in some sense, tip our hand a bit about what the realm of policy choices might   be  I admit that I don’t know how to get around this  We do want to have information from   markets, but asking the questions of markets is also transmitting information  I’ll put this issue   on the table as something that perhaps we can talk about when we get to the discussion of the   work of the subcommittee on communications that we’re going to have later     Yes, both extremes seem unsatisfactory  I don’t know in my   own head where I stand on this, but I think it is something we should try to solve     If it’s truly not revealing information, then I guess it would be   okay to release it publicly  We can talk more about this     Thanks, Mr Chairman  I’m going to follow up on this line of   questioning from President Lockhart and Governor Tarullo  It’s a question we’ve been puzzling   over in Minneapolis  It seems that if you look at the sovereign debt in Europe, the situation   looks just as bad today as it did in April and May in terms of the spreads  And yet there doesn’t   seem to be any evidence of the contagion that alarmed us so much in May—I think the VIX   January 25–26, 2011 86 of 282              popped over 40 at some point  So that contagion story that was such a factor in our discussion in   May doesn’t seem to be there now  I’m looking for stories to explain it     Thank you, Mr Chairman  In the course of our discussion   yesterday about the natural rate of unemployment, I mentioned that I thought it would be useful   for us to consider a wide range of measures of inflationary pressures, in addition to the natural   rate of unemployment and the gap between the current unemployment rate and the natural rate,   and I’ll elaborate on that now  In discussions with a number of our local contacts, we asked   about their ability to raise prices, and the basic response was the same  Many firms are facing   input cost pressures because of the rise in commodity prices—some of these firms are actually   producing those commodities, so they’re pretty pleased about that [laughter], and we should keep   that in mind  Other firms are trying to pass these input prices on to their consumers, but they are   not finding, as a general rule, that the demand is sufficiently strong to support these attempted   price increases  As a result, firms are absorbing the input cost increases by cutting margins and   not by raising prices  In a similar vein, we heard from contacts about their plans for wage   increases  There are signs of labor shortages in North and South Dakota  Also, in some   high-growth areas, like health care and IT, wage pressures are starting to build  All in all,   January 25–26, 2011 109 of 282              though, wage increases were relatively moderate from 2010 to 2011  So, if you look at the most   granular level, inflationary pressures do seem subdued in the Ninth District   If you look at the national level, it seems to me that there are a number of possible ways   to think about gauging inflationary pressures, that is, to think about the degree of slack in the   economy  One approach that we tend to emphasize is the difference between the current   unemployment rate and the natural rate of unemployment, but as discussed yesterday, there are   many uncertainties associated with that approach   So I’ll suggest three deliberately simple-minded approaches that we could add to that   approach  The simple-mindedness of these approaches should give us some confidence that they   will be robust across a wider class of models, but, of course, it’s useful to augment them with   more econometrically and theoretically sophisticated approaches as well   The first is a very simple NAIRU approach  It just looks at the difference between the   current inflation rate and lagged inflation, and it’s trying to get at the acceleration in inflation  A   lot of slack should lead the inflation rate to fall, and if there’s not much slack, then the inflation   rate should be falling very little or rising  Second is the New Keynesian approach  It takes the   current inflation rate and compares it with expected inflation  If you look at a simple, simple   version of the New Keynesian Phillips curve, this difference is proportional to the output gap    Third is a purely statistical approach, and here I’ll refer to the Stock-Watson recession gap that   we heard about in Jackson Hole  That’s a difference between the current unemployment rate and   the minimal value of unemployment over the current and the past 11 quarters     Consistent with what I said about the Ninth District, all of these aggregative measures   indicate that inflationary pressures in the US are currently low  Starting with the NAIRU   approach, inflation decelerated in 2010, and core inflation decelerated by 90 basis points from   January 25–26, 2011 110 of 282              2009 to 2010  The New Keynesian measure gives a similar result  If we look ahead at inflation   forecasts, zero-coupon inflation swaps, the median Blue Chip forecast, the Cleveland Fed   forecast—they’re all pointing to inflation of around 17, 18 percent in 2011  So this measure,   the difference between 2010 inflation and what we expect in 2011, is also negative, which   implies that inflationary pressures are low right now from the New Keynesian perspective, as   well  Moving to the third measure, unemployment was around 5 percent in the first quarter of   2008, so the Stock-Watson recession gap is large   But what about as the year progresses, as President Plosser emphasized?  I think it’s   useful to contrast what I’m going to say to what President Evans said in his remarks  Which one   of us turns out to be right will be critical in thinking about policy as we go forward  At the   granular level, we received some information that firms were anticipating larger wage pressures   by the end of the year  Of course, we have to wait and see whether that transpires or not, but   those kinds of wage pressures would be much more difficult for firms simply to absorb in their   profit margins and would more likely to lead to price increases   What about at the more aggregative level?  The simple NAIRU approach is going to tell   you that the forecasts—from the zero-coupon inflation swaps that I mentioned, the Blue Chip   forecast, and my own projection, for that matter—are all for inflation to accelerate in 2011   relative to 2010  That measure would say we’ve got inflationary pressures building by the end of   2011  Now to the New Keynesian approach  By the end of this year, the inflation forecast for   2012 compared with the forecast for 2011 shows a relatively small difference, something like   18 to 19 percent  So by the end of 2011, the New Keynesian approach is going to be saying   that there’s not much of a gap anymore, and, again, it will imply that inflation pressures have   built by the end of the year  Finally, the Stock–Watson recession gap says unemployment was   January 25–26, 2011 111 of 282              near 5 percent three years ago, as I said  By the time you roll to the beginning of 2009,   unemployment is 82 percent  So if unemployment is falling to near 9 percent by the end of   2011, that gap has now shrunk from around 4½ percent to less than 1 percent  Stock and Watson   also proposed a similar gap in terms of capacity utilization, and that version of the gap seems   likely to vanish completely by the end of the year   In my view, the expected paths of all three of these measures of inflationary pressures   would point to a need for policy tightening by the end of the year  But in all three, it really   comes down to  How is inflation going to behave over the course of 2011?  I think we should   start to plan for various contingencies now  My own prediction, as I’ve described, is that we   would have to start to think about tightening by the end of 2011, which is more than a year   earlier than the Tealbook’s projection—and I was interested to see that it’s only about six months   earlier than what’s in the New York Fed’s forecast  Monetary policy is all about contingency   planning, and I’ll talk about one way to construct a plan for all of the possible contingencies that   we face in the next go-round  Thanks a lot     I think they’re going to turn out to be wrong on this point  If   you use the forecasting model that they talked about in Jackson Hole, they would have forecast   significant disinflation from that point forward  All I was saying is that, by the end of 2011, that   model is not going to have those same pressures in there     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I didn’t catch what you said about   prime-age workers  Were the statistics you were quoting about prime-age males or prime-age   males and females?     Okay  Thanks     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I will take up some of President   Rosengren’s time  [Laughter]  I support alternative B, but I would recommend some changes in   language  Like President Lacker, I prefer the first paragraph of alternative C, because I think it   does a better job of reflecting the change in the data that we’ve seen in the intermeeting period,   which is the point of that paragraph  In paragraph 4 of alternative B, I would like to propose the   following edit  Change “stable inflation expectations” to “stable longer-run inflation   expectations”  I think short-run inflation expectations have not been as stable as longer-run   expectations have been, and, since we’re probably more interested in longer-run expectations   anyway, it’s worthwhile putting that in   January 25–26, 2011 159 of 282              If I’m being asked to choose between the last two sentences of paragraph 3, I prefer the   penultimate one to the ultimate one  My attitude is  If we’re not changing our program, then   why change the language?   I wanted to say a few words about the future  As I said earlier, I think monetary policy is   an exercise in contingency planning and in risk management  I think the Tealbook does a great   job of identifying the key risks  On pages 6 and 7 of Part B of the Tealbook, the staff leads us   through a very imaginative scenario—I applaud them for taking it on, and I think what they did   was really cool  They take the NAIRU as actually being 6¾, but the central bank will only learn   that fact slowly  The analysis concludes with the following sentence, which I viewed as   ominous  “The inflation consequences would be much larger and more persistent if the public   were to misread higher-than-target inflation as a sign that the FOMC had raised its long-run   inflation target”  Given the reaction to the second LSAP, this kind of miscommunication and   misinterpretation is a real possibility, and we should be thinking about conducting monetary   policy to manage our exposure to this risk   To that end, I’m going to describe three scenarios under which we’ll need to make a   decision about our strategy  For simplicity, I’m going to say that our next decision point is June,   though, obviously, whether it actually is or not depends on what happens  The first scenario—  and, by the way, I don’t think it’s the most likely case—is an adverse one  Unemployment   remains near 10 percent  Quarterly and year-over-year inflation remains subdued at, say,   1 percent or even less than 1 percent  Short-run and longer-run inflation expectations remain in   the 1½ to 2 percent range  This basically describes the status quo  In this scenario, I do not   believe there’s a need to expand the LSAP or to contemplate exit in the near term  I think the   current monetary policy stance would be appropriate  Of course, we can all imagine scenarios   January 25–26, 2011 160 of 282              even worse than this, and, if they materialized, we would, I think, want to expand the extent of   our accommodation  Because of our conversations last fall, we have a pretty good understanding   of how that accommodation might work, although I would recommend expanding our set of   tools beyond the LSAP   Let me turn now to what I view as the most likely scenario  Output growth in the first   quarter is at least 3 percent, maybe closer to 4 percent  Employment growth averages 200,000   jobs per month for the next six months  Unemployment gets down closer to 9 percent than   10 percent  That scenario sounds like the Tealbook, but I want to add a key element that I was   stressing in my economic go-round statement  Inflation has averaged between 130 and 150 basis   points in the first half of the year, and market expectations imply that inflation will be about   170 to 200 basis points over the coming year from June to June  This scenario is consistent with   my own forecast for inflation, and, perhaps more importantly, it’s also consistent with the Blue   Chip and financial market forecasts  If this scenario materialized, all three of the auxiliary   measures of slack that I described in my economic go-round would have fallen in the first half of   the year  And, presumably, we should be thinking about them as being even more likely to be at   or near zero by the end of 2011  So the Committee would need to begin internal preparations for   exit, and, in particular, we would need to decide whether we still liked the sequence of moves we   seemed to have reached a consensus on last year  First, remove the “extended period” language;   second, start draining reserves; third, raise rates; fourth, start selling assets  In addition, we’d   need to decide the optimal time frame for the preferred sequence of moves  Do we think about   one, two, three, or even four meetings from initiation to get to the key step of raising rates?  I   think both kinds of topics would be appropriate in June, given what I’ve described   January 25–26, 2011 161 of 282              The third scenario is the “good news” outcome—and, like the first scenario, I think it’s   unlikely  However, I also view it as troubling, because I think we’re largely unprepared for it    In this scenario, things turn out very well compared with what we expect  Output grows at close   to 5 percent in the first quarter and looks just as strong in the second  Headline inflation in the   first half of 2011 is over 2 percent, and core is between 1½ percent and 2 percent  Employment   growth averages nearly 300,000 per month, although unemployment would still be above   9 percent  If this scenario materialized, we might need to initiate the first steps of our exit   strategy as soon as August  We might need to compress the time we take for the four steps that   I’ve described   In considering the latter two scenarios, I think it would be very useful to have staff   analysis to address two specific questions by our April meeting  The first question is  If we drop   the “extended period” language, what do markets expect about when we’re going to raise rates?    Is it three months, six months?  And what would be the consequences of moving faster or slower   than markets expect?  The second question, and President Lockhart has stressed this point before,   is  How many reserves do we need to drain to be able to raise rates effectively?  And how fast   can we possibly do it without adverse consequences?  I think that having this analysis in hand in   April would put us in position to react to these last two scenarios in a thoughtful manner  Thank   you, Mr Chairman     You beat Eric  [Laughter]     As long as we can use the word “rocking” in March, that will   be fine  [Laughter]     I wasn’t sure what Michelle’s advice was     And to stop at “the end of the second quarter of 2011”?      Thank you, Mr Chairman  I want to thank the subcommittee   for their work on this  I tend to agree with what Governor Yellen has said  Given the kinds of   risks that are involved for the Federal Reserve System in this matter, I think a formal policy is   something that we should be thinking about  I have to admit, though, that, since I have not   engaged in any of this kind of activity myself, I’m not sure exactly what the formal policy should   consist of  Certainly, in considering the issue of potential limitations on content, the point that   says, “You should not be characterizing deliberations at FOMC meetings,” seems clear enough   to me  I think it’s reasonable to consider having another staff person at these meetings, which   seems like a good check  Beyond that, I guess I’m willing to be led by others’ judgments     Charlie, are you talking about contacts with the media at this   point?   January 25–26, 2011 209 of 282                Okay     In 140 characters or fewer  [Laughter]     Yes, I’d like to follow up on Governor Raskin’s comments   because I thought you laid out a really good way to think about things  I would just add one   aspect  I think another role in our communication is listening  Communication is not just us   talking and telling people what we want them to hear  Part of our role is to listen to what’s going   on in the economy  That’s where you end up in these private settings, really  It’s not so much   that I have any interest in privacy, but rather that the person talking to me might have an interest   in privacy  "
8982,2011-03-15,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Brian, I had a question about how   the equity premium is being calculated—you take a ratio of some kind of earnings divided by the   price index and then subtract out some measure of the risk-free rate, is that how it’s being   calculated?     I’m asking because I’ve seen other forecasts that use different   measures of earnings, like a 10-year moving average of earnings  Were you using last year’s   earnings?     Thank you, Mr Chairman  In general, the Ninth District   economy is on a better path than the national economy  Unemployment is below 7 percent in the   District  Some of this is driven by the oil boom in North Dakota where employment grew by   nearly 5 percent last year  But even in the much more diversified economy of Minnesota,   unemployment is now down to 67 percent  So this follows up on President Bullard’s point that   there is considerable heterogeneity even among US states in their unemployment experience   More generally, there is confidence in the Ninth District in the recovery  Firms have   more certainty about federal taxes in the wake of the election and the subsequent fiscal deal    They are less worried about the ultimate impact of the health care reform  And as President   Evans observed, their complaints about incipient regulations seemed less vigorous than in the   past, although I would say there is one group that would distinguish themselves in that  We had   our first meeting of our Community Depository Institutions Advisory Council, and the bankers in   that group were fairly quick and vigorous in their complaints about regulation  So there are   people out there that will complain about regulation   This optimistic frame of mind means that many firms seem ready to expand hiring    Firms see little or no pressure on wages over the next year or two, but some do plan major price   increases by the end of 2011 in response to increases in other input costs  At the national level, I   found the discussion of labor force participation on pages 11 and 25 of Book A of the Tealbook   to be thoughtful and useful  For me, it highlighted the challenges of predicting the evolution of   March 15, 2011 47 of 165              labor supply, and, hence, labor market slack, over even a relatively short horizon like 12 or 24   months  When you look at the graph on page 25 of Book A of the Tealbook or the graph on page   11 of Book A of the Tealbook, the Tealbook is basically predicting an uptick in labor force   participation and a reversion to a trend that is fitted to data that go back about 10 years  The   question is  Will we see that uptick or not?  I agree with the Tealbook that there are definitely   reasons to expect that the answer to the question might be yes, but I think there is also evidence   that is just the opposite  As we all know, unemployment fell from 98 percent in November to   89 percent in February, which is the same as it was in April of 2009  In an accounting sense,   more than half of this decline can be attributed to people who left the labor force  The question   for us that’s important in terms of slack is  Should we expect those people to return to the labor   force, putting downward pressure on wages and prices as the economy improves, or not?  One   way to try to get some insight into this question is to look at the U-5 unemployment series  This   is a broader measure of labor force underutilization that includes people who have not looked for   work in the past four weeks but report themselves as, nonetheless, ready to work  Presumably,   these are the people who are most likely to reenter the labor force as the economy improves    They are sometimes referred to as being marginally attached to the labor force  If you look at the   U-5 unemployment rate, it has mimicked the behavior of the standard unemployment series  It   too has fallen sharply over the past three months to return to roughly its April 2009 level  My   conclusion from that—and if you break down the series into more components, you could reach   the same conclusion—is that relatively few of those who have left the labor force during the past   three months view themselves as being marginally attached to the labor force  This is all in an   accounting sense, of course, but those are the conclusions you would reach from looking at the   U-5 number  This is very suggestive, and I would only say that it leads me to be uncertain about   March 15, 2011 48 of 165              the path of labor force participation  And, these uncertainties translate directly to uncertainty   about any measure of labor market slack that we use to gauge the appropriate level of monetary   accommodation   This issue about what slack is will become really important  For example, if you look at   the Taylor rules on page 37 in Book B of the Tealbook, set the slack terms there to zero, and just   think about inflation at 12 percent, the results would not be a justification for our current level of   accommodation  We would have to have interest rates be significantly higher than the zero   lower bound at that point  So the discussion about slack is very critical for justifying our current   level of accommodation   I would say the right way to think about slack is through the behavior of core inflation   and the behavior of the forecast of core; that’s likely to prove a more reliable gauge  In   particular, what I mean by that is if you look at the Taylor rule, either the 1999 one or the 1993   one, the last term is this y minus y* piece  My uncertainties about labor force participation mean   that I think y* is hard to measure  And what kind of price setting you follow can give you a   different way to substitute in for that, using core inflation as a way to proxy for that  If you are   using a New Keynesian model, a scaled version of the difference between core inflation and   expected future core inflation is the right way to proxy for that in the simple, crudest versions of   those models  In late 2010, that difference was a big negative number, because core was so low    But I expect that difference to be much closer to zero by the end of the year, because forecasts of   2012 core are likely to be real close to realized 2011 core  If you are a fan of the NAIRU   models, you could replace that y minus y* by a scaled version of the acceleration of inflation, the   difference between current core and lagged core  In late 2010, again, that difference was a big   negative number, a good justification of our accommodative monetary policy  But I expect core   March 15, 2011 49 of 165              to be along the lines of the Survey of Professional Forecasters done by the Philly Fed  I expect   that core inflation will be between 14 and 15 in 2011  That means that difference between   annual core inflation and lagged annual core inflation will be close to 70 basis points by the end   of the year  I continue to expect by the end of 2011 reliable measures of slack will not support   our current level of monetary accommodation  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support alternative B, but I   would like to propose changes to the third sentence of paragraph 2 of alternative B, and I’m   suggesting these changes because I think the tension in the public’s mind about what’s going on   with headline inflation and our accommodative stance makes it important for us to clarify  So   with that backdrop, I would propose replacing the word “temporarily” with the word “currently,”   and I would propose dropping the word “headline” from that sentence  Then in the next   sentence, instead of saying “limited pass-through to underlying inflation,” I would say, “The   Committee expects these effects to be transient,” comma, “and” instead of “but,” “it will pay   close attention to the evolution of overall inflation and inflation expectations”  The impact of   March 15, 2011 95 of 165              these changes would be to say that we are seeing upward pressure on inflation right now, but we   are not reacting to them because we expect those changes to be only transient in nature   As President Bullard articulated, I do think our ultimate variable of interest is headline,   but it’s over a sufficiently long period of time  The reason we’re not reacting to these changes is   not because they’re showing up in headline, it’s because of the fact that we expect them to be   sufficiently short lived  So that’s my proposed change to alternative B     Do you want me to read the whole thing?      “The recent increases in the prices of energy and other   commodities are currently putting upward pressure on inflation,” period  “The Committee   expects these effects to be transient, and it will pay close attention to the evolution of overall   inflation and inflation expectations”     Yes, but—sorry, “but” is fine     You did that just for that reason, I’m sure  [Laughter]     That’s fine     I have a few more words to say     Well, thank you  I’m opposed to tapering our purchases; I   agree with both President Rosengren and President Lacker on that  I like the preliminary   discussion of exit in the Tealbook  I’m looking forward to a fuller discussion in April    Certainly, I don’t think we’ll be in a position at that point to settle this question of when exactly   exit will begin, but I’d like us to begin to settle on the sequencing of timing and moves after a   given start date   In the last six weeks, the Tealbook has moved up its projection of our first interest rate   increase to the third quarter of 2012, but I anticipate exit to be a multimeeting process that will   most likely begin three to four meetings before the actual raising of rates  I would think it would   begin with the changing of language, but that’s something we can start to discuss next time  If   my forecast is right, that would mean we will start the process in about a year  Of course, raising   rates in the third quarter of 2012 is a point forecast, and the Tealbook also includes a 70 percent   confidence interval for that point forecast  That error band includes an increase in the fed funds   rate of 50 basis points by the end of 2011  So that’s what’s in that 70 percent error band   March 15, 2011 97 of 165              In a similar vein, it’s instructive to look at table C of the March 11 memo to Reserve   Bank Research Directors from Thomas Tallarini  (I stole it from my Research Director  I don’t   think I’m supposed to be looking at those things)  That table uses simulations of FRB/US to   estimate the probability that the fed funds rate will exceed 25 basis points at some point during   the year 2011, and the table reports that estimated probability as being 52 percent   So monetary policy is about risk management, and good risk management means being   ready for the possibility that we may need to initiate exit by as early as September or November,   and I hope we do that planning for that possibility  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Yes  I thank President Evans for his close attention to my   remarks     I will just articulate one thing, which is that I am only   emphasizing one aspect of the New Keynesian model, which is the Phillips curve itself, and so   when you want to evaluate what I’m saying, you want to do it like a GMM test, or something   like that, of that one particular equation  So that’s the only piece of the model that I’m   exploiting     I agree with President Evans  This would be a major change   and something we should do with tremendous contemplation and thought, not in the last three   minutes     I’m going to say two conflicting things  On the one hand, I   think—and this follows up on some stuff that Tom was mentioning as well—this is an   institutional change, and it transcends any particular person who is the chair at this time  I think   that we all have a great deal of confidence in Chairman Bernanke’s ability and desire to   communicate the broad cross-section of views  But this is going to be an institutional change   that will transcend this particular individual   On the other hand, I would say that—and, actually, this also follows on what Bill was   saying—last August we had I think a one-day meeting, and at that meeting we made a change in   policy in terms of reinvesting the MBSs  There were good economic reasons for doing that, but   it was a very confusing period  I guess the question would be  Did you give any thought to   doing this after every meeting?  And the final thing I will say is that there are a lot of talented   public affairs people around the system, and I, at least, feel like I can’t get my PA people   involved right now in this because it is Class I FOMC; they aren’t Class I  If there is a   systematic way to get the PA community involved in our discussions of communication, I think   that would be good for the Committee      I feel it’s distinguishing the meetings in an unusual way  It’s   not like we only make important decisions at two-day meetings that require a lot of clarification    So if we are going to go down this path, I actually would suggest thinking about doing it every   time   March 15, 2011 135 of 165                But those June projections would still be available in August     One quick logistical thing, which is, you want to have some   way to confine the scope of questions  You probably don’t want to be taking questions about   debit interchange, for example     It’s going to be hard for us to keep track  [Laughter]  "
9006,2011-04-26,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I have a question about figure 23    This represents the primary dealers’ estimates of our draining capacity  I was wondering what   the staff’s own estimates would be of that number     The intermeeting period, a relatively short period of time     A relabeling, almost  If I might follow up, I understand your   concerns on reverse repos  What would be your concerns about what kinds of constraints we   would face in terms of the use of TDFs?     Thanks     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I found the staff memos   immensely helpful, and I thank the staff for their work on them   Exit has two components, timing and sequencing, and I will focus my remarks in this go-  round on the issue of sequencing  Timing, of course, is critical, but I will have more to say about   that in the later go-rounds   In general, as my own memo suggested, I like the sequencing in option 1  With that said,   I will describe three ways in which I think option 1 in the staff memo could be improved  I will   April 26–27, 2011 42 of 244              answer the four questions and then close with a comment about the FOMC statements that the   staff proposed for use in connection with exit   Option 1 in the staff memo has four steps that take place over 15 months  step 1, end   reinvestment; step 2, three months later, drop “extended period” language and begin reserve   draining; step 3, six months after that, raise the fed funds rate; and step 4, six months after that,   increase the fed funds rate and begin a gradual process of asset sales   I would make three changes to this plan  First, I want to continue to reinvest payments   received from MBS, because one of the things I felt I learned in 2010 was that failing to reinvest   MBS payments is a way to generate pro-cyclical monetary accommodation  More specifically,   when conditions weaken and long rates decline, people prepay their mortgages; a policy of MBS   redemption then implies a fast withdrawal of accommodation, exactly what we don’t want when   conditions weaken  This is a poor paraphrase, I think, of words that Vice Chairman Dudley   uttered last August  Hence, when we end reinvestments, we should do so only for Treasuries   Second, I don’t see the need to begin redemptions before dropping the “extended period”   language  We will still need to drain reserves before raising the fed funds rate  Ending   reinvestments three months earlier than dropping the “extended period” language will have little   intrinsic macroeconomic impact, and I think that it is going to introduce lots of uncertainties into   the minds of market participants  What I would be willing to do is to combine what I called   steps 1 and 2 of option 1—that is, do three things at once, which is to drop the “extended period”   language, begin reserve draining, and end reinvestments of Treasuries all at one time  The staff’s   plan defers sales until six months after the increase in the fed funds rate  That deferral is okay   with me, but I have to say that I don’t really see the sharp economic distinction between   April 26–27, 2011 43 of 244              redemptions and sales  So I would also be willing to start selling MBS and Treasuries   simultaneously with ending reinvestments   Third, as written, option 1 puts six months between dropping the “extended period”   language and raising rates  I’m not sure why six months is the right length of time  This was the   context of my discussion with Brian and Bill earlier about how much time we really need to be   thinking about reserve draining  That’s the operational gap that I think we have to contemplate,   but basically I would consider a two- to four-meeting gap, so three to six months, as being a   more appropriate interpretation of the term “extended period”  And I think we could do a   reasonable amount of reserve draining in that time frame as well     Those are my three changes  I want to continue reinvesting payments from MBS  I   would not use ending reinvestment as my first step  I would, instead, combine that with   dropping the “extended period” language and beginning reserve draining  And the final thing is   that I think we don’t have to wait six months between dropping the “extended period” language   and raising rates  I think three to six months is probably a more appropriate interpretation   Let me turn to the questions  I have answered a lot of them already, but I’ll go through   them anyway  As I said earlier, I would not use redemptions as the first step; the first step   should be to drop the “extended period” language and simultaneously begin reserve draining    Redemptions could take place at the same time as that  As indicated, I would want to continue to   reinvest MBS proceeds into Treasuries   I like a slow, largely predetermined path of sales  I agree with President Plosser and Bill   that asset sales and fed funds rate increases are largely substitutable ways of affecting the   economy  And I think that our economic understanding of the impact of asset sales on the   economy is pretty much in its infancy, so I would not use something we don’t have such a good   April 26–27, 2011 44 of 244              understanding of as an active tool of policy  We needed to use asset purchases because the fed   funds rate was at zero, but we can always reduce accommodation by raising the fed funds rate  If   the fed funds rate were to hit zero again—as President Bullard points out, negative shocks could   hit us in the midst of what we consider our exit strategy—we may need to slow or reverse the   path of sales if the deterioration in economic conditions were sufficiently severe   My answer to question 3—I’ve used sales and redemptions as basically substitutable   ways to reduce the size of the balance sheet  I don’t think that balance sheet reduction should   begin before you remove the “extended period” language from the statement  Other than that, I   don’t have strong views as to when we start  As long as the staff is confident in the efficacy of   reserve draining—and I hope we will be able to build that confidence—sales and redemptions   can begin after raising the fed funds rate  I don’t see why we need to wait six months, but I’m   also happy to do so   Okay  On question 4, the true–false–uncertain choices, I think I’ve got “true” on all of   these  I realize, of course, there was no right answer to this question, but—[laughter]     I’m going to be terse on these  In terms of 4a, I agree with the   statement  Consistent with the view expressed in 4a, I prefer a corridor system to a floor system,   ultimately  There are definitely some economic benefits to the floor system, which research   around the System has pointed to, but all in all, I think the benefits are outweighed by its relative   unfamiliarity  I agree with the statement in 4b as well, and I agree with the statement in 4c,   except that I always want to be thinking about asset sales and redemptions as being a bundle, a   way of reducing the balance sheet as one, so I would talk about asset sales and redemptions   being implemented within a framework   April 26–27, 2011 45 of 244              Let me close by saying a word about the suggested FOMC statement about raising the fed   funds rate target  This is on page 16 of the exit strategy memo  These are certainly early days to   be talking about this kind of stuff, but there are some subtle governance issues we are going to be   facing as we move into our exit strategy here  The suggested statement includes a reference to   the Board of Governors’ action on interest on reserves  I think including the Board of   Governors’ action in the FOMC statement is confusing and potentially problematic from a   governance point of view  I would, instead, make the FOMC statement about the FOMC’s   actions  The Board of Governors can release a separate statement, presumably at the same time,   that could read, “Consistent with the FOMC’s change in its target for the fed funds rate, the   Board of Governors voted to change the interest rate on reserves to be” whatever it is  Thank   you, Mr Chairman     I guess what I’m thinking is, maybe we should be doing   something new, given the novelty of the situation  That’s all I’m suggesting     That is a correct interpretation of what “perfect substitutes”   would mean     Thanks, Mr Chairman  I wanted to follow up on this point   that I learned from Vice Chairman Dudley last August, and now I’m apparently going to have to   unlearn it  [Laughter]   My concern is that if we adopt a policy of redeeming MBS—suppose we do that in   December 2011—and conditions soften in 2012 and longer-term rates fall, we will then be put in   the position of stopping the policy at that point, because it could well be at that stage that we will   begin to see people starting to pay down their mortgages more rapidly, just as we did in August   2010  My vision, as I think I have heard from others around the table, is that the balance sheet   track should be going on slowly downward in the background  If we redeem MBS, we are going   April 26–27, 2011 72 of 244              to be in the position of balance sheet management immediately  That is what I took away from   that     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I have a question about the debt   ceiling  As noted in the Tealbook, it appears that investors are still pretty sanguine that some   kind of deal will be reached, and that the debt ceiling will be raised by July  In my own thinking,   though, I see this as being a risk that we should take account of  I was wondering what the staff   perceives to be the economic and financial risks or consequences if the debt ceiling really isn’t   raised     Markets have been wrong, though, before     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I have talked to a number of   business contacts throughout the Ninth District over the past six weeks, and the high rate of   headline inflation was very much on their minds  One concern was that elevated oil and food   prices would drive down demand for other goods and so choke off the recovery  But the other   real concern was that headline inflation would leak into what we at the Fed like to term   “underlying inflation” and generate a persistent high-inflation scenario   In terms of the latter concern, many retailers pointed out that increases in input prices   were putting upward pressures on their costs  However, they remained uncertain about their   ability to pass those cost increases on to consumers  One offered story, though, is that they   believe that the current high rate of headline inflation will give them, quote–unquote, “more   cover” to initiate price increases in nonfood and non-energy goods and services  According to   this story, a firm can raise its prices more rapidly because households believe that all of their   April 26–27, 2011 124 of 244              prices are rising more rapidly  This story would mean that the apparently transitory increase in   headline inflation has the potential to generate a self-fulfilling increase in expectations about   core inflation—a self-fulfilling increase that could well prove to be persistent  This story—that   transitory movements in headline inflation can translate into persistent movements and   inflationary expectations—is one that bears watching  Fortunately, there is little evidence so far   that this upward pressure on longer-term inflationary expectations is happening  For example,   the five-year, five-year forward breakevens remain in historical ranges  The Cleveland Fed’s   measure of expected inflation over the next 10 years, which President Pianalto was just   referencing—I like that, because it attempts to strip away both liquidity and risk premium   affects—has risen since last summer, but it does remain below 2 percent   So medium-term and longer-term inflation expectations do seem stable for now, but this   risk that the transitory becomes permanent is one that we need to be prepared for  And I’m not   sure that we are  If we look at our standard monetary policy rules, they are silent about how to   respond to changes in longer-run inflationary expectations  What triggers are we using to tell us   that longer-run inflation expectations have risen?  Do breakevens need to rise to 3½ percent,   4 percent, 4½ percent?  Do the Cleveland Fed measures need to hit 22 percent, 25 percent?    How aggressive should we be if the economy were to hit these triggers?  As far as I can tell, we   don’t have a systematic approach to dealing with this kind of scenario, and I think we do need   one   In contrast, our policy rules are clear that the level of accommodation should track core   inflation  I took what President Evans was describing from the very interesting work that was   being done in Chicago as proposing not tracking core inflation but some filtered vision of core,   which is trying to tease out the persistent component of core  That would be different from the   April 26–27, 2011 125 of 244              kind of rules we have traditionally been using, and it would be interesting to see if those kinds of   rules, using historical data, would actually perform better than the rules we’ve typically used    But for now, I think I would rather stick to the rules the Committee has typically used, the ones   that track core  And as a result, and as my memo on reducing accommodation indicated, I am   going to be tracking PCE core inflation carefully in thinking about the appropriate timing for   reducing policy accommodation   The Tealbook now forecasts that core PCE inflation will be 14 percent over 2011  My   own outlook has not changed that much  It continues to be that PCE core inflation will be   14 percent or possibly even higher  And our own rules indicate that the FOMC should respond   to that increase in core inflation by raising the fed funds rate  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I think these observations about   the labor market are spot on  I will say, I’ve spent some time looking at these data too, and I   think it’s very confusing  One thing I would point to—and I think I mentioned this last time—is   looking at these broader measures of unemployment and thinking about the marginally attached,   et cetera, I would have thought that if we were seeing a group of people leaving the labor force   who were about to pop back in, you would have seen more of an increase in the group of   marginally attached workers than we’ve seen     Certainly I accept that amount would be about right, yes     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support alternative B  I’m not   totally happy with paragraph 2 as written  I think it’s an attempt to be what the younger folks   might call a mash-up between President Lacker’s version and the original  At the risk of   confusing things still more, let me make a suggestion, which would be to drop the last part that’s   highlighted in red—the “and a decline in inflation to rates consistent with the Federal Reserve’s   mandate”—and replace it with “in a context of price stability”   April 26–27, 2011 179 of 244              I think what’s confusing about the paragraph right now is, we talk about underlying   inflation being low, then inflation goes up to being high, and then we’re talking about what we   want it to come down to be  I find the paragraph confusing when I read it  I think my suggestion   may be more helpful, but maybe others will have ideas about how to address this     That is correct, yes     I remember that     I’m sorry, Mr Chairman     As I think about the evolution of future policy, I continue to   focus my attention on core inflation  Core inflation was under 1 percent over the course of 2010   April 26–27, 2011 180 of 244              Our estimates in Minneapolis are that the output gap was around minus 4 percent at the   end of 2010, and given these conditions, as you highlighted, Mr Chairman, it’s appropriate for   monetary policy to be highly accommodative, and it is  The Board of Governors’ staff estimates   suggest that the LSAPs are generating enough stimulus so as to be roughly equivalent to a fed   funds rate of minus 2½ percentage points  I guess there’s some range between minus 2 and   minus 2½, but I’ll stick to the rough equivalence   Now, some observers have suggested that this level of stimulus should remain in place as   long as inflation expectations remain stable, but such an approach is inconsistent with the kind of   rules we have in the Tealbook, and they’re inconsistent for a good reason  If we waited until   inflation expectations move, we’d actually probably have to impose much bigger employment   costs on the economy to try to get them back to where we want them to be  So it’s, I think, a   better policy to adjust our level of accommodation as the economy moves towards the Fed’s   targets  The staff now forecasts that core PCE inflation will be 14 percent in 2011  My own   forecast is slightly higher, and these kinds of increases in core PCE inflation would argue for a   reduction in accommodation   At the same time, unemployment will be at least 1 percentage point lower at the end of   2011 than in November 2010  This change, too, argues for a reduction in accommodation—and   I think Governor Tarullo made some good points yesterday—assuming, of course, that the   natural rate of unemployment did not fall by as much over the same time frame   Mr Chairman, I found your comments on my memo to be very helpful yesterday  In   particular, I have to say that I had really underappreciated the notion that accommodation is   being removed as we move closer to a date when our holdings of longer-term securities return to   a more normal level  I think this idea is a very important one and a very intuitive one   April 26–27, 2011 181 of 244              If I’m sitting there as a member of the public thinking the Fed is going to hold onto their   long-term securities for 30 years, and six months pass, well, not much accommodation is being   removed by that  But if I’m thinking it’s going to be more like three years that the Fed is holding   onto those securities, when six months pass, then there’s a fair amount of accommodation being   removed  This really points to the need to have some strong communication about what our   expectations are for the date of eventual balance sheet normalization when our holdings in long-  term securities return to something consistent with what we think of as being normal   There’s a variety of ways we could do that communication  We could do it during the   press conferences  I heard, and I don’t want to overstate this, a fair amount of agreement among   members of the Committee that we were planning to get back to something like a normal balance   sheet over a five- to six-year time frame  But another way to do it would be to add a projection    We offer our projections of longer-run inflation; we could offer a projection of a date that we   expect balance sheet normalization to take place  Right now, though, the communication is   proceeding in a rather informal way  I think our main communication is President Williams’s   working paper, and that’s probably not the best way for us to communicate these things, with all   due respect  [Laughter]  But I do continue to anticipate that in the fall the Committee will need   to respond to the changes in economic conditions by taking the first steps toward raising the fed   funds rate  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Oh, that is a good suggestion     I’ll say a couple things  First, I think references to “headline”   should be avoided  I think in the systematic overview of language that will take place in the next   six weeks we will regret using that language  The use of the term price stability is to connote   two things at once, and perhaps it’s too oblique to do that  One is that inflation will decline from   its current high levels, but it’s also to say that underlying inflation will return from its current   low levels to 2 percent   April 26–27, 2011 214 of 244                I think of “underlying inflation” as being our best possible   forecast—     Our actual forecast is for inflation to do this—to go up, and to   come down below, and then to reach target from below  I think it’s a very subtle and artistic   forecast  [Laughter]  "
9035,2011-06-21,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I just had one quick question for   Mike, which is, how do the models capture the large-scale asset purchases and their impact?     Yes, thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll, first of all, second what   others have said, that this was a really excellent piece of staff work  I spent the week reading   through it very carefully with the help of my research director, Kei-Mu Yi, and we learned a   tremendous amount in part because people were really generous with their time in answering all   of our questions  We really appreciate it  I wanted to follow up on something that Governor   Yellen and President Lacker said about what would be interesting to see going forward  I think it   would be great for the group of workers on this project, as well as the Committee, to see output   from this project, I would say, on a quarterly basis—not as much as we saw here, but something   more concise along the lines of, What’s the forecast?  What’s the story behind the forecast?  I   could imagine a report of about a page and a half that would be pretty useful   A couple of quick comments about why this would be useful, beyond the fact that I think   that we don’t have the model of the US economy and seeing things from a wider range of   models would be good along those lines  One is something that Governor Warsh mentioned last   year, and I thought it was a great point  Governor Warsh was struggling with how to get Reserve   Bank economists more integrated into the process of thinking about the FOMC; this project is   June 21–22, 2011 27 of 282              one way this can happen because we already have that kind of interaction taking place, and I   think that would be fantastic  The other thing that I’ll emphasize about these models—and Mike,   quite rightly, I think, has pointed to some of their failings or deficiencies—is that I am really   impressed with how fast people have been able to build on them in the past two or three years,   especially in light of events  You don’t want to think, in our constantly changing environment,   about a model as being a static object; it’s more of a dynamic process  We’re always going to be   building and adding onto it, and these models have proven very amenable to that process, in part,   I think, because of their structure, but also in part because this is what the people in academics   are really good at using  For instance, Mike was mentioning the fact that the models that were   being used within the current DSGE group don’t have unemployment  Well, there’s a very nice   paper that just came out, I guess, a couple of months ago by Galí, Smets, and Wouters that is a   DSGE framework that builds in unemployment  I think that we’re going to be able to build   better models through our interactions with the academe by having this kind of model, or a suite   of models, as Governor Yellen said, that we constantly use  I think the dialogue about what we   want to see and what this group can provide would be better if we start to see something from   them on an ongoing basis  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Sure  Thank you, Mr Chairman  My proposed change was   grounded in my feeling that when we remove this phrase “extended period,” it will be a very   important step for the Committee in the process of exit  I was concerned about the fact that, at   least in my own mind, I was not clear about what that step is supposed to be communicating  I   felt it was important, as best we can, to have some kind of shared understanding of what that step   would mean  I have offered, by way of change, my own interpretation of what that step would   mean  It could be that, as we will find out shortly, there is sufficient lack of consensus on this   point and that we don’t want to finalize it at this time  But I my main point is that I think we   should have some clarity about what this step would mean as part of the exit process  In terms of   my own thinking about it, what it would mean to me is that at that point, we would be   anticipating that the first increase would be two to four meetings out     Governor Yellen, are you proposing to add the words “at   least” before the word “three”?  Is that the substance of the proposal?     I am perfectly happy with that as an amendment, if that’s the   nature of the amendment  I don’t have a problem with that     I am very happy with this document  I thank you, Mr   Chairman and the staff, for preparing it  I think it’s a very valuable practice for us to continue to   do this, to summarize consensus as we develop it, at least for internal purposes  I realize this will   June 21–22, 2011 45 of 282              not be released publicly, but we can even think about going to the next step, of releasing such   consensus publicly  But at least for our internal purposes, I think it’s great to do these   summaries, and I’m very happy with the document as is     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I just wanted to follow up on   President Rosengren’s suggestion about replacing “at the same time or relatively soon thereafter”   with the word “next”  I’m sympathetic to the idea that we don’t want to have references to exact   times, so I’m happy with that  But on the other hand, the word “next” does remove the   possibility of doing something “at the same time”  So I would prefer to see something like “at   the same time or thereafter”     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Brian, I had two questions related   to the debt ceiling  The first question is about credit default swaps on US debt  Are their prices   showing any movement at all related to concerns about the debt ceiling?  And the second   question is, when you talk to market participants, do you perceive any contemplation of some   kind of extraordinary unspecified intervention by the Federal Reserve to maintain market   function in the wake of hitting the debt ceiling or breaching the debt ceiling?     At the risk of being repetitive as to what President Lacker   already said so eloquently, Mr Chairman, I think it will be important, in advance of any big   event in the markets, for us to be clear to the markets about what our stance is  I think we might   be clear within this Committee, but it’s going to be important as well for that clarity to go   through to the markets  Maybe that can be done by late July or early August or something like   that     I was going to add to what President Lacker said, that I think   there’s a way to put Larry’s comments on the situation in a DSGE framework  Think about a   DSGE model that layers on more heterogeneity among households and maybe has some income   uncertainty for households as well  If you think about those households as facing higher   amounts of income uncertainty, possibly because of the impediments to hiring that President   Lacker points to, those people are going to be engaging in more precautionary saving to buttress   themselves against those risks  And then that will show up in the form of lower individual   consumption, and then aggregate up to lower aggregate consumption  We live for the day when   we have a DSGE model with full and complete markets and that allows for heterogeneity     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Now I want to mention some   anecdotal evidence, following up on something President Hoenig said  My banking supervision   group and I have heard concerns expressed repeatedly from banks that specialize in ag lending   about what they consider weak or lax underwriting practices being used by the Farm Credit   System  Now, the Farm Credit System, when you think about the big banks in the United States,   is relatively small—it’s $200 billion in assets—but it owns about one-third of all the farm debt in   the United States  Its failure is an interesting thing to think about, because it wouldn’t be   systemic from the point of view of the US economy, but it would certainly be systemic, I   believe, in terms of the agricultural sector, which is often viewed as being more significant from   a national perspective than its weight in the national income and product accounts would   suggest   The Farm Credit System is a government-sponsored enterprise; it raises funds by issuing   debt, and that debt is highly rated, probably because it’s a government-sponsored enterprise    Now, I have to say that we should take into account that our banker contacts who tell us that the   Farm Credit System’s underwriting practices are lax are competitors with the Farm Credit   System, and their concern should be viewed in that light  At the same time, the fact that we kept   hearing about this means I think that those comments are sufficiently prevalent to warrant further   investigation by the Board of Governors, and perhaps by the FSOC  One thing that’s worth   June 21–22, 2011 107 of 282              noting is that the FSOC has no representation from the Farm Credit Administration, who is the   safety and soundness overseer for the Farm Credit System  So in some sense, there is no direct   way for this to get to the attention of the FSOC  Thank you, Mr Chairman       Thank you, Mr Chairman  Like the Tealbook, I believe there   has been a slowdown of the pace of the recovery since our last meeting, and I think this   slowdown has been influenced by temporary factors—factors that will reverse themselves in the   months to come  My forecast for real GDP growth is similar to the Tealbook  I’m expecting   growth to accelerate to close to 3½ percent over the second half of 2011, and I’m expecting   growth to be between 3½ and 4 percent over the course of 2012  My relative optimism is shared   by Ninth District business contacts  We’ll be releasing a midyear business poll in our fedgazette   later this month  That poll shows continued moderate improvement in business conditions in the   Ninth District over the past year, with broad-based increases in sales and employment    Consistent with my national forecast, respondents in our District predict that the next 12 months   will be even better  They indicate, too, that labor markets are relatively slack  By and large,   they are finding that workers are widely available with muted wage pressures, and to put that in   context, I should add that unemployment in our District is well under 7 percent  Firms do expect   to expand hiring in the coming 12 months, and that labor markets will tighten slightly   June 21–22, 2011 134 of 282              The poll also shows that firms expect to be able to raise prices over the next 12 months    This finding is consistent with what I see as the national inflation story  Over the past six   months, annualized core PCE inflation was 1½ percent; this is a sharp acceleration of the rate of   inflation  From April to October 2010, annualized PCE core inflation was 06 percent  Such a   rapid rate of increase in six-month PCE core inflation has occurred but twice in the past 15 years    Other more broadly based measures of inflation paint a similar picture  The trimmed mean PCE   inflation calculated by the Dallas Fed was 17 percent from October 2010 to April 2011  The   median CPI reported by the Cleveland Fed was 09 percent from April to October of 2010 and   then rose to 19 percent, annualized, from October 2010 to April 2011  Like the Tealbook, I do   expect core PCE inflation to be 17 percent over the course of 2011, but unlike the Tealbook, I   see core inflation accelerating still further into 2012, and I think this is a symptom of the fact that   I see potential output as being lower than the Tealbook does, perhaps for some of the reasons that   President Lacker mentioned   The behavior of inflation points to diminution of slack in the economy over the past six   months, and I think that the behavior of labor markets also does  Unemployment has fallen from   98 percent in November 2010 to 91 percent in May 2011  Roughly half of this decline is   accounted for by people finding jobs  The employment-to-population ratio has risen—small, but   it has risen—by 02 percentage point  The rest of the decline in unemployment is due to people   leaving the labor force  Now, a key question is  Are the people who departed the labor force   waiting on the sidelines to jump back in when conditions improve?  The Bureau of Labor   Statistics provides monthly estimates of the number of people who are marginally attached to the   labor force—more formally, those who were not currently looking for work but who would like   to work and have looked for work in the past 12 months  That number has fallen by 9 percent   June 21–22, 2011 135 of 282              over the past half-year  This is suggestive that many of the recent departures from the labor   force will not be temporary  More generally, as the unemployment rate falls, people find jobs or   people decide that they’re no longer available for work, and both of these decisions reduce the   pool of available workers for a firm looking to hire  From the point of view of monetary policy,   both kinds of decisions work in the same direction  They increase wage and inflationary   pressures  That’s why forecasting models tend to use the unemployment rate and not labor force   participation as a predictor of future inflation   I fear these recent data are reflective of longer-term uncertainties  Like most of you, I   believe that the unemployment rate will fall back to between 5 and 6 percent by 2016, and in that   sense, I do think labor market slack will normalize, but I am highly uncertain about how that   reduction will be accomplished  Will the unemployed find jobs or will they leave the labor force   permanently?  The answer to this question is a critical one for the United States economy and for   our thinking about monetary policy because it really will shape the longer-run behavior of what   we consider to be potential output  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  At this meeting, I favor   alternative B  However, I do believe that if the economy evolves according to the forecast in the   Tealbook, it is likely that I will favor an alternative closer to C later this year  I will talk about   June 21–22, 2011 177 of 282              why by going back, first, to our discussions yesterday, and then going back to what I said in   January   Our discussions yesterday were quite illuminating for me, because I think people were   able to articulate some of the things that I have been struggling with over the past six months or   so  I think it really comes down to the question of what is potential output, and what is the path   of potential output likely to be  We heard a number of hypotheses offered for why economic   activity has remained so slow, and I think one way to capture that is to look at the behavior of   employment to population, which is essentially the same as it was two years ago  President   Lacker offered the hypothesis that expectations of taxes and regulations, and perhaps the   realization of taxes and regulations, are suppressing economic activity  That shows up as a   decline in potential output that might not be coming through in our models  President Dudley   offered the possibility that the accommodation is becoming blunted by its usage over time, and   that is showing up as an increase in the gap and not a decline in potential  Governor Yellen   offered the possibility that uncertainty is leading firms to defer investment, including hiring,   which can be thought of as another form of investment  And that can be seen either as being a   decline in potential or as an increase in the gap, because it would really depend on what kind of   uncertainty the firms do see themselves facing  One of the things we’ve done in Minneapolis is   to try to evaluate the extent to which uncertainty about Fed policy itself is really suppressing   investment  If you look at measures in asset markets of uncertainty about the movements of   interest rates, those at least do not seem to show uncertainty to be a major force at this time,   which is, I thought, good news   At this stage, you hear all of these possible explanations, and it’s very challenging to sort   out across these  However, I think one key variable that we can be thinking about to cut across   June 21–22, 2011 178 of 282              these various possibilities is inflation itself  If it is really that potential is lower than we think it   is going to be, then we should start to see acceleration in inflation  To pick up on President   Dudley’s point, if the accommodation is getting blunted over time, we should start to see   disinflation taking place  So that brings me back to January, where I laid out three possible   scenarios for the first half of 2011, and they were largely distinguished by the behavior of   inflation  In the first scenario, core inflation was near or below its historically low 2010 levels;   that did not take place  In the second scenario, which I viewed as the most likely, annualized   core was 13 to 15percent in the first half of 2011, and core was expected to rise further to   between 17 and 2 percentage points over the coming year; that is, from this June to June 2012    In the final scenario, annualized core was between 1½ and 2 percent in the first half of the year,   and then headline was actually above 2  In the latter two scenarios, I predicted that   unemployment would be above, but close to, 9 percent  I think the data on inflation and   unemployment have evolved in the first half of 2011 in a way that’s consistent with my third,   relatively high inflation scenario  As a result, inflation is now much closer to a target of   2 percent than it was in November 2010, and measures of the output gap suggest that it’s also   less negative  For one thing, unemployment has fallen; for another, the difference between core   inflation and its past or expected future values has also fallen  Now, as President Plosser   suggested in his remarks, if you use a Taylor-type rule, I think these data all point to a need for   reduction in accommodation relative to what we put in place in November  And this is what I   said in January—if this third, relatively high inflation scenario materialized, we might need to   initiate the first steps of our exit as soon as August   That said, I should emphasize the points on which I turned out to be closer to being right    I have to say, I was also unduly optimistic in this third scenario in the sense that I simply did not   June 21–22, 2011 179 of 282              see the unemployment rate being so close to 9percent without having had a lot more growth in   real GDP than we’ve had, and a lot more growth in employment  However, I still think that the   response I described in January to this relatively high inflation scenario would be the right one    My starting point is that our chosen level of accommodation in November was appropriate    Since that time, I believe that underlying inflation has risen and that slack has fallen  So despite   the sluggish growth in real GDP and employment, I would say that the observed increase in   inflation and the fall in slack would point to a need for a reduction in accommodation during the   second half of this year, beyond the reduction in accommodation that President Williams pointed   to   This somewhat technical argument can be put into a broader context  Many of us,   including myself, have said publicly and to each other that we would like the Federal Reserve to   target a 2 percent inflation rate over the medium term  And some of you around the table have   implicitly or explicitly argued that we can accomplish this goal by basing our policy decisions on   our own internal forecast of the medium-term behavior of inflation  I think this approach is   potentially problematic  For policy to remain credible in the eyes of the public, we need to   reduce accommodation as readily observable and independently collected measures of inflation   rise quickly back to 2 percent  Many of us have spoken out in public about why we felt it was   appropriate to keep our chosen level of accommodation despite increases in energy prices, and I   certainly have spent some time on that myself  I think we are convincing on that because   inflationary expectations have not gone up  But I believe it will be much harder to maintain our   credibility if we do not reduce accommodation in response to sustained increases in the prices of   most goods, as captured by measures of inflation like the core PCE, trimmed mean PCE, and the   median CPI  I will try to put it even less technically  We have enormous amounts of   June 21–22, 2011 180 of 282              accommodation in place  We have the short-term interest rate essentially at zero  We have   $2 trillion of longer-term assets on our balance sheet; that is roughly equivalent, by some staff   estimates, to a cut of about another 2 percentage points in the fed funds rate  I do not believe that   the public will view this kind of enormously accommodative stance as being consistent with our   claims to target a 2percent inflation rate when the prices of many, if not most, goods have   accelerated as quickly as they have to rates of inflation above 1½ percent  As I say, I support B   today, and I would support it with President Williams’s emendation, which I think is an   appropriate one  But I expect that the evolution of data, and especially data about measures of   underlying inflation, will lead me to support an alternative closer to C in the latter part of the   year  Thank you, Mr Chairman     I’m attempting to apply the Taylor principle to the joint   package of accommodation that we have in place so that we are able to, in a sense, lower the fed   funds rate below zero through the LSAP  And so in that sense we’re able to have a policy of   minus 2 percent through the stock of longer-term assets that we have  As time passes, some of   June 21–22, 2011 181 of 282              the effect of that stock, as President Williams has pointed out, will be reduced, but as inflation   rises and slack shrinks, then we should be reducing that joint package of accommodation     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I think risk is a complicated   concept  I think it is a good idea to include language about it, but I think we should do it   contemporaneously with actually releasing our projections about risk— something down the   road     I think that it’s different if you say, “The implications of the   analysis in this paper are that the Committee should—”     Well, because everyone is converging, I was going to suggest   saying “within five years”  But if everyone is happy with where they are, then I’m happy with   that, too     That shows a distressing lack of stamina  [Laughter]  "
9061,2011-08-01,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I had one quick question, which is   that it seems the Treasury’s planning was, as you suggested, Louise, quite fluid  If we were in   the middle of having hit the debt ceiling and the Treasury changed its mind about how it wanted   to prioritize principal and interest payments, would we be in a position to accommodate that   change of mind from an operational standpoint?     That’s correct   August 1, 2011 13 of 53                Thank you  That was very helpful     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I thank Bill for his summary of   his earlier memo   As I stressed in my earlier memo to this Committee, I believe the choices that a central   bank makes during periods of fiscal strain can have potentially important consequences for   August 1, 2011 22 of 53              longer-term price stability  As I see them, all of these choices are grounded in three basic   elements  evaluation of Treasury securities when we make purchases or make loans, the   acceptability of Treasury securities as collateral, and the haircuts to be applied to Treasury   securities when they are offered as collateral   In terms of valuation, the English–Sack memo recommends that we use market prices as   much as possible, and I agree with this prescription  However, I think one thing that we should   be careful about is that the prescription needs to be coupled with a quantity restriction on the   fraction of defaulted-upon Treasuries that we would hold on our balance sheet  Otherwise, we   could be perceived, correctly or incorrectly, as actually setting the prices of those securities   In terms of acceptability, the memo recommends accepting defaulted-upon Treasuries as   collateral  Now, rating agencies would typically downgrade defaulted-upon securities to D  In   that case, our current collateral guidelines and usual private-sector practices would say that these   securities should not be acceptable as collateral  Now, I have to say that my own view is that,   given our employment mandate and the risk to market function, we should deviate from this   standard practice and be willing to accept the defaulted-upon securities as collateral, but we need   to explain that we’re willing to make such a deviation only because we expect all Treasuries to   be paid in full within a short period of time  Without such an explanation, our willingness to   accept D-rated Treasuries could be viewed as a signal of our willingness to monetize the federal   debt and so undercut price stability   In terms of haircuts, the memo essentially recommends using our current practices  I   agree with this approach, including the footnote in Chairman Bernanke’s July 28 memo that we   will change our haircuts in response to sustained increases in market volatility  I think we need   to be clear to the public about our choices about valuation, acceptability, and haircuts, but I think   August 1, 2011 23 of 53              even more important is that we need to be clear about why we are making these choices  In   particular, our communication should explain why our choices help us achieve our fundamental   objectives of maximum employment and price stability as opposed to simply talking about   instrumental goals like market function   Let me turn very briefly to the specific options that Brian and Bill offered in their memo    I’m happy with options 1 to 5  In terms of options 6 and 7, I believe we should certainly   consider these if we think the relevant impairment to market function poses significant risk to   employment  Option 9 involves an expansion of the balance sheet, which I would not favor   simply as a way to deal with a debt ceiling issue  I see option 10 as potentially useful, but with a   caveat that we can’t end up holding so many defaulted-upon securities that it appears that we   were setting their prices  I’ve been speaking as if this is a situation we are actually going to be   dealing with, and of course, right now it looks like it will be only a hypothetical, which I’m   thankful about   Let me close with one final comment about communication if we do have this kind of   event happen in the next day or two or in the future sometime  I think communication will be   critical, and I would very much hope the Chairman would be able to give a press briefing about   the policies that we’re using and communicate why we’re using these policies  I think the issues   are subtle and the choices do matter, but I don’t think we would be able to achieve the right level   of communication without the Chairman’s personal touch  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Yes, Mr Chairman  I just wanted to comment briefly on the   Vice Chairman’s suggested policy action of buying Treasuries  I would counsel that we do not   handle that through a notation vote  I think this would be something that we should consider as a   Committee, because I do think that such an intervention would have potentially profound   consequences for price stability  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
9082,2011-08-09,"  Yes, thank you, Mr Chairman  Brian, I’ve been hearing this   story, and you had mentioned it as well, about how the downgrade on Friday triggered the   decline in equities on Monday  But I’m struggling with putting that together with the fact that   Treasury yields went down so much  Is there a story that’s going around that tries to rationalize   all of that?     Thank you   August 9, 2011 16 of 162                Thank you, Mr Chairman  I don’t know if this is a question   or a comment  David, I thought this picture that you showed about households expecting an   increase in income was extremely interesting  I’m not sure that I’d be so quick to associate it   with a change in demand conditions  If households are expecting a slowdown in potential   income growth, maybe even sharper than the markdown that’s occurred in the Tealbook, I think   if you asked them this question, they would answer it in the same way—that they don’t expect as   much income growth as they had in the past  While I think it is consistent with the story you   said about “Boy, this is showing up as a slowdown in demand,” it could also be a sign of the   households realizing that potential is just not as good as it was in the past     Yes, I’m sympathetic to that     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Over the past six months, there’s   been a decline in optimism among our business contacts in the Ninth District, at least among   those who are not in resource-related businesses and who do not live in the Dakotas  [Laughter]    More specifically, I am now hearing a renewal of the 2010 wait-and-see attitudes on both cap-ex   and hiring  The fading optimism in the Ninth District is reflective of national economic   conditions  As we are all aware, the economy grew slowly in the first half of 2011   I think we can look to housing as being a potential source of this slow growth  In my   view, the roots of this recession and of the slow recovery lie in the loss of housing value and the   concomitant shrinkage of wealth and borrowing capacity  And this process continues  For   example, the flow of funds data tell us that the value of real estate owned by households fell   another 7 percent from the second quarter of 2010 through the first quarter of 2011  We often   focus on the impact of this loss of net worth on demand  However, it also affects the supply side   of the economy  As Governor Duke emphasized in a speech last spring, entrepreneurs rely   heavily on their personal assets and savings to initiate new businesses  Hence, declines in   household net worth disrupt the process of business formation and so disrupt the process of   innovation and job creation that fuels the expansion of potential output  And here, I think, the   August 9, 2011 58 of 162              Census Bureau’s data on job creation from 2006 and 2007 are suggestive  Housing values began   to fall in 2006, and financial conditions generally worsened in 2007  But growth remained   positive until the first quarter of 2008  If you looked at overall job creation, it remained higher in   2007 than in 2006  But the number of jobs created by newborn firms fell from 2006 to 2007 by   12 percent, and of course, it’s gone on to fall sharply further since then   I’ve stressed one channel that links financial frictions and the supply side of the   economy  There are other channels that one could point to  What was initially a demand shock   can actually turn into a supply shock  And I offer some evidence that actually countervails the   thesis that President Lacker was describing  There’s a host of empirical papers that document   how spells of non-employment are associated with significant wage losses  And the question is,   is this due to screening or signaling effects, or is it due to actual deterioration of skills?  There’s a   paper by Edin and Gustavsson from 2008 that uses a Swedish longitudinal data set that links   measures of general literacy and numeracy to measures of employment, and they estimate that a   year of non-employment is associated with an individual moving down 5 percentile points in the   distribution of these general skills in the population  This kind of erosion of skills is another   effect of the fall of net worth generating unemployment and then translating into a corrosive   effect on the supply side of the economy   What’s my point?  My point is, these joint effects on demand and supply make it hard for   us to establish with any certainty to what extent the low growth of the economy translates into   disinflationary pressures, whether the surprising low growth in real GDP reflects slow growth in   potential output or a worsening output gap  And the revisions in the Tealbook arising from the   recent revisions in the NIPA are consistent with this abstract statement  Thus, the August   Tealbook says that the potential GDP grew at only 11 percent in 2009 and only 17 percent in   August 9, 2011 59 of 162              2010, while in April the Tealbook said the potential GDP grew at 2 percent per year in both   years  These uncertainties about potential output imply that we need to use additional sources of   information as we seek to measure changes in resource slack in the economy  For example,   despite the recent modest employment reports, the Tealbook predicts that unemployment will fall   04 percentage point over the course of 2011, and we generally would view this kind of decline   in unemployment as a sign of diminishing resource slack  Now, I talked about it at earlier   meetings—at length, I would say  Unemployment itself is only an imperfect signal about the   amount of slack in the economy  I think it’s useful to turn to inflation itself as a complementary   source of information   And here I think Governor Tarullo is absolutely right, and I’ll put myself in the group   that was surprised on the downside by events in the first half of the year in terms of economic   growth  I think I’ll be surprised on the downside relative to my January forecast by what   happens in the second half of the year  But it’s also true that most of our forecasts were low for   PCE core inflation for 2011  I was probably on the high side relative to most of the people   around the table, and I was forecasting 1½ percent PCE core inflation for 2011  Now I agree   with the Tealbook that we’re likely to come in at something closer to 18, and possibly even   higher, for the entire year  This is something we have to take into account as we think about the   degree of slack and the effectiveness of monetary policy in the economy  So from 2009 to 2010,   core inflation was falling from 17 percent to 1 percent  From 2010 to 2011, as I just talked   about, it’s going to be rising from 1 percent to something like 18 percent  At a minimum, you   would normally think about this increase in the rate of change of inflation—this is the third   derivative of the price level, for those of you who are keeping track of these kinds of things    President Williams appreciates that  [Laughter]  It would seem to indicate that resource slack is   August 9, 2011 60 of 162              lower in 2011 than in 2010  GDP growth in 2011 has been slow, but as the Tealbook emphasizes   on its very first page, we don’t exactly know why it’s been slow  The falling rate of   unemployment and the rising rate of inflation suggest that, despite the slow growth, resource   slack is diminishing  In the next go-round, I will talk about how these considerations should   impact our thinking about policy  Thank you, Mr Chairman     I was supporting President Fisher’s view     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Of necessity more than   preference, I am going to have to follow Governor Tarullo’s admonition to be nimble in my   remarks, and I’ll do my best to do that at the cost of being even less articulate than usual  I am   August 9, 2011 116 of 162              willing to support alternative B as written and circulated  I do not see myself being able to   support any of the emendations except the one that President Plosser offered for paragraph 4    Let me talk about my thinking in that regard  That thinking is framed by the following issue, and   I’m often asked this  What’s the most difficult thing for you in terms of formulating policy   relative to being an academic and thinking about policy?  I think the difference is, for an   academic, it’s a relatively sterile exercise where you write down models and you formulate what   you’re supposed to do, and you come up with some long-term framework that you’re supposed   to use  And I think as a policymaker, quite rightly you’re keeping track of short-run movements   in data and responding to that because there are movements that take place that are outside the   realm of your models, and you have to be moving your thinking accordingly  I think it’s very   challenging to keep hold of your longer-term framework while you’re confronting the short-term   data, and I’m a little concerned about the idea of changing our long-term framework in response   to one week’s worth of information  That’s what I find troubling   Let me talk about our longer-term framework, and I’ll say some things that are going to   be unabashedly hawkish, and I’m going to say some things that I think are fairly dovish  Let me   talk about both of those  My thinking about our longer-term framework is that it’s not just what   we talk about among ourselves and how we understand the dual mandate or exactly what   objective function gets used in the staff simulations  It’s about what we communicate to the   public and to our overseers, the Congress of the United States  My understanding of what that   communication is, and we reiterated this last November, is that our commitment is to follow   policies that will keep inflation at 2 percent or a bit under, and my thinking about further   accommodation is shaped by that commitment   August 9, 2011 117 of 162              What we’re doing right now is using two forms of accommodation—low target interest   rates and large-scale asset holdings  And the way the monetary policy rules work is—and the   rules are designed to target a particular inflation rate, in this case 2 percent—that you tailor the   level of accommodation to the level of underlying inflation and to the level of the output gap    We adopted our current level of accommodation in November 2010, when inflation was very   low, 1 percent and decelerating, and unemployment was 98 percent  What’s the situation now?    Unemployment is lower than it was at that point  Core PCE inflation ran over 2 percent over the   past six months  Other measures of medium-term inflationary pressures—for example, the   median CPI and the trimmed-mean CPI calculated by the Cleveland Fed—have also run near   2 percent over that period  None of these changes in the economic position since November—  the fall in unemployment and the rise in available measures of underlying inflation—argue in   favor of easing given, as I said, that our longer-term framework that we effectively   communicated was that we’re trying to keep inflation at 2 percent or a bit under, with the idea   that when pressures that are pushing up unemployment are coming along, they’re also pushing   down inflation, and as we act to move inflation back up to 2 percent, we’re also acting to keep   unemployment low  In fact, as I argued last time, I think the changes in the economic picture   relative to November could well argue for reducing accommodation, but I think that that would   really be ignoring the data  I think the data do lead one to think we could be facing a   substantially wider output gap than even what’s in the Tealbook  The way we would see that is,   we should start to see downward pressures on inflation  I think this is the scenario, for example,   of the New York Fed forecast  The New York Fed is forecasting 11 percent core inflation next   year  I think one way to resolve this is to see more information about incoming data on core   inflation and inflationary expectations  So I just don’t see adopting more accommodation at this   August 9, 2011 118 of 162              stage as being consistent with our public commitment to keep inflation at 2 percent or a bit   under   The other way to put this is, if we want to follow policies consistent with our public   commitments, we should be prepared to change what our communication of our longer-run   framework is  I think this gets to some of the statements about lack of self-equilibration in the   economy that Governor Raskin talked about and the staff talked about  So what’s going on—or   one story of what’s going on—is that we’ve got deleveraging that’s pushing down on   consumption, and that means there aren’t enough jobs  But if there was equilibrium, what should   happen in the marketplace is that real interest rates should decline enough to generate enough   consumption demand  Even though people don’t want to eat as much now because of all the   shocks that have hit them, if real interest rates fall enough, they’re not going to want to save, and   that will make them spend, and that will generate jobs, and that will generate employment  So   what’s interfering with this possibility?  Well, one argument for what’s interfering with this   possibility is the zero lower bound—and that if you’re at the zero lower bound, and you have a   commitment, as we have, to keep inflation at 2 percent or a bit under, that means you’ve put a   lower bound on the real interest rate  It can’t go below negative 2 percent, which sounds really,   really low, but maybe it needs to be lower  Making a public commitment to a higher target   inflation rate—at least temporarily, as perhaps President Evans is advocating, or possibly   permanently—would expand the range of possible outcomes you could attain  In particular, you   could generate policies that would lead the real interest rate to fall below negative 2 percent    This is not something I would argue we should adopt today  It is something we should be   thinking about and considering in response to what has been a long-term issue—that the   economy is not recovering anywhere near as rapidly as we think it should, given conditions  We   August 9, 2011 119 of 162              should be thinking about whether or not that’s because of the fact that we’re not able to generate   the real interest rates we need to get equilibrium   One thing that I certainly agree with Governor Yellen on is that I think it would be great   to have a two-day meeting in September, and one of the things I think we should be talking about   at that point is the possibility of adopting a hard target inflation rate  I also don’t rule out the   possibility of changing our framework and our way of thinking given the data we have seen   coming in  I think we should do that  What I object to is the notion that we should be doing that   on the fly in response to a relatively short flow of information  I think it would be useful to have   staff analysis of the costs and benefits of taking such a step  But failing that, given that we have   a particular framework in place that we have communicated to the public, which is that we are   interested in keeping inflation at 2 percent or a bit under, I don’t see ourselves being able to   adopt further accommodation  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Yes, I’m not sure that helps, unfortunately  I was just going   to point out that while it is true that using “extended period until 2013” accords pretty much with   our estimates of what our mean would be—or actually, I think, it’s even to the left of that—the   reason it’s useful policy from one perspective—why it’s accommodative—is that you’re   shearing off the possibility of raising rates or reversing accommodation before that  We can’t   both argue that it’s not going to have any effect and view it as increasing accommodation    That’s my only point     I’ll have to think about it more      Could I clarify one thing, Mr Chairman?     I would not be able to support the alternative, even as   rewritten with Governor Duke’s proposed change of language   MR FISHER  Which is?     Not at this time, no  "
9110,2011-09-20,"  Yes, thank you, Mr Chairman  Brian, I just have a quick   factual question, which is, how much usage of the ECB swap lines has there been so far?     Oh, I see     Thanks  That was very helpful     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I had a question and a comment    The question was about the observation that if we executed either the MEP or the LSAP, we’d be   holding 40 percent of the Treasuries with maturity over six years  To me, that suggests that these   operations might not be all that scalable  So in the sense that if we faced further deterioration in   the economy and we wanted to provide more accommodation at that stage, it would be difficult   for us to think about working through augmenting these programs  Is that a fair conclusion?     Thanks  And then the comment is about how, if we were to   lower the IOER, banks could begin imposing explicit negative deposit rates  This is reminiscent   of conversations I’ve had with people—they typically tend to be older people—who are   complaining about the low interest rates they’re earning on their savings  The comment that I’m   tempted to make, but which I have not made yet in public, is that this is actually a feature, not a   bug  [Laughter]  We’re trying to get them to consume, as opposed to saving, to spend money on   their grandkids and lend to that promising young entrepreneur down the street, as opposed to   holding money, and so this actually would be a sign of the program working   September 20–21, 2011 26 of 290                No, that’s fair     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I was willing to go first, and often   a willingness to go first implies that you are going to talk for a long time  That’s not always true    But it turns out to be true in this case  [Laughter]  I’ll start by framing things to a certain extent    My decision in August and my words today are centered on a simple premise that a central   bank’s primary asset is its credibility  I think we need to communicate our objectives clearly and   consistently make choices that are in keeping with those announced objectives  Without that   communication and that consistency, we’ll lose our credibility and our effectiveness  In that   context, I’m going to touch on three issues  The first is objectives and communication, the   second is forward guidance, and the third is quantitative easing   I am going to talk about the three messages  The first is on the communication and   objectives issue  I think that before adding more accommodation, the Committee, and especially   its leadership, should clearly communicate to the public that in light of the disappointing state of   the labor market, it is willing to allow core inflation to rise above 2 percent, and potentially near   to 3 percent, for possibly several years  The second is that I think we need a method of   providing incremental variation and accommodation at the zero lower bound  And I have   another suggestion to throw into the mix, and that is that the Committee should vary the level of   September 20–21, 2011 35 of 290              accommodation by announcing changes in its expectation of the duration of the stay at the zero   lower bound under what it perceives to be an optimal monetary policy  So not a date, as we   currently have—mid-2013—but rather a duration  I’ll discuss why I think that would be   preferable to the date that we currently have  Actually, Governor Tarullo has already touched on   this in his memo  The third is that we should keep an LSAP in reserve  Rather than using it   now, I think we should keep an LSAP in reserve in case we have to raise inflation expectations,   as in 2010   Let me start with the objectives and communication issue  Right now, I perceive a large   disconnect between the Committee’s objective function and our communication to the public   about that objective function  I got the sense at our last meeting that, given the state of the labor   market, many—possibly most—meeting participants would be willing to follow monetary   policies that would expose the economy to a significant risk of inflation being as high as   2½ percent, or possibly even 3 percent, over a multiyear period  In contrast, our communication   to the public, as well as our earlier actions, has been widely interpreted as being very clear that   we will not allow inflation to rise above 2 percent  I think that before we engage in further   accommodation, this disconnect needs to be repaired  One way to do this is by repeating the   following sentiments through speeches, testimony, and the like to basically state what I have just   said, that the Committee believes, given the parlous state of the labor market—you don’t have to   use the word “parlous,” but I like it [laughter]—appropriate monetary policy could result in PCE   core inflation rising above 2 percent, possibly to 3 percent, for several years  And I think this   message would be most effective if it came from the leadership of the Committee—the Vice   Chairman of the FOMC, the Vice Chair of the Board of Governors, and the Chairman  So on   objectives and communication, I think we need to fix the public perception of what our objective   September 20–21, 2011 36 of 290              is—or at least what our communication to the public has been—and what the feeling is within   the room   Let me turn to the right form of accommodation, and I’ll talk about the language in   alternative A first  I’m not supportive of the proposed language in paragraph 2  In terms of   inflation, I think the SEP already provides a way to communicate our perspectives about   appropriate medium-term inflation goals  And the language in paragraph 2 just seems designed   to undercut what I view as the valuable heterogeneity in those perspectives  There is   heterogeneity within the room  That is communicated through the SEP  I don’t see any reason   to take that out of our communication  In terms of unemployment, I do report a number for my   five-year forecast for the unemployment rate, conditional on optimal monetary policy, in the   SEP  But I’m not asked to report a standard error bound of any kind for that  Let me tell you, it   would be large  My own five-year forecast for the unemployment rate, labor force participation,   and the employment-to-population ratio are all highly uncertain, even assuming we do follow   optimal monetary policy  I would say it’s a mistake to put a long-run unemployment number   into the statement, given how much uncertainty at least I feel about that number   Now, I’m very sympathetic to the goal of paragraph 4, and that is, it tries to provide a   partial description of the reaction function of the Committee  I’m a big fan of rules-based   approaches to monetary policy, and I think I’d really like us to continue to work toward   formulating an appropriate reaction function  That work, I think, has to continue within this   room first, before we are really ready to start communicating to the public about it  I’d be very   interested in hearing what others have to say about it  My own guess is that we are still some   way from achieving what I view as the necessary degree of consensus on the form of our   reaction function   September 20–21, 2011 37 of 290              But in any event, even if we do get some kind of consensus within the room, I’m   skeptical about the utility of using the compressed language of the statement to communicate,   even partially, our reaction function  In the past, we’ve used the statement to describe the results   of feeding current conditions into what is our reaction function  When we say we arrive at a fed   funds rate target, that’s basically to say we have a reaction function, and what we have done is   feed the current conditions into the reaction function  It spits out a target  This obviously   operates at a more holistic level than the mechanistic level that I’m describing, but that’s what   gives rise to what occurs in the statement  And I’d like to continue that practice—to strive for a   form of accommodation that can mimic that  Once we have some kind of agreement about the   nature of the Committee’s reaction function, I think we can convey its contours much more   effectively using the richer forms of communication that are available to us, like the press   conference tool, speeches, and testimony  That said, we do need some way to vary the level of   accommodation in response to economic conditions when we are at the zero lower bound  And   as I touched on in my questions, I do not think that the balance sheet adjustments are going to   lend themselves to that, so I think communication is going to be the right way to be thinking   about that   Let me suggest an alternative approach that builds naturally from our previous   statements  When you go to talk to the public—and they always ask it jokingly, but it really is   what’s on their mind—the main thing they want to know is, what’s going to happen to interest   rates?  And I think that’s what we should be communicating in our statement  The current   statement addresses this by saying that interest rates will stay low “at least through mid-2013”    But that lower bound itself generates some uncertainty that might be avoidable  Instead, I would   suggest just telling the public what they want to know—it’s going to have an impact on their   September 20–21, 2011 38 of 290              decisions—that is, our current best forecast of when liftoff will transpire, assuming that we   follow what we view as optimal policy  For example, the November statement could read, “The   Committee currently anticipates that interest rates will remain extraordinarily low for the next   12 quarters”  And I said “12,” which is not “mid-2013,” obviously, but “mid-2013” was a lower   bound, so presumably you are going to want to add beyond that  That is a fixed period of   duration, and the reason I say that is, if in December the Committee decides to leave the level of   accommodation unchanged, then you would just leave the statement unchanged  If you come   back in December and conditions look exactly the same as in November, well then, you should   have the same length of time at the zero lower bound coming out of your reaction function  It   shouldn’t be that you’re going to be six weeks closer to the time of liftoff, which is what I think   Governor Tarullo mentioned in his memo  In contrast, if conditions remain the same in   December, the date of anticipated liftoff would just automatically roll forward by six weeks  If   we removed accommodation, 12 quarters could become 11 quarters; if we added   accommodation, 12 would become 13  Now, I think this obviously presents communication   challenges  You want to make it clear that this is a projection, an expectation, not a   commitment  But I think this can be done at the November press conference, where what I’ve   just said could be articulated  I just think that the expected duration of this lower bound is an   easily understood, relevant, and continuous variable that can be adjusted in response to economic   conditions, just as we used to vary the fed funds rate  I think it is an approach that merits some   attention as we think about what kinds of tools we’re going to use to vary the level of   accommodation at the zero lower bound   What about balance sheet adjustments and the IOER?  The staff memo just points to   distinct limits on capacity for all of these tools  Obviously, on the IOER, I don’t think we’re   September 20–21, 2011 39 of 290              going to go negative on it, so there is a limit on the capacity on that  I think there are also limits   on the balance sheet adjustments, as Julie and I talked about  We are essentially talking about   almost a one-time use on that, and I just don’t see them as a viable method of providing   accommodation on an ongoing basis  The second LSAP was clearly effective in reducing the   risk of deflation; it is a real positive of our implementation of that  I would think about   providing incremental variation in accommodation using this expected duration of stay at the   zero lower bound  Just keep the LSAP in reserve in case we feel the need to raise inflation   expectations  Now, that time may be coming closer than I would like, given what Brian was   talking about in terms of deflation possibilities  But in any event, I think the size of our balance   sheet, whether it should or not, economically does seem to have an influence on people’s   inflation expectations  And I think we should keep that in mind   I will close by returning to my first message  If you look at the staff’s optimal control   exercises in Tealbook, Book B, and in the forward guidance memo, they strongly suggest the   FOMC could do better with respect to its dual mandate, even if one put relatively little weight on   unemployment, if it follows policies that admit significant risk of inflation running above   2 percent and possibly close to 3 percent  And I think that before adopting the accommodation   that is consistent with those outcomes, the Committee and its leadership need to clearly   communicate their willingness to undertake those policies and to have those kinds of outcomes    Given my own baseline forecast for the economy, which I will talk about later today or   tomorrow, I think of this kind of communication as really being necessary and sufficient for   further accommodation  If the Committee is willing to undertake this kind of forthright   communication about its willingness to have higher than mandate-consistent inflation for several   years, I would be in favor of adding more accommodation  I would be opposed to adding more   September 20–21, 2011 40 of 290              accommodation if it is not  My concern is credibility  This communication fix would, I think,   take care of that concern  Thank you, Mr Chairman     I’ll refrain from making comments about how much CNBC   has read Lars Svensson’s work  [Laughter]  As you referred to in your framing remarks, Mr   Chairman,  I think it is important to keep in mind that the thresholds that are being used in   paragraph 4 of alternative A are not u*  They are a way to describe when the Committee will   raise interest rates as consistent with some notion of u* being maybe 5 to 6 percent     Okay  So that’s the way I took it  With all that said, I think   we can get to a point where we all understand that in this room  I think the challenges in   communicating that to the broader public might be pretty high   September 20–21, 2011 54 of 290                It’s good to have oil, isn’t it?  [Laughter]     I was going to make a very quick comment  Governor   Tarullo pointed to the idea that we have to be careful about whether we’re thinking about   thresholds or triggers or rules when we put these numbers into the statement  In light of that, I   would caution that if we do end up putting numbers in—which, as I’ve indicated, I’m not excited   about—I think we want to be careful to choose numbers that we’re not likely to change  I think   there’s a tendency to say we want to stick close to 2 percent not to scare people, and so we put in   something like 2¼ or 2½ or whatever  But you want to think down the path and consider that   unemployment has remained very obdurate in the space of a great deal of stimulus  If we get to a   point where our medium-term outlook for inflation is above 2½, closer to 3, and unemployment   is still at 8½ or 9, what are we going to want to do?  Admittedly, the way that it is crafted is all in   September 20–21, 2011 109 of 290              terms of thresholds, so it looks as though we have the flexibility, but the interpretation will   matter as well     But you won’t  [Laughter]     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I heard from a variety of business   contacts in the Ninth District in the intermeeting period, and I would say the dominant word is   “caution”  There is hiring going on in the Ninth District  There is cap ex going on  But neither   is proceeding at a rate necessary to spur significant economic growth  And as a result, the   unemployment rate has remained relatively steady in the District over the past few months, albeit   at a rate much lower than that of the national average   Nationally, my outlook has deteriorated since August but remains slightly more   optimistic in the near term than the Tealbook  And certainly I would say “slightly”  I now   expect the unemployment rate to fall to just over 8½ percent by the end of next year, and I expect   real GDP growth to average 23 percent over the two-year period from the fourth quarter of 2010   September 20–21, 2011 154 of 290              to the fourth quarter of 2012—that is, through 2011 and 2012  My forecast for inflation has   firmed slightly, and I now expect core inflation to average 2 percent per year over the two-year   period from the end of 2010 to the end of 2012 under what I would consider optimal monetary   policy  I would say, like President Lockhart, that I was quite sympathetic to, and found   appealing in terms of my own views about the economy, the scenario described as “Greater   Supply-Side Damage” in the Tealbook  That means that on the real side, I’m expecting the   recovery to continue but at a painfully slow pace  On the inflation side, under the assumption of   no additional accommodation at this time, the evolution of prices is consistent with our dual   mandate   Let me talk about risks  I was asked to give a talk to the senior leadership conference in   Chicago  And one of the things I talked about was the need to do contingency planning—not   just private contingency planning, but also public contingency planning  And let me talk about   what I mean by that  My baseline forecast, as I mentioned, is that inflation will run at 2 percent   over the next several years  But I do see a lot of risks to that  In particular—as I’ll talk about in   a few minutes—I see risks that what I’m judging to be deterioration of the supply side is actually   something that’s occurring on the demand side  And that’s going to lead to more disinflation   than what I’m anticipating   So what’s one way we can deal with that through public contingency planning?  Well, I   think that translates into price-level targeting  There’s been some talk about generating threes   now to make up for ones we had in 2010 and in 2009  I think that’s a rhetorical flourish  I see   those ones as being totally sunk at this point  By promising threes now, we can’t make those   ones into twos  But it may be useful to promise to make up for future ones—if we had a one in   September 20–21, 2011 155 of 290              2012, to make up for that with threes further down the road  That kind of promise—that’s what   price-level targeting is all about—could help curb disinflationary pressures   Now, contingency planning about Europe is much more delicate  But it’s important for   us, and it’s an urgent problem for us, to have in mind what kinds of responses we would take    And I don’t think those responses would take the form of monetary policy  Mr Chairman, you   said, I believe, that it would take some form of our lender-of-last-resort function  It’s important   for us to be clear about what we can do and what we are prepared to do  And establishing that   clarity is very challenging because you don’t want to create the very risk that you’re trying to   control  But at the same time, I think many market participants are likely confused about what   Dodd–Frank has left intact for us and what it has not and about what we can and can’t do without   the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury  So trying to be clear about what we can and are   prepared to do in the event of severe liquidity pressures due to a European crisis could be very   important  Of course, the first thing is some kind of an internal discussion   In terms of monetary policy, as always—and as we just heard in this cross-table   discussion between President Evans and President Lacker—our decisions hinge on our   judgments about the quantity of slack in the economy  I do think that President Evans’s   dichotomy in demand and supply was a little bit sharp compared with what we can discern    Speaking for myself, I would certainly agree that the initial shock that hit the economy in 2008   was clearly a demand shock, and any model that tried to say otherwise I would be quite   suspicious of  But there have been ongoing shocks from that  If you just fed that initial shock   into the model, you would have expected a relatively rapid recovery from that  And here I’m   talking about the usual New Keynesian models  I think a series of ongoing shocks that we   certainly aren’t fully on top of has been hitting what’s going on in the labor market   September 20–21, 2011 156 of 290              What’s important here is that in a lot of the models we write down, labor is just not as   dynamic a decision as it is in real life  When firms hire workers, first of all, they don’t think   about that individual worker  They think about how it’s going to affect a group of workers, and   they think about that as being something that’s going to be lasting over a longer period of time    Once you admit that possibility, you can start to think about taxes, regulation, and firing costs    When you talk to firms, they say that they learned how big firing costs were in 2008 and they do   not want to go through firing again, so they’re very reluctant to hire  Regarding mismatch,   there’s labor-biased technological change that has gone on over the past two years as well as a   variety of forms of uncertainty, some of which are on the demand side, certainly, and some of   which are on the real side  All of this is to say not that the supply-side shocks are clearly what   are going on, but that it is much more confusing than simply saying that it’s clearly a demand-  side disturbance  That’s why I’ve been pushing in past meetings, and continue to push, the idea   that looking at inflation data, the behavior of inflation, is what helps us sort out across these   things  And the increase in inflation since the end of 2010 is disturbing on that and points to   more support for this “Greater Supply-Side Damage” hypothesis than one would like   I’ll close by pointing out that by some measures, there’s not that much slack in the   economy  I thought it was interesting to compare measures of slack now with those in mid-2004,   during what was then considered a jobless recovery  I think we have a better perspective on   what that can look like now  Capacity utilization right now is essentially the same as it was in   June 2004; I’m talking about overall capacity utilization  The fraction of the labor force that has   been unemployed for less than 15 weeks is only slightly higher now than it was in June 2004    And just as in 2011, the data available on PCE core inflation in mid-2004 showed a sharp   increase to over 1½ percent  As many of you will recall, the Committee reduced accommodation   September 20–21, 2011 157 of 290              in mid-2004, whereas the Committee increased accommodation last month  Now, I’ve left out   one huge difference in terms of measures of slack—a long-term unemployment rate, which is   much higher now than it was in June 2004  So I think this comparison suggests that the   Committee is currently attempting to use additional accommodation as a way to bring down the   very high long-term unemployment rate  Unfortunately, I believe that it may take large amounts   of inflation to reduce long-term unemployment by even a small amount  I’m not saying that that   tradeoff is not a worthwhile one  It depends on your loss function, certainly  But I think if that’s   what we’re trying to do, we should be clear to ourselves that’s what we are doing, and we should   be clear to ourselves that the relevant inflation costs may in fact be significant  And to return to   my theme from earlier, I think we can retain our credibility only if we are also clear to the public   about the potential inflationary costs involved in attempting to reduce long-term unemployment   using monetary accommodation  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I wanted to make a comment   about the use of the date as opposed to my suggestion yesterday of using an announcement of   expected duration of our stay at the zero lower bound  Right now, if the Committee were to stay   with the mid-2013 date, in some sense the default is reducing accommodation from that, because   you are moving closer to the time when that date is going to take place  So the default stance is   September 20–21, 2011 192 of 290              that you are reducing accommodation  That is very different from when you choose to leave the   fed funds rate the same  In that case, you are not reducing accommodation, you are keeping   accommodation the same  If, instead, the Committee had said in August that they expected that   conditions would warrant keeping the fed funds rate exceptionally low for two years, you could   leave that statement in place, roll forward six weeks, and you would have the same level of   accommodation in place   Now, I have talked offline to some of you about this, and I agree with the general   sentiment that we don’t want to be making too many changes at one time  I’ll take that as read    But I do think that, going forward, we are going to spend a long time at the zero lower bound  It   is worthwhile to make this change—away from a date to a duration—to get away from the   automatic tightening that is built into this     That’s correct     But that’s how raising the rate usually works, Bill, right?  If   you look at a usual kind of monetary policy rule, you will set the rate according to current   conditions  But if you are below trend and there is mean reversion, you are expecting conditions   to improve, and as they do, you raise the rate accordingly  Even if you are on your forecast path   under the usual fed funds rate in normal conditions, we would be raising the rate along that path,   even if things just played out according to what we expected  So that’s right  I’m trying to   design a system at the zero lower bound that will work the way our fed funds rate movement will   September 20–21, 2011 193 of 290              usually work  I will talk more about this in my policy statement, where I think our not using this   over the past 10 months has actually had a cost     Right, sure     One suggestion I would have is that the Committee actually   specify exactly what inflation rates they had in mind when they say that inflation rates are   moderating  I think it is certainly true of the three-month frequency  Maybe it is also true of the   six-month frequency  If the Committee has a particular frequency in mind, then you can make   reference to that     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I favor alternative C  I do not see   alternative B as being consistent with our decisionmaking in November of 2010  Inflation, and   the outlook for inflation, has risen since then  Unemployment, and the outlook for   unemployment, has fallen  I should clarify what I mean by the term “outlook” using it in a   different sense from how Governor Yellen and President Williams have been using it  When I   September 20–21, 2011 223 of 290              think about what outlook is relevant for the course of monetary policy, I try to think about what   horizon you might think monetary policy is going to be effective at  In November 2010, one   might look ahead to the end of 2011—a one-year-ahead look—and see where unemployment is   going to be and where inflation is going to be at that point  I won’t remember the numbers off   the top of my head, but my recollection is that in November 2010 we were thinking about   unemployment being around 9 percent by the end of 2011 and that inflation would be running   13 percent, or so, over the course of the year  Now, we come forward to September 2011 and,   again, looking at what horizon do you think monetary policy is going to be effective at, that   horizon is still one more year out  The right way to think about it is to consider our one-year-  ahead outlook in November 2010 compared with our one-year-ahead outlook now  And once   you do that kind of comparison, it is clear that the changes in economic conditions do not justify   the addition of further accommodation, relative to November  One possibility is that our   objectives for inflation and unemployment have changed, that we are willing to tolerate more   inflation than we were in November of 2010  If that’s true, then that change has to be   communicated to the public  I detected heterogeneity of viewpoints even within this table about   whether we are following what one might call a hard inflation-targeting framework or a flexible   inflation-targeting framework  We have to be clear to the public about which framework we are   actually using  I will come back to that toward the end of my remarks   Two things have been difficult and have made the decisionmaking hard since last   November  One is that I don’t think we had a good tool for varying incremental amounts of   accommodation as conditions changed  From November through March, conditions improved    In fact, I remember being asked, even in January by reporters, “Look, things have gotten better    Shouldn’t you actually stop the purchase program at this point, or curtail it early?”  I don’t think   September 20–21, 2011 224 of 290              any of us felt like we should do that, with possible exceptions  But, by and large, we didn’t have   an incremental tool for varying the level of accommodation as economic conditions varied  Let   me talk about how my duration idea might have worked, my idea that the statement would   include some expectation of how long we would stay at the zero lower bound over the last 10   months or so  In November 2010, I think we would have said something like, “We expect to be   at the zero lower bound for eight quarters”  Then, as conditions would have improved, in March   I think that it would have been very reasonable to move that up to, say, five or six quarters    Certainly, we were talking a lot about exit among ourselves at that stage  We can quarrel about   whether there would have been a consensus view, but let’s take it as five to six quarters  From   June to August, as things really worsened, you would have been able to do the natural thing,   which is to add accommodation  The problem is that we didn’t take accommodation away in the   natural course of events as things improved   The other issue is that I don’t think unemployment and inflation are the triggers for this   Committee  When I listen to people talk, I hear a lot of discussion about what is going on in   terms of employment growth and what’s going on in real GDP  I think real GDP growth and that   performance is very important in the thinking of many people around the Committee  I say that   only because I think it should give people pause about what you want to include in the statement   as your triggers—be sure that those are the variables that we’re conditioning decisionmaking on    I would certainly argue that for November 2010 through September 2011, those were not the   variables that were critical in thinking about the conditioning decisionmaking  I think it was the   poor performance of real GDP relative to expectations that was critical   At the risk of being even more tedious, I will talk about why exactly I favor alternative C    Let me take the 1999 Taylor rule  This is generally regarded as a description of past behavior by   September 20–21, 2011 225 of 290              the Committee that led to relatively good outcomes, and it is also viewed, at least among the   rules that John Taylor suggested, as being relatively accommodative  Take the output gap in that   model and translate it to an unemployment gap, and here you have to make a choice about how   that translation works  I am going to choose an Okun’s law coefficient of 2, which serves to   make the rules less accommodative, and I will use the staff’s effective NAIRU of 6½ percent  I   will use core inflation of 16 percent, which is measured over the past year, and unemployment is   91 percent  If we plug that into the resulting Taylor rule, the right-hand side, it is going to say   the fed funds rate should be negative 180 basis points, which sounds very low  The fed funds   rate itself is between 0 and 25 basis points  Now the question is  how much accommodation is   being provided by the cumulative effect of the LSAP?  In November 2010, staff estimates were   that the LSAP was providing about 200 basis points of accommodation  As President Williams   has emphasized to us, this really depends on how long investors expect us to keep reinvesting the   proceeds from the LSAP  It is worth noting that in November 2010 investors’ modal forecast   was that the exit process would take place less than two years later  I would say that, at this   meeting at least, the LSAP is providing at least as much accommodation now as it did in   November 2010  If you add this all up, you get a left-hand side of a fed funds rate of roughly   minus 175 basis points  That means that alternative C is the alternative that is most consistent   with the 1999 Taylor rule  This calculation I just offered is based on the staff’s estimate of the   NAIRU  I certainly think that the recent behavior of inflation and wages suggests that the   NAIRU could be higher than 6½ percent, which would translate into a need for tighter policy   The version of the Taylor rule that I am using has a particular inflation objective in it,   which is to keep inflation at 2 percent  That is consistent with our communication of our current   inflation objective  That is ultimately why I favor alternative C  It is the alternative that is most   September 20–21, 2011 226 of 290              consistent with our communication of our inflation objectives  Indeed, my baseline forecast is   that further accommodation along the lines of alternative B is likely to lead inflation to average   2 percent over the next two years   Let me pose a counterfactual  Suppose that over the past few months the Committee   clearly communicated to the public its willingness to accept inflation higher than 2 percent, or   even as high as 3 percent  Then I would say that my concerns about credibility would have been   met  President Lacker has raised some very important issues about that communication and what   it would mean for longer-term expectations  But if we have a flexible inflation-targeting   framework, we should not be operating it clandestinely  I think there are good public policy   reasons for that, and at heart, it limits our effectiveness  If we had clearly communicated our   willingness to accept inflation higher than 2 percent, or even as high as 3 percent, my concerns   about credibility would have been met, and I would have been willing to support additional   accommodation at this meeting  But as it is, Mr Chairman, I am going to be supporting   alternative C     I think it is going to average slightly above 2 percent over the   next two years     Mr Chairman, I think that this underscores the challenges of   communicating with the public on this point  I think that the public perception of our framework   is closer to the idea that we will not tolerate 2 percent  It would be very helpful to clarify—  exactly as you have now with me—what our inflation target means and what it does not mean    In my view, the reactions to President Evans’ recent remarks show that there is a sense in the   general public and in the media that our medium-term targets really translate into something we   have to meet on a year-by-year basis   September 20–21, 2011 228 of 290              Those of us that are involved in the idea of monitoring cost recovery for the product   office might be familiar with this example  In the product office, they are supposed to recover   costs over a 10-year horizon  The way we implement that is by watching them closely on an   annual basis to make sure they are doing cost recovery  With that, I think it will be very   helpful—certainly for my own thinking about policy—for the general public to hear exactly this   clear explanation you just gave to me about what the framework is  Thank you      I voted, but I thought it was a straw poll     I like Eric’s suggestion  "
9136,2011-11-01,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Thanks for the great memo, and   thanks for the great presentation, Michael  I had two quick questions  One is, in exhibit 3, when   I look at PCE prices under nominal income targeting, the graph ends in 2018, and we are still   above 3 percent  How long do we stay above 2 percent in that simulation?     Yes, I agree with that     I agree, yes     Thanks  That was useful  This is not my second question  It   is more of a follow-up  I think that this gets back to something that President Lacker was asking   about discretion  One thing that might be interesting to know is the size of the losses that are   being forgone by a discretionary FOMC as we go along these scenarios  If you are in 2017, and   the inflation rate is at 3 percent and unemployment is down under 4, what is that FOMC thinking   about how much they are forgoing in terms of the losses?  I think that would help us understand   how credible these kinds of plans are  I don’t know if I was making sense or not     My second question is, what is the size of our shortfall, in   terms of nominal GDP, right now?  The staff has an estimate of potential, and I think the   shortfall right now is being calculated relative to that notion of potential GDP, and that comes to   be about 7 percent in the current quarter relative to where we were starting in December ’07 or   something like that, fourth quarter ’07  Many outside observers would say that the gap is   actually 4 percentage points bigger than that because they are using some kind of trend line from   December ’07 to be their guidepost   The challenge right now is, how do we start to communicate about our nuanced measures   of potential GDP to the public relative to just drawing the straight trend line, which I think is   November 1–2, 2011 17 of 282              more what people are used to?  I will speak for myself  When I try to communicate to the public   about how deep this episode has been, I use the trend line  For one thing, I think potential GDP   is Class II FOMC information, so I am not able to talk about it  [Laughter]  But more seriously,   it is a challenge for us to say that we are going to do nominal income targeting, but, by the way,   we don’t view ourselves as responsible for 4 percentage points of what you think of as a   shortfall  It is a communication issue that might be hard     Yes  Thank you, Mr Chairman  The dialogue that you and   President Evans just had is relevant when we think about the Eggertson and Woodford model   and the Werning model  I have to admit I understand the Werning model a little better, but in   those models, basically, price-level targeting works extremely well, except for the presence of   the zero lower bound  It means in some settings that you’re not able to keep prices growing at   2 percent or constant  If you’re ever in a situation where you’re meeting your price-stability   mandate in the Werning model, if you’re doing well on that and hitting 2 percent, 2 percent,   2 percent, you do not have a problem in that model  That’s also true in Eggertson and   Woodford   I think it’s important to make this distinction that you just made between that and Japan   and the US in the ’30s, that those were situations where you could easily point to problems on   the price-stability mandate and see that the central bank is not behaving optimally  I think it’s   more challenging in our current environment where, as you expect in Minneapolis, we’ve done   extremely well on our price-stability mandate—over the past four or  five years, we’ve done very   well on it  There are some differences of opinion about how well we’re going to be doing going   forward, but even there the differences of opinion are relatively minor compared to what we saw   in Japan   November 1–2, 2011 33 of 282              I think when we look at these New Keynesian models—they’re very hard to bring   support for the kind of commitment policies that President Evans has in mind because we’re just   not that far away from our price-stability mandate     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll echo the many thanks that   have gone to the staff for the memos, particularly the Erceg et al memo that formed the basis of   this conversation, but I see I’m going to be drawing on the other memos as well  Very   November 1–2, 2011 57 of 282              impressive work over a very short period of time  With that said, I think there is room for   considerably more analysis before we decide on a framework that is designed to govern Federal   Reserve actions for the next 8 to 10 years and possibly beyond  Any monetary policy rule has   two linked components, which are the initial level of accommodation it is providing and then a   description of how that accommodation changes over time and responds to changes in   conditions   Now, the initial level of accommodation that’s being provided by a given rule is a little   arbitrary  Several people have already mentioned this, but I’ll chime in as well  If we target a   price-level path that began in the fourth quarter of 2008, we’ll get a different amount of initial   accommodation than if we target a price-level path that begins in the fourth quarter of 2007  I   don’t think of the initial amount of accommodation as really being a definitive property of price-  level targeting or any rule  What really is defining a rule is how that accommodation varies in   response to how conditions change   I’m going to separate two questions in what I’m going to say before I go on  I’ll talk at   some length about these two questions before I go on to the four questions that were posed by the   staff  The first question I’m going to talk about is, what is the current level of accommodation   that we want to provide?  And then, second, what kind of rule should govern how that   accommodation varies in response to changes in conditions?  It’s very important to do this   separation because there are several Committee members who feel very strongly that the current   level of accommodation is unduly low, and the state of economy is such that this probably needs   to be corrected rapidly  It would be untoward to address this perceived need for an urgent   increase in our current level of accommodation by changing our framework  Rather, we should   be able to figure out how to augment the current level accommodation while retaining the ability   November 1–2, 2011 58 of 282              to be appropriately deliberate in our decisionmaking about a framework designed to govern the   next decade of monetary policy  I’m going to try to sketch one way to answer these two separate   questions—current level of accommodation and then evolution—and then I’ll come back to the   four questions, Mr Chairman, at the end   How might we choose an appropriate level of current accommodation?  The first thing   we need to do is decide on a loss function, and it’s our job to provide guidance to staff on this   important issue, that is, us as principals, as policymakers around the Committee  In a memo I   circulated last week, I talked about how we might go about structuring this conversation  With   that loss function in hand, we can compute optimal time paths for asset holdings and short-term   interest rates under the staff’s modal forecast  Now, note that in the policy problems solved on   page 3 of the Tealbook, Book B—there are all these nice pictures about what the optimal policy   looks like—the staff fixes what’s going on with asset purchases  They don’t optimize over asset   purchases  Those are just treated as given, and they optimize over the path of the fed funds rate   What I want to do is start to think about optimizing where the paths include both tools    This might sound like a complicated problem, but we can immediately translate into a simpler   one  The Reifschneider et al memo provides the way to do that  It builds on earlier research by   Fed System economists to map that time path of Fed asset holdings into a time path of downward   adjustments to the fed funds rate   Choosing a path of asset holdings and a path of short-term interest rates is similar to   choosing a path of LSAP-adjusted path of interest rates, and this is a very important point  If   there were no constraints in the size of the balance sheet, then this LSAP-adjusted path of   interest rates could become arbitrarily negative  If we’re willing to have as big a balance sheet as   we want, then we can make those LSAP-adjusted interest rates as low as we want  The policy   November 1–2, 2011 59 of 282              problem then becomes equivalent to the unconstrained optimal problem on page 3 of Tealbook,   Book B  It’s as good as we can do  There is no tension in this problem in terms of the   commitment problems that the staff was pointing to That kind of reverse time-consistency   problem does not emerge there  There’s no commitment versus discretion issue if we’re solving   that unconstrained problem   If we were to go in that direction, though, the balance sheet moves are fairly exaggerated    If you look at the unconstrained optimal policy path on page 3, Tealbook, Book B, it suggests the   appropriate path of LSAP-adjusted interest rates involves cutting them in the near term by   300 basis points  The FOMC could achieve this cut by announcing its intention to buy   something like $3 trillion of longer-term assets  Both of these numbers are quite rough  They’d   have to be filled in with more work  This solution hinges on using a loss function that puts equal   weight on deviations; loss functions that I’ve suggested in my memo would presumably imply a   smaller cut in the LSAP-adjusted rate   This is all about if you’re willing to do $3 trillion of purchases  If you’re not willing to   do that, that means there are costs or constraints associated with balance sheet policies that aren’t   incorporated into the Reifschneider et al memo and not really formally incorporated into the   staff’s technical analysis of our policies  For example, the Committee might decide it never   wants to have a balance sheet larger than $3 trillion  This constraint will translate into a negative   lower bound in the LSAP-adjusted interest rate, and then you get to solve a constrained optimal   policy problem on LSAP-adjusted interest rates with this lower bound   How would this solution work?  You can guess the solution  It’s going to look like the   balance sheet being expanded up to its maximal level and then the short-term interest rate being   kept equal to zero for some period of time  I would see the Committee implementing this   November 1–2, 2011 60 of 282              appropriate level of current accommodation by buying more assets and then announcing an   anticipated duration for the zero interest rate policy   What I’m trying to sketch here is that we can follow a systematic way to identify an   appropriate current level of accommodation without a major change in our policy framework    Without constraints on the balance sheet, then we can make appropriate adjustments to the   current level of accommodation through asset purchases alone  With constraints on the size of   the balance sheet, that’s what leads us into the need for making these long-term stays at the zero   lower bound  That’s all about choosing the current level of accommodation   There’s a separate but certainly linked question of how that accommodation should   change over time in response to changes in the state of the economy  I think it’s a good thing for   us to have a determination of how we want that accommodation to change over time  Given that   the zero lower bound is binding, it may well involve making a commitment  One of the reasons   you’re trying to build a rule—as people talk about the Taylor rule—is to try to buy into   commitment  One of the nice things about the rules that the staff sketches is that it gives us a   way to try to buy into the necessary commitment to have those rules be implemented down the   road   A good rule should satisfy four related criteria  One is consistency—its prescribed   evolution of accommodation under the staff’s modal forecast  It should provide a good   approximation to the solution to the optimal control problems that I’ve discussed above  You   want your rule to match up with what you want to be doing, given what you expect to happen  I   think that’s a relatively easy extension to what the staff has done     What’s a little harder, and this gets to some of the stuff that President Lacker was talking   about, is that we need to have some notion of expected loss  There’s a good start on this in the   November 1–2, 2011 61 of 282              Erceg et al memo on scenario analysis, but really we need a full Monte Carlo simulation under   the assumption the Committee is using that rule  We want this notion of the distribution of   outcomes—how likely it is we’re going to go above 2 percent, for how long, those kinds of   questions—and the expected loss under whatever our loss function is   Third, we really need to think about the robustness of a given rule  What’s the worst-case   macroeconomic scenario for a given rule?  How bad are things under that worst-case scenario?    And then think about comparing rules under that basis  Then, credibility matters  A proposed   rule may well imply that some macroeconomic outcomes will lead to high rates of inflation   coexisting with low rates of unemployment for several years at a time  Is such a rule truly   credible or will future Committees simply abandon the rule at that point?  Rules are rhetorical   devices to try to convince future Committees to do things that are against their own interest, and   so we want to see how much they have to buy into to do that   The memo that we have is a great starting point for these kinds of assessments of   consistency, expected loss, robustness, and credibility, but there’s a lot more to be done  That’s   why I think it’s very important to separate these two issues, Mr Chairman, of what we want to   do today in terms of providing an appropriate level of accommodation, and what kind of rule we   want to adopt for the evolution of that accommodation   Let me try to answer the four questions  Flexible inflation targeting, it’s a big tent  It’s   pretty hard to see how anyone could say no to it, but I will  [Laughter]  I’m certainly on board   with that description of our operating framework, but the word “flexible” is going to require   some definition and some clarity  President Lockhart offered some suggestions, but President   Lockhart’s words (I didn’t catch everything he said, unfortunately) for example, talking about   November 1–2, 2011 62 of 282              2 percent averaging over five years—we explicitly don’t mean that  We explicitly want the   ability not to have that   We have to be very clear  It probably would be useful to be clear among ourselves, first   of all, about what we mean  What I’ve been talking about over the past couple of meetings is the   need for us to be clear about how much inflation we’re willing to tolerate and over what time   horizon  Some of the staff simulations suggest we’re willing to tolerate up to 3 percent for   several years at a time  We have to be clear among ourselves and with the public that that’s what   our policies include   President Evans made a good point about risk management and about his proposed   triggers  I thought the implied dialogue between President Evans and President Rosengren is   really interesting about whether these triggers should be evolving over time or fixed in time   Those are the kinds of things that it would be useful to get sorted out  We should be thinking   about accommodation right now as an anticipation of time we are spending at the zero lower   bound, plus the size of the balance sheet  Those are our two tools to adjust   Then there’s an issue of a rule about how those things would evolve over time in   response to changes in conditions, and there’s more work to be done on that  There’s a fourth   question, but I think I already answered it by answering the first question   Thank you, Mr Chairman, and I appreciate people’s patience in listening to me for so   long, but like several others have mentioned, this is great stuff, and I’m very excited to be able to   talk about it     Just a quick gloss on what Governor Tarullo said about the   SEP paths of the target funds rates  There was a lot of heterogeneity  I was struck by that   I will say for myself, the question was about what I viewed as the optimal path of the fed   funds rate  The question was not about asking me to forecast what the fed funds rate was going   to be—what the likely outcomes of these Committee deliberations would be  My guess is that   President Evans and I might come much closer on that calculation than we would if we were   asked to be in charge of setting the fed funds rate     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I have a quick question, Brian  In   terms of table 18, what would Goldman Sachs look like if we looked at their liability structure?     So, long-term unsecured debt would look roughly the same,   you think, for Goldman Sachs in terms of percentage?     Thank you     Thanks     Yes  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I have a brief question   related to our discussion of nominal income targeting  Looking not just at the change in real   GDP in the year of liftoff—it might be interesting to look at the cumulative output gap of real   GDP or nominal GDP at the time of liftoff  So maybe we’re at minus 7 percent now—just   thinking about putting in the Tealbook estimates of potential GDP and then thinking about how   the forecasts of real GDP have evolved relative to that  I don’t know if I’m making sense     A lot of functions have a third derivative  [Laughter]     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Yes, I wanted to build on   something I had said earlier after Governor Tarullo’s earlier remarks  Frankly, when I speak   about the economy, I’m not sure people are all that interested in what I would do with the fed   November 1–2, 2011 134 of 282              funds rate if I were in charge—they want to know what I expect this Committee to do  And   when we use the SEP, I’m not sure we want to be thinking about it as conveying the full richness   of all of our views about the economy, as opposed to trying to use it to convey what we think is   going to be happening to policy tools   I think it’s right to condition our long-run forecasts on optimal monetary policy  That   gives the people the right idea of what the long-run target is  Conditioning our forecast for the   fed funds rate and for inflation and unemployment on that—I don’t think that’s going to convey   the right kind of information to markets  Markets want to know where we think those variables   are going to go and how we think policy is going to respond to that and what we think policy will   be, as opposed to under what we think optimal policy should be     I would be interested to see a different trial run where we   make a forecast predicated on what we think the Committee will do, what the evolution of   inflation, unemployment, and real GDP will be, on the one hand, and what the evolution of the   fed funds rate will be, on the other hand  And we’ll see—maybe I’m wrong  Maybe there won’t   be more convergence on that, but my suspicion is that there would be a lot more convergence     It’s very reasonable for us internally to have that information    I will say for myself, I don’t think it’s as important for the public  I’m all in favor of   transparency, but I have many vehicles to inform the public of my personal preferences over   these variables  I’m not sure that seeing them in this bar chart form is all that valuable  It’s   valuable for us to know—panel 4B is really useful for us to know in our own internal dialogue    But it doesn’t necessarily mean that’s going to be what we should share with the public     And that’s very valuable, but when we go out and talk about   what we want to share with the public, what’s going to be useful in terms of shaping policy, I   think it’s more about trying to tell the people what we think the Committee is going to be doing,   as opposed to what we would do if we were in charge of the Committee      Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Ninth District economy   continues to perform better than the nation as a whole  The overall unemployment rate in the   Ninth District is under 7 percent  Per capita income has risen slightly faster for the past two   years than in the nation as a whole  That said, the rate of progress within the District has still   been painfully slow  The unemployment rate in Wisconsin, Minnesota, and South Dakota in   November 1–2, 2011 141 of 282              September 2011 is essentially no different from a year earlier, although, as I mentioned,   markedly better than in the nation as a whole  The unemployment rate in Montana has actually   risen over the past year  Nor do I see any impulses for big changes in the near term  Ninth   District business respondents remain cautious, although I will not be able to achieve the level of   nuance that President Lockhart was able to obtain; their level of cautiousness is perhaps a shade   lower than in the fall of 2010, and it’s certainly a couple of shades lower than in the fall of 2009    So the economy is improving, but the pace of recovery is distressingly slow   My outlook for the real economy is consistent with what’s happening in the Ninth   District and is, consequently, not all that different from the Tealbook  The good news is that the   near-term downside risk—this sentence is out of date  I was about to say that the near-term   downside risk from Europe has receded some in the intermeeting period  I wrote this on   Saturday  [Laughter]  I apologize  But my outlook, nevertheless, remains subdued  I expect that   real GDP will grow at 26 percent in 2012 and only slightly faster in 2013  This is too slow to   make rapid inroads into unemployment, and I’m anticipating that unemployment will be around   8½ percent at the end of 2012 and around 81 percent by the end of 2013   Where I differ from the Tealbook is in my forecast for inflation  Core inflation has   stabilized in the past couple of months  Nonetheless, I am expecting that core inflation will   remain at or above 2 percent over the next two or three years  Obviously, the difference in my   forecast for inflation is predicated on a different view of slack  There are, I think, reasons to   believe that slack is large  As captured in the Tealbook, detrended real GDP in the third quarter   of 2011 is over 10 percent lower than in the fourth quarter of 2007  The employment–population   ratio remains well below its December 2007 level  But there are also reasons to think that slack   is smaller than these observations might suggest  Detrended real GDP and the employment–  November 1–2, 2011 142 of 282              population ratio have been disturbingly steady over the past two years despite variations in   monetary policy and fiscal policy  And a theoretical statistician looking at the recent data on   detrended real GDP or on the employment–population ratio would not be led to the obvious   conclusion that further stimulus would lead these time series to turn north   As I mentioned at our last meeting, I think the comparisons with June 2004 are   informative  The capacity utilization rate is about the same as in June 2004  The short-term   unemployment rate, the fraction of the labor force that has been unemployed for less than   15 weeks, is only slightly higher than in June 2004  Along the same lines, I believe that it is   instructive to compare the matching efficiency of the labor market in mid-2004 with what it is   today  If you look at the vacancy–unemployment ratio in August 2011, it is about half of what it   was in mid-2004 during the midst of a jobless recovery  Typical estimates of the elasticity of the   matching function are usually around a half  So this fall of the vacancy–unemployment ratio of   50 percent from mid-2004 to mid-2011 should have resulted in a fall of the job-finding rate of   about 30 percent  And in fact, the steady-state job-finding rate is more than 50 percent lower   than in mid-2004  The matching function seems to have shifted in this sense, so that it is now   considerably harder for good matches to form than in June 2004  If this shift had not taken   place, the unemployment rate would be just 61 percent—only slightly higher than it was in June   2004   None of these observations can be viewed as being more than suggestive  My point is   certainly not that I know for sure that slack is as low as in June 2004  But we need to keep in   mind that the events of the past four years may well have had significant adverse effects on the   supply side  This hypothesis is consistent with the uptick in core inflation that we have observed   over the past year  And those effects will worsen the tradeoff between unemployment and   November 1–2, 2011 143 of 282              inflation that we face in formulating policy, in the sense that any given level of unemployment   will lead to higher inflation  Thank you, Mr Chairman  That’s all I have to say     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I wasn’t ready, but here we go  I   am willing to support alternative B  I proposed the language of “for the next six to seven   November 1–2, 2011 201 of 282              quarters” in alternative B  So let me explain why I did that  In the frameworks go-round, I   described a rule, which I could alternatively describe as a reaction function, as a mapping from   changes in economic conditions to the changes in the level of accommodation  And when I did   that, I didn’t mention calendar time  That’s because reaction functions really should be   intrinsically dateless  They should work exactly the same in 2011 as in 2012  This formulation   of a dateless rule-based approach to policy argues in favor of our communicating our level of   accommodation in a way that is just as dateless  And I believe that we should make it easy for   the public to understand how the level of accommodation is evolving over time, and that would   mean we should describe our policy stance in a dateless fashion so that it is readily comparable   from one meeting to the next or, indeed, from one year to the next   Now, I’ll talk about the impact on the public, and then I’ll talk about the impact on our   own thinking  This issue is not an academic one to the public  I read several news stories that   predicted the Fed would leave its policy statement unchanged and concluded from that that the   Fed is also leaving its policy stance unchanged  This inference is a logical one, but it is actually   incorrect given the current form of the statement, which would involve actually, the Fed reducing   the level of accommodation in place by leaving the date “mid-2013” in place with the passage of   six to seven weeks   I’ll come back to this point about using the duration as opposed to a date as our lever of   changing accommodation now, because I want to talk about something I feel is very important    We talk a lot about policy uncertainty, and I believe that we are right now, unfortunately, a   source of that policy uncertainty  What I mean by that is that I think that we really have to be   more systematic in our thinking about how to build a reaction function  This is not just about   what triggers to pick or anything like that, which is really more about what level of   November 1–2, 2011 202 of 282              accommodation we want in place today—an important question and one that we should be   thinking about all the time—but we also want to be thinking about how that level of   accommodation is going to be changing over time in response to changes in conditions  For   example, suppose next year, a year from now, unemployment is at 9 percent and inflation is   running around 16 percent  What are we going to do in those circumstances?  I’m including   only inflation and unemployment, but basically my idea is, the outlook is remaining the same as   now  We’re in a sort of stasis, which is not my modal forecast by any means, but it’s certainly, I   think, a relatively likely outcome  Taking a dateless reaction function approach to thinking about   policy would argue for doing the same, having the same level of accommodation  It wouldn’t   mean having this year, “mid-2013,” in there, of course, but it would mean arguing for the same   level of accommodation in terms of how long we’re going to be to liftoff   Some of my concerns about Committee decisionmaking over the past two meetings have   been that I don’t think this discipline of dateless decisionmaking has carried through, and it’s not   a hawkish or a dovish comment  It’s basically, if you want to add accommodation a year from   now when the conditions are the same as today, you should be asking yourself, why didn’t you   put that accommodation in place now when actually there is a year that will go by in which you   could be helping people with it?  So it’s really about consistency, and failure to be consistent   over time adds to policy uncertainty in the current environment  It’s very important for us to be   more structured and more deliberate in our thinking about how we’re going to react to changes in   conditions  Now, I’m merely channeling the words that President Bullard has uttered on many   occasions  So I’m probably scooping some of the things he’s—yes  But even though that’s true,   that doesn’t mean that what I’m saying isn’t right  [Laughter]   November 1–2, 2011 203 of 282              Having said all of that, it’s not going to be true at all times that you would never, ever   deviate from your reaction function  It’s not as though you want to commit to something and   leave it there and go home for the rest of all time  Governor Raskin has offered some real   reasons that right now we might be thinking that maybe we should change our reaction function    Why is that?  Well, maybe monetary policy is not as effective as it once was  Maybe we’re more   worried about unemployment because we might be more on the verge of triggering more social   unrest than we thought a year ago  So there might be reasons to change, but we should have in   place the structure from which to change before we change  We should have in place a   structured, disciplined approach to thinking about reacting to change in the economy  We might   come to that point and say, “Look  The way we’d been thinking about monetary policy a year   ago wasn’t right  It’s just not as effective as we thought it was”  Or we might get to that point a   year from now when unemployment is still at 9, and we could have much more Depression-like   civil unrest  We might have a different way of weighting inflation and unemployment at that   point  These will be good reasons to be revisiting the situation  But I think it’s important for us   to have something to deviate from and so to have a reaction function in place   Those are words for the future  Right now, as I said, Mr Chairman, I’m happy to   support—willing to support, I should say—alternative B     Mr Chairman?  Sorry     I want to clarify something in my own mind  The word   “significant” was in the September FOMC statement, right?     So taking it out is a change from the September FOMC   statement     Okay  Just to be clear   November 1–2, 2011 217 of 282                Thanks     “Very significant”       PARTICIPANT  “Humongous”  [Laughter]     Could I just say one thing to that, Bill?  For this meeting, I   understand the arguments for staying the same as we were, and I appreciate that  But even if   you’re thinking about alternative A1 down the road, in December or January, we will have to   communicate information about timing in some way  And I think saying something about the   duration, as opposed to a date, would be a better way, even in that context  So I don’t think of   them as being inconsistent  That’s all I would say   "
9178,2011-12-13,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I want to spend my time talking   about the appropriate metric for the maximum employment mandate  The draft consensus   statement that we’ll be discussing later seems imprecise on this point, aiming at employment in   some places and unemployment in others, and I think our own internal dialogue shares that   imprecision  In my remarks, I will suggest that the unemployment rate as opposed to the   employment-to-population ratio is the better of the two metrics   Let me give you some background about why this discussion matters  The   unemployment rate peaked in October of 2009 at over 10 percent  It has fallen back to   December 13, 2011 58 of 198              86 percent, and my forecast is that the unemployment rate will continue to fall to around 83   percent by the end of 2012 and to 78 percent by the end of 2013  But the recovery in the   employment-to-population ratio has been, and I believe it will continue to be, considerably less   dynamic  The employment-to-population ratio is right now 58½ percent, close to its July 2011   nadir of 581 percent and well below its December 2007 level of 627 percent  My forecast for   the employment-to-population ratio is that it will remain around its current value through 2013    This discrepancy poses an important question for us in terms of determining the appropriate level   of monetary policy accommodation  Does the employment-to-population ratio, EPOP, or the   unemployment rate provide the more useful metric for tracking deviations in what we mean by   maximum employment?  To help shed some light on this question, I’m going to turn to some   research that is specific to the Ninth District   The Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development, DEED,   conducts an unusual and valuable semiannual survey of firms  As an aside, if you want to look   up DEED later in Google, you don’t type in “Department of Employment and Economic   Development”  What you type in is “positively minnesota,” their website  The Department of   Employment and Economic Development in Minnesota is a very cheery group  The survey that   they conduct is an unusual and invaluable semiannual survey of firms, and it asks a range of   questions about the vacancies being posted by those firms  We acquired the underlying data   from DEED earlier this year, and one of our economists, Sam Schulhofer-Wohl has spent a lot of   this past year analyzing them     Basically, they’re surveying firms about the kind of vacancies they are posting  One   main finding is that once one controls for occupation and establishment effects, wage offers have   grown at around 2 percent per year since 2007, as well as over the preceding five years  The   December 13, 2011 59 of 198              recession seemed to have little impact on the wage offer being made  By contrast, the number   and composition of vacancies did change greatly over the past four years  In terms of numbers,   vacancies fell in half from the fourth quarter of 2007 to the fourth quarter of 2009, and as of the   fourth quarter of 2011, the number of vacancies still remained somewhat below its pre-recession   levels  The unemployment rate in Minnesota behaved somewhat similarly  It rose from 5   percent in 2007 to a peak of 8½ percent in mid-2009, and it has fallen back to 64 percent as of   October of 2011  The composition of vacancies also responded to cyclical forces  During the   recession, the composition of vacancies shifted toward lower-wage positions  However, even by   late 2010, the composition of vacancies had returned to something similar to the 2007 mix   between high- and low-wage positions   All I’ve been talking about is since 2007  If you go back all the way to 2001, the data   also offer some perspective on the impact of structural forces in the Minnesota labor market    From 2001 through 2007, the number of vacancies remained roughly constant, but the   composition of vacancies steadily shifted toward higher-wage positions  In the face of these   changes in the composition of labor demand, the Minnesota unemployment rate remained low  It   was between 4 and 5 percent in 2007 and 2006  But Minnesota experienced a steady decline in   EPOP, in its employment-to-population ratio, from 2000 through 2009     I’ve thrown a lot of numbers at you  Let me summarize what I think we’ve learned from   these Minnesota data  The recession generated a transitory decline in labor demand, which had   little effect on wages  Instead the decline in labor demand generated an increase in the   Minnesota unemployment rate that is only gradually unwinding  But the recession also took   place against the backdrop of longer-term structural changes in the Minnesota labor market    Since 2001, firms have systematically been looking for more highly skilled workers  These   December 13, 2011 60 of 198              structural changes did not show up in the unemployment rate, but were associated with a steady   decline in the employment-to-population ratio   What are the takeaways for monetary policy?  Obviously this is one data set from one   state, but from that one data set from that one state, I would say you can take away the following   lessons  The unemployment rate is highly responsive to cyclical labor market conditions, while   it seems much less responsive to structural labor market changes  In contrast, the employment-  to-population ratio seems to respond not only to cyclical conditions, but also to longer-term   trends in the composition of labor demand that are clearly outside the scope of monetary policy    My conclusion is that monetary policy should respond to the unemployment rate and the outlook   for the unemployment rate, and not to the employment-to-population ratio and its outlook    Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I had a couple of questions  One   is for Bill and one is for Brian Sack  The question for Bill is, I didn’t see in Tealbook, Book B,   and maybe I missed it, an explanation for why the staff was recommending a change in the   language of paragraph 5 of Alternative B relative to what was in the previous statement of the   FOMC     My second question is for Brian  If the Committee were to   adopt Alternative A3′—the flow of purchases—how long could we run 3′ before we ran out of   capacity?     Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  At our last meeting, President   Williams suggested that he found it useful to consider the recommendations of simple policy   rules when thinking about the appropriate formulation of policy, and in the past, the Chairman,   Governor Yellen, and I have expressed similar views  Along those lines, if you look at   Tealbook, Book B, it looks at the implications of a variety of simple policy rules for the path of   accommodation  This is a line of rule-based analysis, and I continue to appreciate these kinds of   analyses   But I thought that the treatment of the LSAPs in the analysis in the Tealbook was a little   incomplete  In this regard, I would say two things  First, I think the current level of   December 13, 2011 98 of 198              accommodation should include the best estimates of the accommodation that the FOMC is   providing from its large-scale asset holdings  Second, the prescribed evolution of   accommodation should include the use of asset purchases, especially since asset purchases are   explicitly being considered in Alternative A   I believe that the best current Board staff estimate of the impact of our current asset   holdings is that they are providing accommodation equivalent to a reduction of 2½ percentage   points in the fed funds rate  With that estimate in mind, when I look at the graphs on page 7 of   Tealbook, Book B, it seems that if I use these simple rules, policy is currently overly   accommodative and, hence, Alternatives A and B would both be inconsistent with the   recommendations of these rules  This is all based on the Tealbook’s estimate of potential  Like   President Bullard, I would be inclined to use a slightly lower estimate of potential  Actually,   President Bullard used a much lower estimate of potential   With that said, I do see two reasons for caution  First, the recommendations of these   rules seem highly inconsistent with the optimal control simulations on page 3 of Tealbook, Book   B  The unconstrained optimal policy simulation implies that the Committee should be buying   something like $3 trillion of long-term assets over the coming year  Second, several members of   the Committee have suggested the impact of monetary policy is not being destroyed but being   blunted by current household credit conditions  This impairment of monetary policy, as long as   it’s not being reduced to zero, would lead one to use more accommodation   At this stage, these reasons for caution strike me as somewhat imprecise, and I would   find it useful at future meetings to have staff work that fleshed them out in some way  Is there a   way to put some kind of fudge factor in the policy rules that make them accord better with the   unconstrained optimal control solution?  In particular, we often talk about the Taylor 1999 rule   December 13, 2011 99 of 198              as being a very accommodative rule  Is there a way to make it line up better with the optimal   control solution so that we can use it for guidance in thinking about how policy should evolve,   but also have the level match up at least a little bit closer to what we have in the unconstrained   optimal control solution?  Second, what is the staff’s best estimate of the current real impact of   monetary accommodation on the economy?  How is our level of monetary accommodation   translating through to the real economy?  These are tough questions, but I think it would be   helpful for us to move them from the realm of the qualitative into the realm of the quantitative as   best we can   Despite this current imprecision of these counterbalancing considerations, I am willing to   go along with Alternative B at this meeting  However, I would strongly prefer that we use the   version of paragraph 5 that was in the last statement for a couple of related reasons  One is   related to what President Lockhart said in his statement  We should avoid using any language   beyond the updating of economic conditions  We don’t want to be indicating anything that   would disrupt markets in any fashion  That’s the practical consideration   More philosophically, the new version of paragraph 5 implies that we see financial   market conditions as being an important factor in the making of monetary policy over and above   the information that those conditions provide about the economic outlook, and I think this is   problematic  Our mandate is not to make sure financial markets function well  Our mandate is   to promote price stability and maximum employment, and obviously financial market   developments matter, but only insofar as they affect the outlook for prices and employment  For   both of those reasons—not rocking the boat and for this more philosophical consideration—I   would favor Alternative B but with the old paragraph 5  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Let me try to clarify, as best I can,   what I was trying to get at with my first point  I certainly agreed with the way you summarized   the second issue  If you look at the LSAP-adjusted policy rule, as David Reifschneider did in the   memo from the previous meeting, the implication would be that our level of accommodation is   pretty close to being appropriate  Whereas, if you look at the unconstrained optimal control   exercise, we are far too tight right now—we should be buying an additional $3 trillion of assets   over the next year  I would like to have a better understanding of the gap between those two    That was my question     Yes, Mr Chairman  You made reference to the first item   being, in your view, a quasi-constitutional item  Was that to distinguish it from the second item?     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I want to join others in thanking   the subcommittee for their hard and thoughtful work on both these important topics  I was going   to say that I strongly support the statement as written, but with President Williams’s guidance I   will say I “firmly” support the statement as written  [Laughter]  I also think that we should be   treating the document as a living and breathing document, with the notion of its being a quasi-  constitutional framework that would require a broad consensus to amend or change   Contrary to some of the thoughts that President George offered, I am very happy with the   exclusion of financial stability objectives  The Congress has laid out our three mandates; they   are hard enough to define as it is, without adding in new ones for ourselves  If the Congress   wants to mandate that we are in charge of financial stability—and hopefully they will give us   some guidance about what they mean by that—[laughter] don’t count on it, but maybe they   will—then we could add it as an objective  I’m happy with this draft in many respects, but in   particular, I am happy with the exclusion of financial stability as an objective   With that said, we should continue to work to establish consensus, wherever possible,   about the elements of our policymaking framework, and try to communicate where we can about   December 13, 2011 158 of 198              that consensus to the public  It would be great if we could address a couple of issues in similar   statements in the next six months or so  Here I am thinking more of a statement similar to the   one we issued in June about our exit strategy  One issue that could help clarify things is to   decide what exactly our metric for performance in terms of the maximum employment mandate   is going to be  This is something I talked about earlier this morning  Is it going to be   employment or is it going to be unemployment?  The current statement is imprecise on this   point, probably by design  But we should talk about this, and I indicated this morning that it   would be better for us to focus on the unemployment rate when we think about building the loss   function that President Evans has referred to   Along those same lines, our current statement refers to balancing deviations for   maximum employment and price stability  Is there a way for us to provide more explicit   information about how the Committee does that balancing act?  In technical terms, what can we   say about the properties of the loss function that underlies the Committee’s decision?  At our last   meeting President Evans, President Rosengren, and I had an implicit conversation about this, and   it sounded like we disagreed, but actually, we agreed  What we agreed on was that we would be   willing to use a symmetric weakly concave loss function over unemployment and inflation   deviations   That might be overly technical for inclusion in a public release  But it has a very useful   implication in plain English  All three of us would agree with the following statement, “If   unemployment is more elevated relative to its mandate-consistent level than is inflation, then the   Committee would be willing to follow policies that lead inflation to rise by X percent, X small,   as long as they also lead unemployment to fall by more than X percent”  Basically, as long as   you are using a concave objective—obviously, this is an overly technical term—but what it   December 13, 2011 159 of 198              translates into is if you’re further away from your unemployment objective, you are willing to let   inflation rise by a certain amount as long as unemployment falls by at least that much  If we can   forge consensus around these kinds of precise statements, it would greatly help to clarify the   Committee’s policy goals and objectives  I could go on, but I want to move to talking about the   SEP projections  I want to encourage us to continue to build consensus where we can about our   framework, being as precise as we can be, while respecting the heterogeneity of views that we   have around the table  I would point to these two issues that we could think about   In terms of the SEP projections, I am very much a pro-transparency person  Broadly   speaking, I favor including policy projections in the SEP  But I’m not in favor of transparency   just for the sake of transparency  I’m in favor of transparency for the sake of clarity, and   President Fisher and others have made some great comments about how this may not really   enhance clarity as much as we would like   I have a distinct concern about how to build the policy projections into the SEP  Under   the proposal, the public is going to see a cross-sectional distribution of 17 fed funds rates at three   future dates  These distributions are designed to provide forward guidance to the public about   the likely path of monetary policy  That’s the point of them  This means that all 51 of these   anonymous numbers are now actually part of the Committee’s policy and policy statement  The   conclusion is inevitable  Individual meeting participants, acting wholly on their own, can   influence monetary policy in the United States  This would be especially true of meeting   participants who were not as pure as President Plosser is urging us to be, but who chose,   potentially for strategic reasons, to locate their answers near the perceived central tendency of   the distribution of policy paths   December 13, 2011 160 of 198              What is the response to this?  Let me try to deal with this logically  Let’s start with two   premises  Any Committee release of information about the future path of policy is really a   Committee statement about policy  In fact, it is designed to be a Committee statement about   policy—that’s what forward guidance is about  Second, I can’t think about how any Committee   statement about policy can proceed without being deliberated upon and voted on by the Federal   Open Market Committee   I am sure Governor Yellen is going to accuse me of letting the best be the enemy of the   good here, but what we have to be thinking about is a collective forecast of policy rates  By   collective, I mean the release of this collective forecast needs to be voted on and approved by the   voting members of the FOMC as part of its monetary policy statement  I would think about   doing this not at every meeting, but four times a year when we are currently releasing a   collective forecast  The central tendency of the Norges Bank’s release is what I have in mind   There is this perspective that this is impossible, given the heterogeneity of viewpoints   about the table  We deal with this heterogeneity every time, and the way we deal with it is the   staff tries to condense it down into three choices—A, B, and C  What we can imagine is the staff   has some path of policy rates associated with option A, some path of policy rates associated with   option B, and a path of policy rates associated with option C, and we would vote on those  I   don’t think it is an impossible task for us to be dealing with this  It is just another part of the   policy process  The policy choice right now is infinite dimensional, and we still somehow   manage to condense it down to three choices  This would be another element of doing that   I realize that the subcommittee on communications’ staff has put a lot of time into this   matter, but we should take our time with this  Forward guidance has been, and will continue to   be, a very useful tool for us, but we want to be very careful about getting the right formulation in   December 13, 2011 161 of 198              practice  This echoes what President Pianalto was saying  The right way to do this would be a   collective way instead of trying to summarize information about 17 separate visions of policy    Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
9203,2013-10-16,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  It’s not so much about the actions   themselves, but about the communication issue that others have already touched on  I’m a little   concerned about the prospect of simply letting our communications take a backseat to whatever   the Treasury happens to decide  The Treasury’s incentives might well be shaped by incentives   that are different from our own; our own incentives, of course, are to promote price stability and   promote maximum employment  I would encourage us to be using our own mandates as the   governing principles under which we think about how to communicate  What I can conclude   from that is that, once we had a breach, we should start communicating pretty rapidly about what   our intentions are, in terms of how we would be treating, say, defaulted-upon Treasury securities,   the discount window  I understand why we sort of took a backseat to the Treasury leading up to   a breach, but I think once a breach takes place we really should start to drive our own bus, so to   speak, in terms of communication so as to best achieve our own objectives     Speaking for myself, I would have been a little more   aggressive with communication even leading up to the date of October 17, because I think that   would be better designed to safeguard the economy against the kinds of financial dislocations   that we’re concerned about having downward pressures on prices and downward pressures on   employment in the near term     Thank you, Mr Chairman  President Fisher pretty eloquently   already said a lot of what I wanted to say  The one thing I would add to what he said is that   Governor Powell pointed to the fact that we do serve as the Treasury’s fiscal agent, and I think   we should draw a pretty bright line between those activities in which we’re serving as the   Treasury’s fiscal agent—and we should not be communicating ahead of the gun without the   Treasury’s say-so about how we would respond along those operational issues, the issues that   Susan talked through  I think 1 to 5, as far as I’m reading them, don’t come into that role at all    So I would be pretty comfortable with, if we reach unanimity about 1 to 5, our reporting that   unanimity in the minutes, and absolutely leaving the door open that the Federal Reserve is a very   inventive, imaginative organization  We have other ways to provide support if needed     Yes, I will just follow up briefly on what President Lacker   said, because I think he raises some very good points that I have certainly been troubled by  I   think it is important that when we are thinking through 1 through 5, one of the backdrops for that   —at least for me—is that we are thinking about this as being a relatively short-term event where   the Treasury will eventually make us whole  If we buy a defaulted-upon security, we expect that   within a relatively short period of time, the Treasury will actually act to make us whole on that    If we didn’t have that expectation, I think that 1 through 5 wouldn’t look as attractive to me  But   I think our interventions that are being described in 1 through 5 are expressing that confidence   that we will be made whole, and in that way moving market prices  That’s very similar to—as   you, Mr Chairman, referred to—how we operated in a crisis  We expressed a level of   confidence that maybe the private-sector agents, because they were operating on their own,   couldn’t have   October 16, 2013 32 of 50      Thank you, Mr Chairman  I am actually interested in what   other people have to say about 8 and 9, so I don’t necessarily want to speak about 8 and 9 at this   point  In terms of 6 and 7, I think that Vice Chairman Dudley raised a great point in terms of 7,   that maybe the fed funds rate isn’t really necessarily the right marker for the way we are   influencing interest rates  I think that should force us to be thinking about a very broad question   about how we are communicating our monetary policy and the state of monetary policy  Is it   enough to say we’re targeting the fed funds rate between 0 and 25 basis points?  It really   transcends what’s happening in the context of a financial crisis  I’m not sure of the scenarios in   which we would be moving so rapidly, with respect to 7, that we wouldn’t be able to call a   meeting as we did in the past four or five business days, to address this  What I’m working   toward is that I would like us to begin talking in a more holistic way about how we want to   communicate the stance of monetary policy  Is it really through targeting the fed funds rate, or   October 16, 2013 39 of 50    do we want to have a broader discussion of other interest rates?  And then I think it becomes   very natural to think of 7 as just fitting in with that broader context  In the absence of that, we’ll   have to deal with it on a more case-by-case basis  It’s hard for me to think about scenarios in   which things are so fast-moving that we wouldn’t be able to come together to think about 7   Six seems very different to me  It just feels like we’ve been struggling with the problem   of making monetary policy easy, at least that’s the way I think about it  We have this zero lower   bound on the fed funds rate, and on other interest rates  A lot of times it looks like we’d like to   lower that, and now we’re coming along and saying, “Boy, we’d like to actually make rates   higher”  So 6 seems weird to me, and I guess at this point, at least, I would have to have a much   better understanding of what we’re trying to accomplish     Finally, one quick point  When I think about these issues, I actually don’t think about   financial stability as some separate goal of monetary policy, or of this Committee  I think of us   as trying to achieve our goals of promoting price stability and promoting maximum employment    Financial stability certainly interacts with that in the sense that it introduces risks for our ability   to make progress on our goals  But certainly with an alternative like 6, where I think it sounds   more like you’re trying to actually address a market problem, then I would have to know a lot   more than I know right now about how raising rates in this way is actually helpful in terms of   promoting maximum employment and price stability   So to summarize, I can see myself being in favor of 7, but I think I would want to do it on   a case-by-case basis  I actually think Vice Chairman Dudley’s comments open up a much   broader question that we should really be thinking about as the Committee, outside of any debt   crisis  And, I would just need to know a lot more about 6 before we sign on in the abstract to it  "
