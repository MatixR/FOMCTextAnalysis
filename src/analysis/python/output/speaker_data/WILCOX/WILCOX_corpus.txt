  As Dave noted, the tax cut has been a key influence on our  thinking about the near-term projection  Almost all of the rebate checks should be  mailed out over a ten-week period beginning the week of July 23rd As shown in the  upper left panel of Chart 6, we are assuming that spending out of the rebates--the     6/26-27/01 56   gray portion of the bars--will provide an important lift to PCE during the next three  quarters, with the largest effect in the fourth quarter of this year  As shown by the  red portion, the permanent cuts likely will have only a barely perceptible influence  this year, but next year they should come into their own as a second and more  substantial round of rate reduction comes on line   The upper right panel shows the influence of the tax cuts on the growth of real  PCE Absent the tax stimulus, as shown by the red line, we would have PCE growth  slowing further in the third quarter to less than 1 percent at an annual rate, before  picking up somewhat through the rest of the forecast period  But if the tax-related  stimulus plays out as we expect, the quarter just ending will mark the trough in  terms of PCE growth, and spending should accelerate in the third and especially  fourth quarters of this year   Over the longer term, the personal saving rate helps to anchor our PCE  projection The middle left panel outlines a few recent and prospective influences  on the saving rate First, with some crack detective work, our Flow of Funds  Section discovered that BEA has been underestimating employer contributions to  private pension plans since 1995 By last year, the miss had ramped up to roughly  $50 billion BEA has indicated to us that the problem won’t be fully addressed until  2003, when they next publish a comprehensive revision of the NIPAs  Second,  BEA announced earlier this year that data from the Unemployment Insurance  system show about $75 billion more in wage and salary income in 2000 than is  currently reflected in the NIPAs  This one will get fixed next month, with the  publication of the regular annual revision As shown in the middle right panel, all  else equal--a very important caveat when thinking about possible revisions to the  saving rate--these two factors suggest that the actual saving rate is higher than the  measured saving rate, and by enough to put it back into positive territory  More  important, these adjustments remove a little bit of downside risk from the outlook   Over the projection period, the various provisions of the tax cut will cause the  saving rate to bounce around, as households smooth their spending in the face of  choppy income  And, we expect the reverse wealth effect to be putting some  upward pressure on the saving rate By the end of next year, once the tax cut effects  have largely played out, the saving rate--shown as the black line in the bottom  panel--should have settled at the somewhat higher level implied by our projected  ratio of wealth to income, which we have shown here as a three-year moving  average, on an inverted scale   Your next chart turns to the subject of whether there is a capital overhang  You  have received a staff report on this issue, which, I should say, benefited from the  help that several Reserve Banks provided in facilitating conversations with business  contacts The top panels summarize the key econometric results  For each of two  types of equipment--high-tech and other--we estimated a target level of the capital  stock, shown in each panel with a red line, which we assumed to be a function of  variables such as the level of output and the cost of capital  Then we compared the     6/26-27/01 57   target to the actual capital stocks, which we show with black lines  If the actual  capital stock exceeds the target, we say there is a capital overhang, and indicate it  with gray shading By this method, which obviously is imprecise and subject to a  slew of caveats, we estimate that firms are holding roughly 20 percent more high- tech equipment than they would prefer, the left panel, and about 10 percent more  other equipment than they would like, the right panel  One thing to say in favor of  these estimates is that they do seem to line up reasonably well with the views of our  business contacts   An interesting related issue is the role that network-type markets might play in  generating capital overhangs The middle left panel traces through why this might  be so As you know, markets that involve network effects tend to tip toward one  provider, because everyone wants to belong to the network that has the largest  number of users  Each competitor in such a market will therefore have a strong  incentive to invest aggressively in the early going, to improve its chances of  becoming the dominant player  If several firms each invest on a sufficient scale to  serve most of the potential market, a capital overhang is almost sure to result   This kind of dynamic may help explain recent developments in the market for  long-haul optical fiber As is shown in the middle right panel, capacity in this  industry has exploded in the last five years--by so much as to challenge our graphics  software, even with a ratio scale! [Laughter] Moreover, the volume of fiber in the  ground--the black line--only begins to tell the story; the devices attached to either  end of the fiber are also very important for determining the capacity of the network   As shown by the red line, we estimate that if cutting-edge devices were installed on  all the fiber in the ground today, the effective capacity of the network would be  multiplied by roughly six  This evidence, along with a raft of conversations that  we’ve had over the past few weeks, convinces us that there is indeed a glut in long- haul fiber that could take quite some time to absorb   The bottom panel summarizes the main conclusions of our study  First, we  believe there is a capital overhang today  Second, we believe that the overhang  disproportionately involves high-tech equipment  Given the faster depreciation of  high-tech equipment, this conclusion suggests that today’s overhang may have a  shorter half-life than would otherwise be the case  Third, for most firms, financial  factors seem not to be a major drag on capital expenditures  To be sure, some firms  are having more trouble raising money today than a few years ago, but in many  cases that seems mainly to reflect the absence of a viable business plan  Finally,  with regard to the implications of the overhang for monetary policy, we think there  are two main points to be made  First, we think the overhang is only a moderately  negative influence on the outlook Put simply, even if we could somehow take the  overhang away immediately, we would still have a weak projection for real activity   Second, we believe that the overhang is not likely to noticeably impair the  effectiveness of monetary policy  If monetary policy worked primarily by  influencing the demand for equipment, we might think otherwise  But monetary  policy works on a wide variety of spending, including housing, PCE, and net     6/26-27/01 58   exports, through a number of channels in financial markets  Moreover, we never  have been able to demonstrate a vigorous channel operating through cost-of-capital  effects on investment spending, especially in the short run  Therefore, despite the  capital overhang, we believe that monetary policy will be about as effective in the  current easing cycle as it has been in previous easing cycles   Your next chart turns to the broader topic of the outlook for investment  A  good deal of concern has focused on the volume of debt that was issued to finance  the investment boom of the late 1990s  But, as shown by the black line in the upper  left panel, interest expense remained only a moderate source of pressure on cash  flow through the first quarter of this year for the nonfinancial corporate sector as a  whole To be sure, as shown by the red line, the telecom service firms, which  collectively have seen a doubling of their interest burden in just five years, are a  notable exception Similarly, as shown in the upper right panel, the expected default  frequency has increased much more sharply for the telecom service firms than for  the nonfinancial corporate sector as a whole  We interpret these data as suggesting  that, for most firms, financial considerations will not sharply curtail capital  spending   That said, a sobering reassessment of prospects for the telecom sector may have  helped put the spark to the tinder last year, but once the fire was going a traditional  accelerator dynamic appears to have taken over, as is illustrated in the middle panel   As the growth of business output slowed in the second half of last year and into the  first half of this year, firms cut the growth of their real spending for non-high-tech  equipment and software sharply  And while we believe that some of the  extraordinary weakness in this sector will abate later this year, a revival in E&S  spending may not be on solid footing until sometime next year when it becomes  more evident to firms that business output is reaccelerating   Turning to nonresidential investment, some crosscurrents are influencing the  outlook Activity in drilling and mining has been boosted by the high prices of oil  and natural gas, and spending by utilities has been supported by the need for new  electricity generating capacity But as shown in the lower left panel, these two  sectors account for only about a fifth of overall nonresidential investment   Moreover, as shown at the lower right, prospects for the sector overall are much  dimmer than in the past year or two, reflecting among other factors a widespread  notching up in the vacancy rate for office and industrial space   Your next chart turns to the outlook for inflation  As you know, the growth of  structural productivity--shown in the upper left panel--is one of the key building  blocks in our thinking about the prospects for inflation You may be relieved to  learn that I plan no further dissertation on that topic today, other than to note that  fluctuations in structural productivity growth shape our estimate of the “short-run”  or “effective” NAIRU, shown in the upper right panel  Indeed, given our  anticipated path for structural productivity, we expect the effective NAIRU to rise to  about 5-1/4 percent by the middle of next year  This implies that the projected rise     6/26-27/01 59   in the unemployment rate puts a bit less downward pressure on inflation than one  might otherwise have thought   In addition to lower resource utilization, a number of other factors influence the  contour of the price forecast over the next year and a half  One factor helping to  reduce core inflation is a moderation in energy prices, which--as shown in the  middle left panel--now seems to be well in train  If it continues as we expect,  energy prices should take about 02 percentage point off the change in core inflation  from this year to next  In addition, as shown in the middle right panel, near-term  inflation expectations seem to have held about steady over the last six months,  despite the upward pressure on headline inflation  Putting these pieces together, all  three measures of core inflation shown in the bottom panel are more or less flat from  their current levels   Your next chart examines the situation in the labor market  The top panel  relates the unemployment gap to the GDP gap  By either measure, the pressure on  productive resources will be diminishing fairly rapidly over the next few quarters   The middle left panel shows that the more rapid top-line price inflation of the last  two years--the gray bars--is likely to contribute to a more rapid rate of growth of  compensation this year--the red line  And, as shown in the middle right panel, we  believe something similar will occur with respect to productivity growth   Compensation demands appear to reflect productivity developments only with a  very long lag As a result, the rapid growth of productivity during the last few years  is likely to still be feeding through into compensation growth at least for the  remainder of the forecast period  All told, as shown in the bottom panel, we expect  compensation growth as measured by the employment cost index to be about the  same this year as last, as the effect of easing resource utilization is about offset by  the larger contribution from lagged inflation  Next year, however, we expect the  ECI to decelerate as the downturn in energy prices damps the contribution from  lagged inflation by 04 percentage point   Karen Johnson will now continue our presentation     If I’m recalling correctly, I think that was from a conversation we had   with one of our business contacts I believe it was in the context of one of the CEOs remarking   that previously he or she had thought that demand would double every three months and now   catastrophe had befallen them and it only doubles once a year     Maybe somebody can help me by finding the reference     6/26-27/01 65     I won’t make any comments on our standard errors!     I think it's hard to know  It certainly is the case that the telecom   sector has been punished incredibly Stock prices of the telecom service firms and the equipment   makers have been beaten down by just astonishing proportions  Whether they've taken on board   the full extent of the outlook as we see it, I can't say, though by and large the raw materials of the   analysis we've done are in the public sector  In this particular regard I don't think we have any   information that is not available to a careful market analyst  That doesn't insure that it’s reflected   in the current level of prices by any means     What I was trying to do was to lay out some theory on the timing, or   the sequence in which these events might have unfolded     I would hate to go to the mat on that issue without having a chance to   look at the data first My sense is that the gist of this channel, as shown in the middle chart, is     6/26-27/01 70   that by and large a sort of traditional accelerator mechanism seems to have operated here  One   element that is unusual, though, is that many people perceive the originating shock to have been   one to business investment  And at least a component of that shock seems to have come from the   telecom service sector  Those firms themselves account for what is, at least to me, an astonishing   fraction of overall investment  I don't have the figure nailed down but it’s somewhere between   10 and 15 percent of overall equipment investment  So clearly, the reassessment of the prospects   for the telecom service sector was important, but that's not to suggest that developments in the   industrial sector were not also an important contributing factor     Well, there are a couple of elements that I can throw out  One is, as   we tried to emphasize in the report, that these gaps that open up between the estimated target and   the actual capital exert some drag on aggregate demand  And at least if you believe the model   estimates--though I could give you a long list of reasons why you shouldn’t--these gaps are rather   slow to work off So, for example, in the high-tech graph on that chart we can see that through     6/26-27/01 72   most of the 1980s there was an alleged gap that didn't get corrected  That's just to say that the   overhang in high-tech equipment and in other equipment is a moderate negative on the outlook    But that in and of itself doesn't have a large incremental effect  In his remarks I believe Dave   Stockton highlighted the two key factors that we think are going to turn the economy around    One is monetary policy and the other is fiscal policy  All this sort of rolls together; if it becomes   apparent that the momentum of the economy is shifting, then through normal accelerator effects   other things start to come along with it  But the two key prime movers would be fiscal policy and   monetary policy     Fitted to the actual data and estimated in a system of four equations   involving these two elements of equipment plus nonresidential structures as a third and   inventories as a fourth     I could never plead guilty to feeling comfortable with something as   far removed from what ordinary business decision makers see as their reality  If I were to try to   defend this as best I could, I’d say that one piece of corroborating evidence is that if we look at   average periods over which there has been an overhang--defined by the shaded gray areas--they   correspond to periods of slower than average growth  And by contrast, the periods when the   actual stock was short of the target stock are ones with faster growth  Now all kinds of things   were going on during those periods; the overhang wasn't the only factor by any means  But that's     6/26-27/01 74   one piece of corroborating evidence  And then, consistent with President Moskow's comment, it   does make me feel a little better that when we went out and talked with some real people--       I guess I managed to take some comfort in that, maybe more frankly   than from these model estimates     I don't think I can answer that on the spot, but I'll certainly think about   that It's an interesting question     Thank you, Mr Chairman  A reader of this  meeting’s Greenbook could be forgiven, I think, for contracting at least  a mild case of sticker shock  After all, we revised down our estimate of  growth for the current year--already half completed--by 04 percentage  point, and for next year by twice that much, to cut 1-1/4 percentage  points from the level of GDP by the end of next year  But rather than  casting this forecast as a big change from its predecessor, I would like  to begin today by making the case that this can largely be seen as a  status quo forecast         Without a doubt, there has been considerable buzz in the last few  weeks about the revisions to the national income accounts and how  dramatically those revisions have changed perceptions of  macroeconomic reality  In a way, of course, that is correct  The  revised figures suggest that firms invested much less than previously  estimated during the past three years  Accordingly, capital deepening  occurred at a slower pace, and that has important implications, of  course, for growth prospects As my colleagues Fleischman, Sichel,  and Struckmeyer outlined in their memo to you last week, we have  trimmed our estimate of potential GDP growth by four tenths this year  and six tenths next year  Obviously, a revision of this magnitude is of  enormous consequence for some issues, including assessments of the     8/21/01 5   trend rate of growth in the standard of living, the long-term outlook for  the federal budget, and the solvency of the Social Security system         But the implications of the NIPA revisions for the conduct of  monetary policy could easily be overdone  To a first approximation,  the recent history of inflation remains essentially as previously  estimated  From that, we infer to a first approximation that the  pressures on productive resources probably were about as we had  estimated based on the previous numbers  In particular, the gap  between actual and potential GDP probably was about as we had it,  albeit with lower levels of both actual and potential output         Previously, we had been attributing a goodly portion of the  outstanding inflation performance of the late 1990s to the acceleration  in structural productivity Now, with the productivity boom  downgraded a notch, it can obviously do less of the work for us in  terms of explaining why inflation has stayed so low during the last five  or six years So what explains the extraordinarily good inflation  performance of the late 1990s?  The short answer is that we don’t know  for sure, but something else must have been causing inflation to behave  so well despite the low unemployment rate  Often cited candidates  include the rise of temporary help supply firms, better job matching  facilitated by the Internet, welfare reform, and reduced pricing power  due to more intense foreign competition  Before, we were in the  slightly awkward position of having no room for any of these entirely  plausible explanations to play a role  Now, there is scope for these  possible changes in the behavior of labor and product markets to be part  of the story While we are uncertain about the precise magnitudes of  the various individual effects, we are assuming they will persist, with  the consequence being essentially equivalent to a reduction in the long- run NAIRU from 5-1/2 percent to 5-1/4 percent         Thus, when all the dust has settled, our assessment is that you are  operating in an environment that in some ways looks very similar to the  one we saw in June Inflation is about the same and the pressures on  resource utilization look similar  As a result, the stance of monetary  policy, as gauged by the gap between r and r*, also looks about the  same         That said, let me now turn up the microscope and point out some of  the adjustments that we have made to our outlook in the context of that  broadly similar framework  By far the most important of these  adjustments is a further marking down of our outlook for business  investment  As you know, the data on orders for June were  extraordinarily weak, headlined by a 13 percent decline in orders for  communications equipment, not at an annual rate  As we could find     8/21/01 6   little solace either in the Beige Book or in our own informal contacts  with members of the business community, we are now assuming that  this quarter’s decline in real spending for equipment and software will  be essentially as steep as last quarter’s  We’re also assuming that the  fourth quarter will show no great improvement either  In addition, we  have turned much more bearish on the outlook for nonresidential  structures While the commercial real estate sector seems to have  avoided repeating the excesses of the late 1980s, vacancy rates have  been rising sharply of late and we foresee several more quarters of  declining spending on nonresidential structures  This, too, seems to be  supported by the reports summarized in the Beige Book and elsewhere         In contrast, we continue to be surprised to the upside by the strength  of consumer spending  The advance estimate of retail sales for July  was noticeably stronger than we had been expecting, and with the tax  rebate arriving in most households’ mailboxes this month and next, we  still anticipate that household spending will provide important support  to activity in the months ahead         The only other notable modification to our near-term outlook is  mostly just a matter of timing  By our assessment, automakers have  been in the process of building more vehicles--especially trucks--this  quarter than we think they can reasonably expect to sell As a  consequence, we think they will need to cut production significantly in  the fourth quarter The resulting swings in production, on our  assumptions, add about 1/2 percentage point to GDP growth this  quarter and take away about 1-1/4 percentage point next quarter  We  may be off on our timing one way or the other but unless sales pick up  substantially, a sharp cutback in production from current plans  sometime in the next few months seems highly likely  And Ford’s  announcement last week--which is already built into our numbers--is  probably only the beginning         So from a larger perspective, how should you, as the principals in  this process, audit the reasonableness of our projection?  As a starting  point, I suggest that you consider three basic questions  First, do you  find our revisions to potential GDP growth plausible?  We now have  the growth of potential GDP slowing from 3-3/4 percent last year to 3  percent this year and to 2-3/4 percent next year, reflecting a slower pace  of capital deepening I should note, for those who are trying to gauge  the long-term growth potential of the economy, that on our current  outlook for business investment we would have the growth of potential  edging back up perhaps to about 3 percent after 2002         Second, do you find it plausible that we have adjusted our forecast  for actual GDP roughly in line with the revision to potential, leaving     8/21/01 7   aside some issues of lags?  Our theory in making this adjustment is that  households and firms should not be completely oblivious to the change  in the outlook Indeed, households and firms were likely on to this  even before we were In particular, we know that for the most part  households tie their spending to the trend in their income  And if the  trend in their income slows, then we should have a good deal of  confidence that their spending will slow as well, even if with a short  lag We also know that businesses gauge their need for productive  plant and equipment to the pace of their current and expected activity   And if they sense that activity is not living up to prior billing, they can  be counted on to trim their investment spending accordingly         I should hasten to say that not everyone is as glum as we are about  the near-term prospects for real activity; for example, the most recent  Blue Chip consensus is at 2-1/4 percent for growth in the second half   But in the face of a noticeably weaker foreign outlook, unremitting  gloom from the industrial sector, continued bad news from the tech  sector, and a steady drumbeat of negative earnings and layoff  announcements, I am a bit hard pressed to share their optimism         Third, do you find our cautious optimism about the outlook for  inflation plausible? To be sure, as we highlighted in the “alternative  simulations” section of the Greenbook, the substantial downward  revision to the markup in the NIPA accounts appears to take away a  cushion we thought firms had to absorb future cost pressures If firms  move to restore that cushion, the consequence could be several more  tenths of inflation as early as next year  However, the environment we  see is one of low capacity utilization, increasing slack in labor markets,  and earlier retrenchment in energy prices than we had previously been  expecting Moreover, we believe the revised data on compensation per  hour for the year 2000 may be importantly distorted by the treatment of  options granted by employers, so we have been inclined to discount  these data While margins clearly cannot be suppressed without limit,  we are inclined to believe that the plausible limit has not been reached  yet, and so we anticipate continued relatively good inflation  performance over the forecast period        Let me conclude by focusing on one of the risks to the outlook that  we highlighted in the “alternative simulations” section of the  Greenbook--namely, the risk of a major stock market correction   Contrary to my general story line that the NIPA revisions did not affect  much of interest, I don’t think that’s the case here  As you know, there  were downward revisions over the last several years to NIPA dividends  and earnings Moreover, our analysis leads us to be considerably more  guarded in our assessment of the outlook for the trends in these series  based on the downward revised growth in potential output  That        Wall Street Journal  implies that today’s level of equity prices is being carried on a shakier  foundation of fundamentals  I should add parenthetically that I think  this morning’s story in the  reinforces this view,  although it doesn’t alter the validity of the NIPA accounts because, for  all their shortcomings, the NIPA accounts happen to get this aspect of  earnings reporting correct On the whole, this leads us to conclude that  whatever our level of apprehension about the market before the release  of the NIPA data, it probably ought to be moved up a notch in light of  the new information   8/21/01 8     Let me make two comments on that  First of all, I made an oblique   reference to the issue of lags  We translate a downward shift in the trend in incomes to consumer   spending with a lagged response of a couple of quarters  We think it takes households a little   while to catch on to this change We brought down potential GDP growth by 04 percentage   point this year We think about half of that lower potential growth this year translates into a   reduction in actual GDP growth For next year we took potential down by 06 percentage point    And by that time we believe the adjustment process is far enough along so that households will   begin to recognize a softening in their income prospects, and indeed in their permanent income,   and that will be incorporated into their spending  So we feel that over that kind of time horizon   it’s realistic to build changes in the fundamental tenor of income into the growth of consumer   spending     Yes     There’s not a lot to go on  We don’t have clean, historical experiments    We have some elegant theory and some consensus parameters  We attempted to calibrate simulation   models to values that we think are sensible and that in other circumstances produce reasonable   results But history is not replete with temporary investment tax incentives of the kind that we’re   simulating here  And Congress is not notorious for following through in every respect with the   specifics of its original announcement  So one possible risk that could attenuate the effect of the   investment incentive is that, contrary to our assumption in the Greenbook, businesses may doubt that   in fact the incentive will be allowed to expire at the end of the three-year period  In that case the   provision wouldn’t spur as much investment as we had assumed will take place  That said, there is   econometric evidence that at least helps us to narrow the range of uncertainty a bit  We have a view   about the long-run elasticity of the capital stock with respect to the cost of capital  We have some   evidence on speeds of adjustment  We tried to piece together those bits of evidence using a   simulation model to get a handle on how big an effect the proposed legislation might have     I’d like to underscore two points that Dave made earlier  First, what we   have built into the Greenbook projection is not a straight read of our model simulation  We did very   substantially push back the investment response to the tax incentive precisely on the theory that   businesses might plausibly respond to the heightened climate of uncertainty over the next couple of   quarters by opting to wait They might well decide in the context of a three-year incentive--if it does   last that long--that there’s very little penalty to waiting until some of that uncertainty is resolved    Secondly, we observed from the experience with auto sales in October that at least in a different   context economic actors do respond quite vigorously and quickly to something that is seen as a   temporary sale on a large capital item, namely motor vehicles in this case It’s conceivable that   businesses may respond in a similar way       I will grant that the duration makes a big difference        4  Thank you, Mr Chairman  We will be referring to the material  labeled “Staff Presentation on the Economic Outlook” Your first chart sketches the  broad outlines of the staff projection  As you know from the Greenbook, we believe   4 Materials used by Mr Wilcox, Mr Slifman, and Ms Johnson are appended to this document (appendix 4)                 January 29-30, 2002 Page 44 of 194  that economic activity is close to or at a trough  If this indeed turns out to be the case,  we will have experienced a very mild contraction in some dimensions  For example,  as shown in the upper left panel, we now expect that four-quarter growth in real GDP  may just touch zero rather than dipping well below, as has been more typical of  postwar recessions As shown in the panel to the right, our Greenbook projection had  output edging only slightly lower last quarter—a considerably better outcome than we  had been expecting just six weeks ago  Moreover, as Larry will be discussing in a  few minutes, the data on manufacturers’ orders, shipments, and inventories that we  received this morning were a shade stronger than we had been expecting and, all else  equal, would cause us to nudge up a shade further our estimates of growth last quarter  and this quarter I should note, of course, that BEA’s adding up of the fourth quarter  will be released tomorrow morning  We see real GDP growth gathering steam over  the first half of this year, moving modestly above the growth of potential by the third  quarter and remaining above potential through the end of next year  As shown in the  middle left panel, we expect the unemployment rate to peak soon at only a little above  its current level and then to drift down over the remainder of the forecast period   Slack in resource utilization, together with the indirect effect of lower energy prices,  should be sufficient to put core PCE price inflation—shown by the red line in the  middle right panel—on a downward trajectory  And with structural productivity  growth expected to rebound a bit next year, we see core PCE inflation moving down  into the neighborhood of 1 percent by the end of 2003  The bottom panel outlines  some of the major forces shaping the outlook as we see it  First, on our assumptions,  monetary and fiscal stimulus will be substantial enough to offset considerable  restraint from the stock market and the dollar  Second, the inventory correction  should be coming to an end  Third, excess capacity in many industries is likely to  weigh on the strength of the recovery in equipment spending  Finally, inflationary  pressures remain in check   Your next chart provides some historical perspective on the recession that we  believe is just concluding  As you may know, the Business Cycle Dating Committee  of the National Bureau of Economic Research applies three criteria in determining  whether a given historical episode qualifies as a recession; these criteria are often  referred to as “the three Ds” of recessions—duration, depth, and dispersion  To  qualify as a bona fide recession, a slowdown in activity must last long enough,  involve a large enough contraction of activity, and affect a broad enough swath of the  economy   The top panel of this chart measures recessions in terms of the first “D,” duration   If the staff forecast were to come true in every respect, we are guessing that the  Business Cycle Dating Committee would eventually declare the trough in activity as  having occurred either this month or next, putting this recession right at the postwar  average in terms of its duration      The middle panel turns to the second “D” and presents various measures of the  depth of postwar recessions As shown on line 1, if measured by the absolute decline  in real GDP from its own peak to its own trough, this has been a very mild                    January 29-30, 2002 Page 45 of 194  recession—involving a reduction of only 04 percent, roughly a fifth of the postwar  average and the mildest of the bunch  An important feature of this episode, though,  was that the official period of recession—as defined by the NBER—was preceded by  a period of subpar growth So if one defines depth on the basis of the change in the  GDP gap from its own peak to its own trough, then—as shown on line 2—the current  recession bulks a bit larger relative to the postwar average  Similarly, if one measures  severity according to the increase in the unemployment rate, line 3, the recession just  ending was again about two-thirds as severe as the average  Finally, as shown on line  4, if industrial production is the metric of choice, then the current episode clocks in at  a three-quarters rating relative to the postwar average  These comparisons highlight  that every recession is different In this episode, the decline in real GDP was quite  mild compared with the historical average, whereas the decline in IP was only a bit  less than the average   Turning to the final “D,” the bottom panel presents one measure of dispersion—  that is, how broadly the slowdown has been felt  This panel shows the BLS’s three- month diffusion index for private nonfarm payroll employment  For this series,  which is based on employment changes in 353 different industries, readings below 50  signify that more industries reported a decline in payroll employment over the  preceding three months than an increase  The latest few readings on this series  suggest that the recent slowdown has been about as broadly felt as the prior three  recessions for which this series is available   The next two charts review our assumptions about four key conditioning variables  in the staff projection Chart 3 focuses first on the real federal funds rate, defined  here as the nominal rate less the four-quarter rate of change in the core PCE price  index As shown in the top panel, the Committee’s actions over the past year have  brought this measure of the real funds rate down almost to zero, a low level by  historical standards but not unprecedented   The middle left panel takes a different approach to comparing the current cyclical  experience to previous episodes In this panel, the black line shows the trajectory of  the real funds rate for the eight quarters preceding the peak (to the left of the vertical  line) and the eight quarters following the peak (to the right of the vertical line)  For  this purpose, we treated the first quarter of 2001 as the peak quarter, in line with the  NBER pegging March as the peak month  The red line shows the average path of the  funds rate in the nine earlier postwar recessions  Finally, the blue region shows the  entire extent of the range of values taken on by the real funds rate during each of the  nine earlier episodes Several features of this panel are notable  First, relative to  earlier episodes, the real funds rate coming into the peak this time around was on a  shallower upward trajectory—presumably reflecting that inflation was under far  better control toward the end of the most recent business cycle expansion than in the  average previous episode Second, and perhaps more important for determining the  contour of the recovery, the real funds rate turned down earlier and more decisively  and is projected to remain lower throughout the projection period than was the case in                    January 29-30, 2002 Page 46 of 194  the average previous experience  Indeed, a central driving force in the staff outlook is  the stimulus provided by monetary policy   The remaining two panels on this chart turn to another major source of stimulus,  namely fiscal policy  As you know from the Greenbook, we abandoned the partial- expensing provision and the second round of personal income tax rebates that we had  built into the December projection  However, as indicated in the middle right panel,  we still anticipate that the federal budget will provide a considerable boost to activity  this year, even without those provisions  A good chunk of the anticipated impetus  reflects the next installment on the phased-in tax cuts that were enacted last year  But  the greater amount of the overall impetus will come, we expect, on the spending side  of the budget—most of it already enacted, but we also have a small placeholder in the  projection for some additional appropriations this year  As shown in the bottom  panel, the impetus that we are expecting this year—a bit more than 1 percent of  GDP—is on a par with the levels of 1982 and 1983 and a considerable turnaround  from the late 1980s and early to mid-1990s,when fiscal policy was restrictive   Your next chart turns first to the behavior of the dollar  As shown in the top  panel, we have the real exchange value of the dollar hanging up near its current level  throughout the remainder of the forecast period A glance at the history of this series  suggests that there really is no “typical” behavior of the exchange rate around a  business cycle turning point  In two of the NBER recessions since the breakdown of  the Bretton Woods agreement in the early 1970s, the dollar tended toward  appreciation, while in the other two it trended down  As shown in the middle left  panel, compared with the average of these very different experiences, the dollar in the  current episode was on a steeper upward trajectory before the peak and has remained  relatively strong despite the Committee’s aggressive move toward an easier stance of  monetary policy   In a similar vein, the middle right panel suggests that the stock market, which had  importantly fueled demand until 2000, has been a restraining force around the most  recent business cycle peak relative to the average historical experience and on our  assumptions will remain so through next year  As shown by the black line in this  panel, the market—represented here by the S&P500 price index—declined sharply  coming into the peak and lost another 10 percent in the two quarters after the peak,  ending the third quarter of last year down a total of about 30 percent from its high   Part of that loss was recovered in the rebound during the fourth quarter, but even so,  we believe that some additional restraint on consumer and business spending is  probably still in the pipeline As you can see from the dashed portion of the black  line in the middle right panel, we have assumed only a mild uptrend in equity prices  over the forecast period We view our assumption about the stock market as a  relatively neutral one, but we are aware that traditional measures—such as the price- earnings ratio shown in the bottom panel—continue to suggest that equity valuations  are rich by historical standards             January 29-30, 2002 Page 47 of 194  On balance, as is illustrated in your next chart, our assumptions for these  conditioning variables and other considerations lead us to expect a milder-than­ average recovery As shown on line 1 in the top panel, we expect real GDP to grow a  bit more than 3 percent over the four quarters beginning in the current quarter—  roughly half the average rate of increase over comparable periods in postwar  recoveries With potential GDP expected to grow about 2½ percent over the next  four quarters, the projected recovery would close about ½ percentage point of the gap  (line 2) that we believe currently exists between actual and potential GDP  Reflecting  the relatively tepid pace of the recovery, we expect the unemployment rate (line 3) to  be about unchanged over this period rather than declining a little more than 1  percentage point, as has been the historical average  Moreover, we expect the  industrial sector to be very slow in rebounding, with growth over the next four  quarters of only 3¾ percent—far slower than the double-digit postwar average  At  least in one respect, the milder-than-average projected recovery is not to be lamented   As shown in the middle panel, we believe there is considerably less slack in the  economy currently than has typically been the case at troughs since 1960 and thus, in  one sense, not enough room for a cyclically “normal” rebound   The bottom panels attempt to shed some light on the question of where the  slower-than-average recovery shows up  These panels show contributions to GDP  growth over the next four quarters from key components of aggregate demand, with  some interest-sensitive elements of household spending on the left and the business  sector represented on the right  Turning first to the household sector, we have  residential investment and durable goods spending contributing less than 1 percentage  point to the growth of GDP over the next four quarters, whereas in previous  recessions they have generally contributed considerably more than that  The  seemingly lackluster performance of these components of spending this time around  is the flip side of their having held up remarkably well through the contraction phase  of the cycle and thus should not be expected to move up by the average amount from  their current levels On the business side, the ongoing tribulations of the  communications and aircraft sectors have helped shape our judgment—reflected in  the lower right panel—that business fixed investment will add less than ¼ percentage  point to overall GDP growth over the next four quarters, whereas in many previous  expansions BFI has made a positive contribution of more than ½ point  Larry  Slifman will now continue our presentation    Your last chart displays the projections that you submitted for this  year The central tendency of your projections for the growth of real GDP is revised  down from the June meeting  Likewise, the central tendency of PCE inflation  projections is revised down a notch from last year  We would now be pleased to  address your questions     I think what the Dating Committee was reacting to primarily was that   until September 11 the depth criterion hadn’t been met  It was that event, with the rapid falloff   in activity after September 11, which in their minds pushed the preponderance of evidence over   the line     January 29-30, 2002 Page 57 of 194    It’s conceivable  Certainly Doug Elmendorf’s and Karen Dynan’s work   with GDP data suggests that those data are susceptible to great revision  That’s not the main   focus of the Dating Committee’s examination  They tend to rely on monthly indicators  But, as   you know, the contours of those indicators can be revised on the basis of new information    Indeed, it was only a matter of a few days after the NBER Committee made their announcement,   as I recall, that our industrial production folks issued a comprehensive revision of the IP index,   which pushed back the peak in IP to several months earlier  So, these determinations of a   particular month for the peak are always difficult to make, as the NBER emphasized in their   announcement  As the revisions sort out, it will be interesting to see whether the clarity of the   peak determination improves and whether the date is shifted       That’s correct     It peaked earlier—and several months earlier after the revision     The BLS puts out an array of these series  One set in the series has to do   with the total private nonfarm sector; the other has to do with the manufacturing sector  This is   from the former constellation  Within that there are one-month, three-month, and six-month   diffusion indexes This is the three-month version of that  There are 353 so-called three-digit   industries in the nonfarm private sector This is a diffusion index of the change in payroll   employment in each of those industries over a three-month period  A reading above 50 indicates   that more industries reported a payroll employment increase than a decrease     It’s a truism that every business cycle is different, and no doubt that   applies here as well There is another factor going on in the background at the same time  While   it may be that previously the recession itself was more concentrated in certain sectors, as you   suggest, most of these earlier episodes were deeper as well  All that is required for an industry to   contribute to a reading below 50 is for it to have a decline in employment  So if the absolute   depth of a recession is greater, one would expect the dispersion magnitude to go lower even if   the recession is more concentrated by industry     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I suspect that the typical reader of  the recent business press would find the outlook described in the August Greenbook  surprisingly bright After all, the drumbeat of negative news during the last few  weeks has been nearly unrelenting, with news of corporate accounting scandals,  somber warnings about future earnings, stock prices that have been headed more  south than north, negative results on hiring and especially hours in July, sour reports  from various associations of purchasing managers around the country, a disheartening  reading on consumer sentiment, and the spectacle of the nation’s top CEOs and CFOs  having to swear that they are telling the truth in the documents they submit to the  Securities and Exchange Commission  One of the few upbeat counterpoints has been  the persistent strength of consumer spending, most strikingly for new motor vehicles  but also, according to this morning’s advance report, for other goods as well  But the  brisk pace of traffic in auto showrooms hasn’t dissuaded many observers from  focusing on the possibility of a second bout of contraction  In that context, how do  we explain a projection featuring 2½ percent growth in real GDP on average this  quarter and next, with the unemployment rate edging up only a little and private- sector payrolls starting to show some life?   Unfortunately, of course, it is all too possible that the pundits have it right  But I  want to begin by outlining a few of the reasons why, based on the information  currently in hand, we think the more likely path forward involves continued recovery,  even if at a sluggish pace by historical standards  First, by far the bulk of the earlier                    August 13, 2002 12 of 92  inventory problem now seems to have been worked off  There are still a few entries  on the “watch” list—most notably communications equipment—but for most goods,  inventory holdings are in much better alignment with sales, and if anything, even a bit  lean While the timing of the lift from inventory investment is highly uncertain, we  are reasonably confident that the lift will come and probably not too long from now   Second, monetary policy remains accommodative  Measured in real terms, the funds  rate is in the neighborhood of zero, a very low level by historical standards  If you  prefer to measure the stance of policy in terms of the deviation of r from r*, you could  take comfort in the fact that the actual real funds rate still appears to be well below  the equilibrium rate, even if by a somewhat smaller margin according to our latest  estimates  And one important lesson of the recent experience is that the policy  channels are working fine Low prevailing market rates allowed the automakers to  offer the cut-rate financing deals that attracted so many customers, and historically  low mortgage rates have helped sustain residential investment in the face of steeply  declining wealth and uncertain prospects for the labor market   On the fiscal policy side, the marginal-rate cut implemented at the beginning of  this year still should be feeding through into household spending  And we continue  to believe that businesses will be encouraged by the temporary partial-expensing  provision to boost their spending on new equipment and software  Part of the  impetus from the federal level will be offset on the state and local side, but the  government sector as a whole should be a net plus for the growth of GDP  At the  margin, the downturn in the dollar during the last few months will also be a plus,  especially in comparison with the run-up during the preceding two years   Taken together, these factors are enough to support sustained growth in GDP in  our baseline projection  We had projected that consumers would not flag in their  actual spending—even if they continue to share their apprehensions with the  University of Michigan and the Conference Board—and this morning’s retail sales  report provides reassuring evidence on that point  And in the business sector, while  we have become much gloomier about the outlook for nonresidential structures, we  still see spending on equipment and software as being on a slow but steady path to  recovery   We also updated our views about a number of important parameters on the supply  side of the economy  First, the annual revisions to the national income and product  accounts told us that the average pace of growth during the last few years was several  tenths lower than previously estimated  From this information, we inferred that the  pace of structural productivity growth probably had been slower—and likely would  remain slower—than we had previously estimated, so we revised down our estimate  of the rate of growth of potential GDP But with the slower rate of growth of  structural productivity, we were left with an incipient puzzle  The favorable inflation  performance of the last few years stood essentially as before, but now it appeared that  structural productivity growth was a less powerful explanation  To fill the gap, we  marked down our assumption for the NAIRU, from 5¼ percent to 5 percent, thereby                            August 13, 2002 13 of 92  generating enough additional labor market slack to make the inflation picture fit  together   Over the intermeeting period, the volatility in the stock market left major indexes  down substantially on net Two items in this regard are worth noting  First, if the  long-term earnings growth projections of the equity analysts are to be given any  credence—and that is a mighty big “if”—then a real possibility has emerged that  stocks are currently undervalued This points to one of the upside risks that we  highlighted in the Alternative Simulations section of the Greenbook  Second, perhaps  on cue from our Alternative Simulations section, stock prices have rebounded some  since we put the Greenbook to bed last week If we had had the foresight to  anticipate that mini-recovery, we wouldn’t have altered our projection for the  remainder of this year materially but would have shown another tenth or two of  growth next year   All in all, we see the incoming information as telling us that the economy is  moving along a growth track that is slower than previously projected but moving  forward nonetheless and with a slightly wider gap in resource utilization  In that  context, the prospects for future inflation remain extremely favorable  In the near  term, the greater margin of slack and its implication of even less inflationary pressure  are essentially offset by the reduced contribution from structural productivity growth  and by the acceleration we anticipate in import prices  Although the net effect of  these factors is essentially nil in 2003, if we had shown you a projection this time  around for 2004, as we will in the next Greenbook, you would have seen core PCE  inflation edging down another tenth or two from its already very low level   Having highlighted the upside risk from the possible undervaluation of the stock  market, let me close by underscoring the possibility of a shortfall in aggregate  demand  As you know from reading the Greenbook, one of the downside risks we  featured was a further disappointment in business spending for equipment and  software In particular, we simulated the effects for the rest of the economy of  assuming that outlays for E&S are flat for the remainder of this year and increase  only half as fast next year as in our baseline projection  According to our model, the  probability of an investment surprise of this magnitude is in the neighborhood of  10 to 15 percent In the simulation we reported in the Greenbook, the funds rate was  assumed to be held fixed in nominal terms, and in that case, the output gap was  estimated to widen by nearly 1 percentage point relative to the baseline  However, a  policymaker following an aggressive version of the Taylor rule could limit the  increase in the GDP gap to a little more than ½ percentage point by moving the funds  rate down by about ¾ percentage point by the fourth quarter of next year   A second downside possibility we examined is that households adopt the same  type of caution that seems to have characterized recent business behavior and so push  up the personal saving rate 1 percentage point higher than in our baseline  The model  suggests that the probability of such a large ongoing shift in the personal saving rate,  quarter after quarter, is very remote  But one can alternatively view this shock as a                                                              August 13, 2002 14 of 92  stand-in for the full range of shocks on the demand side of the model; and under that  interpretation, a shortfall of this magnitude has about a 10 percent probability of  occurring, according to our model  In the results that we showed in the Greenbook,  the GDP gap finishes 2003 about1½ percentage points wider than in the baseline   However, a policymaker whose behavior is described by an aggressive Taylor rule  once again can limit the damage, in this case holding the increase in the GDP gap to  about ¾ percentage point by dropping the funds rate about 1 percentage point by the  first half of next year Karen Johnson will now continue our presentation     It’s a risk We brought the workweek back from 340 to 342 hours in   our assumptions for August and September partly on the judgment that this year July 4 fell on a   Thursday so it was particularly easy for employers to grant a four-day weekend  That’s relevant               August 13, 2002 18 of 92  for those employers who are on a biweekly reporting basis because that period would be   included in the time frame of the reports that they submitted to the BLS  In addition, we saw the   weekly claims data coming down over the month So our guess was, partly on the basis of   statistical considerations and what we read as the trajectory of the labor market over the month,   that the survey results were not representative of the month as a whole       I think they concur in the judgment regarding July 4, and I don’t believe   they offered an opinion on the remainder of our logic     I have a different take on it  We took potential GDP growth down   03 this year and 04 next year, and our model simulations suggest that that should feed through   essentially one for one into the growth of aggregate demand  So the way I’d parse it out is that   I’d say about 03 of the roughly 1 percentage point revision for the second half reflects the   adjustment to our trend rate of growth of potential GDP  For next year, I’d attribute a larger            August 13, 2002 19 of 92  fraction of our revision, perhaps 04 of our total revision of 06, to the adjustment to the growth   of potential GDP In growth rate terms, the negative news from the stock market is very   important for this year as are the adverse signals that we think we’re getting about production in   the near term from the labor market report and from the negative purchasing managers’ surveys    We also gave a nod to the adverse results from consumer sentiment surveys, as modulated by   strong auto sales So the larger fraction of the revision this year is due to other indicators that we   think tell us that the gap is going to be widening     I have a couple of additional comments  First, it is incredibly difficult to   interpret some of the announcements that are coming out in the state and local area  For   example, Governor Davis as you know—excuse me, I’m not quite as emotional about the topic   as my faltering voice suggests  [Laughter]     Over the weekend or late last week, Governor Davis announced a   package of $10 billion of budget cuts My understanding, based on public sources, is that only   about $3½ billion of those cuts are to be applied in the current fiscal year; the remaining   $6 billion and change will be applied in the following year  That goes to the more general point   that while there is a lot of distress in the state and local sector—and we’ve reflected a good deal   of that in our projection—there’s quite a bit of latitude for the states to meet these so-called         December 10, 2002 26 of 87  balanced budget requirements They can do that in a number of different ways  I think what   we’ll see in coming months is recourse for things like accessing capital funds—     There’s a whole constellation of financial devices available including, as   Dave mentioned, the state financing of capital projects through bond issuance rather than on a   current basis     Yes, Governor Davis indicated that there are further announcements to   come     Actually, they started out north of CBO on the advice of the Defense   Department  I’m not sure what they factored into their thinking that led them to bring their   number down to below where the Defense Department said it was going to be  It may be   because their figure is $5 billion or so weaker than ours for the fiscal year as a whole, which   translates to $10 billion at an annual rate for the remaining two quarters     I think it’s fair to say that there is a lot of uncertainty about the likely   spendout pattern  We think we’ve begun to see some entrails of that spending in the daily   Treasury statements for April  But getting from the daily Treasury statements to the monthly   Treasury statements, which form the basis for BEA’s estimates, and getting from April to the   quarter as whole involve a lot of estimating  There is a lot of uncertainty in all of those steps       Yes     I think it’s also muted because many of the elements that are   contemplated in the $350 billion package are merely accelerations and so by their nature are   essentially temporary measures  Accordingly, they don’t cause bond markets to anticipate a   substantial worsening of the long-term deficit picture   May 6, 2003 25 of 115      Right      Chart 10, your next chart, shifts the focus back to domestic   considerations and outlines the major factors conditioning our outlook for inflation   As shown in the top left panel, we expect that a significant, though narrowing, margin  of slack will persist over the forecast period—enough to take a couple of tenths off  core inflation both this year and next  Although consumer energy prices (the top right  panel) have begun to soften, for the year as a whole we still expect them to contribute  about a tenth to core PCE inflation  Next year, we expect them to be a neutral  influence  Likewise, we expect core non-oil import prices (the middle left panel) to  add about a tenth to core inflation this year and to have no net influence next year   All in all, as shown by the red line in the middle right panel and on line 5 in the table  at the bottom of the page, we believe that core PCE price inflation is in the process of  stepping down fairly noticeably this year, and we expect it to edge down further next  year  As can be seen by comparing lines 5 and 6 in the table, we have revised down  our forecast for core PCE price inflation both this year and next by about 03  percentage point since the January Greenbook      The deceleration in core consumer prices over the past year, together with the   likelihood that an appreciable amount of economic slack will persist for several more  quarters, has—as you know—generated intense interest in and speculation about the  possibility that the US economy will begin to experience deflation  The next two  charts touch on some aspects of the report on this topic that I wrote with Doug  Elmendorf and Dave Reifschneider and that was distributed to you earlier this month     The first of these charts summarizes and updates our efforts to assess the   probability of deflation and related events  As noted in the top panel, we computed  these probabilities using stochastic simulations of FRB/US, the Board staff’s large- scale econometric model of the US economy  For the purpose of these simulations,  and consistent with the analysis in the rest of the paper, we defined “deflation” as  occurring whenever the Q4/Q4 change in the core PCE price index is less than the  estimated measurement bias in that index, ½ percent  Importantly, our definition is   June 24-25, 2003 74 of 211    meant to encompass a much broader range of circumstances than many observers  have in mind when they describe deflation as inevitably generating a downward spiral  in economic activity  Also in the realm of definition, we treated the zero bound as  having been hit whenever the annual average of the funds rate is less than 25 basis  points  We assumed that monetary policy follows a version of the Taylor rule, but  with the zero bound enforced  We drew the shocks for the simulations from the  model’s residuals over the period 1970-2002  In the paper we circulated to you  earlier, we took the April Greenbook forecast as defining the baseline, but the results  we show here take the June Greenbook as defining the baseline  However, you will  note if you refer back to the original paper that the differences attributable to this  change are small     The middle panel uses FRB/US to calculate confidence intervals around the   staff’s baseline inflation forecast  In particular, the darkest region gives the  50 percent confidence region; the intermediate shading shows the extent of the  75 percent confidence region, and the lightest shading shows the 90 percent  confidence region  Thus, for example, in the fourth quarter of 2004, roughly half of  the probability mass is estimated to fall between zero and 2 percent  Put slightly  differently, about 25 percent of the outcomes show the measured rate of change in  core PCE prices over the four quarters of 2004 falling below zero, thus corresponding  to true deflation of ½ percent or more; and another 25 percent show the measured rate  of change coming in above 2 percent     The bottom left panel reports the probabilities of some specific events  As shown   on the first row of the table, taking the June Greenbook projection as the baseline, we  put the probability of deflation at about 15 percent for this year, just short of  40 percent for 2004, and about 40 percent for 2005  As shown on the second row, we  estimate that the risk of hitting the zero bound is lower because, in many of the  stochastic simulations, deflation is induced by favorable productivity shocks  As  shown on the third row, the probability of both experiencing deflation and hitting the  zero bound is smaller still, but nonetheless represents about a 1-in-6 event for 2004  and a 1-in-7 outcome for 2005       The bottom right panel provides a model-based perspective on one element of the   potential cost of deflation  According to FRB/US, a number of aspects of  macroeconomic performance deteriorate when a central bank pursues a very low  average rate of inflation; the one we have highlighted here is that the central bank’s  ability to stabilize real activity is somewhat impaired  As shown on the first row, at  an average CPI inflation rate of 2 percent (the right-hand column), the central bank is  able to limit the standard deviation of the unemployment rate to 15 percentage  points  But at an average CPI inflation rate of zero—corresponding to bias-adjusted  deflation of nearly 1 percent per year—the estimated standard deviation of the  unemployment rate is 18 percentage points  Similarly, as shown in the second row,  deep recessions are somewhat more frequent when the average inflation rate is very  low, according to the model  While these effects are modest, they nonetheless   June 24-25, 2003 75 of 211    suggest that your choice of an average inflation objective is a matter of some  consequence for the performance of the macroeconomy     Your next chart poses a series of questions about the conduct of monetary policy   raised by this analysis  First, there is the question as to whether you should aim to put  an additional cushion between zero and the long-run average inflation rate beyond  any allowance you might make to take account of measurement bias  The  asymmetric nature of the zero lower bound and the downward rigidity of nominal  wages might incline you toward the view that you should but would leave open the  question of how large the additional cushion should be  As noted in the left-hand  column, you might lean toward a larger cushion the more concerned you are about the  adverse effects of the zero bound and nominal wage rigidity; you might also build in  a larger cushion the greater you see the underlying volatility of the economy as being   On the other hand, as shown in the right-hand column, you might be inclined toward  a smaller cushion the greater your confidence in the efficacy of the alternative  approaches to the conduct of monetary policy that were discussed yesterday  afternoon  You might be so inclined as well if you are concerned about the efficiency  loss even from low positive inflation—for example, from the impairment of the  effectiveness of the price system, the greater scope for losses from nominal illusion,  and so forth     A second question has to do with how aggressive you should be in moving to   head off any incipient deflationary pressures  As shown on the left, a first motivation  for aggressive and preemptive cuts in the federal funds rate might arise from concerns  that nontraditional policy actions will not be effective  A second motivation could  center on second-moment considerations; thus, while you might think that  nontraditional approaches would be effective, you might be concerned about the  uncertainty surrounding any estimate of the effectiveness of nontraditional monetary  policy  Under a conventional analysis of policymaking under uncertainty, that lack of  assurance would justify moving aggressively to reduce the odds of your being put in  that unfamiliar circumstance  On the other hand, as noted on the right, a less  aggressive approach would be warranted the more you are concerned that markets  would interpret an easing in that circumstance as signaling a downbeat assessment of  the state of the economy or if you believe that the public would become unnerved if  and when they see that you have no more scope for traditional actions      Finally, a third question has to do with whether your best course would be to   counteract a deflation already in process even if real activity is currently at a  satisfactory level  You could be justified in combating deflation in these  circumstances if you were concerned about the efficiency cost of deflation, just as  you have been concerned about the efficiency cost of inflation  The costs imposed by  nominal illusion, partial indexation of the tax system, impairment of the price system,  and heightened uncertainty about the future course of the macroeconomy would be  reasons for moving to counteract deflation  In addition, you might be concerned that  deflation—even in this relatively gentle form—could limit your ability to move  policy aggressively to counteract a deterioration in real activity should one emerge   June 24-25, 2003 76 of 211    down the road  On the other hand, as indicated to the right, you might take a very  cautious approach in addressing the deflation if you believed that the factors giving  rise to it would prove only temporary  A cautious approach might also be warranted  if you believed that the deflation would ultimately prove self-correcting, as it might,  for example, if it was induced by a favorable shock to productivity growth that so  stimulated aggregate demand as to lay the groundwork for an eventual acceleration of  prices     Your final chart displays your projections for 2003 and 2004  As shown in the   top panel, the central tendency for the growth of real GDP is ¾ percentage point  lower than at the time of the January meeting, and the central tendency projection for  the unemployment rate is ¼ percentage point higher  The projection for PCE price  inflation is unrevised  As shown in the bottom panel, you anticipate a pickup in the  growth of real GDP next year, little change in the inflation rate, and a somewhat  lower unemployment rate by the end of the year  We would now be pleased to take  any questions you may have       Let me address first the question of what we did to our forecast for the   second half of the year  We marked it up by less than one might have done simply on the basis   of taking on board the changes in conditioning factors such as fiscal policy and financial   conditions  We did that, I think, on the basis of two main considerations  First, in the current   climate of business caution that we see, it seemed plausible to us that there would be a smaller   reaction—especially by businesses but also perhaps by consumers—than one might expect in   ordinary macroeconomic times to the additional fiscal stimulus that has been put in the pipeline    Second, we think that part of the additional demand in the second half will be met out of   inventories as businesses will be reluctant to step up production until they become more assured   of the solidity of the economic expansion    I’m not quite sure how to answer the question about what would have happened if we had   just let the model run, given that our model is thirty or forty judgmental analysts  [Laughter]  If   we had tossed the question to FRB/US, I think we might have gotten something on the order of   another ½ percentage point or so of growth in the second half of the year  In part, I think that is   spoken to in one of the alternative simulations where we show a weaker-yet response to the fiscal   stimulus, which results in ½ percentage point or so less real growth than in the baseline  As to   how reasonable it is to show a set of alternative simulations almost all of which have growth   rates with a leading digit of 4—      I agree with you that it’s impressive  Another impressive feature of the   current situation is the amount of stimulus that is in the pipeline from various sources  They   were enumerated by Steve  an unprecedented amount of federal fiscal stimulus, a significant   depreciation in the dollar, a 20 percent rebound in the stock market from its low, and a very   marked reduction in long-term interest rates  With all that, it certainly looks to us as if the odds   are very heavily tilted toward a significant acceleration in economic growth  I do think there are   risks to the downside, but there are even risks to the upside of our quite robust baseline   projection       I may not have understood your question, but in general on this chart   one could take everything in column A and say its opposite would apply in column B  So   indeed, the greater one’s certainty about the effectiveness of nontraditional approaches, the more   complacent one could be in taking preemptive action against a forecast of deflation     I’d have to say that we have no track record to assess the accuracy of   this survey as a predictive tool     No, it was directional     I think the major instance that we had in mind was a favorable   productivity growth shock, which in our analysis—as we outlined in the paper—shifts aggregate   demand up faster than it does aggregate supply      Thank you, Mr Chairman  As you know from the August  Greenbook, we received quite a few encouraging indicators during the intermeeting  period  Let me mention just a few  Sales of light vehicles in July ran at a  172 million unit annual clip, up 1 million units from the average selling pace in the  second quarter  Chain store sales have been on a noticeable uptrend the last several  weeks  The data on orders and shipments of capital goods improved in May and  June  Moreover, the national ISM index as well as a number of the regional  purchasing managers’ reports either moved up in July or held steady at a high level   And earnings reports for the second quarter generally came in to the high side of  analysts’ expectations     By comparison, the list on the other side of the ledger is short  The two   employment reports we received during the intermeeting period both were  disappointing  At the time of the June meeting, we had expected that the change in  payroll employment would have been in positive territory in June and July; instead, it  dropped 70,000 in June and another 30,000 in July  The decline in initial claims  during the past several weeks has been reassuring but, for what it’s worth, our  preferred near-term filtering model sees the available recent labor market indicators,  including claims, as pointing to only little change—up or down—in payroll  employment over the next month or two  In line with this view, we assumed in the  current Greenbook that labor demand will just stabilize in August and September  before beginning to move up at a pretty hefty clip by the end of the year     In economic forecasting, the majority doesn’t necessarily rule, and in this case we   saw the encouraging news on the spending side as fighting the discouraging news  with respect to the labor market pretty much to a draw—leaving us still expecting a  marked pickup in the growth of real GDP, from well below the growth of potential— 31 percent—during the first half of the year to somewhat above potential in the  second half  The list of factors supporting this acceleration is familiar from our  repeated incantation of it  Fiscal policy still should add significantly to the growth of  aggregate demand over the third and fourth quarters even as the severe distress at the  state and local level offsets a part of the federal stimulus  Monetary policy remains  supportive of a pickup in growth, and structural productivity appears to be on a  relatively steep upward trajectory     The key question we had to confront in adjusting the longer-term outlook was   how to react to the run-up in interest rates that has taken place, as Dino discussed,  since the last meeting  There were two dimensions to this question  First, for  purposes of putting together the forecast, should we downweight some of the increase  in rates as merely reflecting an increase in inflation expectations, and to that extent  not an increase in real rates?  If one were to judge from the relative behavior of  nominal and indexed Treasury securities, a goodly portion of the run-up in nominal   August 12, 2003 13 of 110    rates—maybe as much as half—could have reflected an increase in inflation  expectations, at least in the eyes of bond investors  On the other hand, we had to  wonder why, just as inflation compensation in the Treasury market seemed to be  taking off, near-term inflation expectations as reported in the Michigan survey of  consumers were dropping like a rock and longer-term expectations were holding  steady  We certainly weren’t hearing any stories from the business sector about the  rebirth of pricing power  In the end, we treated the whole of the increase in nominal  rates as reflecting an increase in real rates  While inflation expectations might have  gone up on Wall Street, the same does not seem to have been true on Main Street,  where the spending and investment decisions are made  Moreover, it is worth noting  that at least in some precincts of Main Street, particularly those having to do with  housing, even the purely inflation-related component of nominal interest rates seems  to be relevant for the determination of demand     A second important question related to the change in the interest rate environment   was whether we should downweight the negative implications of the run-up in rates  on a second theory—namely, that it might have reflected an improvement in business  sentiment, and thus should be interpreted as a symptom of faster growth rather than a  cause of slower growth  While business sentiment might well have improved, we  nonetheless concluded that we needed to apply our standard multipliers to the whole  of the increase in rates, for two main reasons  First, in a line of thought much like the  one we applied to the issue of the real-versus-nominal split, while sentiment might  have improved on Wall Street, it was less apparent that it had done so on Main Street   Hiring through early July seemed to be in the doldrums, and as I mentioned earlier,  the subsequent drop in claims has encouraged us to think only that the decline in  payrolls has come to a halt  While investment demand has been improving, we have  no evidence of a dramatic breakout  Moreover, the indications available to us were  that outside forecasters were not marking up their projections, and this impression  was corroborated in yesterday’s Blue Chip release, which reported essentially no  change in the consensus growth projection for this year and next  Second, and  perhaps more important, we felt that we had to maintain some fidelity to our previous  forecasting methodology  For better or for worse, we had taken on board the full  implications of rates as they stood at the time of the June Greenbook, not applying  any discount for the possibility that bond investors might have been having their own  bout of irrational exuberance  Given that earlier decision, it would have been  logically inconsistent in the current forecast round for us only to have taken on board  a portion of the rebound in rates  Altogether, the change in financial-market  assumptions over the intermeeting period—the increase in interest rates, the stronger  dollar, and the lower level of stock prices—were a small negative for our projection  of GDP growth over the second half of this year and sliced a little more than ½  percentage point from our projection of growth next year  In this regard, two other  quick points are worth noting First, for all our angst in the current forecast round  over the proper interpretation of the run-up in rates, our latest forecast of real GDP  growth—both for the second half of this year and for next year—is virtually  unchanged from our forecast two rounds ago, before the bond market dip and rebound  had gotten under way  Second, I should caution that, from the perspective of our   August 12, 2003 14 of 110    forecast, the bond market adjustment is not over  As you know, market participants  currently seem to expect that the funds rate will be on a substantially steeper  trajectory over the next few years than we have assumed in the Greenbook, and long  rates have been set accordingly  If events unfold as we have projected, financial  markets will have some learning to do  In particular, we have assumed that over the  course of next year, as inflation continues to edge down even in the context of a  vigorous economic expansion, the market’s funds rate expectations will converge  substantially toward ours  As a result, bond rates will tail off and finish next year  about 60 basis points lower than would otherwise have been the case  I mention this  not to claim any great clarity in our foresight but rather to underscore that bond  market misperceptions continue to play a role even in the current projection     Before leaving the real side of the projection, I should mention one piece of news   that came in after the close of the Greenbook but would not have greatly affected our  thinking had we known about it—namely the historical revision to the BLS data on  productivity and costs  As you know from the Greenbook supplement, productivity  growth over the last three years was marked up considerably, based on new data  showing a sharper drop in hours worked than previously estimated  We are inclined  to see those revised data for previous years as having little or no implication for a  number of the variables of greatest concern to you  In particular, they have no  implication for the growth of potential output because any adjustment we might make  to the trend growth of output per hour would be offset by an equal-sized adjustment  to the trend growth of hours  Second, they have no implication for inflationary  pressures because any revision to the trend in output per hour would be offset by an  equal-sized revision to the trend in compensation per hour, leaving unit labor costs  unaffected  All that said, the growth of productivity in the second quarter was  nothing short of stunning, and we certainly will have to contemplate once again  whether our assumption for the growth of potential GDP—already apparently far  above the market consensus—needs to be marked up further     Inflation continues to look very subdued  We were a little surprised by the extent   of the increase in core PCE prices in the second quarter, but this turned out to reflect  an unexpected bulge in so-called non-market-based prices  This makes us a little  uneasy because we believe that measurement issues in this component of the index  are especially acute  The market-based component of the core PCE price index came  in right on our projection as of the last Greenbook  In the second half of this year, we  expect core PCE price inflation to run a little higher than in the first half, reflecting  the removal of some factors that we think held inflation down temporarily earlier this  year  Owners’ equivalent rent was held down relative to tenants’ rent by an  adjustment for utilities costs, and we expect utilities costs to be a neutral factor during  the second half of the year  Motor vehicle incentives rose sharply during the first half  of the year, and we are assuming that they will taper off as we move to the new model  year  States and localities are in the process of implementing some hefty increases in  tuition, other fees, and excise taxes as part of their drive to restore their fiscal health,  and we’ve factored these changes into our thinking for the second half as well  That  said, we see the underlying trend in inflation as still pointing downward  With a   August 12, 2003 15 of 110    noticeable margin of slack in resource utilization persisting through the whole of next  year, we continue to project that core PCE price inflation will finish next year below  1 percent  Karen Johnson will continue our presentation       We would interpret that as a further tightening of financial market   conditions  It would certainly come as a surprise to us if that were to occur  Let me step back a   August 12, 2003 18 of 110    bit and put as clearly as I can the contour of rates we see for next year  We have rates easing   back, as you noted, despite the fact that ordinarily—absent any bond market level adjustment—   we’d have a gradual trending up in the ten-year rate  The reason that would occur is that the ten-  year rate is an average of expected future short rates and the bond market would be folding in   higher rates at the end of the ten-year period  So, holding everything else constant, the ten-year   rate would be trending up  Despite that, our projection is that, as financial market participants   gradually adopt our view of the outlook for real activity and the inflation process, that rate will   come down a little  If the bond market were to go in the other direction, as I said, that would   constitute a tightening in financial market conditions  If the increase were on the order of   magnitude that you suggested, with the ten-year rate moving up to 5 percent, I don’t think that   would in and of itself constitute a dramatic restraint on aggregate demand  It might mean a   couple of tenths or something like that over the subsequent four quarters  But that would not be   a helpful development in terms of producing our expected outcome for aggregate demand     Indeed  I was interpreting President Moskow’s question as involving a   sort of disembodied upward drift in interest rates  If it were to emanate from a different view   about productivity growth, then the implications might be different  But even in that case, it   might still signal a wider gap than we had been projecting between actual and potential GDP     The intuition is that, as best as we can figure out, a large amount of   restraint on the part of employers is an important factor at the moment  We think that shows up   in the sluggish payroll employment gains of recent quarters; and it is mirrored by the fact that we   have actual productivity now well above structural productivity  In our projection for next year,   employers are gaining confidence in the durability of the expansion  Our view is that, as their   confidence rises, they will bring their employment levels back into a more normal alignment   with their output, which would generate the kinds of employment increases that you have noted    That, in turn, would bring productivity very gradually back toward trend, though we don’t have   the gap between actual and structural productivity closing completely; that gap persists   throughout 2004 in our projection       As to why there’s a gap between our projection and outside forecasts, I   think part of the explanation is that we have a substantially more optimistic view about the rate   August 12, 2003 20 of 110    of growth of the economy’s productive capacity  If one compares our forecast with the Blue   Chip forecasts, implicitly we have potential growing more rapidly than they do  But that’s not   the whole story  We have the unemployment rate coming down as well  We generate less   inflation pressure out of that in part precisely because we are more optimistic about productivity   growth  And that greater optimism about productivity growth helps alleviate any buildup of   inflation pressures in our view  I would note, too, that the data over the last few months have   come in to the low side of our projection        So we’ve seen nothing of late to cause us to call into question either our   assumptions about the rate of growth of structural productivity or potential GDP or the inflation   outlook  As I mentioned in my briefing, the only surprise we’ve had lately was in the somewhat   irritating so-called non-market-based component of the core PCE price index  But the market-  based component has been quite consistent with our expectations     That’s not an element of our projection  It would be a factor putting   downward pressure on nominal bond rates  That’s in part the mechanism by which we see the   market and the outside world learning about or coming into line with, if you will, our view of the   world  On our forecast, they should see a combination of strong growth in aggregate demand   coupled with much lower rates of inflation than they expected  As that happens, the market   should bring interest rates down, as I was discussing with President Moskow        We certainly have assigned a big role to the very sizable increases in   cash flow that are occurring  We have disposable income growing over the second half of this   year at nearly a 5 percent rate of increase  Importantly, that reflects the $35 billion in additional   cash flow—not at an annual rate—that’s accruing to households in the third quarter from the   combination of lower withholding, the advance refund of the child credit, and reduced estimated   tax payments  So the fuel price increases are a restraint, but they are overwhelmed by the   stimulus that we think the federal government is delivering       It is an important driver of the contour of our forecast  But I’d come   back exactly to your statement that firms will ramp up investment only when they feel they need   August 12, 2003 22 of 110    it  It’s that kind of logic that has led us to be rather restrained in our assessment of the prospects   for the second half of this year  A lot of the anecdotal information that we have suggests that   firms at the moment are delivering those nice surprises to earnings importantly through cost-  cutting measures and not through capacity expansion     By next year, with a very strong acceleration in business output, we   think firms are going to be feeling the need to engage in a substantial expansion in their E&S   spending  The importance of that factor is illustrated in one of the alternative simulations in the   Greenbook  That simulation indicates that if a surge in investment does not come through—we   did the experiment with respect not only to E&S spending but expenditures on structures and   inventories as well—the pickup in overall activity next year will be substantially attenuated      Chart 6 presents the broad contours of our outlook for the labor   market  As shown in the top left panel, we expect that, as firms shed the last vestiges of  the unusual caution of the past few years, they will continue to add significantly to their  payrolls, partly to relieve some of the pressures on workforces that currently appear to  be a bit overstretched  On our estimates, monthly increases in nonfarm payrolls will  average a little more than 300,000 jobs through the end of this year before tapering off  next year  As shown in the top right panel, one implication of relieving pressure on the  workforce is that productivity is likely to come back into closer alignment with its  structural trend  A consequence of the last few months’ worth of data is that the  discrepancy between the level of private employment reported in the establishment and  household surveys, as shown in the middle left panel, has largely closed  For reasons  that are not fully understood, the establishment survey tends to rise more on the upswing  of the business cycle and to soften more in the down phase  Nonetheless, having come  full cycle, so to speak, since 1994, the two measures are in close alignment, at least  momentarily  Even with a robust pace of hiring, we have the unemployment rate (the  middle right panel) remaining slightly above our estimate of the NAIRU throughout the  projection period, for two key reasons  First, as shown in the bottom left panel, we  expect that, as job opportunities continue to open up, the labor force participation rate  will move most of the way back toward its long-term average  Second, we expect that  the workweek (the bottom right panel) will continue its cyclical rebound  If either of  these developments were to fail to materialize, pressures on labor resources could be  more intense than we have assumed in the baseline  I will come back to this risk shortly     Your next chart turns to the issue of inflation  As illustrated in the top left panel, and   as you are all well aware, PCE price inflation has stepped up this year from the very low  rates registered last year, both for the overall index (the black line) and for the core (the  red line)  In recent months, the overall index—shown in the first column of the table to  the right—has been rising more quickly, on average, than the core, reflecting the direct  contributions from food and especially energy  The middle left panel decomposes core  PCE inflation, and highlights that the largest part of the pickup in core PCE inflation  during the first half of this year relative to the comparable period last year reflects the  development on line 3, namely faster inflation in the prices of goods other than motor  vehicles  As shown on line 2, firmer prices of motor vehicles also have contributed to  the acceleration this year, as have the prices of nonmarket-based services (line 6), most  notably the imputed price of banking services     The panel to the right takes a step away from pure arithmetic and attempts to   attribute the acceleration in the core index to some underlying causes  According to our   June 29-30, 2004 66 of 203          models, some of the pickup in core inflation this year can be attributed to the indirect  effects of higher energy prices  Another chunk, according to the models, can be  attributed to the acceleration of import prices, an attribution that seems consistent with  sizable contribution of goods prices shown in the left-hand panel  The remainder of the  pickup, shown on line 3, likely reflects the influence of a slowly narrowing margin of  slack and perhaps a diminishing productivity dividend, as well as the aforementioned  larger contribution from nonmarket-based services and a variety of other factors not well  captured by our models  As shown in the bottom left panel, commodity prices escalated  sharply through the early months of this year but have retreated somewhat in recent  weeks  We expect the pass-through of higher production costs already in train to  continue to boost core consumer price inflation through much of this year, before  beginning to reverse course around year-end  As shown to the right, near-term inflation  expectations, which tend to react to recent trends in overall consumer prices, have  stepped up noticeably in the last few months  Even so, longer-term expectations, shown  by the red line, thus far seem to have remained reasonably well anchored      Despite the recent upside surprises on the inflation front, our forecast continues to   anticipate that inflationary pressures will remain fairly well contained; chart 8 lays out  some of our thinking as to why this is so  As shown on line 1 of the table, we expect  overall PCE inflation over the next six quarters to run at a pace of about 1¼ percent  In  part, this reflects, as shown on line 3 and in the middle left panel, a partial unwinding of  the substantial run-up in energy prices last year and this  And as shown on line 5 and in  the middle right panel, we expect food price inflation to moderate, as farmers step up  their production in response to recent high prices  Moreover, we expect core PCE  inflation to edge back from its upswing in the first half of this year  A number of factors  combine to keep a lid on core inflation in our projection  a persistent, albeit narrowing,  margin of slack in labor and product markets; the good behavior of long-term inflation  expectations; and the pass-through of the more moderate turn of energy and import  prices into core inflation  That said, as Yogi Berra once remarked, “it’s tough to make  predictions, especially about the future”  With that in mind, the bottom right panel  shows 70 percent and 90 percent confidence intervals around our baseline forecast  As  you can see, the 70 percent interval around our forecast for inflation in 2005 extends  from ¾ percent on the low side to nearly 2½ percent on the high side, and the 90 percent  interval is correspondingly wider     One source of uncertainty in the outlook that has garnered a great deal of   commentary lately is the gap in resource utilization  Chart 9 turns to this topic  The  basic idea of this chart is to compare our benchmark measure of the gap—the difference  between our estimate of the NAIRU and the actual unemployment rate—with a number  of alternative indicators of the pressures on productive resources  In every panel, the  unemployment gap is plotted as the red line  For ease of plotting, all series in the chart  are standardized to have zero mean and standard deviation equal to 1, and all are  normalized so that high values indicate relatively intense pressures on productive  resources  The top two panels compare the unemployment gap with two alternative  measures from the labor market  In the panel on the left, the black line shows the  employment-to-population ratio  In the panel on the right, the black line shows the   June 29-30, 2004 67 of 203          Conference Board’s measure of whether survey respondents think that jobs are easy or  hard to get  These alternative measures from the labor market track the contour of the  unemployment gap very closely  Moreover, the latest readings on all three series are  right in line with the values that they registered in 1994—a time when labor still seemed  underutilized     The middle panels compare the unemployment gap with two alternative measures of   capacity utilization—the one on the left being the index produced here at the Board, and  the one on the right being the measure published by the Institute for Supply  Management  As we have noted on a number of occasions, the FRB series has, for  some time, been signaling considerable remaining slack in utilization rates in the  manufacturing sector  By contrast, the most recent reading on the ISM’s index of  capacity utilization seems to indicate much tighter conditions  We believe, however,  that this apparent tension reflects the fact that the ISM is measuring a different concept  than we are  In particular, in responding to the ISM survey, firms appear to take account  of the current availability—or lack thereof—of labor and materials  Accordingly, the  ISM series reflects short-term production bottlenecks  In contrast, we ask respondents to  focus on their maximum sustainable production given the capital in place and to assume  the availability of sufficient labor and materials      The bottom left panel compares the unemployment gap with the output gap, and   demonstrates that we continue to rely on the regularity of this relationship to inform our  assumption for the growth of potential GDP  Indeed, the recent—albeit small—errors in  Okun’s law were one factor in our reassessment of the current level of the output gap in  this forecast  The panel on the bottom right of the page steps outside the realm of gaps  and presents the Chicago Federal Reserve Bank’s National Activity Index  Despite the  fact that this series is an indicator of growth rather than the gap in resource utilization, I  present it here because Stock and Watson and some others have reported that it  outperforms the unemployment gap as a forecaster of inflation, though we have not met  with as much success  Clearly, though, the recent signals from the NAI have been much  hotter than the ones from the unemployment gap  The messages that I take away from  this chart are, first, that the bulk of the evidence suggests that some slack—even if only  a relatively slim amount—remains in the utilization of productive resources  Second,  not all plausible indicators sing in unison on this question, and we have to be open to the  possibility that actual pressures are quite different from those that we have assumed in  the baseline forecast  In other words, we are uncertain about our estimate of the gap in  resource utilization     Chart 10 examines the implications of that uncertainty for the inflation outlook, and   places “gap” uncertainty in perspective by comparing it with two other important  sources of uncertainty  Before delving into the specifics of this chart, let me sketch the  general approach  The idea of this chart is to decompose the Greenbook confidence  intervals that I showed earlier to give you a rough idea of where that uncertainty might  be coming from  For a variety of technical reasons, the decomposition here is partial,  not exhaustive, and most assuredly is less precise than it appears on this chart    June 29-30, 2004 68 of 203          Nonetheless, at least in broad strokes, we think it represents a reasonable first  approximation      The top pair of panels considers the implications of uncertainty pertaining to the gap   in resource utilization  Specifically, as outlined in the bullets in the top left panel, we  consider a confidence interval of plus or minus ½ percentage point around our baseline  NAIRU assumption, which we believe should encompass about two-thirds of the  probability mass  Then, as noted in the second bullet, we layer on top of that the  assumption of some coefficient uncertainty, equivalent to a plus or minus one standard  error band around the slope coefficient translating a given unemployment gap into its  implications for future inflation  As noted in the third bullet, we refer to the  combination of NAIRU uncertainty and coefficient uncertainty as “resource utilization  uncertainty”  The last step, then, is to have FRB/US tell us how important resource  utilization uncertainty might be in generating uncertainty in the outlook for inflation   The result of that exercise is plotted in the top right panel as the innermost cone, which  is shaded red  To put that uncertainty in perspective, I’ve plotted it against the same  Greenbook confidence intervals that I showed you earlier      The middle panels consider the implications of our uncertainty about energy prices    Again, two forms of uncertainty are considered—uncertainty about the prices  themselves and uncertainty about the pass-through into core price inflation  The striking  result here is that energy price uncertainty is an even greater source of uncertainty about  the outlook for inflation than is resource utilization uncertainty, according to FRB/US   Similarly, the bottom pair of panels considers the implications of our uncertainty about  import prices  And once again, the results from the model indicate that we should be at  least as concerned about this source of uncertainty as we are about uncertainty generated  by the gap in resource utilization      In sum, uncertainty about resource utilization is certainly not the only important   source of uncertainty about inflation over the next year or two, and it may not even be  the most important one  In part, this conclusion stems from the fact that we believe the  pass-through coefficient from changes in the unemployment gap to inflation is pretty  small  As well, it reflects the fact that the model thinks it knows that coefficient to  within plus or minus 30 percent or so  That combination of circumstances implies that  resource utilization uncertainty will have only limited implications for inflation  uncertainty  On the other hand, energy prices move a great deal, and so can leave a big  imprint on core inflation even with only a small pass-through coefficient      Your next chart takes a different approach to exploring uncertainty and summarizes   two scenarios from the Greenbook illustrating upside and downside risks to the inflation  outlook  These are the same two scenarios discussed in the Board briefing on Monday   In the first scenario, as you will recall from the Greenbook, we consider the possibility  that we are too optimistic about the supply side of the economy  Specifically, we  suppose that the NAIRU is 5¾ percent rather than 5 percent as in the baseline  projection, and we assume that the bounceback in the participation rate that I showed  you a few charts earlier will be only half as large  In addition, we allow long-term   June 29-30, 2004 69 of 203          inflation expectations to gradually rise 1 percentage point relative to baseline over the  forecast period  As shown by the dashed red line in the panel to the right, these  assumptions generate a markedly worse inflation outcome, assuming a fixed nominal  funds rate, with four-quarter core PCE inflation rising to about 2½ percent by the end of  next year      That said, we believe the inflation projection that we put forward in the Greenbook   has the risks well balanced on both sides  One of the downside risks that we see is  illustrated in the middle panel, which shows the markup of price over unit labor costs   The most recent readings on this variable have been the highest since at least the end of  the Second World War  And while our projection calls for the deviation of the markup  from its long-run average to narrow, it certainly could narrow by more and at a faster  pace  In particular, in the course of ramping up production, firms may bid up wages  faster than in the baseline  At the same time, competitive pressures may be so strong  that they more than offset the price effects of higher unit labor costs  In the alternative  scenario, we assumed that the markup moves halfway back to its long-term average   And as shown by the dashed red line in the bottom right panel, the downward pressure  on inflation of even a partial return along those lines over the next six quarters could be  quite powerful  Nathan Sheets will now continue our presentation       Your final chart displays your economic projections for 2004 and   2005  As shown in the top panel, the central tendency of your projections for the growth  of real GDP this year is only slightly different than it was at the February meeting, and  the central tendency for the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter is unrevised  For  inflation, no February comparison is available because this is the first time that you have  been asked to forecast core rather than overall inflation  For next year, your central   June 29-30, 2004 74 of 203          tendencies indicate a moderation in the pace of growth, a slight decline in the  unemployment rate, and little change in core PCE price inflation      As we have already noted, some important information became available after the   close of the Greenbook  In response to that information, the staff trimmed our  projection for real growth this year and lifted our forecast for core PCE price inflation   For reference, the figures in the final column—labeled “Staff”—pertain to this updated  projection rather than the Greenbook forecast  Over the next several days, you may  wish to consider whether to update your projection; if you decide to do so, we request  that you submit your revised forecasts to Dave Stockton and me by the close of business  on Friday of this week  We would now be pleased to take any questions you may have       We have a new specification of FRB/US that incorporates explicitly   forward-looking behavior in the setting of prices by firms  In a manner that’s often referred to as a   neoclassical synthesis, we have some sort of momentum-based or backward-looking influence on   price setting as well as some explicitly forward-looking behavior  That forward-looking behavior in   the wage–price block in FRB/US is rational in the sense that it’s model consistent within that three-  equation block  And roughly speaking, both are about equally influential  So if you thought about a   coefficient of 1 in the context of accelerating inflation, you’d have about half on the backward-  looking portion and about half on the forward-looking portion   With respect to constructing error bands, we wrestled with that issue fairly hard in putting   together the exhibit that explored uncertainty, and we decided not to do it because the markup itself   June 29-30, 2004 75 of 203          isn’t a fundamental variable in the model  It derives from and reflects a lot of other more   fundamental influences  The conclusion we arrived at was that, if we had shown you confidence   intervals that might be generated by markup uncertainty, we would have ended up sort of double-  counting sources of uncertainty  So in that framework it’s difficult to put a confidence interval   around uncertainty  More impressionistically, just eyeballing this chart suggests to me that there is a   lot of uncertainty about the future behavior of the markup  We’ve wrestled as well with whether   that variable is best thought of as a stationary variable that returns to a well-defined mean  You can   see from the chart in the middle panel in chart 11 that, depending on what sample period you chose   to draw the blue line, you would get a different number for the average to which it should be   returning  So I think in general there is a good deal of uncertainty surrounding the future behavior   of the markup even though we have a hard time actually quantifying it for you     No reasons come immediately to mind on why the main qualitative   findings of chart 10 wouldn’t hold true with respect to the CPI as well  Energy prices have an   important influence on core CPI     There are differences in weights, so I’m sure that there would be small   changes, but I can’t think of why qualitatively it wouldn’t be quite similar     That could be, through an expectations channel  As I noted with respect to   the channel in the bottom right corner of chart 7, that’s one of the reasons we think the Michigan   June 29-30, 2004 79 of 203          survey results for the short-term expectations have moved up as sharply as they have  It reflects the   inflation that individuals are experiencing    Right, but that was true even when we think prices really were increasing at   1½ percent!           Again, with reference to that panel in the bottom corner of chart 7, we   would expect to see short-term inflation expectations come back down as commodity prices and   energy prices moderate  When we run a very simple regression of this short-term inflation   June 29-30, 2004 80 of 203          expectation on some lagged values of actual top-line consumer price inflation, we can explain most   of the recent run-up in the Michigan survey on inflation expectations  So it looks about roughly in   line with what one would have expected, given historical experience and the influence of those   prices on the expectations that people report to the survey takers  If the energy-price moderation   that we anticipate comes to pass, we think those inflation expectations will come back down  We   view inflation expectations as a pretty important part of the dynamics and the challenge that you   confront as monetary policy makers  And we think one thing that’s making your job a little easier   than it would otherwise be is that longer-term inflation expectations haven’t moved up as yet  But   as everyone around this table is aware, the credibility associated with that is not something that can   be taken for granted     As will we     Let me try to give you some defensive content without the defensive   overlay     First of all, I think one way to phrase your question would be to say, How   sure are you that inflation is going to come back down?  I’d say that is about a 60–40 bet, which is   pretty close to even money  But given the range of those confidence intervals, I’m trying to point   out to the Committee that there’s a lot of uncertainty surrounding that question, in terms of how the   baseline will evolve  A second piece of evidence I would throw out comes down to essentially the   same observation  With regard to how well our models can account for the evolution of inflation,   we think an r2 for an equation for the change in inflation is something like 05  This means that half   of the variation is not explained by the econometric equation, imperfect as it is, even though we’ve   had a lot of time in the workshop to tinker with the models   Third, recognizing that there’s a wide error band around the baseline forecast, I still think   that, on balance, the considerations that went into the construction of the forecast make it a   somewhat better bet that inflation is going to moderate from here forward than pick up or stay the   same  Again, those considerations include the reversal of a number of factors that we believe to be   June 29-30, 2004 82 of 203          transitory, which were pushing inflation up in the first half of this year  We anticipate, as you note,   some continued modest downward pressure from resource utilization  We think we may see a little   benefit from a continuing solid productivity performance and the reversal of the trajectories for food   prices and import prices  So those are some of the factors that we think line up to make moderating   inflation a better bet, though not by a wide margin, than intensifying inflation     First, with respect to the two types of channels, I would like to underscore   that the decomposition that is presented here in this chart is partial  It is not an exhaustive   decomposition of all sources of uncertainty  In particular, one thing that we didn’t display was a   confidence interval associated with the error term  The reason is that the error term embeds so   June 29-30, 2004 83 of 203          many different influences, including inflation expectations, which President Moskow referred to,   commodity price pass-throughs that may occur through channels other than just energy prices,   competitive pressures, and regulatory influences  It’s the bucket into which everything in the “all   else” category goes  So I would not want to characterize our view as just two channels—gaps and   these other variables   On the absence of a speed effect, we looked pretty hard for a speed effect and disposed of a   lot of degrees of freedom in the statistical world in that search  We think there is a discernible speed   effect in the prices of items that are in relatively inelastic short-term supply  But for final core PCE   prices, we can’t find it  And we’re reassured in that by reference to some particular historical   episodes like the recovery from the very deep recession of 1980-82, when the unemployment rate   was rising very rapidly and yet inflation continued to decline  Now, if there were a strong speed   effect, it should have shown up during that period, and it didn’t  So we’ve looked hard on the   econometrics, and we’ve done some case studies, and neither approach leads us to think that there’s   much there   With respect to direct monetary influence—whether money itself shows up in inflation—we   think it’s important, but we think it’s important in setting the background factors that we believe   influence the inflation dynamics more fundamentally  We think that what monetary policy is doing   is altering the balance of factors like the gap and resource utilization, for example  When we have   moved to test a direct influence of money in our price equation, it’s a little like a mirage on the   highway  Sometimes it’s there a little bit, and sometimes it disappears  We can’t find a reliably   strong statistical relationship  So we think this is a good, albeit imperfect, framework to use for the   entire analysis   June 29-30, 2004 84 of 203            We think wages are being supported by the rapid productivity growth that   we’ve had over the last few years  We think that is adding a tenth this year, for example, compared   with last year and another couple of tenths next year  On the other hand, overall we don’t see ECI   compensation accelerating greatly  One of the influences on the ECI that we believe will hold it   down is health insurance costs, which we expect to contribute less to the rise in ECI this year  Also,   we actually think that in 2003 the growth of ECI was a little stronger than we could account for in   our models, and we project that that puzzle will go away So the balance of all those factors leaves   our projection just slightly flat this year compared with last year and up only a little next year    There are risks  One of the risks to that compensation projection, which we’ve highlighted, is the   decline in the markup  If workers bid more aggressively for their share of the pie than we built into   the baseline or if firms are more eager to ramp up their production than we’ve assumed, that   compensation trajectory could turn out to be too optimistic       In our alternative simulation for that market-based funds rate, we have the   ten-year Treasury bond rate coming up 20 basis points by the end of the forecast period     In the Greenbook we had nonfarm business productivity at 24 percent  A   quick update of that based on the information that we received on Friday and Monday would put it   at 19 percent     Unit labor costs are up 04, right     Thank you, Mr Chairman  A lot has changed since the June  Greenbook forecast was put to bed  Unfortunately, a lot has changed since the  August Greenbook was put to bed, too  [Laughter]  In particular, in the June  Greenbook, we forecasted that payroll employment gains would average about  300,000 per month in the second and third quarters of this year against a backdrop of  GDP growth averaging about 5 percent at an annual rate  By the end of this year, we  expected that the GDP gap would have narrowed to just ½ percent  By the time we  published the August Greenbook last week, we had tempered our growth assessment  substantially and had marked up our expectation for the GDP gap at the end of this  year to a full 1 percent  But we were still interpreting the June employment report  essentially as a one-time hiccup and were looking for employment gains going  forward only slightly smaller than we had projected in the June Greenbook  Then  came last Friday’s employment report, with its news of only a 32,000 advance in  private nonfarm payrolls, a downward revision to June employment of 51,000, and  only a 01 hour increase in the average workweek  Our misery over coming up short  nearly 300,000 jobs was only slightly alleviated by having so much company      So, as I said, a lot has changed  On the other hand, I should also underscore that a   lot has stayed the same  Even in the wake of Friday’s report, we still see overall  macroeconomic conditions as likely to support a return to above-trend growth—in  other words, growth that is sufficiently rapid to narrow the gap in resource utilization  over the next six quarters, even if only slowly and incompletely  While we have  taken quite a bit out of our forecasts for payroll employment increases in August and  September, we still have those increases tracking into the neighborhood of 300,000 in  the fourth quarter of this year  And in response to the employment report, we  trimmed our forecast for third-quarter GDP growth only 06 percentage point, from  39 percent in the Greenbook to 33 percent currently, on the theory that the deficit in  hours relative to our expectation informed us mainly about productivity in the current  quarter rather than output       In this connection, I should note there was one bright spot in Friday’s report,   namely that employment in the manufacturing sector looked, if anything, a little  better than we had expected  This is particularly encouraging in light of the fact that  manufacturing over the decades has been a fairly sensitive and reliable bellwether of  cyclical conditions  If a pronounced cyclical softening truly were under way, we  would have expected to see it in manufacturing employment, but it simply was not  evident in the numbers for July      Our outlook for inflation also falls in the category of “not much changed since the   June Greenbook”  The most recent CPI report was quite reassuring that the type of  moderation we were looking for seems to be in train  Indeed, the news was good  enough to cause us to shave our projection for core CPI inflation by a tenth both this  year and next  Because the BEA penciled in a faster pace of inflation in the so-called  non-market-based prices, we did not revise down our forecast for core PCE inflation  in line with the core CPI  Even so, however, we have core PCE inflation slowing  from 1¾ percent this year to 1½ percent next year, reflecting smaller contributions   August 10, 2004 10 of 103          from import, energy, and other commodity prices and now a slightly greater amount  of restraint from slack in resource utilization      But while a lot is still the same, enough has changed to make it more than fair to   ask, What on earth is going on?  Lest I spark any hope on your part that I’m about to  produce a fully satisfying explanation, let me assure you to the contrary  In point of  fact, we do not claim to suddenly understand everything that has happened in the last  few months; if we were that smart now, we probably would have been a little smarter  last week; and if we had been that smart last week, we certainly wouldn’t have hid it  so well from the Committee  [Laughter]  Unfortunately, the large-scale econometric  model that we often consult for insight on such issues shares our incomplete  understanding of the current situation  Indeed, that model, left to its own devices,  would have wanted to see an additional 2 percentage points of real GDP growth in the  second quarter, with much of it in PCE  Evidently, in order to provide a full  accounting of the recent weakness in aggregate demand, we will have to appeal to  some factor not captured by our conventional models  In light of the weakness of  consumer spending, factors bearing on the household sector will have special  standing  Let me list some of the possibilities     Hypothesis #1  Maybe it’s just noise  This hypothesis actually comes in two   variants  The first variant takes the view that the data may simply be sending the  wrong signal, not truly representative of macroeconomic reality  I certainly cannot  rule out this variant, and indeed, we had discounted the first disappointing report on  payroll employment, given the relatively encouraging recent readings on initial  claims for unemployment insurance and improving household perceptions of labor  market conditions  On the other hand, this variant seems less plausible in light of a  second consecutive disappointing labor market report as well as the June readings on  retail sales, motor vehicle sales, and industrial production, all suggesting that  something real happened toward the end of the second quarter  A second variant of  the noise hypothesis accepts the accuracy of the incoming data but questions the  persistence of the softness  Maybe we are just on a temporary detour away from  above-trend growth and shrinking margins of resource slack  We put some stock in  this variant as well, in part because we have been impressed by a number of the other  relatively encouraging indicators of demand in the third quarter, including the  rebound in motor vehicle sales, the strength in orders and shipments of capital goods,  and the relatively upbeat anecdotal information that we continue to receive from the  ISM and other business surveys, from the Beige Book, and from our own business  contacts  In addition, we continue to view the fundamental determinants of growth,  especially the stance of monetary policy—and, in the near term, the stance of fiscal  policy—as consistent with above-trend growth  On the other hand, we are operating  in an environment of considerable uncertainty, and a key possibility that we must  entertain is that something more fundamental is going on than just a temporary blip— something we don’t understand and that may persist     Hypothesis #2  Maybe it’s energy prices  Since June, the spot price of West   Texas intermediate has increased about $6 per barrel  Moreover, prices on long-dated   August 10, 2004 11 of 103          futures have undergone a stunning nearly vertical takeoff in the last few weeks   Certainly the hypothesis that higher energy prices are having a much more  pronounced restraining effect on activity than we had anticipated has to figure  prominently on our list of possibilities  Maybe the second surge in gasoline prices in  May and June caused households to reassess the outlook for energy prices and  suddenly to take on board a much larger hit to their purchasing power      To be sure, the timing of the most recent energy price spike is incriminating  But   how much of the recent shortfall in aggregate activity can we really lay at its  doorstep?  In a memo that we delivered to the Committee just before the June  meeting, we estimated that, all else being equal, the run-up in oil prices between  December and June might lop ½ percentage point off the growth of GDP this year  and a further tenth off growth next year  At that time, the spot price had risen about  $10 per barrel from its late-December level  Since June the spot price has increased  another $6 or so, suggesting that the total oil-related deduction from the growth of  GDP this year might amount to about ¾ percentage point—or roughly two-thirds of  the total downward revision to our GDP projection over that time     But while the price of oil is crucial for understanding the revision since the   December Greenbook to our projection for GDP growth this year, can it account for  the steep downward revision to GDP growth since the June Greenbook?  Here the  answer is murkier  By June, roughly two-thirds of the increase in oil prices had  already occurred and so should have been taken on board in the forecast we delivered  to the FOMC just before your two-day meeting  That suggests that the increase in oil  prices since then might account for a downward revision to our estimate of growth  this year of only about ¼ percentage point—only a fraction of the nearly 1 percentage  point revision that we have put through since the June Greenbook  On the other hand,  a number of factors counsel against drawing sharp conclusions  For one, our ability  to pinpoint the timing of an adjustment to higher oil prices probably is very limited   For another, we may not have sufficiently adjusted the June Greenbook projection to  the oil prices then already in view  And for a third, there is little doubt that our  formal econometric models omit potential channels of influence from oil to real  activity, and whether we have adequately compensated for those omissions in our  judgmental projection is not clear      All that said, the coincidence between the spike in oil prices and the air pocket in   spending seems too striking to write off to mere chance  So at this point, we are  thinking that energy prices almost surely are part of the explanation; we’re just not  sure how big a part      Hypothesis #3  Faltering fiscal stimulus  In the baseline projection, we have   been assuming that the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts are still supporting the growth of  consumer spending this year but by a gradually diminishing amount  On our  assumptions, these tax cuts boosted the growth of real PCE ¾ percentage point in the  first half of this year but will lift the growth of PCE in the second half by less than  ½ percentage point and will be essentially neutral for PCE growth in 2005  But here,   August 10, 2004 12 of 103          too, we have only limited ability to pinpoint the timing of adjustment, and this  hypothesis suggests the possibility that we should have attributed a larger fraction of  the strength in consumer spending earlier this year to short-lived tax-induced stimulus  and a smaller fraction to an underlying fundamentals-based thrust      In sum, we think these hypotheses contain some of the seeds of an explanation    Whether they constitute a full or only a partial explanation, whether we need to add to  our list, or whether we need to subtract from it, all remain to be seen  But as usual,  we will have to remain alert in coming months for clues that may shed further light on  the nature of the recent step-down in the growth of real activity  Karen will now  continue our presentation        Mr Chairman, another uncertainty that I’d highlight with respect to the   timing of how this plays out is that the sources of the increase in the price of oil may have a   different profile recently than was the case over the first half of the year  My sense qualitatively is   that strong world demand was perhaps more a front-loaded story in the first part of the year and that   supply concerns maybe have emerged as an issue later     May I just finish the thought?  The consequences for US activity could be   quite different, depending on the mix of supply and demand factors  If that mix changed over the   first and second halves of the year, it could add to the uncertainty about the timing that you were   highlighting in your comment, Mr Chairman    1  Thank you, Mr Chairman  We’ll be referring to the package of       material entitled “Considerations Pertaining to the Establishment of a Specific,  Numerical, Price-Related Objective for Monetary Policy”   As a prelude to your discussion this afternoon, Doug Elmendorf and I will  briefly summarize some of the main points made in the R&S [Research and  Statistics] staff paper that was distributed to the Committee  Then Vincent will  address the issues related to communications and governance that would arise were  you to define a numerical objective   As can be seen in the top panel of your first exhibit, inflation as measured by  any of the major indexes has been both low and stable by historical standards for the  last several years With the economy now operating in the neighborhood of price  stability, some analysts have pressed for more clarity and precision about your  ultimate objectives with respect to the price-related piece of your dual mandate   Others, however, have expressed serious reservations about moving away from what  they perceive to be a successful status quo The background paper discusses the  major issues the Committee would need to consider in determining whether to adopt  a specific, numerical, price-related objective     We view the key characteristics of such an objective, listed in the middle  panel, as the following First, it would be numerical rather than qualitative  Second,   1 The materials used by Messrs Wilcox, Elmendorf, and Reinhart are appended to this transcript (appendix 1)                             February 1-2, 2005 7 of 177  it would be stated in terms of a particular published index  And third, it would  involve a commitment to either inflation control or price-level control  To give  meaning to such an objective, the Committee would presumably aim to achieve it on  average over some extended period of time   As noted in the lower panel, a premise of the paper is that a price objective  should be chosen to minimize the costs of deviations from price stability  If you  share that premise, then you might conclude, as we did, that the objective should be  defined with respect to the price index most closely related to such costs  Such an  index need not be the best short-run indicator of underlying price trends  For  example, an overall price index might be a better gauge of the costs incurred as a  result of deviations from price stability—and therefore a better point of reference for  a medium-term price objective—even though a core index might be a better real- time indicator of underlying inflation  One counterargument to this view is that a  smoother measure of inflation would breach a band of any given width less  frequently and so would present the Committee with fewer communications  challenges This is true enough; we would simply note that the width of any band  would be a choice available to the Committee   In the paper, we underscored that we see the question of whether the  Committee should adopt a specific, numerical, price-related objective as distinct  from the question of whether it should adopt an inflation targeting regime  However,  even the more limited step of establishing an explicit price objective presumably  would involve important changes in the Federal Reserve’s relationships with the  public and the Congress—issues that will be addressed by Vincent in his remarks   Your second exhibit summarizes some of the potential benefits and costs of  adopting a specific, numerical price objective  On the benefits side, advocates  believe that publicly announcing such an explicit price goal could help preserve the  present commitment to price stability by raising an impediment to backsliding on the  part of some future FOMC   Second, announcing an explicit price objective could better anchor long-run  inflation expectations In turn, better-anchored expectations about future inflation  might reduce the volatility of current inflation through its effect on price-setting and  might reduce the volatility of real activity by giving the Federal Reserve greater  scope to offset shocks   Third, a specific objective could improve public understanding of monetary  policy, as the Committee took yet another step to increase the transparency of the  policy process And lastly, agreeing on an explicit price objective could help focus  policy debates within the FOMC by ensuring that everyone is aiming to accomplish a  common objective                          February 1-2, 2005 8 of 177  All that said, skeptics of a specific, numerical price objective argue that the  burden of proof should be on those who would disturb the status quo, and they see  several sources of potential harm  For one thing, if the Committee meant to preserve  the current balance of emphasis between price stabilization and activity stabilization,  then adopting an explicit objective for prices—but not for unemployment or  output—might mislead the public into believing that your emphasis had shifted  toward the price objective Second, pursuing such a course could, in fact, cause the  Committee inadvertently to place more emphasis on the price objective   A third potential cost could arise if your credibility were seen to be  diminished when inflation differed from the stated objective  Finally, a commitment  to an explicit price objective could constrain future actions of the FOMC in an  unhelpful manner  For example, the Committee might feel inhibited in responding as  aggressively as it would like to a financial crisis if inflation were already to the high  side of the Committee's objective   Unfortunately, empirical evidence on these potential costs and benefits is  quite limited, as summarized in the bottom panel  Little to no evidence exists  regarding the likely influence of a specific price objective on FOMC decisionmaking  or the quality of communications with the public   Evidence is also limited on whether an explicit price objective would  improve macroeconomic performance  As documented in the background paper  from the Division of International Finance and noted in the second bullet, there are  some hints from the foreign experience that specific price objectives have helped  anchor long-term inflation expectations  However, survey-based expectations  measures have been quite stable in the United States of late, so expectational gains  from adopting a specific price objective are not guaranteed and probably would be  modest if they did occur  Moreover, the foreign experience does not speak clearly as  to whether better-anchored expectations have yielded better macroeconomic  performance   A key question on the empirical front is whether an explicit price objective  would change the way that private agents form their expectations  Insight into this  question might be gained by investigating whether the profound change in the  conduct of monetary policy over time in the United States has induced changes in the  formation of inflation expectations  Unfortunately, the evidence on this point is  disputed, as noted in the third bullet Some analysts attribute the reduced volatility  of inflation and real output in recent decades to the changes in monetary policy, but  other analysts point to different factors   Faced with such limited empirical evidence, some researchers have turned to  model simulations for help in gauging the possible consequences of changes in  monetary policy  Simulations of the FRB/US model, among others, indicate that  better-anchored inflation expectations would reduce the volatility of inflation and                           February 1-2, 2005 9 of 177  real output However, this result is admittedly sensitive to the assumptions  underlying the specification of these models   In summary, then, we concur with our colleagues in the International Finance  Division in reading the evidence as suggesting that adoption of a numerical price  objective probably would not yield either large benefits or large costs, relative to the  conduct of monetary policy in recent years  Unfortunately, we also see that evidence  as incapable of resolving the question of whether such a step would generate net  benefits or costs on a more modest scale  That leaves us believing that the most  relevant and important issues for the Committee to discuss may be ones that only you  can adequately assess On the plus side, the extent to which an explicit objective  may aid your internal dynamics by ensuring that everyone is pulling toward a  common objective and may facilitate your communication with financial markets,  and, on the minus side, the extent to which such an objective may skew the priorities  you assign to the two legs of your mandate     As you know from the Greenbook and as is shown in the upper  left panel of exhibit 4, the unemployment rate is currently just a tenth of a percentage  point above our estimate of the NAIRU  To put the matter delicately, however, the  most impressive aspect of our estimate of the NAIRU may be the imprecision of it   According to one representative econometric equation, a 70 percent confidence  interval around the point estimate of the NAIRU extends 2 full percentage points  from top to bottom  Accordingly, one might reasonably ask whether any evidence  can be marshaled to corroborate our view that a smidgeon of slack still remains in the  labor market   The upper right panel presents one such bit of evidence  As shown by the black  line, the participation rate has declined a percentage point over the past five years  To  be sure, the model that we use to analyze movements in the participation rate writes  off part of that decline as reflecting trend demographic developments, summarized by                         June 29-30, 2005 81 of 234  the red line But the larger part of the overall decline, according to the model, reflects  a swing from a participation rate that was above its trend level through the late 1990s  to one that has been below its trend level the last few years  On our interpretation,  conditions in the labor market were sufficiently uninviting to cause some workers to  take themselves out of the workforce  But as job opportunities continue to improve,  these workers will be available to rejoin the labor force—and will do so in great  enough numbers to hold the participation rate steady despite a declining trend   The middle left panel shows a broad measure of conditions in the labor market—  total hours worked relative to trend This measure combines the effects of the  unemployment gap, the participation rate gap, and the gap in the workweek relative to  its trend, not shown but currently about zero  As you can see from the chart, total  hours worked remain a little below the estimated trend despite the recent gradual  improvement in labor market conditions   The idea that some labor market slack remains is corroborated by a few other  indicators For example, as shown in the middle right panel, individuals still perceive  jobs as somewhat harder to get than they were in the first half of 1997, when labor  markets seemed roughly to be in equilibrium  Similarly, as shown in the lower left  panel, the NFIB [National Federation of Independent Business] reports that small  businesses still are not encountering quite as much difficulty filling positions as they  did in the first half of 1997 I should also note that a few other indicators suggest that  the labor market is at least as tight as it was in early 1997  For example, as shown in  the lower right panel, the percent of employed people working part-time for economic  reasons has fallen below its average over the first half of 1997   That said, we still see the balance of evidence as suggesting that a little slack  remains in the labor market, but that the margin is narrow, and narrower today than it  was six months or a year ago  Moreover, such slack as may still exist will, on our  projection, essentially be taken up over the course of the next year and a half   Other things equal, in the past, labor market slack has restrained the growth of  nominal compensation and thus has helped to keep price pressures in check as well   And yet, as shown in the upper left panel of exhibit 5, compensation per hour as  measured in the BLS’s [Bureau of Labor Statistics] Productivity and Cost [P&C]  system soared more than 10 percent in the fourth quarter of last year and posted  another hefty increase in the first quarter of this year  As shown by the black line to  the right, even on a four-quarter basis, the growth of compensation per hour has  picked up sharply in the last two quarters, raising the question as to whether  underlying compensation pressures are building and whether they may be feeding  price inflation   We think not, for two main reasons First, as shown by the blue line in the upper  right panel, the other main indicator of compensation trends, the ECI [Employment  Cost Index], has actually been decelerating slightly since mid-2003, suggesting that  the compensation situation may be a good deal less alarming than one might conclude                                 June 29-30, 2005 82 of 234  based on the P&C measure alone  Second, we diagnose the recent bulge in  compensation per hour as having been influenced by a spike in stock option exercises,  which we think have little bearing on firms’ pricing decisions  Indeed, the last time a  bulge of this sort occurred in comp per hour, in 2000, core PCE price inflation—the  red line in the upper right panel—responded little if at all     The middle left panel reviews some of the considerations that lead us to implicate  option exercises in this matter  For now, in the interest of time, I will only touch on  the first and most obvious factor, namely, that option exercises are included in P&C  compensation per hour but not in the ECI  The attribution of a sizable portion of the  spike in comp per hour to option exercises is important, because growth in that form  of compensation is not likely to persist at its fourth-quarter pace   Indeed, to that point, the middle right panel summarizes our outlook for the  growth of compensation per hour As shown on line 1 of the table, we have the four- quarter change in P&C comp per hour coming back down sharply this year, as about  half of last year’s fourth-quarter spike is unwound  As shown on line 2, we have ECI  compensation per hour moving up along a smoother trajectory, pushed up by the  gradual tightening of labor markets, the continued pass-through of increases in  structural productivity to real wages, and the lagged effects of higher consumer price  inflation last year and this year Overall, on our numbers, the growth of  compensation will be moderate enough to allow a gradual deceleration in core  consumer prices from here forward while still permitting firms to maintain the  markup of prices over unit labor costs (not shown) noticeably above its average over  the past 35 years   But we could be wrong about all of that, and the bottom two panels illustrate the  potential consequences of a misjudgment on our part  As outlined in the lower left  panel, we sketched an alternative scenario in the Greenbook in which hourly  compensation increases 1 percentage point faster than in the baseline over the  remainder of this year and next  In addition, we assumed that firms have sufficient  pricing power to protect their profit margins, and are able—by the end of the scenario  —to return the markup to its baseline value  As shown by the dashed red line to the  right, the resulting boost to core PCE price inflation is substantial  By the end of  2006, core inflation is running at a 3 percent annual rate and headed further north  from there   While we view a compensation-led spiral as a risk to the outlook, we do not see  compensation as having been a major source of the recent upward creep in core  inflation But if not compensation, then what?   The top left panel of exhibit 6 steps back and reviews the scope of the recent run- up in core PCE price inflation  The red line in this panel shows the evolution over the  past 18 months of our forecast for core PCE inflation during 2004  As shown by the  leftmost point on that line, back in December 2003 we forecasted that core PCE  prices would increase about 11 percent over the course of 2004  As shown by the                                June 29-30, 2005 83 of 234  peak in the red line, by August of last year, we had marked our forecast up, on net,  about ¾ percentage point, to 18 percent  Thus far, in any event, that August forecast  has proved to be a little too pessimistic; as shown by the rightmost point on the red  line, our latest estimate—which now simply tracks the published figure for 2004 from  the BEA—is 16 percent   The blue line similarly tracks the evolution of the forecast for 2005  There, as  you can see, the upward revision in our forecast has been more pronounced  As  shown by the rightmost point on the blue line, the current Greenbook calls for core  PCE inflation to come in this year at 21 percent  As shown by the green line, we did  not begin providing a forecast of inflation in 2006 until last September’s Greenbook,  but since then, that forecast has followed a similar upward trajectory  So what has  been going on?   The panel to the right provides half of the answer  As you are well aware, oil  prices have surprised both us and the rest of the world greatly to the upside  As you  can gauge from the vertical distance between the dotted blue line at the bottom and  the dashed black line at the top, the forecast implicit in oil futures contracts back in  December 2003 for oil today was too low by about $30 per barrel   But other developments have worked in the same adverse direction  As shown in  the panel to the middle left, the PPI for core intermediate materials prices also has  risen considerably faster than we expected as of a year and a half ago, and is expected  to continue along its current higher trajectory  Similarly, import prices (shown to the  right) have risen faster, on net, than we expected in December 2003, even though  events have unfolded a little more favorably than we had expected as of December  2004   The table in the lower left panel traces through the implications of these  developments for our inflation outlook  As shown on line 1, between December 2003  and last week’s Greenbook, we’ve revised up our estimate of core PCE inflation in  2004 by 05 percentage point, on net, and have marked up our forecast for inflation  this year 1 percentage point  Lines 2 and 3 show that the deterioration in the oil  outlook can account for about half of the upward revision in both years, while  import  and materials prices can account for nearly all of the rest, leaving only a small  amount, line 4, to be explained by other factors  We take some comfort from this  result because we expect the upward impetus from the sources represented on lines 2  and 3 to prove transitory   As shown in the table to the lower right, as those transitory influences wane, we  expect the inflation picture to improve  For this year, as you know, we have topline  inflation (line 1) coming in at 2½ percent again, little different from last year, before  dropping back to 1¾ percent next year, under the influence of the swing in energy  prices And, as shown on line 4, we have core PCE inflation stepping up ½  percentage point this year before moderating slightly next year                              June 29-30, 2005 84 of 234  Given that oil prices have surprised so much to the upside, one might have  expected our projections for the growth of real GDP to have been marked down  substantially of late But, as shown in the upper left panel of exhibit 7, that has been  only partly true   This panel does for the growth of real GDP what the one from the preceding  exhibit did for core PCE inflation Thus, the red line shows the evolution of our  projection for real GDP growth over the four quarters of 2004  As shown by the  steadily sinking portion of that line, which paralleled the feeling we had in our  stomachs at the time, we marked down our projection for the growth of real activity  substantially as the bad news came in during the first two-thirds of 2004  By contrast,  our projections for 2005 and 2006 have been remarkably stable  How could this have  been so?   The panel to the upper right shows that the increases in oil prices relative to what  we had assumed in the December 2003 Greenbook in fact were, on our estimates, a  major negative for the growth of real GDP both last year and this  As shown by the  red line, we estimate that oil price increases trimmed half a percentage point from the  growth of real GDP in 2004 And, as shown by the blue line, they will cut nearly a  percentage point from the growth of real GDP in 2005   Clearly, oil price effects can be only part of the explanation, because they fail to  explain the full extent of the disappointment in 2004 and they explain too much in  2005 The middle left panel fills part of the gap  As you will recall all too clearly,  our estimates as to the influence of the partial expensing provision proved rather wide  of the mark  As shown by the declining height of the bars marked “2004,” over the  course of the past year and a half, we have progressively trimmed our estimate of  fiscal impetus in 2004, explaining another 02 percentage point of our overall  downward revision By the same token, the bars marked “2005” show that the  patching of the pothole plus some unanticipated defense spending have added to the  projected growth of real GDP this year   The table to the middle right summarizes the net effect of these two influences   As shown on lines 2 and 3, the increase in oil prices and the reduction in fiscal  stimulus can explain about half of the shortfall in 2004 growth relative to our  projection on the eve of the year The remaining 07 percentage point was a puzzle in  real time, and largely remains so today   For 2005, the parsing-out exercise yields a tidier result  By our lights, oil prices  were indeed a big negative, but that negative was almost completely offset by our  miss on the partial expensing provision  Without doubt, other influences have been  bearing on the growth of real GDP but, conveniently, they happen to net to zero in the  arithmetic for 2005   One implication of this exercise is that the underlying growth of demand—  supported, to be sure, by low interest rates and appreciable gains in housing and stock                        June 29-30, 2005 85 of 234  market wealth—has been pretty robust  Looking ahead, we expect oil to remain a  negative for the level of real GDP, but not to any great degree for its rate of growth  going forward Thus, if oil prices flatten out, as we assume, we would expect the  relatively robust pace of underlying demand to show through to topline growth   The table at the bottom of the page summarizes our outlook for the growth of real  GDP As shown on line 1, for this year and next, we expect real GDP growth to  average about 3½ percent per year This growth rate is close to our estimate of the  rate of growth of potential, so (as shown on line 7) the output gap closes only a little  from its current level of about 1 percent  Throughout the projection period, domestic  final sales are the key driver of aggregate demand, supported by interest rates that  remain quite low  Net exports (line 5) subtract a little less from the growth of  aggregate demand this year, but resume their more substantial pace of erosion next  year Inventory investment (line 6) is expected to be about neutral for real growth  this year and next     I think there would be something to be said for that  As I look at these   indicators, I see profiles that look very similar across the six panels, and so—     Well, our interpretation has been that the labor force participation rate,   shown in the upper right panel, has been sending a little different signal from the unemployment   rate over the last year or so  That the participation rate—whose sources we understand   imperfectly— declined suggests that there is a little more productive capacity remaining or more of                          June 29-30, 2005 92 of 234  an underutilization of labor resources than one would infer from the upper left panel on the   unemployment rate     As I look at the upper right panel, I see two indicators that seem to be   swinging around each other  P&C comp per hour had been a little to the soft side of the ECI for a   time and then it moved a little to the high side of that  I don’t have a particular story for the change   in the profile from earlier     No     I think that’s correct      Well, in a sense, we’re carrying two sets of books  And this mystery isn’t   going to get unwound for quite some time because it won’t be until August that the UI   [unemployment insurance] data are incorporated for the first quarter, and that will give us the   beginnings of a read on whether we were right or not       Our understanding is that they’ve taken down a wedge—to run off some of   that—but we think it’s going to come down a lot more in the final statistics     That’s exactly right  I have here the quarterly pattern that we have written   down for comp per hour, and I’d be happy to give it to you  It’s a little misleading because what   we’ve done is assumed that that runoff is going to happen over the course of 2005     That’s correct That’s when the UI data will be incorporated for the first   quarter                                June 29-30, 2005 94 of 234    You’re correct  In our analysis, these are the key drivers, in terms of the   factors that are shaping the contour of—     No, that’s correct  In terms of the factors contributing to the deceleration in   core PCE price inflation between 2005 and 2006, what I’ve shown here—energy prices, import   prices, and these other relative prices that I’ve chosen to proxy by the intermediate materials   prices—are taking off somewhere between ¼ and ½ percentage point from core PCE inflation, in   our estimation  At the same time, we think that some of the past increases that have occurred have                                June 29-30, 2005 95 of 234  gotten built into the structure of inflation a bit  Whether one labels that “inflation expectations” or   “inflation momentum,” it is awfully hard to disentangle  As for productivity, we think that it’s   mainly structural productivity that matters for firms’ pricing decisions, not fluctuations in actual   quarter-by-quarter productivity  So we have that as essentially a neutral influence on inflation over   the projection period  The fact that we tie pricing decisions to structural productivity developments   rather than actual productivity may be what is colliding with your intuition     This chart is trying to get at exactly that sort of iterative process of a futures   market that, meeting by meeting, ratcheted up its expectation of oil prices, as illustrated in the upper   right-hand panel And yet, meeting by meeting, the futures market—and we along with it—figured   that oil prices would level out from that point forward  Sometimes, for our inflation outlook, the   absence of a negative is a positive—in the sense that with oil prices not moving up further in our   projection, we don’t have that upward impetus     I agree with that, but the profile of oil prices is markedly different now,   with an extraordinary skyrocketing of the far-dated futures  One of the most amazing developments   over the last—     It’s illustrated in Mike Leahy’s exhibit 15, on the chart in the middle left   panel There has been a marked change in the relationship between near-dated and far-dated   futures     But the risk that you are pointing to, President Santomero, is illustrated in   the middle right panel  That shows the step-up from the trajectory in the December 2003   Greenbook (the dotted blue line) to the December 2004 Greenbook (the dotted red line)  Now, as it   happens, the revision to the outlook since December 2004 is a little to the favorable side in terms of   US inflation performance, as shown by the downshift from the dotted red line to the dashed black   line So there is risk I think Mike’s point is that we think we have the risks reasonably balanced    The risks are two-sided  So we could be coming back to you with an exhibit 6 that would have a   figure in the lower left that was revised down or revised up from the 04 of a percentage point  It’s   not a one-way risk; that’s the point      Thank you, Mr Chairman A corollary to Murphy’s law is  that the biggest forecast errors on an employment report always occur when the  report comes between Greenbook publication day and the FOMC meeting   [Laughter] Last year, in an event that undoubtedly is seared more into my  memory than yours, the corollary held true  This year, in the biggest surprise of  all, there was no surprise, and I am in the unexpected position of being able to  report that the August Greenbook forecast has survived the incoming data a  grand total of five days and counting In that regard, I should note that this  morning’s release on productivity and costs came in very much in line with our  expectations   A colleague correctly observed that there are a lot of moving pieces in this   forecast, so I thought you might find it helpful for me to review what some of   those pieces are    The first has to do with the implications of the annual revision to the   national income and product account [NIPA] data  As you know, the BEA   [Bureau of Economic Analysis] took down its estimate of the level of real GDP   in the fourth quarter of 2004 by 09 percent  In response, we moved down our   estimate of potential GDP by an identical amount  Thus, all else equal, we   would have shown the same GDP gap at the end of 2004 in this Greenbook as   we did in the June Greenbook                                   August 9, 2005 14 of 110  But not quite all else was equal In work unrelated to the NIPA revisions,  we refined our model of the labor force participation rate so that we could  extend our estimate of the trend in that variable backward in time on a  methodologically consistent basis  As it happened, those refinements to the  model steepened the downward tilt in the trend by enough to subtract a couple  of additional tenths from the level of potential GDP by the end of last year,  leaving the GDP gap at 09 percent rather than the 11 percent that we had  shown in the June Greenbook   The second moving piece has to do with the growth of potential GDP going  forward One implication of the revision to the national income accounts is that  the capital stock is likely to grow more slowly over the forecast period than we  had earlier believed Accordingly, capital deepening should make a smaller  contribution to the growth of potential GDP; indeed, we have cut that  contribution by a quarter of a percentage point this year and next  So on the  supply side, the basic summary is this a slightly smaller gap as of the end of  2004, and somewhat slower growth of potential GDP going forward   The third moving piece has to do with the demand side  We read the data  that were released during the intermeeting period as suggesting that the  economy has somewhat more forward momentum in the near term than we had  anticipated in the June Greenbook  You might not know it from top-line real  GDP growth in the second quarter, which was only about a quarter of a  percentage point stronger than we had anticipated, but the composition of  growth pointed to greater strength In particular, inventory investment stepped  down much more sharply in the second quarter than we had expected  As best  we can tell, most firms outside the motor vehicle industry are satisfied with their  current inventory positions, and so will see no need to pare the pace of  inventory investment to anywhere near the same degree as they did during the  first half of the year If they manage to maintain their inventory investment at  the second-quarter pace—as is anticipated in our forecast—they will, at one and  the same time, keep the inventory-sales ratio moving down in line with its long- term trend and add more than a percentage point to the acceleration of real GDP  between the second and third quarters   The underlying pace of final sales also looks a little stronger to us now than  at the time of the June Greenbook, but not by much  A good deal of the second- quarter surprise was in net exports, and we do not expect that unanticipated  strength to be carried forward As for domestic final demand, the second- quarter surprise was very modest  To be sure, the recent pace of motor vehicle  sales is eye-popping, but the bulk of that demand is being met out of  inventories And, in any event, we have assumed that the piper will have to be  paid as far as those sales are concerned  Despite the extension of the employee  discount programs, we have sales dropping back in August and September from  the 20 million rate reached in July—on the theory that many consumers                                  August 9, 2005 15 of 110  probably believed the automakers the first time around when they said the  discount offers would expire—and we have the payback continuing into the  fourth quarter Aside from net exports and motor vehicle sales, our outlook for  private domestic final demand is hardly revised, on net, over the last three  quarters of this year   A fourth moving piece has to do with inflation  The information we  received during the intermeeting period presented a mixed picture relative to our  expectation in the June Greenbook On the one hand, the most recent readings  on core market-based PCE [personal consumption expenditures] price inflation  have been encouraging, and they have caused us to mark down our estimate of  inflation in this category ½ percentage point in the second quarter and nearly  that much in the third quarter  On the other hand, we have a good deal more  energy price inflation in this projection, which contributes directly and in full  force to the overall PCE inflation rate, and seeps through as well—to the tune of  01 percentage point—into core inflation next year  And we also have less  restraint in this projection from any gaps in resource utilization  On balance,  though, we see these factors as fighting each other to a draw, leaving our  projection for core market-based inflation unrevised from the last Greenbook   However, that was not the end of the inflation story  A consequence of the  annual revision was that nonmarket prices now are on a steeper upward  trajectory than before In our projection, we have assumed that inflation in this  component will average roughly 3 percent going forward, rather than 2 percent  as we had assumed in the June Greenbook  Because this component has a  weight of 20 percent in the core PCE price index, the increment of 1 percentage  point to the rate of growth of this component in our projection adds  02 percentage point to our projection for core PCE inflation   The last moving piece has to do with monetary policy  Against the  backdrop of somewhat slower growth of aggregate supply, greater near-term  thrust in aggregate demand, and a somewhat higher rate of inflation in core PCE  prices, we shifted up the assumed trajectory for the funds rate 50 basis points  essentially throughout the forecast period  On our current assumptions, we have  the funds rate leveling out at 4¼ percent in the middle of next year  Evidently,  private-market participants share at least some of the same reactions to the  incoming data, as they have marked up funds rate futures prices by almost  exactly the same amount   The adjustment to the policy assumption was important for presenting you  with a forecast broadly consistent with your policy objectives Had we left the  funds rate assumption unchanged at its June trajectory, output would have been  above its potential in 2006 and 2007, and core inflation would have been  running at 22 percent in those two years, and edging up rather than down                               August 9, 2005 16 of 110  One of the many questions confronting you is how you should react to this  change in the inflation outlook Are inflation pressures unchanged, on net, from  last time, as indicated by our outlook for the core market-based component?  Or  are they more intense than before, as indicated by our outlook for the official  core PCE price index including the nonmarket component, and the overall PCE  index?  It seems to me that the answers to these questions depend on what you  are trying to control, and the time frame over which you seek to impose that  control   If you see yourselves as controlling the overall PCE price index, and you  aim to bring that measure back into line with your policy objective within a  small number of years, then you would probably regard inflation pressures as  having worsened since the June Greenbook, mostly because of the greater direct  contribution of energy prices to top-line inflation, but also because of the faster  pace of increase of nonmarket prices     At the other extreme, if you see yourselves as controlling the core market- based index, then you would probably judge no material change to have taken  place in inflation pressures since the June Greenbook, based on the simple  observation that our outlook for this measure of inflation has not been revised   Perhaps the toughest case is the intermediate one, in which you see  yourselves as controlling core PCE inflation, including its nonmarket  component  In this case, if you regard the nonmarket component as bearing no  relationship to reality, then you might insulate your policy from the change in  BEA methodology by marking up your target inflation rate by 02 percentage  point—equivalent, in effect, to controlling the market-based component  On the  other hand, if you think the nonmarket price index might convey some useful  information—perhaps not from quarter to quarter or even from year to year, but  at least over the intermediate term—then you would probably be inclined to  adopt a tighter monetary policy in response to the change in measurement  methodology  This is the assumption implicit in the Greenbook   One last point on which I should be clear On our estimates, the monetary  policy assumption we adopted for purposes of this Greenbook is sufficiently  restrictive to keep actual and potential output in approximate balance and to put  core PCE inflation, even including the upward-revised nonmarket component,  on a slightly downward-sloping trajectory Indeed, as best we can tell, 4¼  percent on the funds rate is slightly more than enough, in the long run, to keep  inflation heading downward, and after a few years at that level, the funds rate  could be brought back down to 4 percent  This is not a monetary policy that  acquiesces, in the long term, to inflation continuing to run at 2 percent, but  rather aims to nudge it down, little by little, into the neighborhood of 1½  percent In this respect, the monetary policy in the current Greenbook is very  similar to the one in the June Greenbook  In both cases, policy nudged the                                            August 9, 2005 17 of 110  inflation rate down to 1½ percent; but also in both cases, many years were  required before that lower level was attained     Karen Johnson will continue our presentation      It’s about 20 percent     It is a very big number  These nonmarket elements are, I think, by   definition not included in the CPI     Well, owners’ equivalent rent for this purpose is defined as a market   component even though it, too, was imputed by the BEA  In general, our clear preference is for   the weighting scheme embodied in the PCE price index as opposed to the consumer price index    We think that gives a more realistic portrayal of the market basket     They are  For better or for worse, the fact is that they mostly have the   character of correcting something that involved either an error or a miscommunication  In one   case, it was clearly just a coding error in the computer code for medical services  In the other   case—which the BEA doesn’t quite portray as an error—it was an errant trend apparently   introduced by some miscommunication between a supervisor and an employee   So now that has been brought into line A certain price for noncommercial banks, I think,   had been dropping at 10 percent per year and now it is rising slightly  So that alone contributes   about ¼ percentage point to the upward revision in the core measure for 2004  So these are very   big, very quantitatively important revisions       I’m absolutely certain that their hope is that any revisions will be for   reasons other than error detection  They will bring on board new source data and new                                  August 9, 2005 21 of 110  information of all sorts  We’re not expecting anything again that would involve revisions of this   magnitude     I don’t think we are seeing any slippage or deterioration in price   pressures Maybe the most direct piece of evidence on that is just that the last couple of readings   on the CPI have come in to the good side of our expectation  I think that’s the best summary   statistic I can cite From the orders contacts that we have in the business community, for   example, I don’t think we’re noticing a marked intensification of price pressures either   It is true that in the national income accounts the markup of price over unit labor cost was   revised down just a bit, but we don’t lean on that very heavily in our inflation analysis  So, I’d   say the fact that the market-based inflation news has been to the good side of our expectation is   probably the best summary statistic that I can give you     I can’t think of any reason off the top of my head for the confidence   band to have changed We certainly perceived no asymmetry in the risks  We’ve gone to   enormous effort this time, as always, to present to you a forecast with balanced risks  I don’t see   any reason why the width of our confidence band should have narrowed or widened  I suppose   I’m going to fall into a common conceptual error here, but I guess I would say that the   uncertainty around the oil price projection might be even greater now than average  But I hear                                  August 9, 2005 23 of 110  echoes in my brain saying, “You know, now is a particularly uncertain time,” and I never hear   anybody ever saying, “Now is a particularly certain time”  [Laughter] Nevertheless, if I were   going to point to something that would widen the confidence intervals, it may be the oil situation,   but I don’t find that a very compelling piece of evidence     No, it doesn’t because in our inflation models, the output gap enters   linearly So it has the same effect at the margin, whether it’s 07, as it was at the end of the   projection last time around, or 01 as it is this time  We are very uncertain about what the actual   magnitude of that output gap is, but the fact that our point estimate is at 01 percent rather than   07 percent doesn’t materially change our uncertainty about the inflation outlook  It would if we   perceived some kind of a threshold effect—if, when output moved above potential, we saw that   as igniting inflation pressures in a nonlinear way  But we’ve looked over the years and haven’t   found any compelling evidence of a nonlinear effect of that kind     Well, I think the best metaphor for the way we take this measure of the   output gap into account is that we view it as a barometer  It’s an indicator of pressure  At any   given moment in the economy there are going to be sectors and regions that have more pressure   than others So if the output gap is well constructed, what it should be showing is that as actual   output gets into the neighborhood of and perhaps even exceeds potential, in general average   pressures will be rising So the average upward impetus on inflation will be increasing, but—                                               August 9, 2005 24 of 110    There used to be a view—I’m thinking back to the Brookings 1960s   view—of an L-shaped supply curve     I’ll give you J  [Laughter] You know, our ability to detect these kinds   of things in the aggregate data is not very good, especially against—     Just to be clear, we don’t see potential as a sort of physical maximum     It’s a measure of the sustainable rate of output which can be maintained   with all other factors either contributing to inflation or deducting from inflation so that   productive capacity isn’t itself lending any impetus up or down to inflation  That’s not to say   that output can’t transitorily go above potential  It’s not to suggest that producers have met their   physical capacity—their limit on production     That’s a very deep question, and I think the answer—     If we could engage in a little Orwellian history, I think what we would   prefer to do is to go back and revise our old estimate of the bias in inflation  We might maintain   our estimate  Or we might say, “Oh, there was something in the data that I didn’t understand   before so if I thought the upward bias was 09 percent, maybe I should have thought it was only   07 percent”     Having made this correction, if you thought the bias was X before, not   knowing about the mistakes in the—     Yes, you should still think it’s X     While I agree with every aspect of what you said, where one is left at the   end of the day is with a difficult question as to how to judge truth  In the case of gasoline, we   can go out and conduct an independent sample of the price of gasoline at filling stations around   the country, and we can assess whether the measurement methodology leads to a bias in the CPI   relative to what individuals are actually experiencing in their day-to-day purchases  But the very   essence of these components we’re talking about is that it’s vastly more difficult, maybe even   impossible, to do any kind of benchmark study to know whether we have the measurement right                           August 9, 2005 28 of 110  I’m very confident that in the revised version of the national income accounts the measurement   is better But whether it’s right or not now is impossible to say     That’s exactly correct Yes     I can point to two main factors  One is simply the aging of the   population The baby boom cohorts are moving into an age of lower participation rates     No     People my age and older are moving into lower participation rate   categories That alone, on our estimates, has been taking about a tenth of a percentage point off                       August 9, 2005 29 of 110  the trend participation rate per year since 2002 So that’s the predominant factor  The other   factor that we think we see is a leveling off in the participation rate of women  Whereas earlier   in the postwar period the participation rate of women had been rising strongly, we believe that   has ended So those two factors are the major driving forces     Well, we think that participation rate was above the trend  Let me set   the facts first The actual participation rate was about trendless from 1990 through 2000  We   have the trend in our new model running at about 666 or so through that period, including   through the late 1990s We have the participation rates in the years from 1996 through 2000   running above trend     Correct—at its peak Then, as the economy softened and came into the   recession in 2001, the participation rate first came back to its trend  Subsequently, through the   period from 2002 through 2004, it softened and went below trend  In our projection, going   forward we anticipate the actual participation rate to hold about flat; and the participation rate   gap in our projection is closed because we have the trend coming down to meet the actual     So, it’s true that this decline in the trend is an important feature of our   outlook for the labor market     As with all econometric estimates, we do have a range of uncertainty    On our estimates, the trend participation rate now is 663 percent, which is just a couple of tenths   above its current level Our reading of the article that was published in your Bank’s Review is   that Katharine Bradbury’s estimates run from 668 at the low end and up to 68  By the way, for   reference you could look at page 3 in Part 2 of the Greenbook, if you have a copy of that     Our confidence interval, if we were to state it, perhaps would run up to   67 If we were really stretching, maybe we could see a trend participation rate in the   neighborhood of 67 I, frankly, find that a little hard to believe, given the strength of the   demographic forces that we think we see pushing down the trend participation rate by about 01   percent per year Our point estimate, as I say, is 663  Our labor economists say, on their   confidence intervals, it may be somewhere in the mid-66 area  We’d all agree that there are                      August 9, 2005 31 of 110  uncertainties about the methodology  So, if we stepped outside the formal econometrics, we   might think we could see a number as high as 67 or something like that       But that 67 would really be pushing it  That would be taking into   account that there probably are considerations outside of the model and that models never quite   work out as well as econometricians or empirical investigators hope  But at the end of the day   we believe that the case is fairly strong for some downward tilt in the trend participation rate     Yes Our price projection has moved up  The best measure of that may   be what has happened to the core PCE price index  Let’s see, now that I’m looking at the   numbers I’m about to eat my words  In 2002, on the revised figures, core PCE inflation was at   22 percent and we now have it at 20  So if one takes as the trend last year and the first half of   this year, I guess I’m going to have to reverse myself and say that the core PCE price index has   been about flat  It has been running in the neighborhood of 2 percent or a little above  It has   been higher than we thought because of the oil price     But not getting higher, yes                    August 9, 2005 32 of 110    The Greenbook baseline does
