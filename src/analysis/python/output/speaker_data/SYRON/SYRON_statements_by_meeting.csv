3765,1989-02-07," There's no information for forecasting in that  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Mike, given what Ted has said in here and what was said about oil prices in the Greenbook that we got earlier, one always makes point estimates but what's your view of the symmetry of the risks on the inflation side? Particularly, I'm referring to the staff inflation projection and the forecast for compensation in the first and second halves of 1989 given what was [happening] in the last half of 1988  Let me start out with the thrift issue First of all, I think the point is well taken in terms of the effect of rates in the short run on thrifts Figures I looked at for the savings and loan industry as a whole show about a negative 17 percent gap So a  -22-    2/7-8/89  50 basis point increase in rates roughly costs them about $1 billion of their capital One could assume, under current circumstances, that that translates roughly to what has to be done in terms of giving assistance But I think that there is a difference between the short term and the long term in the sense that it doesn't obviate our need to take steps that prevent inflation from getting further out of hand as time goes on because--and I'm sure the staff has done some work on this--you have the linear function of what it costs the thrifts as rates rise Also, many of the largest thrift institutions have hedges that are humped in the sense that they may be feeling well protected going out 150 - 200 basis points even when they get into residuals going back, say, for 100 basis points But these hedges fall off a cliff if one gets into a situation where you get very dramatic increases, or decreases for that matter, in rates So I think that's something that has to be factored into the equation when you're looking at the thrifts  What I have to say about our view of the real economy is probably quite redundant to what many other people have said We have very little difference with the Greenbook forecast We do come out somewhat higher on the inflation side; we come out actually slightly out of the central tendency area on that That has to do with the impact we expect the rate of growth will have on the unemployment rate But to be honest, that's probably related in part to our own experience in the region We do feel that the risks are quite asymmetric--that's the New England pronunciation for asymmetric, I guess--but they're doubly asymmetric in the sense that we may get more inflation and then we think the difficulties of dealing with these issues may be harder if we get into an inflationary situation But this is to be discussed tomorrow  As far as the region goes, we are seeing some softness, relatively, in New England Not to contradict what I said before, but I think the reason that we're seeing some softness is because we really had a boom for a long period of time If you look at Massachusetts for example--and Massachusetts is half of New England-- per capita income in the state now is 123 percent of the national average whereas in 1975 it was 103 percent If you were to adjust for relative costs it really would have been below that Consistent with that, wages have been rising quite rapidly When Bob [Boykin] talked about Louisiana [I was reminded of] some work we had done looking at manufacturing cross sectional data on hourly earnings versus the unemployment rate in manufacturing States that are the highest are all the New England states Louisiana has to be one of the states that was lowest, consistent with what he was saying And the local price level, if one wants to assign any real weight to that given the smallness of the sample, shows that prices are rising at about a 63 percent overall rate in the greater Boston area Now, I think it's interesting that southern New England is doing much more poorly--or it's starting to do more poorly--than northern New England, which experienced some of this relative prosperity later on The only industry that we have right now in southern New England that is doing better than nationally is the construction industry, which happens to come fairly late in the regional business cycle And we do have a quite soft real estate market But the lessons--if there are any-- that I draw from this for the national economy are that the problems that we have in the region are the result of having grown very, very strongly for a period of time at a pace that was not sustainable And  -23-    2/7-8/89  maybe that influences our view of the approach one should take to policy nationally  I used to until last year  I favor 3 to 7 percent because of my personal weighing of the alternative risks It seems to me, coming back to the credibility issue, that the damage to our credibility if we stay with 3 to 7 percent and come in below the range this year is far less--I shouldn't say far less--it is less than what the cost might be if we were to have to raise the range next year In either case we would have to explain it So, I would favor staying with 3 to 7 percent and if we felt that it was possible, given unknown changes of velocity and given what's going on in the financial markets, we might make a comment about the thrift situation in what's said [in the testimony]  Mr Chairman, just a clarifying question if I might?  In what you've essentially proposed--alternative B in the Bluebook--the Bluebook notes that under that alternative some of the recent rate increases might in fact slip back; we might see some decline in rates under alternative B I take it that in the approach you're talking about that you would not want that, absent some signs of weakening in the real economy or some other events in the international markets--  So I can say that under your proposal you would not want to see a decline in rates in the short term?  Yes, the funds rate  Okay  That's essentially correct  That's my concern  I think, as Ed Boehne said very well, that we are in a period of some substantial uncertainty and that one has to weigh the symmetry of the risks I fully agree with his analysis that it is always easier to loosen later on than it is to tighten later on The staff forecast, which seems to me as good a forecast as one is going to find any place, does have some worrisome implications in terms of inflation, excluding energy, as one gets out beyond the forecast period So, in an unconstrained world I would tend to favor an approach somewhere between ""B"" and ""C"" But I do agree strongly that it is important to communicate institutional harmony at this point in time given the number of things that are going on And I would be comfortable with your position, given that you suggested that there would be a consultation within a matter of a couple of weeks and that there would be no decline, effectively, in market rates in the interim period--that we wouldn't have sent a signal that we were going in the opposite direction when that might have to be reversed within that couple of weeks  So, I prefer a ""B-"" but am comfortable with ""B"" "
3790,1989-03-28," Peter, how widespread are these exotic--if I can use that term--hedging strategies that Salomon had in place? Are there many other firms that have things that are [that complex]? Obviously, there are varying degrees of complexity, though Would they have the edge in terms of the complexity of their strategies or are there others that are operating--  It may be a [unintelligible] distinction  They may have thought it was a hedge in priority  Mike, I just had a question, which I think I know the answer to Regarding the rate increase that is implicit in the Greenbook forecast Is that essentially a straight line linear forecast throughout the year?  I guess the second part of the question I'll put off until later But I'd be interested in speculating if it wasn't a straight line increase whether the potential impact of that was of importance  The second part of my question relates to the questions Governor Johnson asked In your model, is it fair to say-- and this leads to the risks--that you don't see us getting below the natural rate until somewhere around the second quarter of 1990?  Consistent with what Bob [Parry] said, you get this responding sort of with a lag In New England now we're seeing lower housing activity than you might expect, considering other variables, because with the rate of appreciation having declined substantially--it has actually gone negative in real terms--people are  -19-    3/28/89  buying housing only for shelter They are not buying it any longer figuring that it is an investment as well So, at some point it sort of falls off a cliff in a sense, and you get a strong negative reaction to the whole thing  Well, maybe it's because I'm sitting next to Bob, but the New England economy sort of performs inversely to Texas I'm not sure whether there's any causal relationship Contemporaneous measures of the region's economy are very strong an unemployment rate of 32 percent; personal income still growing at faster than the national level But if one looks a little beyond that, particularly using anecdotal information from talking to people, there are certainly signs of a number of areas where there are problems Manufacturing employment has been declining in absolute terms for some substantial period of time There was some mention of the computer industry on a national basis; that's reflected to an even greater extent in New England One of largest employers, Digital Equipment Corporation, had a very major decline in its stock price last week that reflected some problems they had in earnings Consistent with that, we're seeing that wage pressures are still pretty strong at the unskilled end of the labor market At the skilled end of the labor market pressures seem to be abating somewhat from what has happened in the past But going beyond that there is a variety of things that I think are going to lead to some further relative slowing in the New England economy We have serious tax problems in three of the six states that account for about 80 percent of the population and 80 percent of the economic activity in the District There are incipient problems in the banking sector Delinquencies have risen Actually, it's the ultimate in anecdotal information, but in last Sunday's papers we had three pages of ads for single-family houses, which is unusual for us Granted, they were big ads so they end up taking a lot of space But interestingly, particularly in the housing area, I think what's driving it is not rates so much as this realization that people are no longer going to buy a house at $600,000 and then two years later turn around and sell it for $800,000 That's what we were talking about before--Bob Parry's point that people are buying shelter I would maintain that much of what's going on in New England does not really reflect monetary policy or overall constraints in the national economy It's sort of supply constrained and relative costs have gotten so high in the District; and actually, it's a very small District in terms of its weight nationally  In terms of the national economy, we too don't differ very much--hardly at all--[with the Greenbook forecast] I have some slight difference with the unemployment path of the staff forecast and agree very much with the tone of the comments that Mike Prell made this morning However, I find those projections somewhat  -29-    3/28/89  disconcerting--not in the sense that we don't agree with them but that they imply that we have a very difficult situation before us in that we know inflationary pressures are there It seems to me there isn't much question about that, regardless of what we do right now And while there have been some--to be different I'll use the word ""reeds""- -in the wind of a possible slowdown, I don't think we've seen any broad signs We have certainly seen substantial increases in personal income; we don't know how that's going to be reflected later on There really isn't any convincing evidence of a substantial slowdown, so we are rather dependent on a forecast for that And the Greenbook forecast--which I'll say again we have very little problem with-- shows, even taking out the drought in the second quarter, fairly strong rates of growth There was discussion about what the natural rate is I think that we're in a difficult position where if one does believe that the risks are not symmetrical, the risks would lead one to want to be more conservative  Plenty of confidence in us, that's all!  I personally would be more comfortable with something closer to ""C"" than ""B"" because I think we are probably going to have to tighten at some point and I would prefer to tighten sooner rather than later But having said that, I'm comfortable with your suggestion of ""B,"" asymmetrically stated The point that was made that we certainly wouldn't want ""B"" to be consistent with an easing of market rates--I'm not sure what the exact number is--is an important one The only other point I would make is that I would not in the immediate period be terribly concerned if M2 continued to grow rather slowly, because I'm not as sanguine that some of these thrift problems, in terms of the deposit outflows, are not going to continue in the immediate period ahead That's based in part on looking at some data of FSLIC insured thrifts as compared to FDIC insured thrifts "
3818,1989-05-16," The same message--which would be given to both, I think--is that a lot of us do have skepticism about the value of sterilized intervention over a long course of time I understand the need to do it and I don't want to be terribly dogmatic But the proposal for $3 billion makes a lot of sense [it requires] coming back to the Committee again rather than having a very large increase, which possibly could be interpreted by people--even though they may not pay much attention to it--as saying that this is a change in the fundamental approach that's being taken  I have a technical question, Mike, that you raised when you talked about the inventory behavior In the Greenbook forecast you have a fairly noticeable decline in the change of business inventories over time I was wondering, looking at traditional relationships between sales and price expectations and that sort of thing, whether that reflects some judgment on your part about structural changes--more just-in-time inventory kinds of patterns on the part of manufacturers? Or, are there other reasons that are more fundamental for the decline in the change of business inventories?  Recognized only by commercial bankers  First of all, I think the New England economy, like most of the Northeast, is slowing markedly In the past I think we've seen some slowing for a few months that has largely reflected idiosyncratic kinds of factors of mix; the difference now is that there is some more evidence that the slowing reflects a big system with national kinds of trends Retail sales are soft really across the board, particularly in the durables area I don't think it's largely because of interest rates; it's because of excesses of the  -23-    5/16/89  past Housing is very soft and we have very, very substantial overhangs, particularly in the condominium market As a matter of fact, the headline in last Sunday's Boston Globe--I would say it was greatly overdone--in 3/4 inch black type on the business page was the word ""bankruptcy"" It was about a number of developers and others who had gone into bankruptcy, and it was saying that the rate of increase in bankruptcy in the New England District and the cost were now greater than they had been in Dallas The level is still extremely low But we have had negative commercial space absorption in the greater Boston area for the first time since--  Negative absorption of commercial space is where, because of consolidation of firms and cutbacks, less space was rented in the most recent period than in the period before that, leading to an increase in the vacancy rate in the suburban areas  Really, we have a few [unintelligible] Our manufacturers have reasonable backlogs but they say their new orders in many cases don't look very good, particularly in defense and in the computer areas that tend to be very defense-dependent One reason I asked Mike the question earlier about inventories is that some of our manufacturers in the aerospace business--particularly those in the business of supplying parts to jet engine manufacturers--say that, given the backlogs they understand the manufacturers have, they are not seeing as much in orders as they were earlier The large jet engine manufacturers, particularly General Electric and Pratt and Whitney, seem to be going more to just-in-time types of inventory practices So, as I say, we think some of these things reflect earlier excesses, a deterioration of our competitive position Bob [Forrestal] mentioned some expansion in the Southeast of firms based in the Northeast Some of those are our firms because they decided not to expand [in our region]; generally, when they close the plant here they don't open a new one because of labor costs and other factors  As far as the national economy goes, our view is very similar to that contained in the Greenbook While I have some sympathy for what people have said, I'm inclined to think that there is more slowing going on than I would have thought a month ago I find that somewhat heartening in that what we're seeing really is consistent with the Greenbook forecast and what we'd expect, given the rise that we've seen in rates thus far Looking at the employment numbers, while last month's number was a little low it wasn't enormously below what one might think of as a sustainable rate of growth in employment, especially when one looks at strike-adjusted data Given where we are in the labor market right now, I think Bob Parry's remarks on that score are very apt I don't know a great deal about the details, but we're somewhat concerned about what we're seeing in the Bethlehem Steel settlement, though that might be taken care of over time by competitive factors with USX or something But I think developments in labor markets still indicate that some inflationary pressures are built in there that will take a while to work out  Mr Chairman, I have a lot of sympathy for your view of staying where we are The problem we seem to be having is defining just where we are I think policy has been pretty successful Where I am, to try to use Governor LaWare's approach, is ""B;"" $600 million; but asymmetrical  The way it has been I would keep it the way it has been, but I think to some extent that asymmetry is muted by moving up the emphasis on the Ms within the directive, because people know what has been happening to the Ms  My only point is that I would leave the language on the ""mights"" and ""woulds"" the same  On the Ms  Excuse me, a point of information Are you suggesting ""slightly"" and ""might"" on the second part or ""somewhat/ would"" and ""slightly/might"" in terms of symmetry?  ""Slightly/might"" on both?  ""Slightly/would,"" I suppose  ""Somewhat/would"" "
3861,1989-07-05," Mike, do you have any inkling as to what's going to happen with the GNP revisions?  Mr Chairman, the New England District that has led the upturn to some extent is certainly way out front in the downturn In talking to our directors and other people around the District, I'd say in terms of making their own investment decisions and going forward there is some cautious pessimism on their part Things seem to be fairly soft over a pretty widespread area Specific industries such as the high-tech and computer industries are quite soft Some of that may be related to particular mix factors in that  -20-    7/5-6/89  part of the industry In the defense sector, which is very important, current work in process is starting to be reduced and they are really concerned going out Employment has been growing somewhat more slowly than nationally for a while now Superimposed on all of this, we do have an overhang in the construction industry and in the housing industry; the result of this is that loan demand has softened a bit and we're starting to get a backlog of property on the market and an expansion of auctions This combines with the fact that we have in Massachusetts, the largest state in the District, very serious fiscal problems--both state and local People reading about the fiscal problems continuously has led to a broader pessimism, which has been reflected in retail sales So, inventories are not a problem at this point in time but people are being really quite cautious Wages have been well behaved, as you might expect in this environment, though the labor market in the services area--particularly the lower-end services sector--is still quite tight But it's loosening up a fair bit in production levels  As far as the national economy goes, we would generally agree with the Greenbook as it was presented with a couple of caveats We have somewhat stronger growth in GNP as a result of somewhat stronger consumption growth--obviously in other parts of the country--with the saving rate not holding up as high as the Greenbook has it We have some concern about higher inflation because of the uncertainty on our part that wages nationally will remain as well behaved as they have in the past, particularly looking at the tightness in labor markets and what has happened to prices in an overall sense--not just excluding food and energy, but all prices So, I think it's pretty clear that we're in a very difficult period We don't see a cumulating downturn in the economy But I think the risks are at least balanced, with probably some more margin on the softer side of the economy  Mr Chairman, I think that policy has been a mixture of luck and skill and has been remarkably effective And I  -36-    7/5-6/89  think the challenge before us is to continue that process The comments that have been made on signals are highly appropriate in terms of the point that it's certainly necessary that we lower some of the ranges But I find that I'm somewhat sympathetic to what Governor Angell said, particularly given that we think it is likely, were we to adopt alternative III, that we subsequently would have to raise the range for M2 With that [being] our suspicion--and it is mine--I would prefer alternative II  Mr Chairman, I have a great deal of sympathy for the policy prescription that you advocated for the following reasons first, given that our long-term goal is price stability, I'm not all that unhappy about where we are right now; and at least for the next couple of quarters I'm not that unhappy with what the Greenbook forecast has embedded in it in terms of the behavior of rates Knowing the uncertainties that exist in this world, I think it is very important to move gradually, for the reasons that other people have mentioned, and to adopt an approach or continue an approach in which the Chairman has a fair amount of flexibility There are things that could happen in the intermeeting period that would substantially change how one would read the economy So, I very strongly support that "
3888,1989-08-22," They won't come out until after these discussions are all through  Mike, I have a question about a prospective piece of data The claims data have looked very good so far My question has to do with the Nynex strike I happened to talk to the fellow who runs the Nynex in New England and there's an issue about some people-- I guess in New York State--who after seven weeks on strike are    8/22/89  eligible to file claims In some other states they may not be eligible to file claims but they may be filing the claims anyway because the company has to send someone into the employment office to dispute the claim or else it ends up counting against the company's experience rating I'm wondering if that perhaps could have some effect on the claims data that we are going to be seeing over the next period--whether the markets know that and how they are likely to [react]  Yes Claims could go up artificially because they would be--  It's a reallocation  I thought some of the decline in nondurables was accounted for by food  The debt or--  Something can change in the meantime  Well, that's the progress plan--from here to Australia  Thank you, Mr Chairman Well, as far as the national economy goes, I think in many ways it couldn't be much better But there has been talk about New England and the phrase comes to mind that ""this too shall pass"" I hope it doesn't  It has in New England  In the First District, I think it's fair to say that overall economic conditions are quite soft and likely to get softer The unemployment rate is up nearly a percentage point, or a little less, over about 4 months There have been significant declines in employment, particularly in the high-tech and computer industries and in construction, which is at this point where one might expect  -27-    8/22/89 -28-  It's about 4-1/2 percent--still significantly below the national average, but that is up 08  There is only one state in the District which [unintelligible] population, which is Massachusetts; its low point was around 3 percent and it's now 4-1/2 percent And that's the only significant jump--a monthly jump of around 04 of a percentage point The thrift industry, largely the savings banks, has very serious asset quality problems which are now spreading to commercial banks Unfortunately, more than one of our larger super regionals has substantially large [non]performing assets and is getting quite bad marks in terms of their asset quality--Bob Boykin is smiling here-- which is going to be a problem for us in the future There is some evidence, particularly in some of the northern states that the problems that people have had in the real estate market are making lenders more cautious now than in other markets, which is starting to have some cumulative effect This accumulation of bad news, [along with] a rather substantial number of layoffs and a very bad fiscal situation in Massachusetts, has impacted somewhat I don't know how much value one wants to put on these data, but a survey I saw breaking down consumer confidence by region showed consumer confidence in New England off 22 percent And that's certainly had an impact on retail sales, which is corroborated by our state sales tax revenues As one might expect, this has had a favorable effect on wage demands, particularly at the middle and upper levels But at the entry levels we still have the McDonald's thing--a great deal of money  In talking to manufacturers in the District, I find a really striking divergence in their views and their experience within and outside of New England There are problems in the computer industry, which you referred to earlier, on a nationwide basis Some of our firms are dramatically [unintelligible] industries--which is on the front page of The Wall Street Journal--and have experienced the problems much more so These really are firm-specific, product-cycle, kinds of problems Even our successful companies, like  are suffering with the nation But other manufacturers report that they are doing reasonably well nationally compared to their really cautious expectations; and they really have expected a fairly soft year None of the ones that we have talked to expect a recession They expect a continuation of slow growth, as referred to earlier Suppliers of commercial aircraft are doing reasonably well and capital goods producers are arguing that their orders are holding up quite well We look at the volume of exports out of Logan Airport because most of what we produce for export is shipped by air rather than by water, and that has shown a fairly striking decline in the level of exports But some of that problem is mixed with this product-cycle thing I think we realize in New England at the intellectual level--but it's a little more difficult at a visceral level--that this is coming off a high but unsustainable level I may be stretching it a point, but I think there may be a little lesson from the region; the mechanisms are different from the national economy as far as what has happened in New England where we were substantially overheated for some period of time Unfortunately,    8/22/89  we haven't had the experience in New England that we are having nationally, where we seem to be going into a soft landing  It looks to me, as far as the national economy goes, that it's right about where we want it to be Looking at the data that have come in, we don't see the kinds of imbalances that would lead to a recession As other people mentioned earlier, the Greenbook revised up growth in GNP in every quarter, I think, compared with the last Greenbook And employment growth, particularly, is revised up Using the model that we have, employment is close to the upper end of what we think is consistent with maintaining the current inflation rates and would have no [unintelligible] making substantial progress toward improvement The Greenbook does have a slight upward movement of the unemployment rate over the next year, but very little really This could be revised away; things could easily change We know that the inflation outlook is quite good Like Gary, I think the information we have would lead us to believe that maybe it will be a little better But when you exclude food and energy, it doesn't seem to me that we would make an enormous amount of progress I think we've been quite fortunate on the wage front, given the tight labor markets that we have There is some concern on the national level about how long this luck is going to hold It seems to me that policy has worked very successfully so far; we rather like what has been done so far and would be concerned about changing very much from that--I'm getting into the next part Given the relative tightness in the labor market nationally, one would have to be concerned over the longer haul that surprises might well be more on the up side than on the down side Thank you, Mr Chairman  I find myself in great sympathy with what the Chairman said Given the uncertainties that we face, I just don't see a reason to change at this point in time I also would prefer symmetric language because of concern about the potential market reaction and how the markets would read a change in the language I don't feel as strongly as President Guffey does about that Since things aren't going to stay this way forever, and maybe we're going to need something to help us, we should face the issue of where we are going over the longer run, because there's general agreement and a lot of frustration that the inflation rate is at an undesirably high level Where do we want to go? "
3913,1989-10-03," Most of the questions I wanted to asked were already asked by Tom Melzer But it seems to me that the United States has a strange [institutional] situation Domestic monetary policy is the role of the independent central bank International policy is the role--on a 60 percent basis, at least--of the Treasury Mr Chairman, I just wanted to ask a question but I think Jerry answered it already Have you been faced with sort of a Hobson's choice in the sense of being involved in something that I think almost  -11-    10/3/89  everyone here is skeptical of--sterilized intervention--believing that we were better off over the long course of time maintaining that 40 percent, say, rather than [our] just getting out at this point in time for the reasons Tom Melzer noted? I think an important factor in waiting to see how long we want to remain a player is having some notion of how long this process will go on It seems to me that it might be useful--I would hope useful from your perspective--when you go back and talk to the other people with whom you have to negotiate to indicate the degree of discomfort that many people have on the issue But I agree with Tom; I just don't see at this point how we can back out of it But I think we do need to have some notion of how long this will go on  Yes  Columbus Day  You can approve his transactions  The Committee passed by majority--in other words it is ratifying  Mr Chairman, on this give and take, the New England economy is far from booming The slowdown that we are in the midst of continues It's not cataclysmic but it does seem steady Interestingly, the earlier declines in the southern New England states--the big states such as Massachusetts and Connecticut--have now spread to the three northern New England states There are a variety of factors a quite poor tourism season, absolute declines of employment of a substantial magnitude, particularly in the construction area and also in manufacturing In the case of manufacturing, I think that's a bit of a spillover from the slowdown in manufacturing in Connecticut and Massachusetts In the case of construction, it just reflects overbuilding and a lot of excess second homes on the market With respect to our manufacturers with whom we have contact, we get an interesting pattern We tried to separate out what they tell us about the national economy from the regional economy and we get a very distinct difference in responses With respect to the regional economy, everyone is really quite pessimistic; but in talking about the national economy, while no one is what we would call  -25-    10/3/89  euphoric or expects a runaway boom, the general response we're getting is that they expect a rather moderate and steady [growth], with some adjustment to the capital spending levels, but not a great one There is not a great concern about inventories on their part In retail activity within the District we see some significant problems, with the beginning of some inventory problems there Labor markets are generally mixed The agreements and settlements that have been reached generally have been well behaved although there are still substantial pressures at the low end of the labor market At the higher end of the labor market things really have been softening quite a lot  As far as the national economy goes, we have been generally comfortable with the Greenbook forecast with two caveats (1) the Greenbook does have the saving rate declining, but we question whether it might possibly decline even more and consumption come up somewhat more; and (2) we have a concern about the pattern of wages This is reflected in other things that have been said whether in the employment cost index, particularly when one starts to disaggregate and look at what is unionized and what is nonunionized, there really is a dramatic change in that decomposition over time; and whether in the future, particularly if the national economy remains relatively robust, we might not have the kind of good behavior we've had in that area Overall, we think the risks are about evenly balanced between the economy growing too fast or starting to slow too much, although we don't see any signs really of cumulative softness I will finish by saying, as you indicated earlier when we were discussing the foreign currency issue, that before very long we're going to be in a situation where we have to decide as far as inflation goes just what we want to accomplish and in what kind of time period--what constraints we feel are on us and how the mechanisms work Thank you, Mr Chairman  A theoretical question, looking out and going into next year If the capital gains legislation were to pass--and there is a lot of discussion about windows and that sort of thing-- what kind of effect will that have on M2 as we go into next year?  Like many others, I'm happy with the current state of the economy But also like many others, I'm not happy about the outlook, particularly on inflation, as we go out a couple of years I know the errors that such a forecast has I understand the constraints that are on us as far as the dollar goes Because of my longer-term concerns on inflation I'm very comfortable with ""B,"" but I would also prefer symmetrical language in the hope that the market would see symmetrical language as no change  And it depends on the time periods you're looking at I think the Neal letter is consistent with looking at this over a long period of time Most people don't behave--  There are going to be costs but there is going to be a benefit in that over the long period of time after that prosperity will be greater "
3963,1989-11-14," I have two questions, which I think are probably related to special factors as well One that you have alluded to already is the rebuilding effect of the national disasters It seems that that occurs very quickly and then tapers off I just wonder about that--with no better information on my part than watching what we see being reported--because it seems that it would require more over a longer period of time  It comes on pretty quickly  That was one question I had The other question has to do with the output figures in 1990 I'm just wondering if there were some special factors contributing to the pattern in output per hour compared to the growth rate in GNP?  Yes, because you have productivity increasing as GNP is decreasing  And your longer-run trend is?  Well, I'd say the First District economy is mixed to slow Previously, the declines have been confined to the high-tech area, the real estate area, and generally in construction But now they are broadening out to the economy as a whole We actually had total employment over the last three months fall by 1 percent, paced by a 4-1/2 percent decline in manufacturing employment, with nonmanufacturing employment staying pretty flat Previously, financial services had grown at some pace but that has leveled out now, and many banks particularly are taking steps to reduce costs because of their [unintelligible] problems We've seen very slight increases in the trade sector Housing permits are down 30 percent over a year ago and 60 percent from their peak level And we are beginning to see some decline in house prices, by I'd say 10 to 15 percent, which is different There's a substantially increased number of auctions as some developers do go bankrupt Needless to say, loan demand is not terribly strong in this situation Among the manufacturers that we surveyed that are active nationally, there is actually an amazing degree of almost unanimity in that they are reporting slow growth--not strong growth, but still things are not falling off the edge of the cliff They're seeing increases in growth of about 6 to 7 percent, and that's because of a wide range of products from telecommunications equipment, milling equipment, and maybe personal care products, with some people saying they have [unintelligible] and greater strength overseas An exception to this, of course, is suppliers in the auto industry and the computer companies Computer companies in New England, because of particular product mix issues, just have not benefited from what's happening elsewhere Actually, that's a lot of the source of the weakness in manufacturing employment Despite this, inventories generally have not been a problem, although in a few particular cases they have built up Retailers are not anticipating a good Christmas, which is to be expected in these circumstances; and as you also would expect, they have kept their inventories quite lean in this situation Prices generally have been very well behaved There has been some mention of an increase in prices of specialized metals such as tungsten Labor markets have softened in line with the increase in unemployment that we've seen And now for the first time--though we've seen this across many skilled classes before--no obviously exorbitant rates are being offered to starting labor at fast food chains  As far as the national economy goes, we don't have any real disagreement with the Greenbook, which we believe does not show a bad profile for the intermediate term given what we want to accomplish I think Ed is right we're steering down a relatively narrow channel here; I'm not quite so sure that I agree that we're listing to one side or the other The more important question that we're going to discuss is what we want to accomplish over the longer run I think there's fairly broad agreement within this group that we do want to get to a greater degree of price stability over time I know at the  -16-    11/14/89  next meeting we will talk at some length about what the cost of that would be I would note that the Greenbook assumes that policy remains essentially the same through the middle of next year and then tightens somewhat after that Even in that circumstance we really don't see any improvement in inflation, as measured by the CPI ex-energy through 1991  On the labor front, we have seen pretty well behaved settlements I thought I might just mention the Nynex settlement because I happened to talk last night at some length to one of the mediators in that case There are two unions involved--the IBEW and the New England Communications Workers of America in New York This was but it's the same settlement in both places Sadly, the settlement is not as favorable to management as is suggested in the press releases but it still is not disastrous Basically, it probably comes down to about a 12 percent settlement over 3 years depending upon what one thinks is going to happen to medical costs That was the big issue in this strike--virtually all medical costs continuing to be borne by the employer--and that's what people stayed out on Ultimately, Nynex gave in on that In terms of wages themselves, the contract provides for 3 percent the first year, 1-1/2 percent in the second year, and 1-1/2 percent in the third year but with a COLA in the second and third year that is equivalent to the CPI minus 2 percent--60 percent of the CPI over 2 percent is a better way of putting it It is interesting that the inflation assumption that was used or agreed on by both the union and the company was a CPI of 47 percent the second year and 48 percent the [third year] The medical cost--and I think this may be on the low side--is estimated at about 2 percent of the cost with regard to the agreement proposal over the life of the contract  In terms of the relevance of all of this, I believe that we do have to think about this price stability business One thing that struck me in the Greenbook was that we have two sets of leading indicators and both of them--I think for some time now--have been trending down and showing the probability of a recession I don't know whether that's [unintelligible], whether we're seeing a symmetrical risk in either direction So, I'm not really terribly worried about that I do think we've staked a good deal of credibility and have a lot of credibility right now That was brought home, and I'll finish on this, by a conversation we had with the chief planner at --and this is kind of an ironic result He said he was expecting a recession next year because he thought the Fed really wanted to get inflation down and the basic underlying rate of inflation was around 5 percent and that was too high and thus we were going to tighten Now, this was in a call that was made by one of our economists But a lot of people are paying attention to what we say and I am concerned that we maintain the credibility that we do have Thank you, Mr Chairman  I agree with your suggestion basically because it's no change Given what we did last week, I don't think we have much choice right now I think we're in a very difficult situation As Ed Boehne said, it is a question of risks; and I agree with Tom Melzer's point that some reality testing has to be done out there and I'm not quite sure how we get that to occur But given the lags involved and what we've already done, I just don't think it makes any sense to make any changes at this time  Yes "
3992,1989-12-18," I think that's a very relevant point with respect to looking at the '81 period that was being talked about because, while I'm not disagreeing on the point that we had no credibility in that period, that was a case where [we] demonstrated a willingness to really hit the economy over the head with a sledgehammer to get inflation down And it may be that this kind of shock effect occurring all at once rather than by a gradual approach-- I think it's not clear how much credibility that--  Mr Chairman, I would think that probably most people around the table agree with the notion that we want to get inflation down over time but we're talking about how fast Mike Kelley said something about the slope of the line What I think is the real issue here, and several people have alluded to it, is the issue of political acceptability Bob Forrestal raised that There is a question [of our] not being a part of the government set up in the Constitution; but how long we can squeeze the--  Okay Well, I only wanted to touch on this In terms of this exchange between Gary Stern and Lee Hoskins, it seems to me that in many ways we can't really compare the willingness of people to look at what happened in '79, '80, '81, and '85 with the current situation in that, as you said earlier, we were coming off a period in which people were afraid our capital markets were going to be destroyed perpetually--that there was going to be [no] long-term bond market And we had accelerating inflation So there was much, much greater concern and much, much greater willingness to take tough action in that circumstance That may have something to do with the fact that of the sacrifice ratios that are shown in Exhibit 9, the ratio of 18 for that cell [for the 1981-85 period], for whatever it's worth, is the lowest except for the 1970-72 period when we had [price] controls, than any cell, domestic or foreign, with the exception of the one in France Whereas now, I think we're in a period in which most people's expectation is that we have relatively stable inflation We need to get it down over time, but we have relatively stable inflation That is dramatically different than the other situation  Mr Chairman, I will comment on the two specifics of your question but, in terms of looking at the cost/benefits of this issue, I think Jerry's point is well taken We don't know on that table I think it's extraordinarily useful but [unintelligible] what precisely the sacrifice ratio would be There has been a lot of discussion of the cost/benefits in present value terms I think it could be interesting, possibly, to do an exercise to see what sort of sacrifice ratio you'd have to have so we'd know how much weight to put on the credibility issue to break even [unintelligible] that works Because we're still operating in, at least--  No, I'm not saying publicly Actually, what I'm saying is How many people we throw out of work now will be made up for in present value terms by the [employment] gains we'll have later on?  It's getting to be that way now  You can talk in terms of GNP, though  That's what I was thinking  I was thinking of present value GNP But to get to your particular questions, I would find targeting something like a steady low rate of inflation acceptable I find it consistent with the statements that you've made in the past about the level; the kind of numbers that you have used are, in fact, the kind of numbers that Jerry used I think it's consistent with your statement that that level really would not seriously affect economic decisionmaking As    12/18-19/89  far as the timetable goes, I think it's hard to say yea or nay My notes on other people's comments around this table suggest as well that [the feeling] is sort of yes, but not precise And that's where I would come out, in part because of the concerns that John LaWare expressed I don't think we get anywhere if we just say we're going to get there but we're not going to tell you by when I think we have to give something like a two-year band or something, depending on the number that we pick--saying when we want to get there, say, 1994-96 or 1995-97, or something like that  I don't think there's anything wrong I think it has a nice added--  Which is the most important  Well, Mr Chairman, I think we're in an extraordinarily difficult and tricky situation here when we try and [unintelligible] up public sentiment I have been struck, when I give talks and discuss the need for the Federal Reserve to be disciplined and how we are being disciplined in getting inflation down--and I'm talking about business groups, not about community activists--that I haven't had anyone come up to me and complain It's akin to John's point that inflation is really too high now What they come up to say is Why can't you get rates down because my machine tools aren't selling or this isn't happening or that isn't happening So, I think the only way we're going to get anywhere--and it's a long-term process--is to demonstrate what the cost of inflation is I think that a lot of the improvement to personal living standards has been driven by increases in the participation rate in the labor force and the norm now being the two-worker family rather than the single- worker family Because of inflation and other factors, productivity hasn't been rising and real wages haven't been rising We need to get the saving rate up We have to show people how they and their children in the future are going to be better off in a low inflation world than they are now Because they don't understand that now, they are not going to support that And I think it's very, very important when we try to make this case that we demonstrate as clearly as possible the constraints that the Federal Reserve has on it what it can and can't do I'm not disagreeing that we can't get rid of inflation, but at what cost? And it depends upon what other people do And by that I'm talking about things like the minimum wage, protectionist legislation, different steps that are being taken in medical care costs, all of those things Someone told me a long time ago that being a shock absorber is not a terribly lasting profession; you get hot and worn out And I think we need to demonstrate to people how we are really in the shock absorber role and show them the terrible box that we are in  It is mixed  Mr Chairman, some time ago I think Joe Coyne drafted something that was an agreement among the Committee that none of us would talk to the press seven days before or seven days after a meeting I wonder if it's not worth revisiting that issue  In the First District, the latest indicators show our economy as slow to mixed, which is an improvement Expectations are almost universally gloomy but I think that's not just because of the national economy It's an interaction of the budget problem in Massachusetts--which is sort of a fiscal Beirut--the softer [real estate market], the problems we have in the high-tech industry, and expectations of potential problems in defense There's a lot of concern about that, obviously, as a result of recent developments; and that greatly increases concern about the banks and what that means potentially This really has been carried widely in the newspapers and is having an effect I don't know how good the sample is but if you look at the Conference Board consumer confidence survey by region over the last year, the expectations in New England are 29 percent below where they were last year Despite that, employment in the last month actually grew slightly in New England and the rate of [un]employment was flat This is a significant improvement from the downturn we've been seeing for some period of time Retailers are quite bearish and very concerned about sales And the anecdotal information isn't encouraging in that regard Some of that is attributable to the very cold weather we, as many people, have had, which is keeping people out of the stores On the other hand, the cold weather obviously is going to stimulate measured sales of natural gas, utilities, and other things Almost all of our manufacturing contacts report sales as flat, [unintelligible] down For example, a heavy manufacturing who is headquartered in New England but who actually has a lot of his facilities in Lee's District and Roger's District is very, very pessimistic He produces a lot of stamping equipment for the auto industry and that sort of thing Interestingly, he has found his sales now to be getting into foreign nameplate domestic producers; he has cracked that market somewhat Someone raised the point of a structural shift in the auto industry and I wonder if that isn't something that is happening If you look at the sales of foreign nameplate cars produced domestically, they are holding up a fair bit better than sales of the Big Three Both input prices and prices for products remain fairly well behaved Although most firms improved--I guess this is universal--from past behavior, they hope to improve their margins [further] next year At this point  -79-    12/18-19/89  most manufacturers we've contacted have not changed their plans for capital spending; their plans were not terribly ambitious in the first place, but they have not changed them a great deal As I mentioned, the real estate market remains quite soft, particularly in the residential area  Nationally, we're inclined to pretty much agree with the Greenbook forecast If we have any area [of doubt] it might be that we don't know that we will get quite the reduction in the out years in spending on consumer services that the Greenbook has In terms of my own perspective, as far as the national economy goes, I have come around to the view that things may be somewhat softer than I had thought originally And I think this is borne out by the latest figures we've seen There are two factors I'd like to mention to expand on that One is that in going through the consumer confidence survey by region that I mentioned--and as I said I don't know how good the sample is--the two regions where consumer confidence actually looks pretty good with regard to expectations next year are the west Northcentral and the east Northcentral The west Northcentral looks pretty good but in the east Northcentral I think it depends an awful lot on what does happen to manufacturing there I also wonder, given the problems the banks have in real estate and elsewhere, whether more firms are going to have difficulty getting credit as they reach the point in the cycle when they turn to banks to get credit I know this is happening; we're hearing a lot of complaints about this in our Consumer Advisory Council I wonder whether banks are going to be more inclined to pull their horns in, which could lead to accumulating [unintelligible] All this leads me to believe the risks are more on the down side than I had thought before A difficult question for monetary policy, it seems to me, is exactly what the effect of rates is going to be on much of this on the [unintelligible], I'm not quite sure; also on housing, given the demographics [Unintelligible] may well be through the export sector, but they obviously will have an adverse effect on prices, which comes back to the issue of where we go next and how we relate that to yesterday's discussion  And Massachusetts  -81-    12/18-19/89  As many people have said here, it's very hard to judge the risks on one side or the other Mike Kelley's comment about his becoming a two-handed economist is appropriate here But even though the risks are fairly well balanced, we can't avoid the fact that this is a very high stakes game that we're in, particularly at this point The point that you made in terms of when we get a window is well taken as is the point that these changes that we're talking about are minute enough--minute may not be the right word, but they're not so gigantic that they're likely to have dramatically different costs in the longer run So in that circumstance, I prefer taking out a little insurance in the sense of protection on the financial fragilities side and the economy going down I would be comfortable with the 25 basis points but--and I think this is an important distinction--with symmetrical language I have one last point Another factor that weighs into this is that I strongly prefer taking the action, as Jerry said, at today's meeting Now is the time to do it  [Not] unless the door opens  I second  But Roger, to get back to Jerry's point, it does tend to make this show how close a call this was and the concern-- "
4017,1990-02-06," This was a very complete presentation and I just had two technical questions My first technical question has to do with the composition of auto sales as shown on Chart 5 As you know, we've been hearing for a long time a lot of anecdotal information from people in the auto dealership business and usually in the Big Three dealership business I'm wondering if there's a possibility that we're giving that too much weight Going back to 1987, say, if one    2/6-7/90  looks at the increase in the number of domestically produced foreign nameplate units--and from what I understand just from reading--in many cases the input [unintelligible], and in some cases engines, are produced domestically in the United States It's possible that we made a little too much at some point of the anecdotal information on the decline in the auto industry because of our natural instinct to look at the auto industry as Ford, Chrysler, and General Motors  I don't disagree with that, but given the demographics and the cycle of car financing and so forth, there is a question of just how responsive much of this is to interest rates  Also, if you look at the technical issues on this, cars are lasting longer as well  The second technical question, picking up on something Governor Angell said, has to do with the outlook on oil prices On Chart 20, in looking at the price per barrel on oil, what is the general outlook that you've factored in here in terms of natural gas suppliers? I hear from a lot of people that the natural gas bubble is starting to peter out and that there are concerns about pipeline capacity I thought maybe I should mention this, since we've had very substantial cutbacks in interruptable service in the Northeast  Thank you  Mr Chairman, if I could first turn to the District economy, there is somewhat of a dichotomy in the New England economy between what statistical measures indicate and the level of confidence In fact, if you look at the confidence survey that the Conference Bureau does by census region, there was really a dramatic decline over the last year The region went from being the highest in the nation with an expected outlook of 144 on the index to 72 now So, we've had a 50 percent decline in confidence in the region in a year But according to the recent data that we've actually seen, personal income on a per capita basis grew faster in New England than nationally  As for other closely related regional data, employment actually increased in the last two months of 1989 after declining earlier in the year The unemployment rate in the region now is about 42 percent and the per capita income is still 124 percent of the national average, so we were starting from quite a high base Having said that, we think a softening is inevitable We do expect that the unemployment rate in the region will go up and will exceed the national level and that there will be a concomitant decline in the relative rate of growth in personal income Thus far, the deterioration has largely been in the manufacturing and real estate sectors, exacerbated somewhat by newly emerging problems of financial institutions If the only problem were in manufacturing because of the high-tech adjustment problems, one could be relatively sanguine But I don't think that's the case Looking at recent experience, even though we haven't had any real reason for boom/bust, we are going through one now in the real estate and construction area It's to the point now where if someone calls a financial institution that they haven't had a long-going relationship with to talk about a real estate loan, it's almost like one of these commercials where people on the other end of the line just laugh and say something like ""You must be kidding! We're not doing any more real estate loans unless we have a    2/6-7/90  well established relationship with you or unless you have extraordinarily good collateral""  So, there is a great deal of doom and gloom This, of course, has been reflected in retail sales Our retail sales around Christmas were not terribly good, particularly in the durables area And we have an emerging inventory problem in that area and in autos and other areas I touched on the banking situation The increased risk premia are having a compounding effect outside of real estate We're hearing more and more, particularly from small and mid-size businesses, about greater difficulty in obtaining C&I credit I think that's consistent with what we've shown in the loan officers survey If you combine all of this with the severe fiscal problems and the essential political paralysis we have--certainly in Massachusetts and you can see it starting to emerge in Connecticut to some extent--it just doesn't paint a picture that is consistent with people having expectations that are going to keep spending up Actually, we found quite a contrast when we talked to our larger manufacturers in terms of their experience domestically, in the region, and internationally First of all, I should say that from the point of view of a producer, the labor market situation has improved markedly in New England Turnover rates are down dramatically Even in our Bank, turnover on the graveyard shift in the check production area is falling just astronomically  If you're on the buy side  That's right, but we are not in an AFL-CIO meeting And they have a little different view than we do on what is considered wage inflation as well In the case of our large manufacturers, we have an interesting phenomenon going on Many of them are suppliers to both the aerospace and the auto industries, and they certainly have seen a softening in their supplies to the auto industry But you may have noticed that firms like Textron are supplying more to the aerospace industry even though their auto business is off Big gains in aircraft are helping us out a lot In terms of forward-looking indicators, we do have a large paper industry, as you know, and actually that area is somewhat worrisome Paper and packaging materials tend to lead national cycles somewhat, and the demand for that does seem to be down and capacity utilization is down Interestingly, thus far, defense really has not been that much of a drag on the regional economy and that's of course because a lot of what we do is in the research and development area But large producers like Raytheon are attempting rather feverishly to diversify  Nationally, our forecast is not greatly different from the Greenbook It's just about the same in terms of unemployment and inflation; we have slightly stronger growth But we think the economy has softened Where I would have said before that we thought the risks were somewhat symmetric, I think the risks now are on the down side for the economy Obviously, we'll get into this when we talk about policy, but I think we're in a very difficult situation in that we're walking on this razor's edge There's a real question of how    2/6-7/90  long we will be able to walk on the razor's edge before getting cut or falling off and getting bruised Perhaps where we sit depends on where we stand, but I think this question of financial fragility is really something that can't be taken entirely lightly Having said that, I think that the arguments about concerns for greater inflation as compared to the softening of the economy can work both ways against fragility, which puts us in an extremely difficult bind in policy  Now people in the rest of the country, instead of saying we're not another Texas, are saying we're not another New England!  Don, you already mentioned it I was going to ask on the M2 forecast which way you thought the risks were or whether they were symmetric You said they were a bit on the down side?  That's good, too A follow-up question on that On balance, if commercial banks also were to decide to grow more slowly in this emerging caution that we see and decide not to fund [growth] in wholesale markets and people see some signs of less aggressiveness in the retail markets, would that work in the same direction?  Sure  -25-    2/6-7/90  Thank you  A lot of what we're talking about here relates to perceptions, which are hard to know And that always makes things very difficult I'd like to associate myself with two things Gary's comment about not being so worried about achieving zero [inflation] and holding where we are right now in the short run; and the consistency of that with your point that probably none of these things is going to happen over the next 5 years because of the intervening events So, I think we have to look at the longer-run ranges in terms of their consistency with where we want to go in the short run In terms of signal effects, like Governor LaWare, I had some sympathy for [unintelligible] going to 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent on M2 But then as I started to think about it, I viewed that as a balancing of risks--that the risk of not coming within the upper part of the range transcends the early benefits we get from having a signal And if we're going to stay with M2 [of 3 to 7 percent], I would be inclined--this is a question of market perceptions and I think most of the market looks at M2--to leave all the ranges the same rather than have the market saying If they came down on M3 and debt, why didn't they do something on M2? I'd also like to associate myself with Governor Angell's statement that this requires quite careful explanation--a fulsome explanation, perhaps is a better way to put it--in your testimony  May I ask a question? If we're going to move the debt target down a whole point and leave the M2 target the same--  Given where the M3 target is about to come in, is there some value of parallelism in the sense of people not seeing too much fine tuning in it and also going to 2 to 6 percent for the M3 target? I'm coming back to [the question] of whether we're doing this just for this period, this year, and not looking out beyond it  ""B"" symmetric Looking at things overall, I agree with your analysis I would like to make more progress against inflation, but in terms of moving now the international problem we talked about argues against that I am concerned about the financial fragility and do agree that a little lowering in rates isn't going to deal with that But a little lowering in rates could have some effect on the overall economy So, balancing these two things out, I come out with the view that we should stay just where we are, particularly with the move that we're making on the long-term side and what the Chairman is going to be announcing in the Humphrey-Hawkins testimony I think that's consistent with just being right down the middle of no change "
4046,1990-03-27," Second  Mr Chairman, I know of two or three instances in Boston where foreign loan production officers, foreign representation officers, have come in and taken over real estate deals with established developments in two cases and with a new development in another case  Manley, I think what's happening--if the evidence from our small neck of the woods has any relevance to this--is that some of the larger and pretty much creditworthy developers are finding alternative sources of credit and they really haven't slowed down a great deal The smaller and medium-size firms in the C&I loan area are suffering somewhat as a fallout of this experience They find it difficult to get working capital; [their access earlier] had existed on a relationship basis with institutions that now have difficulties because of the real estate problems  There's a change in the composition because the foreign banks are not coming in and picking up that financing  Move it  I have two questions One is In looking at the most recent CPI number, how much weight are you inclined to give to possible changes because of weather-related factors and seasonals in apparel, with much warmer weather early in the year? Will things potentially even out with the spring season earlier on? Is there a possibility that the seasonals were affected, perhaps biasing up the CPI excluding energy compared to the CPI?  The second question I have is that I'm rather struck by the change in the [unintelligible] of the Greenbook Over the next two years where you come out at the [end] is not terribly different from what you had last month  But what is different is this assumption for quite a substantial increase in short-term rates What I'm wondering is--you can answer this question either way--where we would come out at the end of this period in terms of the growth of inflation and also capacity utilization if we didn't have that increase in rates that's built into your forecast What would your answer be? Conversely, if we wanted to have significantly more meaningful progress on prices-- and I'll let you give the magnitude--how much higher would your assumption be for an increase [in interest rates]?  -11-    3/27/90  What kind of unemployment rate would you have at the end?  I think that has something to do with the characterization of what kind of time period and whether [an interest rate move of] 100 basis points is significant or not significant There's a difference between whether it's significant or not significant in terms of the real economy and whether it's significant or not significant in terms of how much the Committee moves in a relatively short time  -18-    3/27/90  Come back to--  To deal with the District first, the New England economy is not in phase with the rest of the nation Just this afternoon we were talking about regions and this perhaps is a good precedent for it because we're seeing a lot of difference by region The New England economy is relatively sluggish and in my way of thinking probably will be that way for the next year or so There had been some thought, by myself and others, that expectations were worse than reality; but unfortunately reality is doing a good job of coming up to expectations  Well, going down; that's right There's some question about how much relevance it has to national policy because I think a lot of this has to do with a sort of classic bubble, particularly in the real estate area, and some problems that we had in manufacturing And the accompanying financial situation, with the conversion of mutual savings banks to stock institutions, just put in place [unintelligible] in credit over a short period of time  We just had the data for regional employment benchmarked and, unfortunately, they show that for the region as a whole employment actually declined about 1 percent in 1989 It declined dramatically in some states such as New Hampshire where it dropped 3-1/2 percent Construction employment in that state dropped 25 percent Now, that's obviously a small state; but still, those are meaningful numbers In the short run we expect a continuation of this rather negative trend in the business outlook  On this credit crunch issue, given the problems with depository institutions that everyone knows about, just any super regional in New England is very, very wary of extending further credit for real estate loans I think that's going to be advantageous over the long run because we did have a bubble, but it means that construction, and to a lesser degree manufacturing, are going to act as drags on the economy in the period immediately ahead In manufacturing, the outlook tends to mirror more the national scene Firms tied to the aircraft industry account for a fair amount [of manufacturing activity] and are doing quite well Firms tied to the auto industry, which we also have, are doing quite poorly We have a sectoral problem in the [unintelligible] those in Bob Parry's District are doing, and I think it's going to take a while for that to turn around Overseas sales by manufacturers have been stronger than domestic sales and that has still held up despite what has happened with the dollar; people are very optimistic there Retail sales have softened but people are beginning to think that they are seeing some bottoming out in the softening, and there really aren't serious problems with inventories It could be a degree of concern that kept people from building up inventories too much Overall, there's a feeling of greater cautiousness among our manufacturers; I would expect that to be reflected in less vigorous orders for durable goods on their part in the coming year One sees this particularly in the paper industry where capacity [use] is actually still high but they  -27-    3/27/90  are just very cautious in going ahead Price reports, as you might expect in these circumstances, are quite good, with absolute declines in prices in residential and commercial real estate Labor markets are much better behaved, with people being able to find work where they couldn't before You don't see many $625 an hour signs up in the McDonalds' windows anymore, and you don't even find as many crowded McDonalds' stores  Nationally we find our own forecast for the economy to be very similar to that of the Greenbook, with some slight difference in timing quarter to quarter But as many people have pointed out, an exactitude of this process in timing really doesn't mean that much We are concerned, though we don't disagree with it, about the outlook for inflation As has been pointed out by Governors Angell and Johnson and others, this is really quite a cause for concern I would say that in the absence of concerns about the international scene or in the absence of concerns about financial fragility and some of these credit crunch stories that we're hearing--not two negligible factors, though--I would be inclined to feel that it's time to be really serious about progress on inflation and to move more vigorously Even with these considerations, I think on balance the risks nationally are for more inflation rather than the other way around And I think that our token [move] should be in that direction  That's not true of the thrift industry  Could I ask Ted just what he expects the impact would be in the exchange market if the funds rate were to rise 25 basis points?  How much is considerable? I'm not going to ask you for a point estimate, but what do you think [the effect would be] on the yen and the DM generally?  Well, we're in a very difficult situation, obviously, and when one is treading on eggs it's best to tread lightly In that regard, there is much to be said for your recommendation in terms of it being premature to make any move in terms of absolute [unintelligible] But I am concerned that the Greenbook shows what I think most of us consider an unacceptable inflation performance with an implicit assumption--whether it's significant or not you can debate--of a 100 basis point increase [in the funds rate] over the year So, I would say that on balance, because I think this issue of maintaining our credibility is very important, I would want to give the markets some signal that we were worried about inflation and I would have a slight bias toward going with an asymmetric directive  It's very easily demagogued; that's the really dangerous thing from our perspective  In that regard, Mr Chairman, how big is the breadbox in the sense of the $20 billion that we're talking about now relative to the position that we've had in the past vis-a-vis the amount of trading that's going on in the market? Sam started to talk about that and that's what I wanted to ask him Is this just an extraordinary buildup?  Following my esteemed colleague from Massachusetts, I withdraw  Why wouldn't we want to wait until we reach the point where there's a reasonable chance that we're going to have--? "
4055,1990-04-11," Mr Chairman, this is Dick Syron May I ask a question? Sam commented before, [and perhaps he can] expand on it, about concerns in the market about the weakness of US financial institutions "
4078,1990-05-15," Mike, just a technical question The inventory situation seems to be depending on how one looks at it Are we going through any sort of structural change over time? How much weight would you put on structural change toward just-in-time inventories and that sort of thing? Or are you thinking it's still a pretty accurate reflector of [unintelligible]? My own view of inventories is that we're likely to see a bounceback But do you think there's an argument against that and that [businesses are moving to] permanently lower levels of inventories?  Thank you, Mr Chairman Well, you know where the strongest growing states are; I can tell you where some of the weakest growing states are  No, it's New Hampshire, actually The economy in the region continues soft, although it's not in a steep decline Employment fell about 1 percent in 1989 We expect it to fall by another 1 percent in 1990 and we expect the unemployment rate region- wide to go north of 6 percent These assumptions are based on a model that was run without incorporating a national model with as much credit tightening as the Greenbook has in it Actually, it's interesting that by state, New Hampshire is by far the softest,  -11-    5/15/90  followed by Massachusetts and then by Connecticut The reason for that, I think, is that construction has turned down so much Construction [spending] region-wide has fallen about 10 percent, but it has fallen 25 percent in New Hampshire This is really micro data, but with it being a very important industry in southern New Hampshire particularly, and becoming almost an economic [unintelligible] in its own right like a traditional manufacturing industry, that's a swing that couldn't be avoided There is a substantial real estate overhang in the District Housing sales activity remains soft; housing inventory stays high I think housing remains soft in part because people are very unrealistic in pricing We don't seem to be getting real price adjustments Using the ultimate in anecdotal information-- what I am doing myself, and I just sold a house--I think you can move houses but you have to sell them for about 18 to 20 percent less than the price at the peak And people just generally aren't willing to do that I think it's going to be slow to come back because we're at quite a regional disadvantage now in terms of wages in light of the very strong growth that we had for some period of time And, obviously, we have serious tax problems; they are worse in Massachusetts but there are tax problems in Connecticut as well as some in New Hampshire To some extent, in a regional sense, there was no one to take the punch bowl away and what happened was that the region just got carried away  Going to the credit crunch issue, we think there is something there but it's very specific to small-to-mid-size businesses and to the construction area It's hard to say that in the construction area it's because of tighter supervision [of lending institutions]; we had other problems in that area In the aggregate data a lot has been made of the System's preliminary data saying that lending in New England is down 8 percent over last year We actually took that data and then adjusted it for two or three different things the large volume of loan sales by some of our large banks that are in trouble; the sale of credit card portfolios; and the writing off of some of the other real estate owned and other adjustments All that gets the reduction down from about 79 percent to about 1 percent So, credit is growing more slowly but no way near as slowly as the data indicate Outside the computer area, where I think we have specific problems, a large number of firms report that sales, while they haven't kept up their strength, are not off dramatically either, particularly in the national market Interestingly, our large [unintelligible] producers--and by that I mean firms such as Ratheon, General Electric and United Technologies--are anxious about the outlook and they are planning for a slowdown; but given lead times, they haven't felt much effect on production And they have had some success in converting plants to other products Interestingly, they find their export business and even import substitution are actually quite good For example, United Technologies just became a preferred supplier for--I guess we call them transplants--foreign-name plants producing modulars for doors and different things like that So, the export business is becoming more important to us, both directly and indirectly When we talk to people around the District, we're finding that inventories are quite lean Again, it's hard to sort out exactly, but they are quite lean at the retail level as well as at the manufacturing level  As far as the national economy goes, we're in substantial agreement with the Greenbook We had thought perhaps that inventories might affect us--that there was a chance for some breakout on the up    5/15/90  side in inventories because we think things are potentially a little stronger We're inclined to discount the retail sales report because of the noise and just see what happens when we get the next PCE report We're encouraged by the improvement in the PPI but it's still obviously [unintelligible] with substantial problems of inflation fourth quarter to fourth quarter In looking ahead--and this was a question I was going to ask but it was asked by Governor Angell among others--if we assume essentially no change in monetary policy, our feeling is that an already discouraging Greenbook inflation forecast would be significantly worse with the prospect of being substantially worse And in that context, we'd be concerned about labor compensation given some of the [upward] creep we've already seen in that area This will be covered during our policy discussion, but it may be easier to take out an insurance policy now rather than to wait until we get into a situation where we really have to crunch significantly later on I think it is true that credibility is important and can make it easier for us on the way down; but I'm starting to become concerned about losing credibility with inflation creeping up on us and our not having been able to change materially the direction of that That will increase the cost of our ultimately having to deal with it, and I think we ultimately will have to deal with it This is a speech, and I guess I should omit that  Mr Chairman, I think this is a matter of timing and I don't think [unintelligible] from one meeting to another is going to make a lot of difference We are always going to work and live in a world that has a great deal of uncertainty As the meetings go by the calls get tougher and tougher, and I'm not sure we can make it any easier I understand what people are saying about perceptions being important at this time; the budget issue is one that I think is very important But that can almost play both ways I would favor alternative B When we come to the matter of symmetry or asymmetry, I think the credibility issue is very important For that reason I would tend to favor asymmetric language--though that's almost splitting hairs, depending upon what the policy record says If the policy record is strongly worded enough and if it indicates the same thing--essentially that if economic data start to come in and lean more strongly than this most recent information and we don't see any improvement on the inflation front and the credit crunch really doesn't develop into something that's equivalent to the market tightening for us, then we understand that we are going to have to tighten in the future With that kind of language, I could more than live with symmetry, though I prefer the asymmetry  We want you to tighten now so we won't have to tighten later when we do vote! "
4103,1990-07-02," Well, I guess this is a Northeast economic story In New England our situation continues to worsen, and I'd have to say with some signs of cumulation But I don't think this is largely because of national factors Our own expectation for the region, given an economic performance nationally something like that in the Greenbook, is that the region will continue to decline well into 1992 and then level off but be slow coming back Retail sales are now quite weak with aggressive pricing; there are some bankruptcies, and inventories are becoming a problem There are some questions about weather influences because we have had a cool, rainy spring and purchases of things like gas grills and that sort of thing--once it gets past the fourth of July--may tend to be put off for another year unless they are priced very aggressively Contributing to all this is the banking situation, which I think we'd have to say continues to deteriorate We now have people actually becoming somewhat blase, about banking, which I guess could be either good or bad We have had a bank failure about every two weeks for the last two months  As these things happen successively, I suppose it is human nature that they draw less attention in the press It's really noticeable that they draw much less attention in the electronic media and on the radio than one might have thought Now, these are [mostly] small institutions With the exception of one $2-1/2 billion thrift institution, these are institutions of less than $1/2 billion  -10-    7/2-3/90  in size, so the impact is not enormously great But to cite one example A story that a $1/2 billion institution was going to be closing was in a gossip column in one of the newspapers two days before and it ended up having some problems but no severe runs or anything like that Interestingly, consumer confidence--and the decline we have had is pointed out in Mike's chart 4--is remaining about the same It's no longer falling in the region, which is a little hard to figure out, but it is at a quite low level Looking at sectors, construction is obviously at dead center, particularly in southern New Hampshire where it was very big And that is going to be a drag on the New England economy  It's almost conceivable! Interestingly, employment in services has been falling as well, particularly in finance, insurance and real estate, and also in wholesale and retail trade You just notice the availability of labor where there really had been a problem with availability in the services sector It is now much less of an issue at the wholesale and retail stores; the stores are actually tightening up and have not put as many salespeople on the floor as they had before because of the concern that they have Interestingly, the credit crunch question, although I'm not sure quantitatively or qualitatively that it has gotten any less pressing one way or the other, is becoming much less newsworthy and is drawing much less attention We took some loan data and adjusted for sales of loans and items that were changed to writeoffs and things like that, and we found that loan data pretty flat except for real estate, and there was some decline in consumer loans Manufacturing was really one bright spot, believe it or not Sales were mixed for our manufacturers--from 0 to 15 percent The two [unintelligible] see an increase [unintelligible] holding up relatively decently but a lot of these things are special factors For manufacturers, exports are more and more becoming an important source of sales Also, a lot of these things are in areas you might expect--in aerospace, as it has gone nationally, some types of electronics and defense-related products Our computer sector is still quite weak For the longer term there is quite a lot of concern about what defense means, and regionally I think we will see a substantial drag from state and local fiscal changes The Massachusetts budget deficit is about $14 billion for the current fiscal year and the next fiscal year is forecast to be about another $14 billion They are trying to arrange for some sort of [financing], part of that out 30-40 years Connecticut has a substantial problem, so there is going to have to be very significant [unintelligible]  As far as the national economy goes, given the policy assumptions last time, our view is that the Greenbook seemed a little optimistic; and given the policy assumptions this time, it seems to us slightly pessimistic I'd emphasize the ""slightly,"" particularly on the unemployment rate As has been noted, it does seem to put a lot of weight on this credit crunch issue I think that is so; at least it's discussed frequently--let me put it that way And it's very, very hard to know what that means There are lots and lots of unknowns out there; things are definitely softening but it's hard to see whether this is a pause or a trend In terms of policy, we need to see something on whether this will continue or not There are a  -11-    7/2-3/90  lot of weather-related issues in the retail sales data, particularly in fuels and personal consumption expenditures and in some of the GNP accounts I'm also skeptical of the month-to-month retail sales numbers So, I don't know that we can think at this point that the consumer sector is really going to weaken The export sector looks relatively healthy; residential construction look weak On the other hand, the purchasing managers survey this morning looked reasonably good The indicators of a recession don't suggest a [high] probability of that Unemployment hasn't risen; claims aren't rising, even though we've seen poor employment performance We just have an awful lot of unknowns out there, not the least of which is what is going to happen with fiscal policy We'll get into a discussion about this later today or tomorrow, but I think it's a very difficult period to make a decision to change [policy]  Well, on this business of a credit crunch--and I think we have had some severe problems along that line--in looking at these figures it's interesting that, once you've adjusted them, a lot of the fall-off is in areas you wouldn't expect to be price-driven-- ie, in consumer lending There is just no avoiding it; that's what's going on  Well, I agree with everything that President Forrestal, President Black, and Governor Angell have said I think that we are just about where we want to be, perhaps in the aggregates as well as in the real economy There is just an awful large number of unknowns out there with respect to the real economy, the behavior of velocity, and what is going on in financial markets From a policy perspective, I come out with a somewhat different result, but it's largely a matter of how one presents these things I agree that strategies I and II are the only relevant choices, given what we need to accomplish This really is a matter of velocity In terms of how one presents this in testimony to the [Congressional] Committees and how it's read in the broader financial public community, there is some value to indicating that we're willing to change targets as velocity changes and to indicating that these [ranges] do not have [the certainty] of a physical science by a long shot It makes it easier when we do have a problem to have indicated beforehand that we made these adjustments because of changes in velocity Generally I also think that we should try to have targets that are somewhere in the middle of the range that we adopt rather than going up [to Congress] and extensively explaining that we're not going to be in the range but that's because of all of these [reasons] I can see arguments on both sides of that, but that would be my preference Given that and given the slight change in or flat velocity between 1990 and 1991, I would be in favor of the staff's alternative shown on page 17 [of the Bluebook] for both 1990 and 1991 Because we would be making a substantial change this year, I think that would require a change next year given that we expect a more normal pattern of economic growth in relation to velocity Having said that, I would not be uncomfortable with--but I'm very worried about how to fine tune this image for 1990--changing, say, to an M2 range of 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent and whatever corresponding M3 range would be involved and then going to these ranges for 1991 But just as a matter of presentation, I'd prefer that we go up [to Congress] now and explain that there have been these changes and explain what our longer-term expectations are and how the monetary targets have to be adjusted for changes in velocity So, that's the direction I would take  On debt, I'm comfortable with 5 to 9 percent  A technical question, Mr Chairman Are you suggesting a 25 basis point cut anticipating we will have a conference call or are we voting for that now essentially unless there's a--  ""B"" I have a marginal preference for symmetric but I can certainly accept asymmetric I do have some of the concerns that Gary Stern expressed on the automaticity of the approach, but I am comforted by your explanation I think it's important to have in the Humphrey-Hawkins testimony an indication that we are not trying to lead the market down, but that we are not effectively trying to ease policy--that there has been some tightening in policy not at our volition and that we see this as bringing policy back more to where we get the [unintelligible] rather than the other way around I think that's actually quite an important distinction "
4128,1990-08-21," So move  In Part I of the Greenbook you talk about the revision in your inflation forecast and say that it's primarily because of the oil outlook I was just wondering, since we did have some other figures that came in before that--this is an exercise of speculation, I realize--if you had been redoing the Greenbook and [the invasion by] Iraq had not occurred, what rough estimate would you have had in terms of the forecast for the change in inflation?    8/21/90  Can I just follow up on that, in terms of the downward revisions? You revised down by 1/4 point, I guess, your estimate of potential But the revisions we saw in the actual data were pretty disturbing to say the least Were there any special factors that caused you not to revise down further? Or was it just that your model came out with about 1/4 point decline in potential given the data that we have? I was a little surprised that there wasn't a greater decline in potential, given that the unemployment rate remained the same  How sensitive is your model to short-term changes in demographics--the composition of the labor force?  Mr Chairman, the gloomy news continues to track the people from the Northeast The New England economy, I think, has continued softening at a somewhat faster rate than it had before--even in the pre-Saddam period That will be exacerbated to some extent by the Middle East problem--at least in terms of peoples' expectations-- in that as a share of energy provided we rely about 50 percent more on petroleum than the nation as a whole But the number of BTUs per dollar of output is only about 80 percent of the national output So, it tends to offset itself somewhat but not completely  In the District, the most pressing immediate issue continues to be a further softening--and almost a free fall in some parts--of the real estate market I don't know whether you've sold your house or not, David While we haven't heard anything about it yet, the oil situation could have an impact on vacation homes similar to that in 1973 and 1979, when people did not want to buy them because of concern about the greater cost of getting to them, and that's why we had a lot of softness in condos At that time--though it isn't true this time-- there was a concern about the supply of fuel to get to vacation homes Even before this came up, though, we really had a quite poor tourist season  Construction employment, of course, has fallen very strongly, but it still has a way to go Even though the level of construction employment has fallen very significantly, it is still above the 1981 level; so we think that will continue to be a drag Beyond that, we've seen weakness now spread to the services and trade sectors In the trade sector particularly, we've seen fairly significant declines in employment As for consumer confidence in the region, the Conference Board data show that even before this oil situation confidence had fallen 55 percent July-over-July I don't know how good these regional measures are, but several months ago New England was the only declining region Now it's striking that only three of the nine census regions--relatively small regions at that--show an increase in confidence  In terms of the less dim, if not bright, areas of the region's economy, I'd have to say that's in manufacturing exports I find a quite distinct pattern for manufacturers between their domestic business and their export business For the domestic business, our survey shows them about flat to down 10 percent; but their export side is up about 5 to 20 percent Interestingly, and I think this reflects something that Bob Parry said, we've started to see some turndown--and we have secondary suppliers--in the aerospace industry and we've started to be greatly concerned about how soft things are But we're beginning to see some hope that defense cutbacks won't be as great [as anticipated] In fact, at Raytheon, one or two contracts have been  -20-    8/21/90  continued that were expected to be dropped Credit availability continues to be much talked about and I think is a somewhat broader problem A relatively small thrift operator came in and said he has told his loan officers ""If it isn't gold, don't bring it in to me"" I don't say that that's a particularly widespread view, but I think it reflects something about the people in general working out problems  As far as the national economy goes, it's far too early into this whole situation to know what the impact is going to be in terms of disruption We need to look at things in terms of before Saddam and after Saddam My own reaction is that I am quite struck by any overreaction to it I'll admit that I was struck by the revisions on the GNP numbers--that what we saw when they came out [differed so much] from what [we thought] had happened before And on the basis of that, I myself have some concerns about confidence and a little concern that the Greenbook forecast might be a bit on the strong side, actually However, I also have--maybe it's a reflection of being a [unintelligible] from the Northeast--an increasing concern about this issue of financial fragility in almost all of our large institutions Thus, on balance, I would have thought the economy seemed somewhat softer before the Iraqi business, though perhaps not to the point of dictating a policy change I don't know if we know enough yet to determine what's going to happen With the degree of [military] buildup that we're going through, it seems to me entirely possible that--even short of an absolute shooting war--before too long we could get to a point where we will get some stimulative effect on the economy, particularly if the reserves are called up We have had, as everyone has, some reserves called up already in our District I also am somewhat concerned about the patterns in consumption and the steepening of the yield curve in the context of the international situation So, I think the discussion in the policy section is going to be very lively indeed  I guess the first law of medicine is do no harm It seems to me that you're suggesting that that might be the first law of central bankers in these circumstances I have a lot of sympathy with that I think of the whole situation in a sort of ""BS,"" before Saddam, and ""AS,"" after Saddam way I must confess that before Saddam I was somewhat inclined to think on the basis of the data we had coming in--the GNP revisions, other developments, and the financial situation--that some moderate easing along the lines of 25 basis points might be appropriate But in the wake of what has happened in the Middle East, with the further steepening of the yield curve and the intermingling of the concern of inflation expectations for a variety of reasons and also what has happened in the foreign exchange market, it's a somewhat hazardous course to make any change at this point in time until we have somewhat more certain information about what's going to happen with the dominant event As you point out, the dominant event will be something not determined in this room I must confess to being somewhat dismayed by your odds I'm not disagreeing with them because I'm sure you know more than we do, but still it's fairly discouraging I agree with the ""B"" asymmetric; and because it is a long time in this environment until October 2nd, I think we may need some consultation before then "
4168,1990-09-17," Ed, Dick Syron May I ask a question?  I agree with your analysis about where the economy is Certainly, in the First District our sentiment is comparable to that in the 1973 recession in terms of people's expectations I agree with your view of what's going to happen in the fourth quarter, and I think a move in the easing direction [is appropriate] But I am wondering about the timing If we were to take the course that you mentioned, which is to explain that we're easing--even before a budget accord has been reached and with the uncertainties in the Middle East--because the economy is so soft, how much weight would you give to the chance that people would expect further easing because they would be saying ""Gee, the Fed has gone ahead and eased, when they clearly didn't want to, preferring to wait for a budget accord They must think things are awfully bad"" "
4193,1990-10-02," They have to find something to look for  Nationwide  Mike, I know a lot of this is because of the oil issue, but I have one technical and one substantive question The technical question Is the big [drop] that we see in the first quarter of 1991 in the CPI because of what you already have anticipated on the excise tax?  My other question relates to your forecast of two mildly negative quarters but then quite a bounceback I know that it's completely [impossible] for anyone to forecast what's going to happen in the Middle East, but I just wonder how likely your forecast is from a much more qualitative point of view Perhaps I'm factoring too much into this for how likely I think the credit crunch is and how much momentum I think this downturn could cumulate once we get into it, particularly on the consumer confidence side That may or may not be offset by the assumption you had to make about when oil prices would change that  Is there an historical analog for a disturbance causing this kind of muted downturn but then bouncing back this quickly?  Thank you  Thank you, Mr Chairman As far as the First District goes, the situation is not very ambiguous Activity has clearly slackened and it is becoming softer--with a lot of variation, of course, sector by sector In the real estate sector, of course, we are seeing some adjustment in prices Residential prices on average are down about 15 percent; condominium prices are down 40 to 60 percent depending on where they are; and commercial rental rates are down about 33 percent Consistent with that, 90 percent of the banking assets in the District are now in institutions that we have rated either currently or prospectively as 3s, 4s, and 5s, and about 55 percent are in institutions that are 4s and 5s As you talk to people, it is interesting that in many ways it seems that businesses are gloomier the closer they are to the consumer Sales of white goods and appliances generally are quite poor and are poorer than we expected, even given the housing cycle Car sales have been bad but  -22-    10/2/90  not really awful, with essentially mixed changes as they have been nationally and fewer sales of small trucks Talking to [retailers in] different types of apparel stores, what we found--and I suppose this isn't unexpected--is that the discounters are doing significantly better than traditional upstairs stores, but even they are finding an enormous amount of price sensitivity Real specials when they run them--I talked to a representative after they had an extraordinary special--will bring people in, but on a day-to-day basis people won't come in And, one interesting thing that some of the people who run these discount chains tell me is that they obviously are keeping their inventories very lean, but they have the perception that the people they buy from also are keeping inventories lean and that's one reason they are not expecting a terribly good Christmas season They think they may not see the surplus of goods coming into them that they have seen in earlier periods Interestingly--I'm not sure it means an awful lot except noise--consumer confidence bounced up in the region from 28 to 37 [Laughter]  With our manufacturers, the outlook is somewhat more mixed Computers are quite weak, even including their export sector; that is a relatively recent change But I will say--maybe this is consistent with what Mike was talking about regarding expectations on the new IBM systems--that people who produce fabricated metal boxes that the computers go in say that they are doing reasonably well and that they are expecting pretty good orders further down the line Manufacturers of longer lead time products that utilize manufacturers [unintelligible], such as those who produce power systems and locomotives, are still doing reasonably well  The credit issue continues to be very, very difficult There is an enormous amount of nervousness about this and, as other people have said, it's a daily story in the newspapers and on the talk radio shows, which is kind of an ultimate index of these things Some significant tightening is probably appropriate in home equity line conditions by banks And we have seen some businesses that really are very substantial in size actually cutting back their capital spending or being more cautious on capital spending because of a concern about how much more debt they want to take on They are becoming very, very worried just about the environment and the attention that is being paid to different quality paper In that regard, mutual funds that we talk to are very, very nervous about all types of bank paper and a lot of them have cut back on it And we're seeing substantial outflows from junk bond funds, which again I suppose is what one might expect  As far as the national outlook goes, we're pretty much in agreement with the Greenbook, although we have this question of whether we will get as much of a snapback as quickly But again, I think that is a slightly different perception on the credit side I would say that with respect to that one issue, which we think might cause some cumulation of this [slowdown], there really is a lot of nervousness about the financial fragility question Looking at the latest two examination reports on shared national credits and highly leveraged transactions, the increases in classifications in those areas are just very, very substantial So the concern I would have, even if we get into what should be a relatively mild downturn precipitated by a supply interruption, is that that could cause significant problems for some of these institutions, which will  -23-    10/2/90  further tighten the credit situation and may expand a slowdown beyond one induced by a supply constraint  Ted, can I ask you--this is slightly different than what you assumed--what your view is on the pressure on the dollar under ""A"" and then ""A prime,"" if we part with the assumption that something is done on the budget deficit?  ""A"" is the traditional ""A"" ""A prime"" is ""A minus/B,"" I guess  Could I ask your degree of nervousness about a cumulative decline on either of these things?  Columbus Day  It will improve their earnings  Just a specific question, Mr Chairman I have a lot of sympathy with what you suggest The specific question has to do with timing You would envision next Tuesday Would you also envision, without putting too fine a point on it--I know this is an action by the Board--the reserve requirement action being announced around the same time?  But the budget action this week--excuse me--is a binding decision, right?  SPEAKER(?) That's correct  Well, I would agree with the program with all these different components The reason is that I'm not upset with [unintelligible] there is in the Greenbook that we need to do something about inflation in sort of a [unintelligible] But I don't think we're going to get it--and [this reflects] my own degree of nervousness about the financial markets--without doing something As I look at this, I think the reserve requirement part is important I    10/2/90  look at the reserve requirement part as having something to do with bank earnings and the longer-term threat to [the viability of] the financial system I look at the 25 basis points that will be done early next week as something that is in return for what is--when you assign probability to it--a significant degree of fiscal restraint  No automaticity "
4217,1990-11-13," A billion dollars would do it?  So move  SPEAKER(?) Second  I have a fair amount of sympathy for what Bob Parry said because I think it's somewhat consistent with the discussion we had earlier in the day We ought to say what we're doing when it's possible and do what we say If this is something that we're really not paying much attention to and it's hard to think that we are--and this is separate from the substantive point--I really wonder why we have it there That was a very effective rhetorical question that Lee asked--whether the 4 percent range was really affecting Peter very much now So, I'm sort of driven to the polar extremes just to drop it out of the directive completely or to go to something that leaves it in there and then also add something like the sentence in the fourth suggestion--the sentence on what's happening in    11/13/90  the real economy and the statement that the Chairman has a great deal of discretion, which is what I think should be the case So, in the interest of simplicity, I'd come out in favor of just dropping it  That's another sensitive question, but I think it's worth--  Cuts back [unintelligible] on phone calls  At the risk of repeating David's question at the last meeting--I'm going to make an assumption sort of going forward-- let me ask this question On the basis of having made a forecast that to me is a little optimistic given no change in policy--and you qualified that in what you said, Mike--I'd be interested in your reaction as to which way you think the risks are of not coming out on your forecast You mentioned, and I'm particularly interested in, the snapback issue Given the continued expectation of problems on the credit flow side, I have a little question about the mechanism by which we get a snapback without a change of policy in two quarters  There is never an awful lot of comfort in these things, but are you much more uncomfortable in terms of your distribution about how long it takes to come back--whether it's two quarters, three quarters, etc?  Thank you, Mr Chairman As far as New England goes, the economy obviously continues to deteriorate Bob Parry's report sounded like [his District was in] the early stages of some of the things we complain about I'd say that in a sense the rate of decline [captured] in the second derivative may be turning a little in that the steepness of the decline seems to be attenuating a bit A lot of this is in real estate, obviously In the residential area we've actually seen prices decline by probably about 20 to 25 percent; and that is bringing greater activity and activity has sort of stabilized The commercial area is still quite poor, with vacancy rates up around 25 percent in the suburban areas Related to that, we're seeing an absolute decline in hookups for electrical power, which by the way ends up being very coincident with nonpayments or corporate delinquencies for electrical bills; it's very highly correlated with that We've seen a substantial jump in that and a significant jump in bankruptcies, particularly among customers of Massachusetts utilities  Well, I want to get a charge out of it; we try to stay plugged in! In our manufacturing sector, demand is weakening with a few exceptions; interestingly, net exports now are declining  -24-    11/13/90  for our manufacturers except for a few off the shelf items that have improved somewhat in the computer area The retail area is very soft, with a lot of price promotions Actually, there are a lot of complaints among retailers that the weather has been too good thus far this fall and that there really have been soft sales of heavy winter clothing Retailers say that they're in pretty good shape on inventories, but they're trying to be very, very cautious and push a lot of stuff out of the door before the Christmas season Most of them feel that they just don't want to go into December carrying very much  The banking sector, I'm afraid we have to say, is truly dismal Some asset markets just literally have ceased to exist And this is not just in the real estate area; I'm talking about loans to small businesses and that sort of thing As a result of all this, I think the good news--and perhaps it's somewhat better than in the nation--is that we're seeing some improved price performance, though [unintelligible]  I'm concerned, though, about the implications both for the region and nationally of all of this on confidence as far as the bounceback goes I must say with regard to the national economy that if I thought we could get the kind of result that's in the Greenbook with the policy implications that are contained in the Greenbook, I'd be happy to take it in a way But Mike made the point, and I think it's the relevant one, that it depends on what one thinks is causing all this The forecast seems a little too optimistic, though perhaps my view is too much influenced by our local situation But I don't think this is all an oil phenomenon; I think it has to do particularly with the credit situation I'm also worried to some extent, given the outlook in Canada and the United Kingdom, just how much export growth will continue to be a source of strength and bring us out of the weak economy here I must say--and this is somewhat related but not directly to what we do in the funds market--I've developed what I'm afraid are [unintelligible] some radical beliefs I used to think you couldn't have a credit crunch, as we traditionally found, unless there was a breakdown in markets It feels somewhat silly raising this, but I think what is becoming more and more an issue nationwide, and it is for real, is that we need to take some steps to reconcile our objectives in macro policy with what we're doing in the supervisory area I must say I hate to raise that because it apparently goes against a lot of things we all believe But I just can't come to a different conclusion because regardless of what we do in policy--and we're constrained with the dollar on one side of the prospective policy--it would take an awful big move to divert some of the enormous increase in conservatism and risk premiums by many lending institutions, and not just commercial banks, given the problems that they have There are several actions that we could take in that area, though as I say they're not directly germane to today's [discussion] on what has to be done But I think we really have to give an awful lot of thought to that as being part of how we proceed--that leaning against the wind may apply to supervisory policy in many cases just as well as monetary policy I hope that in these observations I'm overly influenced by parochialism, but that may not be the case  I think it's the least-worst [position] and I support it I'm concerned about the fragility issue, but I'm not sure any greater move would do anything beneficial; it may not  Yes, give them two things to talk about no last sentence and no M3! "
4232,1990-12-07," Dick Syron here May I go back and ask Mike Prell a question?  Mike, can I ask you to speculate--I guess that's the word--a little about the time lags on the impact or a range of impacts if, say, the Middle East situation were to be widely resolved or at least if there were a substantial diminution in warfare If that were to happen by mid-January, what kind of impact would that have and what might one speculate about the time lags?  Mr Chairman, this is Dick Syron I talked to the managers of two of the main private stores in the area I think their views are influenced largely by the extraordinarily pessimistic climate here but they went into the period expecting weak sales and [sales turned out] to be even softer than they had feared And I think there is almost an edge of panic on their parts and the sense of other retailers--  Mr Chairman, I might just put a technical note to that The feeling here is that some of the sales [results] are due to the very warm weather we have had this season; that has had really a significant effect And now we need [unintelligible] merchandise advertised in the beginning Today some have spring merchandise, believe it or not, when it should be time just about for the coincidence of the first major snow  Well, our oil spending is down!  Mr Chairman, since we're in this general discussion, I guess one would take it that Sam thinks that the discount rate move would not have a major effect in the exchange markets at this point, that one quite [unintelligible] The other issue, which I hate to raise again since it seems [heretical], is that I do think at some point that we are going to need to raise again this issue or at least the perception out there of the change Be it real or not, it has been an [unintelligible] Maybe I'm speaking too much from being close to some of the fire here, but until there is some change in perceptions I think we are going to have difficulty with the money supply "
4255,1990-12-18," Second  Peter, you mentioned market expectations of what might happen next in terms of rates or even a discount rate move  You noted what the situation was and the range of expectations developing in the market To what extent is that difference due to this year-end situation? In other words, people are saying that it may be a while before something happens; how much are they influenced by the year-end situation? Is it markedly different than if we were at the same place in the cycle--if it's possible to determine that--and this were July rather than December?  Thank you  Would this have been seen as a possible temporary change or do you think the market would interpret this as either a change in operating procedures as far as what we said about the borrowings or a ratification of a change that may or may not have occurred in operating procedures? If we were to go effectively to no difference [between the funds rate and] the discount rate or a penalty discount rate without saying anything about--  Thank you, Mr Chairman I had thought until relatively recently that we were beginning to see some signs of a sort of second derivative in New England--a turnaround to some potential flattening But I must say, given the beginning of a slowdown in the national economy, that that's probably not in the cards at this point We have seen some real evidence in the region of markets working in an    12/18/90  entirely favorable sense in terms of better price performance and better asset levels [unintelligible] in wage levels As far as the District itself goes--and I don't know what the implications of this are for the nation--retailing looks very, very soft People are out; there is activity in the stores, but people are not buying Promotions haven't been that effective, and retailers say they don't expect that people are going to be buying after the first of the year This isn't a case of delaying purchases; it's a case of people just saying ""I'm not going to buy very much more"" I talked to some people yesterday at major department stores who indicated that it has been a very poor Christmas season thus far for their outlets, both locally and nationally And consistent with that is what we see in credit card activity We talked with some people at credit card unit and they said year-over-year the level of charges in New England is down 3 percent, compared to up slightly nationally I don't know what the national implications of this are, but certainly in New England an important factor has been the loss of paper wealth in [declining values of] housing We're beginning to do some work on this and very very crude estimates would indicate paper wealth reductions of $600 to $800 billion in the region's real estate That is very significant on a personal income of about $290 billion in terms of any sort of consumer consumption factor I think housing construction in the area still has to go down a ways As I said, we have seen some real improvement in prices, with some spec housing having declined 40 to 50 percent in price and land prices also having declined in some areas  Well, it's an improvement because the price level was just so high that it wasn't consistent with any long-term viable economic gain  It just stops being solvent at those prices I think that's an important point; I'm glad you mentioned that Actually, until recently the transaction level had improved a bit, but land prices had very significant changes, again involving speculation in developed lots, finished lots In some cases we know of, transaction prices were down 1/2 and in a few cases 3/4 from the original asking price We're also seeing this in labor markets, where there has been a very dramatic improvement [in the availability of] marginal labor, if you will--for warehouse labor, McDonald's labor, and that kind of thing The banking situation has been pretty bleak and obviously is going to continue to be so for a while; some bad news seems likely after the first of the year As far as the credit crunch goes, I think we have seen indications that some of the larger banks are attempting to improve their earnings as they go out to increase their willingness to lend At this stage, that really hasn't been translated very much into increased activity, given the concerns that are going on Manufacturing is generally weak, with some exceptions Some exports are doing fairly well as are some short-term defense- related items, particularly missiles ordnance that has to be replaced Capital spending looks quite weak to us In talking to some people-- and one has to remember that 1981-1982 was a fairly benign period relatively in New England--we hear them comparing the current period  -10-    12/18/90  to 1974-1975, and they are saying that they are just going to wait a while before they do any spending and that survival is the most important thing I think a good side of all of this is that it has brought an increased awareness of the excesses of the past We hear from more and more people ""Let's just get this over with as quickly as possible and go on to something in the future""  I agree with Bob Parry in terms of the forecast; what we look at internally suggests that the fourth quarter could be a little weaker than the Greenbook [forecast] As far as the national economy goes, I think we may well face somewhat of a bimodal potential outcome I personally find the Greenbook a feasible forecast, albeit with somewhat of a change in conditions--some modest further easing However, I am concerned about some of the imponderables [such as] consumer confidence Historically, if you look at the data, these periods of oil price run ups and then improvement have been associated with a real bounceback in consumer confidence This may be different because of the issue of diminishing war fears I don't know that I think this will wash out, but the perceived decline in wealth nationwide that Gary mentioned, given what is going to happen to housing prices, may have an effect On the exports side, there's some concern about whether foreign economies, particularly that of Japan, will be as strong as we might hope And given what's happened to prices, I think housing nationally will be depressed for a while So, even without a real problem in the financial sector, there are a number of factors that could tip us over to the other side--into the second of the two modes I think all this argues for taking out some modest insurance on where we're going; I don't think in any sense that it means one should panic I think we have made, or are in the process of making, substantial improvement on prices And the issue is to keep that improvement but at the same time be vigilant so that this doesn't really tip over into something that none of us wants Thank you  Peter, you made the point that you thought the market might be expecting something like 1/2 point on the discount rate and 25 basis points initially on the funds rate I find that overall approach fairly attractive But I'd like to ask Gretchen Is that generally in the neighborhood of what's expected in the exchange markets as well?  Would there be some comfort, if I can use that term, to the exchange markets by what would be conveyed in the sort of press release that Don talked about?  If the Board voted not to accept the recommendation of the majority of the Reserve Banks, what would be the expectation, if I can use that phrase, of what the Chairman would do?  25 basis points now and maintain asymmetry toward ease?   -36-  Oh, yes    12/18/90  Mr Chairman, I like your suggestion exactly as it was put I disagree with Lee in the sense that I think what the FOMC ought to do--I'm not a voting member--is vote to make a 25 basis  -40-    12/18/90  point cut with asymmetric language toward ease It is true that this is not a policy-induced recession I think that's a very important point It is also our responsibility to take into consideration the world as it exists, and I think what you suggested does that without panic on the down side I think it's very important that we now move ahead, but I must say I feel some of Tom Melzer's concerns about how quickly we'll adjust, being a confessed asymmetric monetarist We may not react as quickly on the up side It's important that the FOMC vote for what it thinks should be done, and I'm a little wary of getting into things that have too many conditions This is a very difficult question Besides the results of being on horseback here, there are too many things that are permutations and combinations--that if A happens we'll do this and if B happens we'll do that We ought to say what we think should be done, and I think your suggestion did that  That's pretty precise!  SPEAKER(?) You want to bet?  Why don't we say consumer prices have improved somewhat "
4267,1991-01-09," This is Dick Syron David, could I add something just as an observation on Ed Boehne's question about what is happening in terms of the Districts? I know this is happening somewhat nationwide but we have the comparative data by District and, as you might expect, we have seen a very, very substantial increase in noncompetitive tenders [for Treasury] securities here We have been following this, obviously, on an issue-to-issue basis and it is really quite [wild] on a year-over-year basis I think it is consistent with your hypothesis that to some moderate extent increased concern about holding funds at various institutions may account for some of this, at least in some parts of the country "
4275,1991-02-01," Mr Chairman, this is Dick Syron I'm not at all uncomfortable with what you have done; it's absolutely the right thing But I would just ask a question on procedural grounds In terms of the perception of the market in the future when things are disclosed, I wonder whether you might want to have this be an official meeting of the Committee and have a formal vote of the Committee as a whole on what some would interpret as the second [intermeeting] reduction in the funds rate  I'm sorry; I guess I didn't understand when the 50 basis points would show through to the funds rate Is it going to show through to the funds rate today?  Don't get me wrong; I don't have any problem at all with what is being done I am thinking [about this] in a perception sense And I must say that I'm thinking about the perception in relation to the stories that were in the press early last month, which I thought were counterproductive, to the effect that there was a schism within the Committee and that the presidents at least were dragging their feet in terms of moving [rates] down In the sense of erasing any of that notion, it's clearly your judgment and the Chairman's in terms of how you think the markets will react to this But I'm just wondering if erasing that notion by having a vote might be worth considering  Okay, thank you "
4303,1991-02-05," What do mean by that?  Move the nominations closed  Second  Second    2/5-6/91  Second  Mr Chairman, I understand that it is your intent just to drop this now, but do you anticipate that this will be reexamined and revisited?  Second  Sam, and Peter also With respect to what you in the market hear, do you hear much more in the way of concern about overseas purchases of US debt securities? How much has this been an issue and how much do people anticipate it becoming more of an issue? Or do they?  But this is a financial fragility risk question as well as a question about the dollar  Peter, with respect to the relationship between the RP rate and the funds rate Have you had to alter your stopouts  -11-    2/5-6/91  or other terms in an effort to get to a particular funds rate in this [intermeeting period]?  But there has been a meaningful change?  Mike, just a question, going back to what Bob asked Though it's not enormous, the swing in the impact of government [spending] in the second quarter is 03 How much of that is state and local and how much is federal? It may be reflecting what we see all the time but I'm becoming more and more bearish on the state and local [sector]  But the 3/10ths might be just GNP?  Okay  Yes  Thank you  Actually, Ed Boehne and others have said much of what I wanted to say In terms of the situation in New England, unfortunately, I don't think one can characterize it any other way than as dismal, with pessimism on the edge of panic At this point there really is no source of strength with the possible exception of Patriot missiles for which Raytheon is running three shifts a day, seven days a week When people turn on CNN there is almost a perverse desire to see another one go up because it means more production!  About 2,000 in that particular facility  There is some export strength As for employment, though we started at a substantially lower unemployment rate and a higher per capital income [unintelligible] the 1973-75 recession years, the decline in employment we're seeing in New England now is at a substantially faster rate than at any time in the postwar period That also holds true for the change in growth in personal income This is having the impact you'd expect Retailing is extremely soft; we're seeing very widespread discounting of all merchandise When we talk to retailers they say ""Once this inventory is gone we are not building any inventories We're tired of doing this"" Actually, that may be somewhat favorable in the longer term We're seeing a change in the composition of the retail outlets, even in fairly affluent neighborhoods, more toward discount stores Tonier places are closing and there are more vacancies And we are seeing price improvements going along with this  As you have all read, we have an extraordinary degree of financial nervousness It's to the extent that on the talk shows every morning as you're driving in you can dial up and get the Tracy Report and for $20, which you can charge to your Mastercharge, you will be sent a list of safe Swiss banks where they say you should be sure that you have some of your money We've shipped out close to $400 million in the last several weeks in emergency cash payments [because of] runs in Rhode Island People are calling in to question the safety of the FDIC There are some real concerns about our larger institutions and some other mutual funds and insurance companies are raising questions with us about how they can be sure that they'll be protected if they have a fail in a repo transaction during the day and it goes into overnight or if they send in funds in anticipation of funds in an ACH transfer and an institution is closed In fact they have come with proposals to have that stuff essentially swept off the bank's books onto our books overnight The surprising thing is that the banks are so panicked about it that large institutions have come to us and asked if we can do this I think the only way to look at the economy is that we have a long way [to come] back A friend of mine just did a real estate forecast which is being hailed as greatly optimistic because he shows the beginning of some bottoming out and a snapback in 1995 Compared to a lot of other people's forecasts, actually it is relatively optimistic The recovery there is going to be quite slow  -25-    2/5-6/91  As far as the national economy goes, it seems to me that an awful lot has to do with what happens to confidence Mike I think pulled everyone's line and appropriately so by saying ""rosy scenario"" I have been inclined, as have others, to accuse the forecast of being somewhat rosy But in particular I think the simulations that Mike showed at the end are very useful in dealing with that So much depends on confidence No one knows how long the war is going to last My own naive view of this was that if we had a sort of Nintendo war that was over in a week, there might be some great exuberance and people would feel like they should go out and spend But even if this war goes on for several more weeks or a couple of months, I don't see it leading to a great bounceback in consumer confidence As far as the oil price impact on confidence, relatively recently we've seen some improvement in oil prices And I do have to admit that I bought the credit crunch story late in New England and now have to eat crow with a lot of people and admit that they were right I think the chart you showed was very useful but we're not at the high point nationally in terms of where we'd be [with respect to] a credit crunch number All those things weigh a little on the down side, so I'm inclined to think that the forecast may be slightly or a little more than slightly optimistic But if that's the situation, as I say, I think the simulations or the scenarios that were shown at the end [of the chart show] are the way to go Because of my own, perhaps biased, concerns about financial fragility, I'd be prepared to take out some insurance now with the notion that we would, as Ed said, make a commitment that we'd be willing to turn quickly if we're wrong and we don't need it  VI  Don, I find myself in great sympathy with what you said I have a technical question having to do with this issue of V2 and the credit crunch--not the New England credit crunch, but the national credit crunch The chart we saw yesterday in the chart show indicated that, in terms of this particular measure of the credit crunch, we are not in a much different place than we usually are at this stage in the cycle But part of your velocity forecast assigns some weight to the credit crunch, doesn't it? It may be consistent with the earlier data; that's what I'm trying to get a hint on  But the smaller business borrowing would be mostly from banks  I fully support what you suggest  I think we're  in a time when the course of the economy is  uncertain, the course of  world events is uncertain, and the course of the behavior of the aggregates vis-a-vis the economy is uncertain And in the context of  all of this, we are also in a period when everyone is watching what we do extraordinarily closely It seems to me that it makes all the  -41-    2/5-6/91  -42-  sense in the world to be would presume that fairly  -44-  2/5-6/91  the throws of the agonies of the unemployment  rate and reduced output,  we have the potential to run [over  on] the other side And we're  going to need the excuse to come  back And I think a 6 percent  ceiling gives us the excuse  to come back and raise interest   rates  quicker than the  6-1/2 percent ceiling  Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation with asymmetry Many of the reasons have been given before; one is that there's a long interval before the next meeting I think we may have to do something before the next meeting, and [it makes] sense to take out insurance on the fundamental policy side I do agree very strongly with the comments that Wayne made--and it's reassuring that everyone has made them--on the importance of recognizing the scenarios that were shown [I'm pleased] that we're willing to pay the premiums involved in this insurance policy if we do have to [ease] in the intermediate period rather than being tighter and I think we all should realize that there may be a difficult period coming out of this one The only comment I would make is--and again this may be more appropriate for the [non-FOMC] lunch discussion--that we may well have to do something more on the discount rate before doing more on the funds rate because with a 6-1/4 percent funds rate and a 6 percent discount rate, given people's aversion to borrowing, effectively, we have a penalty discount rate right now I think it's equally likely that the next move may well be a cut in the discount rate without a further change in the funds rate  -54-    2/5-6/91  That's right "
4327,1991-03-26," I think enough has been said about this and I agree with the gist of what has been said about more communication I have what may be a more technical question on this issue Just how does having what may be close to, or effectively considered to be, a penalty rate by many people affect the implementation of policy by    3/26/91  Peter Sternlight? I know we've had some discussion and I'm not directly addressing what has happened, but I'm wondering as we proceed if it's worth at some point having someone crank out something on how much of an issue or concern this is for the Desk--ie the relationship between the funds rate and the discount rate when we're in a period such as we're in now  Well, just in my own thinking about it, I would find that helpful  I was thinking that as we go forward this probably won't be an issue; but if it comes up again, it would be helpful to know  David Mullins asked my question  One minor point though, Charlie I understand what you're saying and it's relevant to something Governor Angell and also the Chairman said In a sense over time the natural tendency, then, will be to accumulate more and more reserves That's the direction it will go in So the cost of holding them, presuming we had a conceptual framework where we model all this, is not completely symmetric in the sense that at least under current arrangements we can borrow if we need to Well, apparently we can; I know it's not always possible, [but generally] we can borrow if we need to get [foreign currencies] but at this point in time we don't have a mechanism for disposing of them when they get to a certain level So, that [leads me to] a judgment--I realize this isn't precise--that as we proceed our bias should be to sell as these [balances] begin to accumulate, given the difficulty of selling as compared to accumulating  It's not much, but it does seem germane to what you said I think the [view] of the Committee would be that if such a window should open up in the not too distant future, you wouldn't necessarily want to take the time for very extensive [consultation] with the Committee I would interpret this discussion to mean that the Committee would be happy to have that happen  I find this whole issue of where we are on the discount rate compared to the funds rate very interesting and one that I don't completely understand in terms of the market's reaction to it In that regard, Peter, I just wanted to ask Is there confusion out there when you read the screens and you see all of these comments that people are making, particularly given the strength of the dollar, about expecting that something might be done on the discount rate just for alignment purposes? I'm not saying we should change procedures here, but at some point it would be nice if people knew what we were intending or not intending by this whole situation But maybe there isn't this confusion in the marketplace  There's a quite ambiguous statement in the Bluebook about a change in the funds rate having--I can't recall the exact words--a pronounced and pretty short-term impact on the exchange rate of the dollar, etc What's the parallelism between that and the discount rate?  Without it showing through  Mr Chairman, considering the meterological analogy, spring hasn't come to New England yet either in terms of the economy or the weather; it was snowing when we left there yesterday One would be hard pressed to call our situation ""mixed"" I think on balance it's still pretty negative There are a few glimmers of hope; there is some fairly significant improvement in the sales of existing homes, consistent with what is happening nationally That might be expected, given that the prices probably have fallen about 20 to 25 percent We did a survey of auto dealers in the last couple of days to find out what is going on Some hope is being generated with increased foot traffic but not sales as of this point yet Actually, dealers did not believe that they would get [increased] sales this quickly after the foot traffic went up In manufacturing, the only strong point that we have--and I might be stretching to call it strong--is that exports are still holding up But even the defense goods producers are having layoffs  The most hopeful sign may be that we're getting price and wage adjustments Actually some work we've done on that indicates that at least for New England historically we really have to have a period of substantial declines in employment and substantial increases in unemployment before we reach a threshold--and that's in both directions--that affects wage behavior We now have had for the region an employment decline, since the local peak, of somewhat greater than 6 percent, which makes it the weakest period of decline in New England on a peak to not-yet-trough basis in history It's possible, but we don't have the monthly data, that in 1946 when a lot of the shipbuilding facilities closed after the war we might have had as much of an employment decline, but that's how far back one has to go  All of this, of course, has had a negative effect on consumer confidence; it is flattening a little but is still very low Retailers report very soft activity with a lot more discounting going on In construction--and this is something that needed to happen--the value of what is being put in place is down somewhat more than 50 percent Financial sector problems are still prominent in the news We expect that in addition to the Bank of New England situation we'll have another $20 billion in institutions this year that will have to be resolved That will be a total roughly the size of the Bank of New England and will be a further hit on consumer confidence As far as the credit crunch goes, I don't think there's a great deal of improvement with our own indigenous institutions We are seeing more entry of nonbank financial institutions and others coming into this market to pick up some opportunities that may be there  An interesting note is the fiscal problems of our state and local governments If you look at either the reductions in expenditures that are going to be required or the likely tax increases, it comes out District-wide as a number somewhere on the order of 2-1/4 percent of personal income And if you add local governments to that it goes to about 2-3/4 to 3 percent So, we think this is something that is going to be rolling through toward the end of this year that will have a further effect on consumption We do think that the region will at least flatten about two quarters after the national economy  -29-    3/26/91  As far as that goes, I find the Greenbook conditional forecast for the next several quarters pretty persuasive The only place I may question it at all is on the basis of [the inadequate] weight it gives to state and local government [spending], which the Greenbook already has as being pretty soft But looking across the nation I'm not sure what is going to happen with that sector I do think, as it should be, that the risks implied in the Greenbook forecast are pretty symmetrical both on the up side and the down side  As far as policy goes, we've done a fair bit already and there are some lags involved; and Mike referred to some of the early signs one might see of upcoming improvement An important factor for us to keep in mind at least--I don't want to preach about it--is that the recession wasn't caused strictly by Iraq in my view We also had adjustments to some fundamental imbalances in the economy that were of a balance sheet nature in some cases I think New England was an extreme case of that, depending on some of the activity that had gone on there and that had gotten a little out of hand And in this environment I think our responsibility is to provide a climate in which these imbalances can be addressed in a painful adjustment period but over time Again, I think the Greenbook forecast is one that would allow us to do that and, obviously, in periods such as this one should be cautious  One, coming back to the point that David raised that every financial market indicator under the sun seems to be indicating a rebound Just looking at the stuff that came out, the comments [about] the stock market really were quite persuasive I was wondering what previous history there is of a false positive with this degree of [a stock market] move  But this would be by some order of magnitude  Mr Chairman, I find myself in complete agreement with your suggestion and encouraged by the mechanism that you suggest I think that we are probably close to a turning point You're right that nothing is ever certain The behavior of the aggregates is encouraging but if we have to move the discount rate, that may well be the way to go particularly in light of what may be nonfinancial factors accounting for changes instead of world spirits about the United States [leading to an] appreciation of the dollar And I am heartened by your suggestion that if it becomes necessary to move the funds rate significantly as well, further consultation would be appropriate at that time So, I completely support your suggestion "
4345,1991-04-12," This is Dick Syron If I could just report We had our directors' meeting late yesterday with some other business to consider I was quite struck, I might say not just at the margin, by a shift in people's feelings back to [the views they held] previously, maybe a couple of meetings ago People were beginning to see some [signs of improvement] but I think there's a stall in that feeling We do have some capital goods producers and this view is very strongly reflected there, particularly in the electronics area Also, there is a change in concerns obviously on the consumer side, and a real softening in exports, including exports of defense goods, was mentioned by a couple of people So, I think that we do have a [shift] here in that some of the immediate postwar euphoria that we    4/12/91 -3-  thought was going to provide a bit of a kick may be waning and we may really be at a very tender point in terms of whether [the expansion] catches on or not So, I would favor moving in the direction that you recommend; your point is very well taken, though, that all of us should make a rather explicit commitment to each other that we have a willingness to shift quickly as things do catch on In my own view that move would be most appropriate not by moving the discount rate back up but by moving the funds rate up to maintain some spread between the discount rate and the funds rate as we go ahead  Ed, I'm sorry to butt in This is Dick Syron Let me just ask you a question for clarification on that I share your view that we're at a point where it's usually--but maybe more so in this case--hard to know exactly what to do Still, the concern I would have, and I would be interested in your reaction, is about changing our procedures at this point, particularly given all the brouhaha that has been going on about having to change I'd be a little concerned about whether that gives off more confusing signals In other words, a penalty discount rate at this point--  I guess I would be more concerned about these expectations because it seems to me on the substance, Ed, that the first direction we'd go in would be the discount rate even if [the funds rate] didn't mirror the first 25 points or so, which I happen to favor doing I'll leave it at that "
4385,1991-05-14," Mike, on inventories What do you make, if anything, of these stories that we have a smaller number of retail outlets for any given volume of sales and that there is a secular downtrend in this? Is that something worth paying attention to?  What makes it a little hard to tell exactly is the lack of some abstract notion that targets what the inventory-sales ratio is and how far we are--  Thank you, Mr Chairman The economy in New England is very poor, with few spots showing improvement; [there are some exceptions], primarily housing Perhaps most disturbing is that I think this may have to do with just getting further into a recession; an enveloping feeling of gloom has affected everything And I see that it spreads further down in the Northeast, actually  As other people have noted, we too have continued problems with state and local governments If anything, the estimates of the deficits on a state-by-state basis are increasing and increasing in a fairly significant way, which will absolutely necessitate significant tax increases The retail situation, however, is a little mixed Durables are not good; autos in particular are very soft, although nondurables have picked up somewhat Some mail order houses particularly have noted a pickup in demand; a lot of that is probably [goods] sold out of the District Interestingly, consistent with improving their margins, some [chains]--and we still have to see how this will work out--actually are charging for postage on catalogues  Commercial real estate continues to decline As I mentioned, housing has picked up a bit for first-time [buyer] units, which in our District at this stage of the game are homes whose prices total less than about $200,000 Manufacturers seem to have become quite pessimistic even in the computer area where things have picked up a little nationally Suppliers to the auto industry and to the aerospace industry are quite pessimistic Interestingly, we have several defense contractors some of whom--for example,  -10-    5/14/91  --also have a significant part of their business in the commercial sector, and they have said that on balance any improvement they got on the defense side was washed away by the regular civilian side They still see this long-term reduction in restructuring on the defense side Prices, consistent with all this, continue to be pretty well behaved  Our lenders are quite cautious Even a couple of our largest banks will say, essentially, that they are not lending unless it's extremely good credit Others that are in a little better shape will tell you that they just are concerned about the loan quality coming in But universally they are seeing very, very little in loan demand As a consequence, they just don't want money I think this is related to what is going on in the monetary aggregates Some institutions that have had potential customers come to them are really lowering their offering rates quite a lot Those are people coming from institutions that are closing or have capital [problems] and from others that don't feel they need any money I'm not quite sure how one factors this into evaluating the situation, but at least in New England--and I suspect more so nationally as well--this issue of restructuring that we've talked a lot about both in financial services and manufacturing, and what is happening in inventories and in state and local governments, does make a situation in which one has to look at the employment numbers at least somewhat skeptically as we go forward Once managers get into this process of feeling that they can have the same level of output and maintain their margins by reducing costs if not increasing sales, they discover all kinds of opportunities that I think they're going to exploit for some time to come I was struck by talking to several people who were saying that there's still more to do here and that they are discovering new opportunities  One interesting story that fits with what is going on in inventories--showing that this is again a two-sided sword--is that we talked to an off-price discounter who indicated that business was horrible but the reason business was horrible wasn't so much that the demand in the stores was horrible; it was because manufacturers had maintained their inventories more carefully and he wasn't able to pick up the volume of distress sale goods that he could before  Nationally, I find the Greenbook forecast very plausible on a center-weighted basis One would really have to nitpick to find fault with it It is more useful to ask what the risks are I would think that in a very, very marginal sense the risks might be slightly on the down side; I see the third quarter falling into the same pattern as the second quarter conceivably, typically because of concerns about exports But I do think--and this goes back to what Bob Forrestal said--that one needs to look at the risks of the outcome, if you will, not just the risk of something happening If we were to get much further deterioration than we expect, that could be fairly difficult to deal with given the problems that we have in some sectors On the other hand, one has to be very encouraged by at least the forecasted improvement in prices that we see It really would be tragic to throw that away So, I think it's very hard to be sure of the outlook at this point, which makes it extremely important to follow the data that continue to come in very, very closely  In one day or over, say, a period of a week? "
4420,1991-07-02," Thank you, Mr Chairman As far as the First District goes, I'd say that there has not been much change It's pretty clear at this point that the District has been through its most wrenching adjustment since World War II A lot of that, obviously, is because of the bubble that we were coming out of Much has to do with specific problems that are not sensitive to the US economy In manufacturing, we have almost weekly announcements of layoffs; a lot of them have to do with some specific problems in our high-tech industry In the defense sector, we have announcements of shutdowns of plants; but that has to do with Tip O'Neill not being Speaker [of the House]; they're not sensitive to macro policy Outside of the high-tech area, the encouraging sign that we get in talking to manufacturers is that the general trend seems to be that things aren't getting any worse and about half of them seem to see things getting somewhat better They do have a very, very cautious approach to capital spending Generally, we don't see any problems with inventories and I'm seeing a favorable price performance from their suppliers As far as retail sales go, consistent with what has happened in other Districts, ex-autos we have seen some significant pickup in our District But we've had very, very warm weather and that probably is part of it In the real estate sector, as has been mentioned in several other cases, we have serious problems remaining Probably the best estimates are that we have about 54 million square feet of vacant space Even if we were to get a recovery fairly soon, optimistically we would be looking at an absorption rate of 4 or 5 million, tops, of that space So, it just looks as if we have a ways to go there That, of course, has had very, very serious effects and we're a long way from being out of the woods In terms of our financial sector, there is a lot of discussion on talk radio about  -16-    7/2-3/91  that I suppose the favorable aspect of it is that it doesn't seem to affect--except in a broader consumer confidence sense--people's behavior People are not running from one bank to another; they feel quite secure with there being federal insurance And some people are saying they've been through three institutions and they expect they'll go through a couple more before they get to another situation We do have some feeling that a credit crunch is still going on but, again consistent with what Bob Forrestal said, loan demand for projects or enterprises one would want to finance is quite weak In the residential sector we are seeing some pickup in housing; that has continued That is not reflected in production yet, though, because of the overhang that we still have  As far as the national economy goes, I have very little to add to the Greenbook forecast I am comfortable with the forecast both in terms of its likelihood and also in thinking that it's not a bad situation to have evolve One can't help but be struck, as was pointed out by Mike in his presentation, by the unusual nature of this recovery--the importance of inventory swings and of exports in terms of what we're looking forward to And I think all of this means that we almost certainly have reached the bottom; but there are significant uncertainties about the upswing Although hopefully not gratuitously, I find myself comfortable with the staff's assumption of what the baseline is because on a somewhat [capriciously] velocity-adjusted M2 basis I consider that to be about what we had built into the baseline  That has definitely been our experience with our large institutions  Don, not to put too fine a point on it--and I think you probably already answered the question--but on this key issue of the relationship between the Ms and nominal GNP In footnote 5, where you say you assume further downward shifts, would it be fair  -30-    7/2-3/91  to say that that's a separate assumption and that you could just as easily have less downward shift as more downward shift? That has some implication for how much room we'd need if the downward shifts were not [abating]  Thank you, Mr Chairman I think, as others have said, that policy has been quite effective, largely by drift of fortune as well as by skill And I think there is general agreement that most of us often think about our objectives in terms of inflation and [view achieving price stability] as a vehicle for promoting real growth in the economy A lot of the somewhat technical debate right now comes down to the issue of how much we want to take into consideration uncertainties associated with the relationship between money and output And it seems to me that, not unusually, we're in a time of significant uncertainty First of all, we're not absolutely sure where we are in terms of the real economy itself Beyond that, there are all of these factors going on in the financial system to which some people have alluded And coming back to the question I asked Don earlier, it's far from clear that we have a great deal of certainty about velocity's behavior in either direction In terms of credibility, a concern I have--I think we'd be surprised by it--is that if we were to lower the ranges and then have to break through the top of the range, that could be as damaging to credibility as some other specs could be in the other direction Additionally, I have a great deal of sympathy for your view, Mr Chairman; I'm not quite sure what we get for changing [the ranges] now in July, halfway through the year We'll have more information both on the real economy and on what is happening in the financial system as the year goes on So, I think the opportunity for gaining credibility is greater, if we find it necessary to make a change, to do so after some of these things become less [uncertain] So, for that reason, I support your suggestion  Mr Chairman, I support what you suggest, ""B"" symmetric I do think that the point that has been made--that it may be necessary for us to be willing to react quickly, if things do come back strongly on the real side--needs to be emphasized again Also, I think what Governor Angell said is very, very true But it's less clear to me how we resolve that in the short run So, all of this argues in my mind for just staying where we are right now "
4439,1991-08-05," Mr Chairman, this is Dick Syron in Boston I just want to support what Bob Parry said It's critical with respect to the banking sector I think as one might expect, at least in this part of the country--  I said that at least in this part of the country among the bankers there is still a very strong fear factor, both in terms of growing pessimism about the robustness of the recovery and also of concern about the regulatory side We have seen in several cases differences in how our regulators would approach individual credits compared with the Comptroller, for example All of this is contributing to a sort of bunker mentality on the part of lenders, who hope that they can ride it out with enough capital until things return to normal I would just add that in talking to a number of insurance companies in New England, they are also being very cautious on new commitments and are taking steps to assure that they have absolute liquidity Now, that may be something that has more [unintelligible] as an explanation of what is happening to [money growth] "
4464,1991-08-20," Thank you, Mr Chairman I think you largely asked my question I'd just like to add, Peter, to the question the Chairman had, and ask about how you feel in a situation in which you believe--of course it may not be possible to forecast this--that the constraints that you're under would have an effect upon the outcome of the ultimate variables that we're worried about I presume there are procedures that you could follow now in consultation with the Chairman and others to deviate from a tight funds target [constraint] for a short period of time  My overall concern, as other people have said before, is dissatisfaction with the current system--understandably so But life is an imperfect situation And at least in this situation, I see more or as much volatility or lack of stability in the financial sector as in the real sector That makes me concerned about doing anything in the short- to intermediate-run to change the approach that we're taking I completely agree with the concerns that people have about the lack of desirability of introducing greater ambiguity  Mr Chairman, along with what everyone has said, I think we have to be careful not to try to send too many messages to the market We're having people see three messages, perhaps, for every one we're trying to send In that regard [I like] your suggestion for [reviewing this] once a year And I think David [Mullins] is absolutely right that we want to retain it and make it an extraordinary event to some extent when we change these things In what we present in a once-a-year approach such as you suggested it is important that we get in there that while we're focusing on price stability, we're focusing on price stability for a reason And that reason is that it's not an objective by itself; it's an objective in order to maximize real economic welfare Sometimes--fortunately not in this group but outside--there can be some confusion about that  Mr Chairman, as to the situation in New England, there certainly isn't anything new to report, at least of a favorable [nature] Talking to directors and businessmen more broadly, there's an increased sense of pessimism that is definitely palpable and a feeling that the region is still deteriorating While the pace of the decline may be abating, there's certainly no sense of an upturn The only bright spot for now is continued activity generated by mortgage rates and existing home sales and also by [housing] price adjustments There is some slight improvement in new home construction Given the inventory overload that we have, particularly in the condo market, it is going to be very interesting to find out just how many waterside condominiums were fully damaged by the hurricane that went through! I think the insurance industry inspectors should be quite careful [in determining] just what did cause the damage  Exactly, which brings me to the next point In terms of looking at local markets, the employment situation certainly  -22-    8/20/91  in the life companies and in the property and casualty companies has contributed further to this great feeling of pessimism, which is being reflected in soft retail sales and also in continued concerns about inflows and tax revenues of state and local governments and what that will mean later on  As far as the US economy goes, the concern that we have is that there may be an asymmetry of risks in the forecast toward the down side There is information one can go through that would explain much of the softness in the Ms and that alone might not be a cause for concern if the softness in the Ms wasn't happening in an environment in which there seems to be increasing causes for concern about the real sectors of the economy Also, what has been referred to as [funds] moving out of banks into other areas, I think does have some implication for credit flows We do see continued concern about credit availability I recently have spoken to the chief executive officers and the chief financial officers of all of our large life insurance companies and their standard reassurances suggest a thin veneer [covering] a sense of great concern; in a couple of cases it is almost in the panic stage or very close to it There is an enormous caution in their lending and a great desire to increase liquidity One very large company which is in both the life and property and casualty businesses was saying that it wanted to be in a situation within a few months where it could liquify one-third of its portfolio very quickly if it had to It's not quite clear to me how that's going to happen I think many of the banks feel--and I think some of this is the result of over-reaction by some of the regulators--that there's a whole generation of commercial loan officers who may not be able to function in the future because they have been through such trauma in this whole aspect It is too early to know the impact of the hurricane on the property and casualty companies but at this stage, based on a few phone calls, it doesn't seem to be very great  We generally agree that the Greenbook forecast is the most probable outcome But I think, as Mike said, the probability distribution has widened, and I would guess the tail on the negative side has increased somewhat We're very dependent on a few things that come back to confidence, including what happens in the auto industry And in this environment, the shocks that we have going on internationally as well as domestically increase the concern on the negative side It's something for us to take into consideration in the next [portion] of the meeting  Mr Chairman, I agree with your conclusions and prescription, which is ""B"" asymmetric toward ease On the margin I would be reasonably comfortable going to version II in the current circumstances I must say that in a lot of other circumstances I would have a concern about moving the aggregates up to that level of prominence But given the weight that has been assigned to the aggregates by many in the public arena and in the markets, I think it's worth doing My concurrence with your view is based on the notion that it's not just an immediate double-dip that is my concern; I'm really concerned about a prolonged period of weakness characterized by no growth or very slow growth rather than a double- dip and the potential impact on the financial system That could lead us potentially to a situation that, unlike the forecast, causes a downturn later on that would lead us to have to take moves that are  -37-    8/20/91  inconsistent with our longer-term objectives So, I think less now is better than more later "
4475,1991-09-13, Syron I agree 
4499,1991-10-01," Second  The one problem with this and the reason for the extensive discussion is that it is perceived--and I think Ed's comment is very appropriate--correctly or incorrectly by many people out there that the appropriate sanction applier, if I can use that term, is the Federal Reserve Now, if that is not how it's done--and I'm not judging that one way or another--then there has to be a way, given what happened, that that issue is somehow defused and it's clear what the sanctions are and why the Federal Reserve is not the appropriate one [to apply sanctions] and what it is that whoever is appropriate is doing  So move  Mike, this is related to Ed Boehne's question This forecast incorporates our usual assumption of no change in rates, which you essentially had to make In going back and looking at our forecasts historically, we have quite a substantial change in rates from what they have been I'm wondering in going forward whether you think the difference between these expectations of rate changes and what the economy has done has been caused primarily by external differences and what is going on in the real economy That's one factor And how much--and you addressed this somewhat already--is it a change in the responsiveness of the economy to a fall in rates? It's impossible to give a precise weighting on that, but I'd be interested in your speculation about that, particularly going forward  So you might say this was different in the past and you wouldn't necessarily forecast that that would continue?  Thank you, Mr Chairman In terms of the District, New England has changed very little since the last meeting In fact, a sense of resignation is beginning to accompany the pervasive sense of gloom Confidence at the consumer level about both current and expected conditions continues to decline; we're in a range that's somewhat worse than the national level And partly as a result of this, retailers we talk to are extremely nervous about the Christmas season They are going in with very light inventories; there has been a lot of inventory liquidation so far and they are planning on quite light ordering for Christmas In fact, now they're seeing some lost sales because of not having goods on the shelf and that's reflected also in indications that discounting has diminished in some of these cases; but they're not about to increase their inventories for a while Manufacturers by and large see some bottom but no real rebound Again, they are very nervous, very cautious on capital spending, and have continued plans for restructuring and reducing employment There is concern in the aerospace sector, which in our area involves feeder industries; they are particularly concerned about what may happen to the B2 program Actually, it's interesting that in the District as a whole we saw a reduction in the labor force last year of about 1 percent Some of that I think is people moving out and some of it is the discouraged worker phenomenon  In the financial sectors there is obviously a lot of continued restructuring going on Much of this, if not all, is very necessary; but it obviously will have a transitional impact on the labor market and the commercial space market It is an interesting phenomenon In the space market alone there is an enormous amount of jockeying going on as developers who have buildings just completed or about to come on line try to compete to steal tenants away from competitors by knocking down lease prices quite a lot From the standpoint of the economy as a whole, while this restructuring certainly has been an important and necessary long-run phenomenon that we don't want to stop, it does constitute a drag on the economy, particularly as it affects many people who usually haven't been impacted by recessions; and it affects their confidence Residential real estate in the District has softened but one would expect with the mortgage market improvement that there will be some turnaround Unfortunately, in what I think has to be on balance a negative report with regard to District business activity, on the inflation side we did have one interesting labor contract, the NYNEX contract, that will affect to some extent at least the management of the New England division of NYNEX It's a fairly rich contract--about 132 percent over three years It actually had to reverse the previous deals in trying to [introduce] cost sharing for medical insurance where [unintelligible] program as long as the company would pay for it fully This was traded off [for other concessions] and we'll see if the productivity returns come in Management expects that they have gotten some significant work rule improvements, but we don't know And they're continuing to cut management employment But I think it was really buying labor peace at what I thought was an unusual time in the cycle  -12-    10/1/91  As far as the national scene goes, I think it's very, very hard to find a central tendency in the forecast that would be much different--or one that I would have much more confidence in--than what the staff has produced I find myself very much in sympathy with Mike's views of the risks as far as the outcome goes I would think that they're slightly on the down side but not greatly  From my perspective what this comes down to, since it's all a game of risks, is Which side is the worst if we are wrong? My own view is that I would prefer to be wrong on the side of having a little stronger growth than somewhat weaker growth, at least in the short run, because I am concerned about the financial sector We have talked about many of the [financial sector concerns] We would be quite a ways away from potential if the economy were to come in-- instead of, say, at 33 percent growth, which is the central tendency --at something like 18 percent rather than 48 percent growth That implies further stresses on the system--[more than if] we were to have 48 percent for a short period of time As long as we're willing to reverse course, I think that the latter could be dealt with more easily than coming in with a very slowly growing economy  Depending upon the state of confidence, I think we could see a quite slow Christmas season I admit that there are strong offsetting risks that imply a rather evenly balanced outcome in terms of what may happen to the economy Again, my views are driven by which side I would rather be wrong on, in terms of the effect of being wrong  I think the new lease prices have weakened but are stabilizing We have levels that are substantially below what they were before but I think that they are reaching--  It's different in suburban areas and the central city In Boston, where obviously it occurred earlier than in some other places, the class A space seems now to be going for $21-$22 and that hasn't changed much, I would say, over the summer  That's right  Well, a lot of leases are rolling over and the average is obviously coming down because people are very aggressively going out and seeking to steal tenants There are a lot of places where that is going on  ""B"" asymmetric "
4517,1991-10-30," Mr Chairman, I think that the situation has deteriorated in a noticeable way and that it is important that we do something I would associate myself with those who say it should be more than--to use Jerry's phrase--a ""plain vanilla"" change And sooner is better than later for the reason that, unless Friday's labor market report turns out to be very different from what I think almost any of us expects, I'm wary of doing another move that is tied very,    10/30/91  very closely to the announcement of the employment figures Also, since we get into the Treasury refunding period next week, I must say I would be in favor of moving today  Non-Friday--that is, not on the day the labor market figures are released "
4539,1991-11-05," So move  Mike, I have two questions Is it fair to say, looking at the probability distribution in your forecast now, that you still would consider the negative tail fatter, even after your revision?  And just a clarification question Did you say that in putting together the [forecast] for this Greenbook you changed the procedure regarding your assumption on where the funds rate would be? Was that before the most recent confirmation?  Well, I thought it was very useful But a question came out of it, in a sense Since you assumed a 50 basis point cut, essentially--  --and we have gotten 25 basis points of it so far, do you consider the forecast that you have now as centered, leaving the previous question alone on the tail, with another 25 basis point cut? [Would that be] your answer as compared to another 50 basis points?  Thank you, Mr Chairman Both in terms of the District and nationally, I think that in the midst of all these problems we're on the edge of some really favorable long-term developments I don't think we should panic in the midst of the very worrisome intermediate term, but there are a lot of reasons to be concerned  In that regard, I said last time that New England had a level of pessimism that bordered on panic I think it's fair to say that it has passed over into the zone of panic now One is tempted now when going to a social event to say to folks [unintelligible] because people start to berate you so much about the employment situation if you tell them what you actually do  That's right, and then they sympathize with you! I'm not sure that the fundamentals have changed that much but confidence seems to have fallen just dramatically, as other people have said When one talks to the relatively small number of major newspapers in our District, one hears about a very interesting and unfortunately worrisome trend in year-over-year retail sales--and last year was not a good year in New England Our major newspaper is seeing a 30 percent decline in their normal ad lineage for retailers going into the [holiday] season If you follow that up by calling a few of the larger retailers, they have had quite weak performances recently and they expect a weak Christmas I think the long and the short of it is that they're trying to cut their expenses and cut their way through this whole period; they figure that a lot of their competition isn't going to make it and they want to be there on the other side but they're not going to try to boost sales in the short run by advertising That's very true in the auto sector where auto sales have been very poor Inventory levels generally are not something that people express concern about but, coming back to what Mike said, we really don't know a lot about the desired inventory- sales ratio now because of these just-in-time changes Loan demand continues very weak at our banks and even in the mortgage refinance area there has been some weakness as people expect that the economy will continue to slide and that rates will decline, so they are waiting to refinance later Actually, in terms of fundamentals, if you look at the rate of deterioration of employment in the District, things are not getting worse as fast as they were earlier In fact, even in the computer sector there has been some slight sign of optimism, although that is offset by weakness in manufacturing elsewhere There is a great deal of concern in the defense sector, particularly in three of our large firms Raytheon, United Technology, and General Electric Wages have been very well behaved We still have a real benefits cost problem, which is an inexorable rise in medical care costs  As far as the national outlook goes, I agree with the Greenbook and also with Mike's characterization of where the risks lie On that score, I must say in talking to a number of money  -12-    11/5/91  managers in the city that one does start to have a concern, with these disappointing corporate profit figures, about what would happen if in the midst of all this we were to have another 10 percent break or so in the stock market People are talking about that as not being at all out of the realm of possibility There is continued concern about banks but, as I say, I think a lot of this is on the edge of a long- term favorable trend [stemming from] restructurings and, while it is temporarily a drag, we're going to see more productivity later on So, the bottom line is that in many ways this fear that has been generated by a lot of people is partially because of the decline in asset values but also it's a cumulative awareness by corporations and even more so by individuals that their consumption levels of the '80s were not consistent with their long-term income prospects And this is an attempt to make up for that in a quite short period of time That is being reflected in what producers are saying as well, which is that this is a correction that we have to go through in the economy and we have to hunker down to get through it  Mr Chairman, if I might just [comment] on that narrow issue I think security after our unfortunate episode has improved And if we really think that's what we're going to do--I have some sympathy for it and I'll get back to that later--then this group, depending on what it thinks the Board of Governors is going to do [on the discount rate], should vote for it now instead of going through the process of just saying we're not officially doing it because we're afraid of a leak in a couple of days  Mr Chairman, while I'm in favor of what you want to do, some questions arise, given what we know and don't know What we do know is that we have risks on the down side and that, while we may not be able to control things, we can influence them This issue of confidence, which others have spoken of, is very important I think the worst thing we could do would be to tell the American public not only that fiscal policy is impotent but that we don't think there's anything the Federal Reserve can do either I think people would give up Also, in terms of the longer time frame, if it should be necessary to turn back, I think the Federal Reserve would do it It's a win/win situation in some sense if the economy recovers because we buy more credibility in the long run by showing that we're willing to do it then I certainly hope, because I think some--to use the phrase of the day--""gong effect"" is needed, that the 25 basis point cut will be associated with a cut in the discount rate Some of [my concern] does have to do with the timing issue that Ed Boehne raised and that you want to return to But I'd be in favor of [your proposal] and I'd be in favor of asymmetric language  Mr Chairman, may I add to your question? How much damage is done and to whom is the damage done?  Mr Chairman, I just want to associate myself very strongly with the views both of yourself and Governor Angell I think this is a case where there is a question of integrity of the organization in what we're doing, particularly in the environment of the last several months domestically I'd be concerned about not letting people who are paid to bear the risks bear the risks when we really don't think, from what I hear, that this is something we fear is going to do a lot of damage to the economy And the economy is what we're supposed to be concerned with  If that's your concern, wouldn't you have to put more in if you do it at the regular time rather than by doing it with an announcement effect before the market opens? "
4559,1991-12-02," Mr Chairman, Dick Syron If I could continue on just where Ed Boehne left off I was talking to some retailers yesterday and this morning in anticipation of this call The retailers here have had very, very negative expectations Whether it's because of that [I'm not sure, but] their sales generally are a bit better than their expectations, although Sunday they were up [unintelligible] Overall, it's slightly better than they expected, but one has to recall that they expected a negative trend and are coming out at closer to flat year-over-year It is interesting trying to learn about their inventories Some of them were in a backed-up situation or in re-organization Actually on this issue of fear, they're finding it interesting where [unintelligible] and it's now an off-price discounter through the Northeast and some of the Midwest Actually, they did reasonably well over the weekend One of the two fellows who owns it had a call from ""Night Line"" Friday; they said they wanted him to go on [the show] and they would ask him what his experience had been His experience at that point had been positive and he told them he was going to paint his experience as relatively positive He may be overstating it, but he said he got the feeling that this didn't fit with the tone they wanted to present and for that reason he was told he wouldn't go on They said it didn't really fit in with the rest of the program and went on to something else So, I think we do have a little self- feeding issue here    12/2/91  As far as the economy as a whole goes, it's hard to differ very much from what Mike said I would say it's most likely that we will see some further negative developments in the early part of next year And that's something we have to bear in mind very carefully in thinking about what we're going to do "
4583,1991-12-17," Peter, is there a central tendency in the range of views on the effectiveness of this kind of thing? It seems to have had a big expectations effect  For the reasons that the Chairman and Bob Parry gave and that Mike Kelley talked about, I support this It does make it clearer and I like the idea of considering it once a year rather than debating at Committee meetings the exact wording of this from time to time The only question I have--I'm just curious--is that I'd like to ask Peter how much all the things we put out there are scrutinized I don't see [this matter] coming up on the screens often I do see it in newsletters, etc Given the [directive] publication lags, how big a deal is that? I support doing it but I'm just curious  How much attention?  Mike, you [raised] a question on equipment spending On the face of it there is a pretty significant change, with different concepts to some extent, between equipment spending in this Greenbook and the last Greenbook There's some discussion of this, but I was curious Is this almost entirely attributable to changes in weights in the computer sector so that, in terms of how you think businesses are reacting, there is nothing to be read into your forecast on equipment spending this quarter as compared to last quarter?  It must be a big change!  Thank you, Mr Chairman In the First District the economy remains poor, but we have some hope that it may [improve] to mixed However, there is concern that the mood--you probably saw that story in the front page of the Sunday New York Times about depression in New England--certainly exceeds the reality in terms of sourness I think this is something that has been spreading nationally recently, not just in New England But even though there isn't a fit between the mood and the reality, this does have a psychological effect which feeds back on the economy, and it's obviously something that overhangs [unintelligible] We think that we probably would not be that far from the bottom in New England if we were to have a national outcome somewhat like that in the Greenbook in that employment losses are stabilizing and there is some beginning of stabilization in the banking situation  On the retail side, we talked to retailers over the last several days and they say that people are being extremely cautious This is reflected in some interesting ways One way, according to a major retailer, is that as there are successive sales, a lot of people are coming back and bringing items to the return window because something they bought at $14 last week is advertised at $995 this week So there's more foot traffic in a way than there are sales, though we don't have any problem with parking spaces at this stage! I'll report what one retailer told us regarding sales Sales, while bad, are not terrible in that there's an expectation that on a year- over-year basis many [retailers] may actually break even, though some national chains we've spoken to have indicated that they see a spreading of the situation in New England to the rest of the country Part of that is because inventories have been kept so lean, and purposely so And some retailers say that they are losing sales because inventories are so lean But if the choice is to take a chance on one side or the other, they are not going to [take it on the side of] inventories  The job market remains very soft A personal anecdote on that is that we have something called a ""sunrise shift"" in our cash operation, with hours from 4 to 8 in the morning and no benefits It has turned out to be very effective for us We had three openings on that shift and when we advertised in the Boston Globe we had 1,000 applicants The applicants actually had to come in and apply--there wasn't any sending in of resumes--so we know that people were serious about it On the other side, we do see some change in the timing of projects by state and local governments with the notion that this is a good time both to finance and to get lower construction costs  As far as the Greenbook goes, we find it realistic this time and possibly even slightly too pessimistic--in terms of what it forecasts for the economy per se, not the potential results We do think that the unemployment rate for any given level of output could be slightly higher than the Greenbook forecast But, looking at all of this, one starts to [question] what went wrong and why things are so much softer than they had been There has been some reference, and I think appropriately so, to the restructuring phenomenon and the  -17-    12/17/91  effect of that on confidence and to these longer-term issues about which there may not be much that we can do Another interesting question, and I don't know the answer, is whether any of the changes in the tax code and the composition of employment this time have diminished the effect of the automatic stabilizers in some ways--there must be some data on this--and whether the decline for any given change in economic activity and federal receipts has been a little less this time There are arguments one can make to say that that was the case Whatever it is, things aren't working as expected And in an [environment] in which things aren't working as expected--even though, as I say, the Greenbook forecast is pretty realistic--what I'm concerned about is the risk or the impact of an error And I think Mike mentioned that We've been through this a number of times; we don't need a lot of discussion on the amount of fragility in the financial system or in expectations But I do think one has to be quite concerned about the potential spreading of this level of inappropriate panic Like many other people, I do see an improvement in inflation I see it on the wage side and, with the number of medical providers that we have in our District, we've begun to see even the beginning of some steps being taken on benefits, which will have an effect in the longer run  As far as policy goes, I know that we have this overhang regarding what may happen on the fiscal side But from my own perspective, that argues for our doing what we think we can more promptly rather than less promptly before concerns become evident [unintelligible] have a little less uncertainty about what the range of options may be on the fiscal side I'll finish by saying that if an action is taken, I think there is some value to maximizing the signal impact of any given amount of change because of what I personally feel are the psychological aspects of this There's nothing we can do about the short run but the environment that we've been in I think does demonstrate the problems involved in an interest- rate targeting regime and what that implies in terms of discrete steps  Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation as I interpret it, but I might go a little further Let me say why If we were to get the Greenbook forecast, with the turn, it might be not all that uncomfortable But I'm afraid that the risks are not symmetrical on the cost side I really do think there's a chance we will get an outcome that would be highly undesirable And then I ask What can we do about it? I don't believe policy is totally impotent I don't think a lot of people do, given what has been talked about here And in that sense, I really do prefer maximizing the signal effect of what we're doing The first paragraph in the Bluebook says that following the last meeting there was a ""slight easing of monetary policy,"" which it interprets as being a 25 basis point cut in the funds rate and a 50 basis point cut in the discount rate If that's slight, I have some question about whether that's what we should be doing in this period of time We could always reverse [an easing move] if we were to get happy surprises I agree with your basic view that the most likely outcome is the one that is [in the Greenbook] What I'm concerned about is the risks that are on either side So, for that reason, my own personal preference would be alternative A "
4595,1992-01-09," Jerry, this is Dick Syron May I ask just one question? Following up on [unintelligible] I appreciate that an extremely difficult high-wire balancing act is involved It's an almost an impossible thing to do with the conflicting issue [unintelligible] we're dealing with eliminating the franchise value, which would seem to be there now On the other hand, I'm just wondering, Peter, what this report is likely to say, particularly on this surveillance issue and from a franchise value perspective on who gets to bid What happens as the next step in this sequence of events? Even though I think [this] is the appropriate thing to do, I wonder whether people are going to be satisfied with [these conditions] And if further steps are to occur down the road, I wonder what the implications of those might be in this joint study?  I think that's probably right I see two things that may be worth emphasizing, if you can One is the transitional nature of these steps and, even if it isn't addressed specifically, it will be clear to people that as we go to the electronic system with open access, albeit with some constraints, it will really finish, as you say, any residual franchise value  I agree with that I'm just saying that I think you ought to take credit for it being in that direction and, if the transition is long clearly because of technical issues, this is the most one can do in the circumstances "
4620,1992-02-04," You wouldn't like to take a chance on a group ticket!  Second  Second  I'm just curious about the intervention I don't have any real problem with it, but could you give us a little more background on what was going on at the time? Were the markets felt to be particularly disorderly? What was happening that precipitated the decision to intervene at that particular point in time, presuming that we don't have a target?  I think I understand why we did it  A question for Tom Simpson In your discussion, you talked about the balance sheet restructurings of both households and corporations This is not a well-defined question, but do we have some notion even in a generalized sense of how much more desire there might be to do that? I'm trying to get to how much intermediated versus nonintermediated funds are going to the open market in this area with some vague presumption of conditions in the market remaining about as they are now  I was also trying to get at some of the cyclical aspects of it in the short and intermediate run, which I think Tom has answered as well, so--  Thank you, Mr Chairman In the First District we had thought that the economy was on the verge of rebounding but now it seems perhaps to be stalling a little again The sector where that's coming from is the manufacturing sector A significant amount of that has to do with defense, and it's probably a long-term structural adjustment Defense is an extraordinarily important industry in Connecticut; on a per capita basis it dwarfs even California So, everyone wants peace to break out as it affects someone else's factory; but we know we're going to have a lot of cuts there and it's causing a fair amount of uncertainty for the District Also, the people who produce the capital spending more generally are finding that their customers are concerned With respect to manufacturing in softer goods, several discount retailers have told us they've had calls from producers saying ""Can you take things from us now because we're starting to be concerned about cash pressures and our inventories are building a little more than we'd like?"" For the retail sector, the post-Christmas period has been a little better than expected, as was the Christmas period So, that is relatively good news In the banking sector, loan demand for ""acceptable"" loans is still weak Several banks have indicated that they are going to be more cautious as a result of the recent legislation in terms of prompt progressive intervention and capital standards We are seeing the beginning of some improvement in nonperforming loans; the level of nonperforming loans has actually dropped slightly at the margin And that is consistent with what has been talked about in other Districts We have seen some pickup in residential construction in single-family homes even in New England; I'm not quite sure who is going to buy them, but I'm told that they are all contracted for before the [shovel] goes in the ground Again, I'm not sure what the reason is, but the mood is generally improved somewhat as well I think part of it has to do with our December cut [in rates]; it is being seen as a watershed event to some extent But people are saying ""Well, it has to get better, and we expect it will get better in the spring""  As far as the nation goes, our own forecast would be quite similar to the Greenbook forecast, though I must confess not necessarily on the same policy assumption that's embedded in the Greenbook I don't mean that as a criticism of the Greenbook; I realize the institutional constraints But I think we do have to take into consideration that a forecast based on the ""no change"" approach to policy, which has become more of a standard assumption in the Greenbook, may have been biased toward optimism as we've gone through these periods I realize looking immediately ahead that we do have this unknown in fiscal policy out there I was very interested in Mike's comments that even the things that have been talked about now-- the presumption that this [fiscal package] doesn't get ""Christmas- treed"" too badly--would not have a dramatic effect At any rate, that's something that we can't anticipate very well at this point The one place where our forecast does differ is with respect to the unemployment rate For any given level of GDP, we would have a slightly higher unemployment rate forecast than what is reflected in the chart I think that goes back to our own little model [at the  -16-    2/4-5/92  Bank] where we have the labor force increasing slightly more than is anticipated in the Greenbook forecast We think that could add as much as a couple of tenths in some of the intermediate periods and, consistent with that, we'd be somewhat more optimistic on inflation  To sum up, on balance we think that the risks still are on the down side One reason has to do with the consumer and the necessity of forecasting that we're going to see a snapback in consumption to some extent If that doesn't happen, I have a fear about what that would mean for inventory behavior and what that [implies in turn] We've obviously made an enormous amount of progress on inflation and we don't want to give that up But consistent with that, we've also seen this restructuring phenomenon that is going on, which will be very beneficial for productivity in the longer run And it seems to me that the proper role of policy, as others have said, is to ""facilitate"" that restructuring phenomenon I do have a concern that were we to see a significant further slowing in the economy, we'd see demands for all kinds of protectionism, not just in the international trade sense but in a slowing down of the restructuring process in many industries That may be because I come from a District where a lot of people have been restructured out and I'm very sensitive to it Thank you  I think it's very difficult because it's very hard to deny the intellectual consistency of this approach; in fact, it is completely intellectually consistent with what we say we're doing, which inevitably in discussing it leads one back to pragmatism My concern is that it may be a little more consistent than the consistency of velocity allows us to be over time I admit in making that argument a continuing analogy Hancock and Revere were considered sort of rogues and not the intellectuals that Jefferson and Hamilton were, so I'm not going to make their argument My concern is that I just don't have confidence in the stability of these relationships in a multi-year process That would lead us to having to have the tunnel be quite wide if we wanted to have any confidence that we were going to stick with it over time And if the tunnel has to be that wide and also if we need to have the possibility of bending the tunnel, one comes back to the issue that the Chairman raised of either a very wide tunnel or a bent tunnel Bent tunnels are almost cones in a sense, and that leads us back to this problem of saying that people could misinterpret what we're trying to do Obviously some will make a fairly mechanical calculation and see that we really would have to drop interest rates--as is implied on page 15 in the Bluebook by extension--very, very dramatically if we wanted to come back to the midpoint without bending the tunnels So, my own view is that this [approach] ultimately is tied to the issue of how flexible we want to be in the intermediate period That's what we're talking about; all these are subsets of that Given the concerns that we have about velocity's erratic behavior and given the many structural changes that people have been talking about, I don't know that this is the time to make a change I prefer for the longer term to focus on P*, which I think is another way of doing it and avoids some of these problems But having said all that, I can't deny that intellectually this is completely consistent and in that sense would seem to be the way to proceed I just am afraid that practicalities both in perception and measurement preclude it, in my own view, at this time  -36-    2/4-5/92  Mr Chairman, I also would be in favor of alternative I because, like everyone else, I have no confidence in what is going to happen in the future to return M2 growth to its ""normal path"" Since you asked specifically, I would be much more willing to be close to the edge at the upper side than the low side In fact, I think that may be necessary and be consistent with what we have in the economy So, given my own guess on what is going to happen to velocity, I would hope that we're at or toward the upper part of the range It is essential that all this be taken in the context of continued progress toward price stability As an add-on comment, I don't agree with Tom Melzer's enthusiasm for Ml and in that regard I would be enthusiastic about doing something to impose reserve requirements more broadly across the components of M2  So moved  Mr Chairman, I guess my longer-term objective here is to have to vote for tighter policy as soon as possible And that has something to do with how we behave in the interim period I'm inclined to agree that we have put a lot of stimulus in the pipeline and that it's more likely that we're going to see an upturn than a further slide But I am concerned about [specifying] an asymmetry of risks or costs [and] being wrong on one side or the other We [are not sure] about the forecast, anyone's forecast That raises, of course, the issue of risks and insurance and how long one waits I think we're going to have to wait a while to see data that are really conclusive in one direction or the other I do think, and Governor Phillips raised this point yesterday, that we may be in a situation--I don't want to use the term ""window""--where it's easier for us to make a change now than it may be later as we come closer to a season that may be seen as more political and also as we get into the midst of all this fiscal policy business Those things would argue for ease because I think we are in the midst of this long cycle that we've talked about, and our role is to facilitate lending The best thing we can do to facilitate the long cycle adjustment is to have a stronger economy  Where all this leaves me at the end of the day is that I would favor easing sooner rather than later But I am aware of the time in which we operate and I think we are in a period in which there's a great deal of concern about confidence in the government as a whole That point is very well taken And in that environment, it's nice to see one organization that has some element of stability So, to tell you the truth, while I would prefer to ease now, short of that, which we won't get [consensus on], I prefer strong asymmetry In this business of nuances, I'd find acceptable what you suggest but would prefer the other side  -55-    2/4-5/92 "
4645,1992-03-11," Mr Chairman, this is Dick Syron in Boston I think the situation here is summed up by one of our contacts for the Beigebook who said ""The situation isn't good but it's better than lousy"" People have felt bad for a long time here, and what we hear from talking to people more extensively is very consistent with what    3/11/92  others have said today Retailers are doing somewhat better than they expected; they don't know about [the reliability of] exact comparisons because of the CNN effect last year Auto dealers actually are doing a fair bit better; there is improvement in real estate, etc Interestingly, the manufacturing sector is rather a mixed situation There is some deterioration in exports except [unintelligible] in Latin America and in some of the less developed countries, the kind of stuff that we sell Overall, though, we do see some signs of a pickup beginning, but there are concerns about its durability and not a lot of evidence that leads to expecting it to be very robust A lot of concern has to do more with long-term structural problems than the current cyclical situation in our region Thank you "
4670,1992-03-31," Peter alluded to this Is there any more to tell about these stories of a squeeze in the 5- and 7-year note areas?  So moved  SPEAKER(?) Second  Peter, I completely agree with the conclusions in your paper I have a question on one of the statements in it about the decision that was made some time ago to maintain the liquidity of the System's portfolio  In looking at the reasons to maintain the liquidity of the portfolio, what are the relative weights? Is it [primarily] a concern that if we own [securities] at the longer end of the market there are risks for gains and losses as we go in and out or is [the dominant concern] the risk of impacting the longer market more than we might impact the short market? I was trying to understand  That has to do with the depth of the short market as compared to the depth of the long market?  Okay So, it's the disruption in the market you would have to deal with Theoretically, you could still do it on the long market but you might have a greater impact  Okay  Tumultuous  Mike, I have a lot of sympathy for your view of the importance of inventories and trying to understand this whole area of inventories and the risks on either side There's no definitive answer to this, but I was wondering What is the central tendency of opinion on how close we've come to the end of this process of [firms]    3/31/92  changing their optimal, if there is such a thing, inventory/sales ratios? Do you see that as a process that is still going on?  Thank you  I'm not sure that we have very much to report as far as the region goes that is different from what people are talking about nationally We have seen some signs even in New England of tentative recovery consistent with what people have talked about [happening] elsewhere in terms of retail sales, housing sales, and sentiment We've been seeing some increase in employment, which is interesting because we find that in the current household survey but not in the payroll numbers Trying to reconcile the two we find that there are a lot of new electrical and gas hookups and new firms starting that are not yet picked up in the payroll survey but are picked up in the current population survey  On the banking side, there are some stirrings of very, very tentative improvement in loan demand though a leveling off, I would say, on the side of asset problems which we think probably have peaked I would think that housing prices--not commercial real estate but housing prices--probably have reached their low point; and that, combined with [lower] mortgage rates, has been stimulating some activity As for manufacturing, the paper industry is actually doing quite well and the computer industry is seeing some improvement, but there is some more recent concern about exports There is, of course, a lot of variance in this across the region--the defense influence I would have to say, and probably one shouldn't read too much into this because of the problems with seasonals, etc, that in conversations since the Beigebook--in calling people in the last few days before coming to the meeting--both retailers including auto dealers and people in the real estate business report some slack in the last 2 to 2-1/2 weeks There may not be too much to that, but some of it is attributed to the rise in rates at the long end  As far as the national economy goes, we share the view that the economy is improving We continue to be worried, though, about the durability [of the improvement] and how [developments] will cumulate We do have an uneasy feeling, which one can't avoid, about vulnerability to swings in mood Just in talking to people generally --and others have mentioned this--we see a degree of dissatisfaction generally and a fragility in people's confidence about the future that require us to stay on our toes As I say, I pretty much agree with the Greenbook I am concerned about two things (1) the cumulative  -17-    3/31/92  process that I referred to earlier and (2) the possibility of exports being a little softer than we have talked about before  As far as policy goes, I think this leaves us with two issues One Is the economy turning? I think the answer to that is probably yes The second issue, though, is How strongly is it turning? I would say that one place where we might have a slight disagreement with the Greenbook is that we see the unemployment rate possibly increasing a little further Based on work that we've done on the relationship to claims, we don't really see the unemployment rate declining until we get claims dropping below 400,000 for a long period So, we still think that the strength of the upturn will be on the soft side That is consistent, of course, with our quite optimistic view of continued improvement on the inflation side We think that Mike's interpretation of long-term bonds is probably correct because if inflation does continue to come in fairly well, it will tend to convince markets further as we go along  Mr Chairman, for the reasons that you have gone through, I find myself very strongly supportive of your fairly pronounced preference not to change policy I think you're right that it is premature at this stage to switch back to pure symmetry because, while the risks of the outcome in the Greenbook I think are pretty well balanced, the damage that would be done by making a mistake is not As for the likelihood that we may have to do something between meetings While we do think that we're seeing a turn here in a number of areas, if I weigh the factors that are out there--the concerns in Japan, and some of the concerns in the financial markets which you alluded to related in turn to the real estate problems, etc--I find it hard to think that we're going to be in a situation where the probability is equal that we're going to have to tighten between meetings as compared to [easing] That to me says that we're in a classical ""stay asymmetric"" [mode] Also, while I have to confess that I'm not one of those who think that the Ms mean everything, I certainly think they mean something And looking at what we've said we intended to do this year--not increasing the range but wanting to come in at least at the midpoint of the range--though I realize the numbers are extremely preliminary, I find the trend we're seeing in M2 particularly disturbing So, I think we're in a world, and many people agree with this, where we need to remain vigilant The likelihood of having to take action, perhaps because of an unforeseen event, is greater on the stimulative rather than the tightening side, and I think that is consistent with staying asymmetric  Well, I don't think we should be in the business of changing it because the numbers that just came in were weaker, unless we want to change the targets because we don't like the number "
4695,1992-05-19," I think there's an opportunity to move further in the direction that we want to go, and I concur that once we're closer to where we want to be it will be worth thinking [more precisely] about what that position should be  Mike, I have two questions, which are somewhat technical innature, dealing with historical [precedent] in data series One is that just in talking to people and getting anecdotal information on the housing market, [that information] is consistent unfortunately with the pattern of data that was announced this morning What I was wondering is whether there is any evidence of increased sensitivity to mortgage rate changes in housing and how that fits in I remember in one of your earlier nonfinancial reports that you talked about almost a change in the relationship between prices and purchases That is, as prices stopped declining in some markets, there was a hypothesis at least that people were more willing to buy because they were less concerned about the [potential] loss, which was a different sign on price than we thought    5/19/92  I have a second question, but I wanted to get to that one first to ask how this fits in with our historical experience and whether there has been a change in habits  For what it's worth, I think your analysis is probably correct and that we don't necessarily get symmetric behavior But after we have a period of declining prices, the relative weight on the investment side becomes somewhat more important  The second question I'm trying to figure out is whether to take much encouragement in the household data I've always been inclined to look more at the payroll data but I'm just wondering whether we do have an historical precedent to some extent or if there has been a shift there because of all of the restructuring that's going on Again, one hears these anecdotal stories of many new smaller firms starting, etc I just wanted to ask you if you could    5/19/92  explore that a bit more because we are seeing quite a diversion in patterns [between the two series] I'm grasping for encouragement here if you can provide it  Thank you, Mr Chairman To start with the District, I'd say the New England economy remains lethargic It's no longer in a pronounced decline but it really has little momentum going in the opposite direction It's interesting actually to hear Bob McTeer talk about things being more encouraging in Dallas We've said that things are more encouraging in New England because on a moving  -23-    5/19/92  average basis the decline in employment last month was only 2 percent at an annual rate But we do think things are close to the bottom  As far as different sectors go, after a fairly good opening of the year, the retailers now seem--I've talked to some of them myself--a fair bit more concerned In housing, we don't know if this has to do with weather or what the story is, but there does seem to be--""softness"" is too strong a word--an attenuation in the growth that we've seen in housing It had done quite well; now, it's slowing off again, which is why I asked the question about interest rate sensitivity And, of course, the expected depreciation is a very big issue in New England  As far as your question on real estate goes, it's a very interesting pattern here It depends a great deal on the sectors that one looks at In the pure office space sector, absorption now is about flat; we don't have negative absorption any more I hope none of you has too much money in TIAA-CREF because you're going to take some loss in the Boston market We have an interesting phenomenon going on with the zero absorption; people are trading up at the same price to higher quality space and there just isn't going to be a market for some of the B+ quality space to [say nothing about the] C space The retail market is really quite interesting in that it shows that real estate is very local We have a couple of new small shopping centers being built with new retailers coming in at the same time that we have great excess capacity in retail space elsewhere To come back to something that Jerry Jordan talked about, the one area where there has been some success in auction type sales has been in the condo market It hasn't held true in the commercial or the retail or office building sectors, but in the condo market finding a price floor has produced the same sort of pattern that Jerry talked about for some of the markets  We hear less about the credit crunch than we did a year ago, although I think it's still somewhat of a residual drag There are some tentative signs of a pickup in lending Some of these companies that John LaWare talked about are in a better competitive position Some of our institutions have raised capital and there's nothing like a little competition We're hearing now about beating the drums of who will be the next aggressive lender  As far as the manufacturing sector in the region goes, that's mixed Well, that's true obviously of anything that's tied to defense, and we have a lot that's tied not only to defense but to commercial aerospace, which is also somewhat weak Until recently, autos and housing-related manufacturers had been doing relatively well An encouraging sign we just had is this Digital puts on a show every couple of years where they bring people in from all over the country And actually they sold more equipment on the floor there than they expected by a fair amount, though other manufacturers we talked to are concerned about seeing their backlogs decline  For the US economy overall, I have little reason, as usual, to disagree with the Greenbook I can quibble on the unemployment rate, which we think might be a little higher in the out period than the staff has it, but the difference is minimal Also, I reflect everyone else's concerns about disappointment on inflation Looking ahead, while I don't have any disagreement with any individual  -24-    5/19/92  forecast--and this doesn't hold true just for the Greenbook--in most forecasts there has been a serial correlation going out two to three quarters, and we've all been overly optimistic Again, it's not a criticism of any individual forecast but it makes me wonder why that has been the case and whether it's more inertia and whether there has been more of a shock to the economic system in some confidence sense [than was anticipated] And it makes me worry, particularly since we're counting a bit [on] even the relatively anemic growth we see in this quarter, [about] what is going to happen to PCE in the durables sector and autos and in final sales generally That leads me to the view, even if I agree with this [forecast] that the probabilities are fairly evenly balanced on the outlook, that I'm not sure the risks are relatively evenly balanced The reason is that if we were to get another negative surprise regarding the pickup, I'd be quite concerned about the impact that could have on confidence and for building in this inertia in terms of trying to get things moving Another part of that, though, is that I don't think there's very much we can do about it Just looking at what is happening in several asset markets, there is a potential for disappointment, an incongruity between the rate of growth we expect in the economy and some asset [market behavior], particularly in my own mind the securities markets Now, I'm not saying it's our role to ratify it, but I think we have to take into consideration that that's a potential disappointment that is going to come along and is going to have a negative pull on the economy  I agree very much with Tom Melzer's comments on the Ms I've always been pretty agnostic about that But I think we're in this difficult position in that we've said that we're watching the Ms, and I worry about a situation in which we might have a combination of the economy coming in soft and the aggregates being out of their ranges I'm worried about that even in a world in which we do want to get to lower inflation I think we all agree on [the desirability of] getting to price stability, but the problem I have is that we could see something snap in the process here that would lead to protectionism, fiscal policy [moves], and other kinds of things that would make it more difficult in an ironic way for us to get to price stability At some point I think we're going to get some happy surprises in terms of this correlation of the forecasts, and I'm looking forward to that and will be happy to deal with those when the time comes Unfortunately, I have no reason to believe that there should be any bias toward a happy surprise more than a continued negative surprise at this point in time  You raise an interesting question--maybe not facetiously--about dropping it  And as if we [know] all of the structural shifts in these relationships and how tight they are  Just a quick technical question Don, you mentioned that the lags had to do with the tax payments and some of the other things that we think have distorted these [numbers] Could you quantify the lags from the inside to the outside of the deposits?  Right  Thank you  I support ""B"" symmetric I hope we need to tighten before the next meeting; I doubt it Coming back to language, on this whole issue of symmetry I remember long debates about ""would/coulds"" and ""could/woulds,"" and I find it very hard to get excited one way or the other about a consonant So, in that regard, I would go along with what you suggested  -44-    5/19/92  No You're right  With a resumption of growth in M2-- "
4721,1992-06-30," We have seen some improvement at the long end, with rates coming down I was going to ask you--this may be unfair-- to look at what has occurred since the last meeting, not on a day-to- day basis but rather on a week-to-week basis We now have a long bond rate just a tad above 7-3/4 percent How much of that is consistent with the fairly steady pattern we're seeing of, if not softness, a lack of firmness in the real sector and then a building in of further ease in the market? Again, it comes down to the question of expectations What I'm asking, and I'll try to be more direct about it, is Do you view the improvement that we've seen in the long end fitting in with the market's expectation of what we might do?  I thought it went up after the [ previous directive] came out indicating symmetric language and then--  It came back down as the data weakened It depends on where--  I don't know what caused [a move of] 10 basis points one way or the other but it was interesting to me that on reports of symmetric [language in the directive] the market backed up  And then they saw, if not a softening, a lack of firmness in the economy--not an enormous amount but a measurable amount  Back to Chart 17 I want to ask a question on potential, just in terms of gross orders of magnitude If we were to follow case 2 right now, say, and [the economy] were running below capacity in the interim, the question I have--and I think I know the answer--is about the relative magnitude of the investment that is given up because of running below potential for a while and how that influences potential in the out years even beyond [your forecast horizon] It's probably not great There were other questions about    6/30-7/1/92  how these various approaches could affect potential I was wondering to what extent the foregone production and the share of production that would go into investment have been incorporated and what the magnitude of that would be  Thank you  I thought this was just looking at the stylized facts Have we had any period in modern history in which there was substantial progress in the fight against inflation without slack?  Thank you, Mr Chairman In the First District we have not had a great change since the last time we met But I would have to say now that it's on the soft side of ""mixed"" The reason for that characterization is that there is a lot of variance within the District The only place we're seeing any significant bounce-back is inside [Interstate] 495 in the greater Boston area, where the economy does show some signs of strength with vacancy rates stabilizing, commercial rents stabilizing, and residential prices actually firming But all of this is because M2 is behaving the way it has! That's an exaggeration, but we're seeing enormous flows into mutual funds I meet with people from the mutual funds fairly frequently and they actually are at the point where they are concerned now and are sending warnings, if I can characterize it that way, to people who are investing in junk bond funds They have had just enormous flows--  That's right, because of the importance of the management of funds and institutions [whose assets] don't count in M2 and their being a big part of the greater Boston economy  That's right, the non-M2 economy See, that's why we've always been heretical! But there really is a concern about a potential break [soon] in the equity market and also further out in the junk markets There's a lot of worry about how sophisticated many people are who are reaching for yield coming into this market On a more serious note, once you get outside the greater Boston area, the periphery--my notes here say ""the periphery""--is poor And that, of course, is tied in large measure to what is happening in the manufacturing sector We're not benefiting for reasons that don't have anything to do with the national economy and the improvement with  -20-    6/30-7/1/92  computers It has to do with the problems in the high-tech industry generally in New England, though we are suffering from the pull-down in defense I think we're just in a long and inevitable period of readjustment here that's going to be painful Looking sector by sector Retailers, excluding autos, report a somewhat weaker situation; housing is slightly weaker compared to the last time except at the low end of the market; and manufacturers, particularly of non- computer high-tech products, have seen some fall-off in their foreign sales but some slight improvement domestically As for capital spending plans, the only reason anyone we talk to is investing is not to increase capacity but because they have the notion that they have to do it to remain competitive in a tougher world The price situation is very similar to what we have heard elsewhere, with lots of pressures on margins and prices looking quite good Bank lending is still quite slow and, given the amount of capital that has been raised by many institutions, I think it's less because of supply constraints and more generally because of the [slow]down in demand [Unintelligible] anecdote, we find that these things always seem to take a year and a half This week the Rhode Island crisis was resolved a year and a half after it started--at some substantial cost to the state, as is always the case  As far as the national economy goes, we're in general agreement with the Greenbook However--and this isn't a comment on the Greenbook so much--in going through the exercise myself for a Humphrey-Hawkins forecast this time I noted that at least in my own forecast, and I think this has been true generally, the central tendency for the last four years has been for serial optimism in our forecasts for economic growth and, with the exception of one year, serial pessimism on inflation I'm not saying that that's going to continue going forward, but I think it is instructive that we have generally been too optimistic on the economy and too pessimistic about the price side In my own view I'm nervous about a lack of firming or cumulative [improvement] in the economy and how this will fold together We're not seeing a firming, and a great deal of new softness is emerging On that score, the numbers that we've been getting on unfilled orders now for three quarters of the year become a concern One starts to ask What is the dynamic for this to come together? We keep talking about confidence, but unless we see some improvement in income, we have to start to wonder how sales are going to keep going And as for the improvement we've seen in income so far, even with the most recent figures income is not growing as much as retail sales and an awful lot of that income is in transfer payments If we look at what has come from employment in the profit sector, we don't see anything there that is consistent with an improvement in confidence All things put together, we would expect a somewhat higher unemployment rate than the staff, but marginally so, based on about the same outlook for GDP We think the staff forecast is pretty evenly weighted; however, I'm concerned that the cost of a mistake is not evenly weighted but [is greater] on the down side My view may be formed too much on the basis of conversations with people who are worried about continuing financial fragility and what will happen if there's too much disappointment in the marketplace  I'll make one final comment on this As far as the Ms go, despite the inverse beneficial impact in Boston, we've always been rather skeptical of the Ms But I do think they say something Just looking back over the last decade, unless we get a break back up in M2  -21-    6/30-7/1/92  we will be further outside the M2 and M3 target ranges than we've been in the last ten years in an environment in which we would have to say that, at least thus far, we've been disappointed with the economic performance we've seen I think that puts us in a potentially difficult position in explaining our actions as we go forward  My question was the question that Wayne Angell asked It was concern about the fact that we don't know when the correlation of errors is going to break and in which direction, and you answered it absolutely as well as it can be answered  Well, I agree quite strongly with where you come out, Mr Chairman While we may approach it differently tactically, we all agree that the idea of Fed credibility is very, very important, particularly I would say at a time when, as you mentioned earlier, there are so many shifting sands in other areas But I think we reinforce that credibility when we don't know something by saying we don't know it rather than by pretending that we do [That is] my greatest fear when we go up [on the Hill] I think Larry has outlined three alternatives quite well My own view is that the structural shifts are still going on and I agree with him in that I don't expect them to go on forever But I would be very concerned about making a change that would be predicated on the notion that we have some idea, with a measurable degree of precision, of where we are in this whole process I just don't think we are at that point The more difficult problem, as you indicated, is the pedagogical one the timing And in that context I think we just ought to say that we don't have a precise answer regarding what is going on and we'll keep [Congress] informed It's an excellent strategy  You have a narrower confidence; you're willing to support it with more precision than the precision we have in the Ms at this point in time  I just want to ask a question of Bill McDonough I'm taking the opportunity [now], but the question is one that was more relevant earlier I think we're talking about tactics here I  -49-    6/30-7/1/92  have a fair amount of sympathy for the message [and] the credibility we want to [earn] But the concern I have and the reason I strongly support staying with the existing ranges is that I simply don't think we know enough I'm deeply concerned that to lower the range by 1/2 percentage point--the question I want to ask Bill McDonough is related to this--would say that we think we know something with some degree of precision We have three audiences the financial markets, the public, and the Congress The question I have for Bill is whether in this environment, looking particularly at the financial markets, he agrees with my perception that the markets think the Ms are rather confused at this point and whether they would put a lot of weight on the credibility side if we lowered the [bottom of the] range from 2-1/2 to 2 percent  May I ask a question just on the language? I'm sympathetic to the suggestion, but the concern about velocity also applies to what we're talking about for the '93 ranges So, I'm  -59-    6/30-7/1/92  wondering if it would be better just to say that unusual velocity could persist, period, rather than to say it could persist in the second half of the year If it was thought that that sentence would apply also to the '93 targets, that might be better because otherwise we don't have something that explicitly says that  I saw that, but the earlier sentence that refers to '92 is a little more explicit  I understand that argument and I don't want to say that we don't know anything; but I think there is a difference in being able to say that the world has evolved and that our body of knowledge and ability to interpret--our internal computer, so to speak--hasn't diminished in terms of our effectiveness But it's this external environment; it may be a subtle point and it may not be possible [to convey it] I happen to think that's what the situation is, that our internal capacity to evaluate these things probably is greater because of the experience than it has been in the past but that the external environment is more difficult  It was a suggestion and I withdraw it But I can't withdraw a question! [Laughter]  Don, what is your early look at next week?  Mr Chairman, this obviously is as tough a situation for deciding what to do in the immediate situation, [as we've had] in some substantial period of time But I must say that, for my own reasons, I find myself having views that are very similar to Jerry Corrigan's In looking at the reasons, I find myself quite attracted to the second model as compared to the conventional model, in terms of what is happening with the economy A part of that is looking at the serial optimism that has been in my own forecast based on the conventional model going back for some time and looking at the optimism that has been in all of our forecasts on a conditional basis I am aware of the concerns that if the second model is [true] it means that inevitably we are overshooting and putting in too much liquidity, but I think we can sop that up afterwards And what that tells me is that we need a more activist policy in terms of not being so concerned about relatively small movements in the funds rate Though I think we come at this from somewhat different analytical schools, I am attracted to some of the questions that Jerry Jordan raised about credibility in the sense that if we said we're going to do something on the Ms but we're not doing it I don't like the excuse that we were unwilling to move the funds rate to [achieve that] Also, looking at what we might do right now, I do think that a move in the prime rate would be beneficial for the economy as a whole; I don't have a lot of concern that we'd see too much stimulus out of that, and I think we'd get [a prime rate cut if we eased] To tell you the truth, in the absence of the jawboning that we've had from the Administration--if we weren't in such an awkward position--I would generally prefer to do something at this meeting I have to disagree with Ed a little in that under ordinary circumstances I would have preferred [a cut of] 25 basis points at the meeting today But in the environment we're in, with this amount of jawboning, I'd be cautious about pushing too hard for that Where all of this leads me, to go back to Bob Black's analogy, is that I'm 60/40 in favor of what you're doing but that's heavily weighted by the notion that I think we should be asymmetric toward ease And the indication that you've given that we would have a conference call to deal with that assuages my own concerns that we should generally [act] at meetings or when there is full Committee consultation  Governor LaWare has a point ""Uncertain"" is uncertain enough!  ""Could"" be uncertain or ""would"" be uncertain  Please  You're absolutely right; it's a problem  Using 2 percent and 1/2 percent, I would think we'd want to focus further on the short run by saying that the Committee is particularly aware of the unusual relationship that exists with the monetary aggregates I'd just add something like that  -76-    6/30-7/1/92  tagged on the end, which is not specific to our objectives This [proposed language] raises as many questions as the problem [we're trying to address] Why don't we just say that the Committee was acutely aware that the behavior [of the aggregates] has been unusual-- not necessarily in those exact words  That's exactly right  The point is that we don't know whether they are expected to be consistent; we have less expectation of consistency  ""During this period"" or ""in this period of uncertainty"" or something like that  Where are you going to start to drop?  I think that's a better suggestion The problem is Do we really think that these reserve conditions are expected to be consistent in the world that we're in now?  Yes, that's what I would prefer  Good idea "
4758,1992-08-18," Bill, the questions I have do not have to do with the tactics of what we're doing because I have full faith and very strong confidence in the tactics that we use in carrying out these operations I have to confess, though, to being somewhat perplexed-- and I'm sure there's an answer to this--about what our policy is and what we're trying to do here and to what extent I just want to be reassured that what we're doing is in the interest of having more orderly markets and [is appropriate in regard to] its impact on the domestic securities market, more particularly the government bond market Just looking at this round of [actions] and looking at the longer-term pressures, particularly if something were to happen with the German official rates, I worry about our credibility more broadly, not just in the foreign exchange market If there's a risk, it's perhaps inappropriate if we are seen trying to do something that is impossible to do So, I'm trying to figure out what we are really trying to accomplish here and over what time horizon I'm also interested in your view as to what extent [the exchange market] is a factor that is taken into consideration in terms of short-term domestic policy If we are concerned about the credibility of this institution, particularly at this point in time, we don't want to seem to be going in two opposite directions I'd be interested in how you integrate these things  Do you think its effectiveness is diminished now as compared to the first [intervention]?  Did I hear you say--this is almost an exercise at the margin--that if there were risks in either direction, particularly regarding employment, you think they might be on the negative side?  That's what I meant, on the unemployment rate  So the risks wouldn't be center-weighted  Are they in M12?  Thank you, Mr Chairman Unfortunately, I think we're in an increasingly interesting situation here As far as the District goes, in New England--consistent with what other people have said about their parts of the country--we had a little buoyancy before we lapsed into a softer state It's hard to separate all the factors that are involved--there are always special factors--but there is no question that there's less buoyancy than before We're not sinking fast, but there's certainly an increase in people's uneasiness Some of this may be related to weather The retail sector has been soft after some earlier encouragement; tourism is not very good The mood is very gloomy, particularly as we get increased announcements of layoffs and further restructuring in employment The tone of the labor market seems to have softened more recently, even I would say in the health care sector, which is one area where there had been significant [employment] increases Looking at the manufacturing sector, the source of strength before was exports and to some extent [unintelligible] supplies for autos, but those are softening now In housing, there is quite a lot of refinancing activity and some marginal improvement in ordered housing--certainly not houses built on speculation--but not very much  The banking side is interesting Our institutions have improved their balance sheets a fair amount and they are taking a more active stance toward encouraging loan demand But they're not finding very much demand I think some of it may have to do with the need to adjust pricing terms to get back to a longer-term equilibrium Loan officers and many senior managers complain of still overly cautious borrowers; but really we just are not seeing very much demand On that score, just as a side point, it was interesting to look at some data When we pulled out New England from the US data, our region contributed a fair amount to the softness in loan demand in the Northeast and also to the employment problems  As far as the US economy goes, I'm finding myself in broad agreement with the Greenbook But if we look at previous forecasts over a substantial period of time, there has been a negative correlation in our errors There's no question that at some point this will turn, but one never knows when that turning point will be Now, I'm not critical of the forecasting process; changes are the [essence] of its nature But when I look at what is going on, I simply don't see any cumulating strength at all in the economy In different periods we see a little contribution from housing or exports and in some cases manufacturing, but nothing that really is coming together to accelerate into a consistent recovery All of this is consistent with the notion of all the obstacles in this long, long cycle readjustment that we have, which many people have talked about Another aspect to this--and I think it's why employment and what happens on the employment rate are key--is that people are writing  -20-    8/18/92  down their human capital as well as their physical assets With each announcement of further restructuring they say ""Well, you see this new [unintelligible] you're talking about, what am I going to do longer run?"" And in my own mind that makes it more difficult for us to have any estimate of what their equilibrium or desired liability structure is going to look like and to know when the saving rate is going to return to what they think is a ""normal situation"" People are very much in flux on this as they watch what is happening in the employment markets For that reason, I really have concerns--not about the technical aspects of the forecast but looking at the forecast from a broader perspective--about how even this wretched and anemic forecast that we have can hold together For example, a concern I have is that we think productivity will be a little stronger and we see a lot of continued impetus for restructuring, so the unemployment rate may well increase As the unemployment rate increases, that is going to have an effect on people's view of their welfare and it could contribute to a further increase in the saving rate Thus, I'd say that the outcome risks are slightly on the down side, though maybe not in a pronounced way And certainly in my own mind the costs of an error one way or the other are much greater if the error is on the down side  The second reason to question whether this forecast can happen--and there's nothing we can do about this--is that if you look at the broad society and the body politic, there is an increased impetus from either party for some sort of fiscal package, which is almost certain to be counterproductive in a long-run sense I just think as we get into next year, regardless of who wins the election, that there's going to be an enormous amount of discontent with people saying they are just not going to accept a situation where we have very slow economic growth There are a lot of people who are very, very concerned about their economic welfare in the long run I'm not sure what we can do about this, but I see a lot of stimulus for [politicians] to develop fiscal packages, and that's a concern I have I don't think our policy has been inappropriate; I think it has been appropriate But I believe we're in a very, very tough situation; indeed, it's what I consider in a broader sense perhaps a somewhat unstable situation  Could you tell us a little more about the qualifications?  I favor ""B"" asymmetric To tell the truth, if we didn't have the situation of wanting to be consistent--I'd be afraid we'd lose credibility in the exchange market if we did something now-- I might be inclined to do a little now So, for that reason I'd prefer to be asymmetric and leave it on hold "
4784,1992-10-06," Second  Bill, I just want to be sure that I didn't mishear something you said before Did you say that you thought the market had--""built in"" is too strong a phrase--a sort of preponderance of expectation of a 25 basis point cut in the funds rate?  I was just going to ask you this To the extent one can reconcile that with the question Ed Boehne raised on your point regarding concern about a potential break away on the down side, is the market seeing that as a factor that might lead to this break away? Is that a factor they see that might or might not lead to this?  Second  I want to ask Ted a question I don't mean to try to put too fine a point on this, but it's just because I find today's discussions even more difficult than usual even though they're often very difficult Ted, you mentioned the jitters in the markets This links back to what Bill McDonough was talking about before Do you see a difference in the jitters in the markets given their expectations of what we're going to do one way or the other? In other words, are the markets likely to become more or less jittery whether we act or don't act or is it pretty much center-weighted?  It's a very difficult situation  That's precisely the answer Thank you  And given lags  I'll cede  I don't know if there's anything dramatically new in our District What may be not dramatically new, consistent with what other people have said, is that there is a deepening disillusion and fear being reflected in consumption and other things It's not panic, but fear is the word that unfortunately is [applicable] I think; I suppose [it reflects] regional problems; considering our employment is down 10-1/2 percent from the peak, that's not greatly surprising Manufacturing over the period since the last FOMC has turned somewhat more sluggish That's tied largely to the aircraft and the auto industries and to the problems we have that are endemic to the local computer industry and their competitive niche Retailing is mixed Value price retailers report some strength on mixed sales Actually, an interesting phenomenon is that they're reporting a willingness to hold inventories longer, given the reduced costs to carry But upscale retailers are reporting that sales are pretty poor Auto sales are soft and that has gone on since the last period The one sign of strength that we have seen is in the housing area for first-time home buyers--low-price houses are being built--but there has been a slowdown again in [sales of] upper price houses Prices are very well behaved We hear these stories about plywood prices-- I'm sure everyone does-- and the pickup trucks heading down Route 495  As far as the US economy goes, I find myself as usual in broad agreement with the Greenbook forecast I'd quibble slightly    10/6/92  with some elements of it Given the employment information we have, for the output that is in the Greenbook I think we might have an even slightly higher unemployment rate But I do believe the forecast itself is internally consistent There are risks, obviously We've been on the low growth path for quite a long period of time; and we don't know what shocks or episodes could come along and knock us off this path from one side to the other We see some of that potentially happening and then reversing itself in the stock market Also, I personally believe that there's a lot to this headwind argument--that this is a rebalancing of people's internal balance sheets But it's very hard, even though we see improvement, to know what the new optimal balance sheet is that individuals and even corporations have in mind, given that many of them have been through a quite frightening period  At the end of the day, what this comes down to for me is that while many of us usually say we generally agree with the Greenbook and could be fairly comfortable with the outcome in the Greenbook, I have to say that I'm pretty uncomfortable with the outcome in this Greenbook Looking at the third quarter next year, we still have an unemployment rate--and, as I say, mine would be slightly higher--that is hovering just below 8 percent and we haven't gone through 3 percent [GDP] growth I think in its broadest terms this is just not going to be an acceptable outcome Unfortunately, again repeating what other people have said, I just don't see the engines that are going to bring us away from this So, I think we're in a very, very difficult position I'm sure--""sure"" may be a little strong--that we will see some sort of fiscal package regardless of who wins [the election] I don't think that's something that we should be weighing in our calculations, so we're in a very delicate position My sympathy, like Ed Boehne's, lies with doing something more The only thing that would dissuade me in that sympathy is a strong argument that the credibility of the organization would be hurt by our doing something close to an election I personally have a lot of skepticism about that argument because we're so close now and the lags are [long], but it's something I think we should discuss a little in the general monetary policy discussion Thank you  Mr Chairman, I would prefer to act and I'd prefer to act now But let me add some qualifiers to this This is as tough a situation as we've seen, at least in a while And it seems to me that on the basis of the discussion there is little question about which direction--unless we're happily surprised or we get extraordinary shocks the other way--our next move will be Generally, I prefer to do things at meetings I have some sympathy for the arguments that were raised by Governor Lindsey in that regard We do have uncertainties out there and I have no illusions about my ability to read these uncertainties in terms of the exchange market or other things that might come along There is this question of just how much data we're going to get in I guess it depends on how one interprets your recommendation I interpret your recommendation on being highly asymmetric toward ease as saying that the timing to some extent will be decided by you The direction is not necessarily completely  -48-    10/6/92  decided yet, but there would be a predisposition to ease--I was writing down your words--unless we were to see some strengthening in the economy On that basis and given all of the uncertainties in the economy and in institutions, I would reluctantly support your recommendation "
4811,1992-11-17," Second  Well, Mr Chairman, there have not been great changes in the New England region since the last meeting, contrary to some of the stories around here There does seem to be some slight feeling of improvement, at least in mood, since the last meeting However, and this is consistent with what Ed Boehne just said, one thing that I'm rather struck by is that when we call around and talk to manufacturers--for example, which is seeing improvement in some lines--they tell us that they are still planning on continued restructuring in employment There just is no one talking about anticipating increases in hiring, including those in the health care sector The manufacturing sector has become slightly more pessimistic because of the export side, with many of our high-tech companies seeing a slowdown in their sales both to Asia and to Europe Retailers are somewhat more optimistic; it has to do with where they started out, I think But there is also a lot of discussion about additional sale days before Christmas this year Consistent with the question that Jerry Corrigan raised on the auto side, autos have seen some general improvement, but in talking to in New England he expressed real concern He had seen a lull in sales since all this news about GM came out He said they did have people coming into the show room now expressing concern about where they were going to be able to get car service in the future, that sort of thing As for the real estate market, on the residential side prices do seem to have bottomed out now; on the commercial side they're still softening but  -10-    11/17/92  probably are fairly close to a bottom Banks see very little good loan demand We still get a lot of complaints about the credit crunch  On the national scene, I don't have any real disagreement with the Greenbook based on its assumptions, and I think it makes assumptions that it has to make in terms of fiscal policy because we have to consider what we're doing ourselves The only issue I would raise--and I guess we'll hear about this later--is on the export side That issue is whether there's any reason, given the further strengthening of the dollar and the weakness that we've seen in forecasts for Europe and Japan, to expect some further decline there My main concern, as in the past, is that we have had somewhat of a serial optimism in our forecasts over time I'm not quite so sure that's true this time But even if one looked at this as being a balanced forecast in terms of risks, which is about what I think it is, we have a fair amount of room given the excess capacity in the economy [regarding] which direction we might want to make a mistake I also think that at this stage we can't be overly influenced by what we think fiscal policy is going to be because there are too many unknowns; we just don't know what it will be or when it is going to come into effect I think things do look a little better but as always there is a concern about whether this is just another false [start] or something that is going be self-sustaining  I half agree with Governor Angell, but I want to tell you which half I agree with It's not the short run I listened to Mike Kelley's list and I must say it was an ample and fairly complete list; but there are a whole lot of negatives out there One reaction I have is that it is a bit like what is going on in New England It's amazing that anyone is still standing! It shows the resilience the economy has, but it still tells me that there are a lot of factors imposing a drag We have seen some movement forward in the last month But coming back to what Bob Parry talked about with respect to the forecast in the Greenbook--I know it does not assume anything on fiscal policy and I think we have to act on that basis because we don't know when it's going to come and we should do what's right for monetary policy instead of trying to game that--I don't consider the Greenbook outcome an adequate one Particularly, I don't think we're going to see any sustainable, comfortable momentum in the economy going forward until we see some improvement in employment That's as much because of people's concerns about their employment prospects and the insecurity that casts over many people as it is the data themselves Beyond that, with this Greenbook [forecast], even the period going out as long as seven quarters is not really satisfactory A lot of concerns have been raised here about the overseas situation That is one new piece of information that came up at this meeting I must say--and this may be where some of these issues come together--that in this particular case given the [unintelligible] I am somewhat attracted to Jerry Jordan's suggestion of making a rate cut now I prefer it on the basis of the real economy alone But a cut now also [may help us] get M2 growth within its range; after all, we've said that we're going to try to [have M2 growth] come within that range To announce a cut now in the ranges without having done something to try to bring growth up into the range this year would look as if we were just making an excuse for why we didn't do that I think we are going to have to cut the range and I would favor a cut of a full point Though it's strictly a judgmental issue, my feeling is that it's probably better to do it in February for two reasons One is that we're going to have more of an opportunity to explain it fully at that time The other is that if we really believe the general tone of the meeting, which is that the economy is going to be a fair bit better in February than it is right now, it's better to make [the reduction in the range] in that context  Could I just ask a question? It's along the lines of something that Tom Melzer mentioned and it has to do with the timing, though I favor February myself Are there opportunities between now and then to send the study--the study that was released-- up to the Congress with letters to the staff, and beyond that to make statements yourself to begin to educate people to the technical aspects of this so that it doesn't become as much of an event? I think it is very much technical, and it's something that we'd like to do and not have anyone really notice  That's right  Go around  No, I'm ease, but could accept asymmetric  I'm in general agreement with what the last three people have said on this I was also going to ask Don Winn a question about how wide the interest was in the memoranda of discussion as compared to early release of the directive I think the Chairman's point is absolutely right We have to assume that things are going to be released unless we can make a strong case not to release them And unless we show that there's damage to the deliberative process, which is Larry's Lindsey's point, I think we would get early release of the entire discussion Pretty clearly, we all agree to that But unless we can show that there's that kind of damage, we have a very, very thin reed to lean on So, I just wonder if we went more in the direction of an earlier release of the directive in a broad form whether we could reduce a lot of the interest there is in this  I'm going to make an unfair request in terms of asking you to make a guess Think of the members of both Committees, the Senate Committee and the House Committee; if you were to ask them whether they would rather have a complete release of a memorandum of discussion with some significant lag or early release of the directive, what do you think the response would be?  But the fact that legislation might pass very quickly might argue for our doing something ourselves before something else comes along and is a fait accompli  It has no cost  Bob, I agree with you on this point, but we can't afford to bury our heads in the sand either  There are sensible things that have been talked about that could be done here that would really be an improvement We talked about announcing what we're doing so there isn't this confusion of ""did they or didn't they?"" in the market And people seem to think that's an advantage If there are things we can do that improve communications and we're not doing them strictly to respond to this but [also because] they have the ancillary benefit to which we are responding as well, I think we ought to do those things I don't think we ought to stand up and, for lack of a better word, try to be overly ""macho"" or independent and just say because [Mr Gonzalez has] raised it we're not going to do it I am afraid this is a perilous year for us, and we could get into a situation of this escalating further and further "
4847,1992-12-22," Second  Ted, I thought the Hooper-Johnson memo was extremely interesting in a number of dimensions That shows that [growth abroad] has more of an impact, obviously, in a polar-case situation on US growth than I would have thought intuitively It is a polar-case situation, but it shows the importance of exports I wanted to ask you to give a horseback kind of guess If you didn't have something as extreme as their situation is--which may be based on a probability of less than 5 percent--but you could get to something that had a probability of, say, 30 percent, where would that leave us? Is it halfway between what we have in the Greenbook and what they had in their note? What would the impact of that be on growth in the United States? I didn't know how to interpret this; I don't know whether it is a linear interpretation  Thanks, Mr Chairman Tom Melzer referred to the regional differences In listening to what has been said here, I am somewhat struck by the fact that we do have quite pronounced differences--I don't know exactly where the line is--in the north of California and in some other parts of the country In terms of activity, I would say that in the New England region nothing is very different than at the time of the last meeting, but there is a palpable improvement in mood and attitude I don't think there is anyone who is ebullient in New England at this point, but retailers are considerably more optimistic about Christmas They have seen better activity so far and, interestingly, in the nondurables area There are the usual complaints about margins, with price competition being very severe Where the final retailing figures will come out in our part of the country is not completely clear because retailers did lose two days with the storm last weekend They think they will get most but not all of it back, but that will offset a lot of the extra two days in the shopping season  The employment markets remain relatively soft with hiring being impacted by continued layoffs In our District that includes IBM and of course the defense sector, which is going to [lay off workers] for some time One sector where we do see some improvement is in housing, consistent with what other people have said Housing prices have stabilized and in fact some isolated markets actually show increases We also think it's going to take a long time for the commercial real estate sector to work out its problems Our banks say that they are seeing some improvement in loan demand, with some growth in loans; but that is being offset in terms of the gross figures by paydowns from other sectors Like other people, our manufacturers have expressed a great deal of concern about the exports side We have a lot of people who sell things [abroad], including non-price- sensitive high-tech kinds of things, who are seeing a quite pronounced slowdown in Europe Perhaps like Richmond, our tax receipts are showing some improvement; but interestingly they are more on the sales side than on the income-related withholding side, where we really haven't seen improvement  For the nation, I think there has been a definite improvement; one can't help but be impressed by the breadth of the sectors reflecting this improvement I still have concerns about sustainability, though I have to say that is something only time will tell, given--to use Don Kohn's phrase--the litany of structural drags that we have I have a real concern about exports, which is particularly reflected in this work done by Johnson, et al Overall, we're somewhat more optimistic on the price side and somewhat more pessimistic on the growth side on a marginal basis than the Greenbook I think at this point the risks are pretty symmetrical Things are improving but the sustainability is not guaranteed at this stage  Mr Chairman, in terms of policy direction, I prefer ""B"" symmetrical, and let me mention why While we study [the economy] an awful lot, I don't think that excludes us from a natural human tendency to have expectations and sentiments that swing too far in one direction or the other I don't think we're exempt from that general tendency I'm encouraged that the [economic outlook] is better, but I think it's far from certain for a number of the reasons you have mentioned I'm inclined to think the potential is greater than we have assumed But the timing of changes in potential as these released workers, if you want to call them that, become more fungible and can be absorbed in a different capacity back into the work force is very, very uncertain and hard to judge I just don't see in the global situation that we will have price pressures in the immediate future I'm not saying that won't happen before long--obviously we have to be diligent about [monitoring] that--but I don't think there is a strong concern about that at this time Also we have this very difficult situation of the very slow rate of growth of M2, with M2 being what we do report to the Congress regardless of my skepticism about it, and the fact that you are going to have to go up [to Congress and testify] So, coming from where we've been in an asymmetric stand toward ease, I think it would be premature at this time not to have at least a way station for some time in terms of symmetry  No, I didn't think you would  That's right "
4862,1993-01-06," Mr Chairman, I very much agree with what you said I just want to ask a question If one were to say that he is sympathetic to the idea of reintroducing the memorandum of discussion, provided it is released after a long, long period and then indicated that we would need [legislative] protection, that does seem to me to    1/6/93  raise the [broader] issue that some legislation is necessary And that is a fairly important issue We would be saying that we might want some form of legislation  I agree with what you are saying It is true that getting into it is the basic problem; I understand But the existing statutes aren't there and that would be their natural response I think we're right back to that burden of having them say ""Well, what would you need in the way of statutes?""  I think Jerry has a point If we respond collectively on the 15th--and if one were to assume for a moment that all our responses are not absolutely identical--he may well have called someone up to testify between the time he gets our responses and the time of the Humphrey-Hawkins [testimony] It may not be likely, but anything is possible  I think that is the purpose  Thank you  We need a new phone system! "
4889,1993-02-02," Second  Mike, you touched on this What are you inclined to think--I guess not terribly much--about these arguments on the composition of inventories? I've seen things about work-in-process inventories having declined more than inventories at the wholesale and retail levels  The increase you have in inventories is not focused in any one sector particularly?  Thank you, Mr Chairman As I listen to this, it really is striking how much variance there is, not only around the country but within areas I would say the tone in New England is very similar in many ways to that in San Francisco The economy remains mixed although improved from the first quarter of last year Retailers had a much improved Christmas and their inventories are quite lean now There are the usual complaints about margins; people expect to be able to increase margins, and there haven't been the post-Christmas sales we often have seen in the past One strong sector has been the nonbank financial services sector, particularly in greater Boston That has had an impact not only on the housing market, which has stabilized and actually turned up a little, but also on the commercial real estate market, which also has stabilized However, [commercial rentals] have stabilized at around $22 a square foot, I'd say, for top Class A space, which translates to the space being worth somewhere around $120 to $150 a square foot; it was built at $250 to $400 in a lot of cases So, there is an adjustment clearly going on  That's right We used to be a manufacturing intensive District but the manufacturing that we still have is really soft now, I'd have to say There's a little strength in some specialties--instrumentation and that sort of thing--but manufacturing is not doing well at all A lot of that [reflects] unique structural problems There are a lot of complaints, though, about softening in Europe because trade is very important for us We see a lot of this restructuring that people mentioned is also going on elsewhere Pratt and Whitney, which produces aircraft engines, is in the process of laying off 10,000 workers, and that is having a very strong impact; that's nondefense related, but there are other defense cuts in that area The cumulative impact of all these things is that in New England anyway employment is still declining at about a 2 percent annual rate In the states that we have data for we tried to understand the difference, similar to [the way we look at] the national data, between the household series and the payroll series to see if new firms [help to provide an explanation] A little digging shows no increase in such things as telephone or electric company hookups, which one might expect to be associated with new firms starting up  As far as the national economy goes, I have little difference of opinion with the Greenbook I continue to be concerned about the export situation I think none of us understands the full dynamics of this restructuring process and its impact on prices and employment Now, we think in a simple two-sector model a lot of this stuff was produced in the defense sector and it wasn't entering the measurements for consumer prices anyway There's a lot of labor flowing from the defense sector into the other sectors of the economy, which is consistent with the decline in real wages we've seen and makes me more  -19-    2/2-3/93  optimistic, actually, on the price front Really, I'm quite optimistic on the outlook for prices for some time to come Consistent with that, if I had any question, it would be whether we would see the roughly 130,000 per month increase in employment shown in the Greenbook That's the one concern I have As a final point, I would say that while I'm very optimistic on prices, we have paid a big price for this; and that in my mind emphasizes the value of keeping the gains that we've had We don't want that to be in vain  Mr Chairman, I support what you suggest I think you're right that, given the relative variances coming from things we can control and things we can't control, there isn't any policy consequence within the ranges of change that we're talking about here I would think in that environment that if we had not already committed to doing something--I'm attracted by the notion of doing something modest and the limit of modesty is nothing--I'd probably do nothing at all But I think we have committed to it; and if we have to pay the price, I think we have to do it  Exactly for that reason I think we have to do it But I have some sympathy for widening the range to 2 to 6-1/2 percent because that is consistent with the notion [of how we view] this number If we were really being honest about it or if we were unconstrained--I'll put it that way--from a political perspective,  -41-    2/2-3/93  we'd say, given what we would like to see happen to the economy, that this number could be anywhere between -1 and +10 That's an exaggeration, but I [wouldn't] go up [to testify] with the same range, even though it is a slightly wider range than it was at some earlier points Widening the range says something; it's consistent with the notion that this is a very uncertain thing to think about And if we're going to widen it, I think you're right that we're committed to lowering the bottom band; it would look like we were caving in if we did not But I would leave the top at 6-1/2 percent  ""B"" symmetric  That's a good idea  ""Probably would""  SPEAKER(?) ""Are likely to""  Are we going to have a discussion of ""E"" at some point? I completely agree with what Mike [Kelley] just said and it seems to me that the only thing we might consider doing is the suggestion labeled ""E"" But how will that be pursued?  Three points One is, as other people have said, that I thought this outline was very useful to crystallize things I'm in favor of further exploration, but I think we need to be cautious And this outline process of listing the pros and cons is very useful to be sure that we've covered most things I have some sympathy for what Al said except that as a practical matter I certainly wouldn't want to revive the Memorandum of Discussion if we didn't have legislation [to delay its release] And I surely wouldn't want to see legislation just to be able to publish a Memorandum of Discussion Finally, I think there is something to be said for pursuing option ""E,"" along the lines of what Governor Phillips talked about I guess my interest in that is somewhat tempered by what Bill [McDonough] said, but I have a question on that It's not clear to me that, say, in the '87 case--if the Desk were doing something that hopefully was transitory in nature and wasn't a major change in policy and there wasn't a Committee meeting--that we'd have to go out and make an announcement that said in effect that because of the disruption in the markets, etc we're changing what we're doing I would presume that in such circumstance we'd always be able to do something like that  -66-    2/2-3/93  I don't know all the details of this but I wouldn't think in that kind of situation that we'd have a very precise tight notion of where we wanted the funds rate to be  An announcement effect of the announcement "
4906,1993-02-18," But what I would argue is that one reason the rate may be down, with a 6 in front of it, is that monetary policy has been credible It's only now being joined by the hope of fiscal stimulus; but it's because monetary policy has been credible  Mr Chairman, you referred to the assumptions as being ""not implausible"" Are you likely to get a lot of questions about the assumptions or do you want to get into that if--  Yes, I think it would be very early frankly, particularly given that they're just assembling a team at the Treasury, for them to have run through those things  I think that's right, Jerry But the question I had is Do we have to say ""not implausible""? Maybe it would just be better to say ""plausible"" rather than--  But the only question I had is whether someone would see the double negative as being overly grudging; they may not, given it's our usual way of putting things "
4931,1993-03-23," I would think we'd have everything to gain and very little to lose by doing this I can't think of what we'd have to lose We do have to be careful that we don't--and no one has suggested that we do--advertise this as a dramatic, sweeping change  Mike, people have been talking for a long time, particularly at the retail level and some at the wholesale level, about the fact that they felt very squeezed on margins That sort of talk has been consistently heard What do we know? Do we know much at all about what is actually happening to margins?  Thank you, Mr Chairman In terms of the District, things aren't very much different overall but there have been changes in the mix I would note that several people have talked about this change in bench-marking of the state employment figures and that same pattern holds in our District as well; it seems to be true in most parts of the country I don't know that anyone is going to feel that they were less ill during the recovery, but that's certainly what the data would suggest to some extent Retail sales in the District continue to show improvement; that began in the Christmas season and there is some continuation more recently There has been a fair bit of improvement in consumer durables--autos particularly, though, were affected by the weather They are changing, as you might expect, the composition of auto sales Four-wheel drive vehicles are very big and little convertibles are very small Actually, this is exacerbating the trend toward the increasing competitiveness of US vehicles It's really quite striking when you talk to people who carry Japanese, European, and American cars They really see the beginning of a dramatic change under way here In the manufacturing sector, I'm quite struck by a differential pattern depending to some extent on the size of the manufacturer The larger manufacturers such as United Technology, GE, Raytheon, Polaroid--not all defense businesses--really seem significantly more pessimistic in their outlook and are still planning to continue restructuring as they go forward, whereas the smaller manufacturers of instruments and  -19-    3/23/93  pollution equipment and a variety of other [products] feel a bit more upbeat Everyone seems a lot more concerned about the outlook overseas, particularly in Europe We happen to have a lot of trade with Europe and there is almost no one with any real anticipation of significant employment increases The real estate sector has shown some improvement In Boston on the commercial side, rents have stabilized and actually have picked up a little That's very uneven across the District; parts of Connecticut are still doing quite poorly There is a substantial amount of homebuilding activity going on, with house prices rising They're rising very much town-by-town depending on the availability of lots to build on and that kind of thing, consistent with other considerations Banks are seeing some loan demand now, slightly more than offsetting the runoff There's a real mind set--a bit too much I'd say--in some banks in terms of their view toward the future and wanting to get going on acquisitions and things like that The nonbank financial sector--and we talked a fair bit to people in the mutual fund business--continues, as reflected in the data, to see very, very strong inflows There is a lot of nervousness among the managers in that area because of the inevitable reach for yields and some concerns about credit quality spreads and about the market getting ahead of itself One last comment on the state and local fiscal side There will be a lot of pressure on localities because of having overspent their budgets due to weather- related [expenses] from the snow and [ice]  As far as the nation goes, we agree with the Greenbook It seems to us that economic growth is ebbing and flowing around 3 percent Right now, for a short time, it may be ebbing a little more than flowing But it's always difficult to forecast and it seems to me that it's even more difficult in the current situation given all of the structural changes that we have going on I have been struck in my conversations with people--again many of these people are in the financial sector--by how much more optimistic they are than perhaps a year ago on the inflation front longer term, but not in the short run And a fair amount of that has to do with a kind of enhanced confidence in the Fed over time It seems to me that there's not very much we can do in the immediate situation to enhance that confidence That may be something that happens as the economy strengthens, which is really when people are going to look to see what we do [Unintelligible] undoubtedly what we say and other things that we can do to diminish the confidence in the short run  Thank you, Mr Chairman I agree with Bob Forrestal I think it's a good thing that people raised the concerns they have because I think maintaining our credibility is very important I think 3 to 4 percent inflation is too high because it may creep up beyond that; the evidence in the past certainly is supportive of that I strongly support [the view] that it is the wrong time to change for a variety of reasons, which I'd like to quickly mention I look at the Bluebook--not just at page 8 and the questions that Jerry Jordan raised--but at table 2, which shows the credit flows over the last 6 months And I have a hard time thinking that that has been very expansive in virtually any sector because I'm looking at bank credit but also at the debt measures There just isn't a whole lot there That, of course, is consistent with the weak Ms that we've seen Also, we are in the early stages of a recovery and I think it's hard to say it has been overheated so far There's a lot of uncertainty about these structural issues None of us has any idea what this Russian business means, though I don't want to put too much weight on that But beyond that, at least in my own mind, I have to think about how we affect prices and what determines inflation And I don't think we can avoid [the conclusion] that the effects come through the real sector There is no magic in this I think, as Jerry and others have said before, on the way down we got prices down because the economy was quite soft; and I just don't see that we're in a position now--and of course this is what is reflected in labor markets--where there's the kind of impetus that's consistent with a longer-term rise in inflation Having said that, I'll fully admit that that story is going to be way too old if the price numbers keep going up and we keep saying that it can't happen in the analytical framework we have But I think it would be premature to move at this stage I also would prefer the alternative language "
4954,1993-05-18," Bill, what is in market expectations now in terms of the deficit? There has obviously been some change in that, but I'm    5/18/93  trying to get some view of any likely disappointment or, conversely, a pleasant surprise  Mike, I have two questions about inflation Being as puzzled as everyone else, I'm just wondering if there is any information in the cross-sectoral look at where margins have widened most I'm just wondering whether that's more suggestive of this regulatory, protectionist argument as compared to an ability to widen margins because of demand The other question is whether there is any information on the expectations side--looking at the relative deterioration of longer-term as compared to shorter-term inflation expectations  When you look at the surveys that show a deterioration in expectations and try to get a handle on what is driving the deterioration--and I'm not that familiar with the data-- I'm just asking whether the deterioration has [been much greater] in the longer run than in the short run and whether that would be consistent with the general notion of some kind of political deterioration, if I can call it that  Yes  -15-    5/18/93  Thank you, Mr Chairman As far as the District goes, the situation remains mixed I'd say it's soft, but not collapsing, and to some extent the overall tone is almost improved In the job market, employment isn't increasing but it's stabilizing; hours are up Hiring of temporary help is up a good bit, along with all you've heard We are still having major layoffs, though, in some areas and an overall softness in the employment market In retailing, like everywhere else, the weather impact was particularly severe Some bounceback from that occurred but there was some renewed softening more recently in retail sales The same weather pattern holds for autos, but auto sales have been making up their losses and remain quite strong Housing activity, particularly at the lower end of the market, is quite strong, with prices actually rising at that lower end for houses selling for less than $150,000 The rest of the market is still fairly soft The commercial real estate market is flattening with vacancies stabilizing but values are still quite soft  If you want another worry to add to all of this, you can talk to people in the financial services industry, particularly the mutual funds They continue to have very, very strong inflows into bond funds, junk bond funds, and other [investments] Everyone takes the money, but at the same time they express continued concern about the sophistication of the investors, particularly that in a lot of cases people are not really aware that they can lose some capital in those bond funds Also, a lot of concern is being expressed about how clear people are when they buy these funds in banks that the value of these instruments is variable, not just the yield  As far as manufacturing goes, the situation is mixed Anything tied to autos is doing all right; the same is true of environmental [firms] But in defense we see more and more of a slide; it's continuously softer Like everyone else, we hear continuous complaints about uncertainty and what is going to happen I had some people in the other morning and one fellow said his company was not going to do anything they don't have to do and that every CEO he knows is absolutely frozen until he can see where things are going  -24-    5/18/93  Unfortunately, as far as the national economy goes, I'm pretty much in agreement with the tone of the Greenbook that--excuse the colloquialism--it's just a plain lousy situation that we have here Like everyone else, I'm very disappointed about the price situation If it was just one month it would be one thing, but it has been longer than that now I really can't understand what is going on; I find it hard to believe that the fundamentals don't have something to do with this in the longer run And, if anything, the economy right now seems softer than six weeks ago at the time of the last FOMC meeting, [based on] retail sales control, [initial] claims, and industrial production But having said all that, I don't have a whole lot of conviction There is an enormous amount of uncertainty; and to some extent it seems with these concerns about taxes and other things that [people] are almost trying to jawbone the economy down, not in a purposeful sense but in the ""if"" effect it is having And in that environment, it's hard to have very strong convictions about the intermediate-term [outlook for] either output or prices  So, would you have a vote?  Actually, my view on this just changed 180 degrees based on what you said My original view was that there was a cost to going asymmetric and if the economy were to weaken and prices were also behaving favorably, given the timing of Humphrey-Hawkins-- But I'm persuaded by the point you just raised that if we have to act, it's much better that it be seen that there was an extensive discussion of this and not that a number came in out of the sky and that we were acting just on that number So, I changed my mind 180 degrees based on that  Mr Chairman, just on the issue of policy itself, it seems to me that credibility is a two-way street It's important to maintain credibility but I fully agree, as I think everyone does, that we are--using your words--in an unstable environment I would argue that psychology is poor not just on the price front; we heard a lot of that I think we're in a situation where a lot of our institutions look very weak And the Federal Reserve is one institution that hasn't looked weak so far So, I'd be pretty cautious about running off and doing anything that looks too much like overreacting in one direction or another And for that reason I would strongly feel that now is not a time to do something Also, on the psychology front, [unintelligible] even on prices unfortunately the markets would react with it I'm not sure Jerry Jordan's daughter would react right away [in terms of] what she wants to pay for the house if we raise the funds rate 25 basis points For a lot of people we would have to wait until it affects their pocketbooks and they see some impact from that  On the question of symmetry, I think that's not an enormous issue It depends an awful lot on whether we end up being wrong, which is at least a 50/50 chance How would we want to present ourselves in that case? Where is the lesser cost of being wrong? I think it probably is to be asymmetric  -50-    5/18/93  One small last point On the issue of implementing policy--and several colleagues have said this--this is an important enough point that I hope we would have a telephone conversation Everything else being the same, I would hope that people could be recorded if this is seen as a critical problem "
4982,1993-07-06," I happened to talk to about five people in the funds industry recently; I was doing it coincidentally I raised the question of how they feel about this; this was after we got the memo Two points One is--these were economists from the funds--that they thought the idea was crazy in the first place But beyond that, even if they were in favor of it, they expected they would have a lot of internal difficulty with their data processing people [at a time] when they are trying to cut costs; they thought it would be quite difficult Then, they raised several technical questions about things we'd have to do There's a lot of concern about this, including not having any theoretical foundation Also, what is set as the boundary for what to include and not include that's spendable? But beyond that this would be a new venture for us, using data that we don't really control in some sense  But even on a practical level, independent of what one thinks is the value of this--which I personally think is questionable--it would be quite difficult  Exactly  No, probably not There has been all this discussion as to whether they should be included in the CRA legislation and that sort of thing, so they have become very, very nervous about any step they see that makes their liabilities closer to being money assets I wouldn't be surprised, say, in the case of  that it would become quite difficult because the fellow who runs it--John LaWare can tell you--can be a feisty guy They might just refuse to do it because they're very, very worried about being seen as a [depository] institution  The Board might want to publish it in the Bulletin rather than as a release If we put it in the release it does start to look as if we're thinking about it for the money supply  A theoretical question on sacrifice ratio, which supports the question about speed effects Would that necessarily wash out over the cycle, depending upon how quickly the economy accelerated and decelerated, or is it [not] neutral in a sense? One can conceive of patterns in which it wouldn't be neutral  What are your thoughts on the sacrifice ratio now, given what we're seeing on inflation expectations?  It could be a very long distributive kind of function on people's expectations And as we get down toward [price stability] it could be that the portion of people in the labor force who remember the '50s level of inflation as compared to those who think that 3 percent is favorable has diminished [That would have] unfavorable implications in terms of the sacrifice ratio Maybe people think inflation can get only so low  This would forecast a real investment boom over a long period of time  It's longer than a Kondratieff; it's the Mullins' cycle!  The problem you'd clearly have when you get into it on other side is that someone would note that some people have raised their estimates on unemployment and would ask if that is our objective on real growth of employment It seems to me pretty perilous if you are going to have to talk before the Congress and say our objective is this on prices with this employment figure You are in just an intolerable position  Wait a minute I thought our policies ultimately were to maximize real growth and that what we did on prices was a way of doing that  Thank you, Mr Chairman Just a couple of points because it's late and we've gone over a lot of things As far as the region goes, there is not much change What there is has involved some deterioration and a slightly softening mood There has been a deterioration in the business mood from uncertainty to somewhere between resignation and fear I would tell the same story that everyone tells; it's virtually universal among almost everyone I talk to We're not two sentences into the conversation when they raise health care, taxes, and all of these other subjects I think Mike Kelley is right that some clarity would help, but I'm not sure we are going to get it in a hurry  Very quickly, retailers have seen some softening most recently Manufacturing is more mixed but the really strong spot we've seen in manufacturing in our District has been related to autos Everything else seems to have softened a bit, including aerospace, as one might expect Loan demand shows some slight improvement but is still soft Ed Boehne talked about an unexpected shock [unintelligible] would get here Actually, we try to keep in touch with financial people and it's interesting that they have expressed some concern about all this money flowing into mutual funds and about what will happen when we get a little market correction and people find these funds are not really CD-like in a nominal term sense I would say the mood of these people and the fund managers is perhaps understandable; it's fairly sensitive They're really quite concerned about this and think we might be in a fragile situation  Talking to the same general group of people about prices demonstrates the rather tough position we're in [because] it's a little like what David Mullins said They say inflation is not really a problem We ask what they have factored into their forecast or their budget when they buy things and they answer 3 to 3-1/2 percent inflation or something like that They say they don't really see inflation going anywhere One of our directors did a survey and found very low expectations about solving the inflation problem But when we talk to people about what they think about monetary policy, what  -37-    7/6-7/93  comes out is that they see this as not a monetary policy driven inflation, though they're not saying it can't be influenced [by monetary policy] But in terms of their expectations, they have a deeply held conviction that the American economy has some inflationary bias built in of around 3 percent whether it comes from steel protection, workers comp, or other kinds of things Essentially, a lot of people I've talked to think that it's so expensive to get inflation below what they see as an asymptote of 2-1/2 to 3 percent that it's not likely to happen  As far as the real economy goes, I have little disagreement with what the Greenbook says Our own forecast is slightly stronger I think the Greenbook is probably more correct, to tell the truth [Laughter] One place that I do have some concern is Europe; the news I hear from talking to people just seems to keep getting worse, whether it's American manufacturers with facilities there or people selling into that market or European bankers coming here Now, maybe we're coming to a trough on all that as well The long and the short is that I think the risks to the economy are probably centered, but they could easily go on the down side as well as the up side; I [can] see this going [either] way And I think the probability of another decline is certainly greater than zero  In terms of what we do about all this with policy, it's hard to think about much change but I would be heavily influenced by how the Chairman wants to convey things in his Humphrey-Hawkins testimony When we get to the very fine minutia of how we word things, that would be a significant factor in deciding  Don, I have a question which is a bit pedagogic in nature; it has to do with how we communicate The place I start is that regardless of which of these alternatives we choose, I don't think it's going to have much effect, at least in the shorter term or in what one might call the intermediate term through '94 and '95 and maybe '96, just given where we are on all of these things Therefore, I think the question is how in this terribly difficult period we convey to Congress and the markets and the public as a whole what we are trying to do here The question I had is Given the increased difficulty we've had, because of unstable velocity, in setting a range for any aggregate, has that in your mind been associated with an increase in the expected variance of velocities? What I'm coming to is whether there is an intellectual case here for a wider range  My concern isn't from a policy perspective or what you've done here; it's a concern I have from a communications perspective  I agree with that But I think the difficulty we have is that if we keep changing the ranges and we don't think we can hit [them] where we [want to] change them and we change them part of the way, what does it get us in an absolute sense?  Draw the circle after it's thrown!  But you think it's still desirable to maintain the current width of the range?  But any change presumes that we know something  Mr Chairman, I think this discussion indicates that we can talk ourselves into or out of anything and, therefore, we could probably talk anyone else into or out of anything [Laughter] So, we've probably made too much out of it After hearing all this, I have some substantial sympathy for leaving things alone right now and doing next year whatever is going to be done for the following reasons If we do make a change now, it's difficult to change it as far as we need to and have a great deal of confidence that growth would come in within the range this year If we change to a range of 1 to 5 percent, the center of that being 3 percent, the GDP forecast-- and I agree the forecast looks pretty good in this difficult world-- the point forecast sets us up for the criticism that while we know this is only a technical matter, we can neither control nor forecast it Maybe we could explain it given all those things we've talked about So, in my mind if we were going to change the range, that would [lead] us to Governor Angell's suggestion of going to where we center-weighted it to alternative III But then I think we would have a problem What do we do next year from that? So, that in my mind argues for leaving things where they are right now and--  For '94 I would probably go to 1 to 5 percent  This, I admit, is a Hobson's choice; there is no good answer here I would say that there are uncertainties which continue to evolve and that in our communications with the American people and the Congress we don't want to come forward with a technical forecast We don't want to imply a degree of expertise in forecasting this from a basis [akin to shifting] sands that is not accurate  Our best guess is but we don't have sufficient confidence in that best guess to imply that it could be interpreted [as the basis for] controlling policy  Mr Chairman, I would strongly support what you want to do I had questions the last time as to whether we should have gone to asymmetry, given that we weren't there I think actually it worked out pretty well  -67-    7/6-7/93  In retrospect it was But now that we're there, I think we want to continue to give the signal that we'd react relatively quickly--I'm trying to recall Norm's exact phrasing--were we to get [clear signs of an emergence of higher inflation] And I have some concern about the market reaction we might get were we to switch back [to symmetry] I also have some concern about what a switch back might signal in terms of people saying Well, does the Fed really see the economy being much softer than they saw it earlier? Also, I think your suggestion was particularly appropriate that, given how long it has been since we have made a change, there should be some Committee discussion That would be in my view the optimal approach to take  Are we into triple digits in counting his letters this year?  And they got it shortly after they had [announced something that was] an error; clearly, someone called them or they talked to someone in that interim period  Can I pursue this? Your guess is that he wrote the article based on [his analysis of various comments] You're right, I think, that if you look at what people have said in testimonies and a number of situations, [a reporter] can put it together But did he then in your scenario, if I can call it that, call around to people to get what he thought was confirmation of it?  So, you think he wrote the article before the meeting and he could have written a similar article before this meeting, unconfirmed by information post-meeting in time?  I don't remember the exact words, but I thought he effectively eliminated Federal Reserve sources but did not eliminate Administration sources  And if you expanded that to what I thought our rule was--that we not only don't talk to anyone but that we give no speeches-- I thought we were to say we weren't available for any comments X days before or X days after; I thought it was 10 days before or 10 days after  -75-    7/6-7/93  Consistency  But the difficulty is that it comes back to what John LaWare said about disclosure This Committee did have a discussion about that But at the time of that discussion I think we had a somewhat better recent history on leaks Regardless of how one interprets the Wessel situation, the CNBC matter was clearly a leak of some sort or another On the face of it, unless we can demonstrate in a relatively short period of time that this leak problem can be eliminated, over the course of time we will have no choice but to go to disclosure It's that simple We have not demonstrated as an organization a capacity to [prevent leaks] and [as a result] we're destroying the credibility of this organization and all the things that we're trying to do in terms of our objectives So, unless we can really get to that point very, very quickly, then we better start thinking very seriously about what we want to release  Because of the time constraints, I'd prefer you do the latter, too  What are those five-year terms anyway? I think you're right; that's a separate issue  Are we agreeing that we are going to do that?  Should we do it?  It's important because we can't even talk about our region Or we shouldn't even talk about our regions because if we do, it gets into--  Oh, yes, absolutely  Exactly  -86-    7/6-7/93  It is?  In the blackout period, okay, but not for any speech to be given outside the blackout period "
5009,1993-08-17," Mike, in looking at autos and at the pattern that we see before us, I was wondering if we had any feel on the leasing side on whether there is--and how much--an incentive factor that might come along like earlier incentives that we saw on prices Specifically, I'm thinking about the leasing terms which seem to be in some ways similar to the direct price sales promotional devices we saw earlier How much do they really shade the residuals very, very closely? Are they even going negative on the residuals as an incentive kind of thing? In terms of having some view of what is going to happen to sales going forward, I wonder whether this is likely to reverse at some point  We have a feeling that this is the same sort of timing that happened before We think that these [kinds of incentives] are going to be offered for a discrete number of weeks in some cases, never mind months, and that they will be removed at some point  Thank you, Mr Chairman Well, similar to many other places, I'd say that the region's economy continues to muddle along; it's not accelerating but it's not slowing either The only thing that is really strong--and this is a comment some other people have made--is the lottery industry and the gambling industry In fact, you have to be an Indian tribe to have an operating permit This has started a new cottage industry among bankruptcy lawyers who, fortunately, now are finding lots of work in trying to determine how many people are required to declare a separate tribe so you can get a  -12-    8/17/93  franchise to build a casino--I'm not kidding--because it really is an extraordinary license  Our pattern is very similar to the country as a whole in the sense that the retail sector is mixed It's not collapsing; inventories seem pretty good and there's very little price pressure We talk to retailers and they're poised to try to increase margins but then complain that they can't They say they have to increase margins at some point, but they haven't been able to do so The manufacturing sector depends very much on the product line I had a little concern from a regional perspective regarding the sectors that have been strong for us because we have a fair number of companies that supply the auto industry They've done quite well, but obviously the outlook for auto sales influences that Also, our computer companies, while not doing as well as those in some other parts of the country, are starting to see improvement With regard to this funny situation between measuring output and [unintelligible] inputs, I was just looking at the data that we produce for regional production measures And we see the computer [measure] is coming up; their employment is going down sharply and their revenues do not look terribly good, but there are more and more ""mips"" being produced out there At some point one starts to wonder about how homogenous mips are, whether they are a good deflator for this whole [industry], and how much more output there is in fact I just wonder how much of the dramatic increase we saw in producers' durable equipment, in computers particularly, is very heavily influenced by this measurement question on what is being produced People in high-tech industries-- instruments, medical equipment and the like--are expressing continued concerns about foreign sales, including some new signs of softness in the UK, which a couple of companies talked about Housing, as other people have commented, has improved; actually, it has improved a fair bit in New England We see at least some firming of prices even in the second home industry  In the financial sector, banks are starting to see some slight improvement--an upward trend in business lending and some improvement on the consumer side The mutual fund industry continues to see very, very strong inflows and there is continued nervousness about where they're going to put the money Harkening back to a comment Gretchen made about hedges in the foreign exchange market, in the institutional funds a lot of people are talking about having found inefficiencies in spreads in the overseas markets compared to the US market--for example, looking at dollar-denominated versus pound- denominated GMAC paper--and are going heavily into those investments They are doing the same thing in some of the other markets and then hedging heavily Now, of course, we'll see how effective these hedges are, but people are talking about just enormous flows in that area Consistent with what other people also have said, we've had a very, very good year for tourism, the best probably in four or five years Some of this is weather-related An explanation is that tourists prefer to drive when there is uncertainty  That's right He has not been welcomed with open arms by many of the people in Martha's Vineyard, but it's a unique place! But the way that most people are looking at it is that at  -13-    8/17/93  least it's an island, so they spin off from the rest of the region The interesting thing is that President Bush's area of Kennebunkport, Maine draws more heavily now than when he was President in terms of a President-related tourism aspect People--this is very, very micro-- are less frightened about going there because they think it won't be as big a hassle That area is actually busier now, selling T-shirts and all that stuff, than before  As far as the US economy goes, I think the Greenbook has it pretty much right I would think that the risks are pretty balanced the way the Greenbook has it I'm not sure that I'd put exactly the same weight on the consequences if we are right on one side or the other But in terms of the likelihood of what is going to happen, I think it's about right In terms of going forward now, no matter which side, an awful lot comes down to this question of what happens to employment and to incomes That's because there is a question of how much longer we can continue seeing good consumption without the growth rate in incomes This is the sort of tension that goes along, and history will see how it resolves itself  Could you repeat that?  Percent?  Yes, percentage points  Right  Don, I have a question that has to do with timing Even if one thought the probability was greater that the next move would be up rather than down, what is the longest that we've had an asymmetric directive in one direction and not acted on it?  Have we ever had one for five or six months?  Can I just follow up? I haven't looked at the data, which is what one needs to do, but how unusual would it be to have a period in which we went asymmetric in one direction or the other, then reversed and went back to symmetry, and then went back to that asymmetry?  Mr Chairman, I think there is a question about what asymmetry means May I just ask Bill or the market people What is the market perception of what asymmetry means?  In the intermeeting period  In the intermeeting period Thank you  Mr Chairman, the substance of this issue of what we're likely to do has been talked about I think we've been very, very successful on this But there's a real danger in any organization if we try to calibrate the cosmetics too closely This is not a simple decision, but at the end of the day the thing that strikes me is that we spend a lot of time at this table talking about the role of the central bank and how we communicate to the public and to markets as a whole and about the importance of being honest in the way we communicate And if the perception of the markets is that our directive does not refer to our longer-term strategy but to what we're doing in the relatively short term, I think it's plain that it's intentionally disingenuous and damaging to the institution to be out there saying that we're leaning toward doing something that we're not likely to do in the next four, six, or eight weeks "
5032,1993-09-21," Short data question Coming back to what Bob Parry asked about inflation, these mandated programs come and go and are going to affect inflation--or inflict inflation, however one wants to say it Do you have a meaningful number, if I can put it that way, in your forecast for that stuff now? Or is it just below the [unintelligible] in terms of being--  I meant prospectively  And the environmental stuff is all [measureable]?  Thank you, Mr Chairman In New England the economy is mixed but there are signs of growth To put this in context, in a sense one really has to look at this period, given the enormous overheating we had in the '70s and '80s in New England, as a long-term healing period I think that's pretty important, and some [healing] is still going on We see some wage rate adjustment [and other] things happening And there are improvements in some areas We've seen very substantial improvement in the banking sector Now, the returns are still not numbers that are comparable to national figures; return on assets is about 1 percent currently There is an improvement in bank willingness to lend, and I think an appropriate degree of caution with it, but there is more lending now even in small commercial real estate ventures On the small business side, I think there is a willingness to lend, and I think we actually have a new equilibrium being approached with small business loans being made on terms that may be [reasonable] over the very long run Small business just hasn't adjusted to that, and those who can't just have to get a deal someplace else and change long-term relationships But I don't think there's an awful lot more to be hoped for in that change in willingness to lend  Like everyone else, we're seeing an improvement on the residential side And even in manufacturing all of this restructuring  -20-    9/23/93  that has been going on--we had a lot of transitional problems--is still going on, but we can see the end of the tunnel, hopefully Going back to this issue of price pressures, it's interesting that in the health care industry, among the producers of health care equipment--US Surgical and these kinds of [companies]--we really do see a change in the way people are approaching things They think this is a permanent shift in their business in a lot of ways with very, very substantial price pressures, and they are adjusting prices downward in some areas One fellow from a quite large health care equipment company said ""If the country does the right thing, my business is going to be lousy for five years and there's just no way to avoid that"" We've mentioned that in the mutual fund business we still see very strong flows [and] increasingly nervous fund managers The comfort I take out of this is in their nervousness; it's the non- nervous fund managers who worry me But I think we are making some progress there in terms of people being more and more aware of where we are in this situation I'd just mention that tourism in New England runs inversely to air fares We had a great year, probably the best year since the mid-1980s in tourism  As far as the United States goes, I'm very much in agreement with the overall contour of the Greenbook forecast I'm a little more optimistic on prices but I have to admit that's based on a usual kind of capacity and to some extent labor market view of things, and I'm a little more concerned on the export side I would think that the risks are probably center-weighted One thing I can't quite figure out is these consumption numbers, [given] what we're seeing in the income numbers [The inconsistency] has been going on long enough now that I'm starting to wonder whether some of the other figures are right Particularly in New England, of course, there has been a revision in some of the data captured in the national revisions As bad as things got, the mood never really got as bad as the data were And I think that's consistent with what we're seeing now, so it makes me wonder about them  Over the long term, I think we just have no choice but to slide through this period; I have some sympathy for what Ed Boehne said about what monetary policy can and can't do I do think, though, that we can't avoid, not immediately anyway, the fact that there are tradeoffs in all of these things And I personally think that at least in the intermediate term monetary policy affects real magnitudes Over the long term it may be a different matter And I always thought the reason we want price stability--and I think it's absolutely important we get it--is to maximize real output So I think that is what we're all about; and unfortunately in some intermediate periods that can involve some tradeoffs  Good idea  ""B"" symmetric "
5047,1993-10-05," This is Dick Syron The point I would have is our capacity to limit such legislation that narrowly I favor the approach you have suggested But in what we advocate or suggest I think we might want to rely a bit more on our willingness to do this being predicated on a belief that we have legal protection under exigent law I will just say that raising the possibility that we would like Mr Gonzalez to introduce legislation that allows us to do this might well result in legislation that is a fair bit further reaching than we'd like in this area  Mr Chairman, I happen to agree very much with the statement you just made And I think the comments that were made about inhibiting discussion are generally useful But in considering this issue, I think what we have to emphasize is their usefulness, given the lag in time and that it's possible for [unintelligible] value on the free discussion of what one might call privileged information My personal opinion, having seen some of those meetings in the '70s as well, is that the way the meetings are conducted now and the tone of the Chairman has [as] much to do with openness as the formal records being kept I also would be a little concerned that someone would turn this argument against us and say Are these people conducting such a rambling unfocused affair that is so poorly thought out in what they present that they don't want it reflected in history?  Ed, I happen to agree very much with what you just said The difficulty, though, is [how] to structure this hearing and the way we go into it If we're completely on the defensive, we can only lose because the way this is structured now with all of us--I don't know how many people are going to testify but I guess it's an awful lot--the chances of there being a miscue or of making a mistake are fairly good I don't know how to do it, but if there is a way, along the lines of what Bob said, of trying to raise in our testimony something about the economy, or even finding a segue between the importance of what we're doing and the [unintelligible] in some of our regions or something else to try to get somewhat off the defensive, it's worth thinking about I'm not sure it's possible  Well, Mr Chairman, what I intend to do is to say Look, I object to a lot these changes that are being proposed I don't object to them in the sense that they are adverse to me personally I'm somewhat proud, I hope, of what I do in the FOMC But I object to them because of the way they would affect the people in my District And the people in my District don't need any more problems in their economy nor do the people in the nation at this point in time "
5067,1993-10-15," Mr Chairman, this is Dick Syron I think we have two separable issues here One issue, as Wayne said, is that it would have been problematical to change this But as Ed Boehne said, I think very few of us knew that this was going on But that has to do with what we said during a period in which we did not believe the  -8-    10/15/93  rules were that we might have to disclose something On the other hand, going forward--and this is what makes it awkward--as Don Winn's memo indicates, we are on the record indicating that we would be comfortable--we've testified and supported legislation several times-- [releasing] something that had the redaction of individual names or foreign countries and a time lag period that is similar to what Virgil indicates the Justice Department might be willing to defend us on So even [though] we didn't have knowledge that precise transcripts were being kept, we're still in a very difficult position--unless we want to say Well, gee, our individual rights were frustrated in the last several years--[in terms] of how we go forward with this, given that earlier testimony  That's prospective  That's a fair point  Well, if we supported that in the past, we might want to take that into consideration as an alternative approach to yielding pure transcripts from the past--if that would seem to be a reasonable approach to those who have asked or potentially would ask for this information in the Congress  Mr Chairman, this is Dick Syron I like very much the suggestion Bill McDonough just made I would make one slight change, which I think is implicit in what he said Going forward we would be consistent with the testimony that we've given in the past on this issue, which has been very explicit, including on the bill that passed the House--was it '83 or '84?--by saying that we could do Memoranda of Discussion going back X years--I'm leaving the three-year period out of it--but that the cost of that would be quite high And you would be getting them on a one-year lag basis for [meetings prior  -12-    10/15/93  to] three years ago But if you want, even though the cost is quite high, we would prepare these But let us do it one year at a time going back and let you look at them and see if they really are of any use And even if we had to do that, once we've gone through iterations--and I would suggest we give them one iteration, a year at a time--after a couple of years back people would find that these things are not very interesting and hopefully we could stop there  Well, that seems to me a very valid point and it raises the thorny, thorny issue of opening up the Act Do we require legislation to do this? I thought--and let me ask for clarification here on what Virgil said before--that his impression was that the Justice Department might be more comfortable defending us on a FOIA issue on the basis of some sort of three-year lag So the rationale we would have is that we're going forward doing a three-year lag with an MOD; that's the same [way] we would be treating, if it seems justified from a cost basis, some of the past [transcripts] Then if a FOIA request came along, one would hope we would get--this is a whole separate question--Justice Department defense  Mr Chairman, I wouldn't use the word ""erase;"" I'd say ""taped over"" I'm just afraid of a quote being taken out of context  Taped over is more accurate and pedagogically better "
5084,1993-10-22," Mr Chairman, Dick Syron I would also support the proposal I do have some questions One is that I'm not sure I would seek legislation unless we really need it because of the concern about opening up the [Federal Reserve] Act, unless we could do it through legislation in the Freedom of Information Act sense And the second thing is a minor, technical point On page 2, item D, Confidential and Financial Information, it says ""including central banks and foreign government information"" I presume the ""including"" is meant to imply that information about individual banks or firms would be excluded or redacted? "
5099,1993-11-09," It seems that there is one other issue here that is related in a broader sense, which is that their current problem is one that we got them into  I think Governor Angell has a very good point there in a broader sense Like a lot of people I am very skeptical, I must say, of intervention in many cases But it seems to me that if one were to look for a case that falls out of the traditional norm, if there is any such term, this would be the one It is one where in some sense the United States is in the process of entering into this treaty and a lot of confusion has been created about it It is an extraordinarily political issue There are a lot of things going on here that are not fundamental economics I think as a nation we bear some responsibility for all of this and I don't think it's quite the same as supporting ordinary intervention in markets  I know that Look, we're giving them the money so they will be able to say they can use it or else we wouldn't be giving the money  Charlie, what do you think would happen with the other G-10 countries in the multilateral program, assuming we go ahead and do this? Do you have any notion?  We have had too many problems in this whole affair with having to go back and ratify things in a broad sense So I would support what Bill McDonough just said "
5139,1993-11-16," A technical point, Mr Chairman, or a reasonably technical point The issue of our ability to obtain voluntarily [from contacts in our Districts] proper and confidential information has to weigh an awful lot in this I will tell you that anyone listening to this would have a hard time concluding that we're going to have the same kind of information presented to us by people in our Districts or anywhere else that we had some time ago So, we're in a damage control situation here  On the question Bob Parry raised of whether going forward we would keep records of conference calls, I would differentiate that If there's a decision or a vote, as you were suggesting, there's a need to do that But in the cases in which there is pure discussion, very many of those situations have been where you or others have been bringing people up-to-date on [matters that involve] confidential information So, for purely economic information or your telling us when you come back from an international meeting what happened there, I would think we'd want to treat that substantially differently  The technical question I have [relates to] what you talked about as an approach before I'd be interested in why you feel that we want a five-year window, if I can call it that, going back as compared to a three-year window going forward? It seems to me that there are two considerations One is that it's hard to say if those past discussions can put a chilling effect on this because they've already happened But on the other hand, there are rights to preserve  It's the rights issue, okay  Thank you  Well, this proposal is basically fine The greatest concern we all have in this is [the possibility of] a misunderstanding with the public and the Congress This is one of these issues That's the reason I don't have that much concern with somewhat greater release, done properly When people see what is actually done it will work to a substantial degree to our benefit Having said that, going backwards I initially had a preference for three years but I am quite convinced by your statement What we've done in going back is that we've changed the rules on people When you change the rules on people, that makes a big difference because the real question is whether you should do it at all That certainly argues for a five-year period I would go with a lightly edited transcript I like Governor Angell's suggestion of accompanying that with the raw transcripts so that people see what has been done And going forward I think there's a lot to be said for an edited transcript over an MOD because it has as much information Unfortunately, what is generating this whole thing is an attitude of misplaced suspicion and mistrust, which would make it difficult to provide an MOD rather than a transcript  Right  Both or one?  We've never had concurring statements at the FOMC  Mr Chairman, can I ask an information question?  I must say, I'm sort of intrigued by something that David said here and it's an information question It's a judgment question for you, I guess Suppose in the relatively near future, [and by that I mean] very near, we were to say that we are going to do two things or a package of things One would be that we would do something on this notion of enhanced minutes I might call them something different than enhanced minutes; I'm trying to come up with a new term of art And if we were to combine that with immediate disclosure any time the Committee acted on the directive--[I stress] ""acted,"" not just going asymmetric--if we were to do this pretty quickly with the kind of lags that David talked about, I must say I hadn't thought about this at all, do you think there's a chance that that would significantly change things? [Would it be viewed as] an  -38-    11/16/93  offering where we would seem to be coming forth with quite a lot and would it give us the ability to do away with keeping things which inappropriately could be subpoenaed and--  That's the question I'm asking  Yes, it has been mentioned  My first choice would be both and my second choice would be raw, annotated  -42-    11/16/93  That's what we should do  You couldn't take the ""not"" out with the light editing if it is clearly indicated--  Correct  But the edited transcripts still might be misleading And what I thought [about] was that it could be interpreted, since you've edited it, that you've somehow ""certified"" it, if I can use that phrase And editing may or may not fix things  [Five and] three  Well, [more than when] they were last enhanced--  SPEAKER(?) Put a little more pep in them  I didn't understand that enhanced minutes was one [of the options] Is this enhanced minutes with a five-year lag?  It's enhanced minutes quickly  Is that David Mullin's proposal?  Okay, I see Enhanced minutes; edited transcript  What time are we eating dinner tonight?  Any swing vote?  Is your enhanced minutes the MOD without attribution, essentially?  So it's the MOD without attribution?  There's another disagreement here We may be talking apples and oranges I said I was in favor of enhanced minutes But being in favor of enhanced, which I still am, in my view is part and parcel in a broader sense expecting that we won't have to have verbatim recordings in the future Also I must say in terms of the public appearance issue--though I'd vote for it separately--that I would favor combining the enhanced minutes with immediate disclosure when we did something  No, my preference was without attribution  That's right  Correct  Right To see this in the totality and how it would affect FOMC deliberations, I think one has to look at this meeting; it has obviously been impacted [by the prospect of releasing a transcript] It may be less impacted if it shows that we can't-- myself particularly--be quiet as time goes on So in two days [the inhibiting effect] may have all worn off But in terms of the totality of the impact on the deliberative process, I would favor a package--I hate to call it a package--of immediate disclosure when we take actions, combined with enhanced minutes and not taping I would consider any of those things individually but in the totality--and it's a political judgment to some extent as to what can be done--I think that's a far better solution going forward in terms of meeting our responsibilities  No secret materials  You'd leave the tape recorder on?  Oh Wayne, this is not a legislative body  SPEAKER(?) That's right  We're here trying to discuss as a Committee the best way to deal with this issue  I don't disagree with that But the issue here is that what I call the ""Mullins proposal"" for lack of a better term--  Confusion  There is something to John's suggestion, though We wouldn't have to wait until--  That's right  SPEAKER(?) He asked for the transcripts and--  What would you do? What would your approach be then?  -62-    11/16/93  That's a dangerous precedent  SPEAKER(?) A dangerous precedent  Given the choices, I would prefer to stay here for the next two or three days and work out what we're going to do going forward rather than do that  It was 1990  So move  SPEAKER(?) Second  So move  Mike, just a pure information question Is the BLS changing the definition of unemployment somehow? I heard something about a one-time change which is going to bump the measured unemployment rate by a significant number of tenths next year  So, after the first of the year, will they be reporting the number both ways for some period of time?  So conceivably people are going to see something that says the unemployment rate is a half point higher?  Well, it is going to be [unintelligible] because in the whole forecast period if we don't change what we assume, we would have an unemployment rate, [with the revised] measures, of more than 7 percent  Well, I'll just continue the chorus here Over the period of the last couple of meetings there has been a definite improvement in our economy And we see this across the economy Actually, in some ways the manufacturing sector has improved somewhat but a tension exists there Output in the electronics sector is starting to do somewhat better Semiconductors and testing equipment are a fair bit stronger and the software business is strong Everyone says they are [producing] components; the computer box business is dead essentially But that growth is working against the downward tension of defense, where the feeling is that defense procurement reductions are coming along a little faster, at least in these [electronic] industries, than people had expected We have a lot of auto-related small suppliers; they are doing quite well But a number of them report continued year-to-year price reduction pressures in talking about the Lopez era at General Motors And they report an expectation, when they contract at the end of whatever period it is, of 2 to 3 to 4 percent reductions in unit prices year-to-year Real estate and the housing sector have strengthened; and even in the non- residential area, though there is not [much] activity, vacancy rates have declined a fair bit in greater Boston That leads one to the question of ""Why?"" since we're not seeing it in other figures And yet a significant number of start-up companies do seem to be coming along It's purely anecdotal information, but we have a large patent attorney office as a tenant in our building and they say they've never been busier And there are some more broad-based data that are consistent with that The retail area is doing relatively well, with some improvement in appliances in white goods consistent with a strengthening in the housing market  -76-    11/16/93  In the context of all this, though, everyone we talk to in the production sector is focusing continuously on productivity improvements and on what they can do Everyone, [when] they see stronger demands for their products, talks about ""How can I [meet them] without making commitments for employment?"" I would say that the mood swing--this is not consistent with what Ed said--has been a pretty strong one to the favorable side by lots of people Actually it outstrips the data by a fair bit; whether it outstrips reality is less clear  As far as the national economy goes, I would agree quite a lot with the Greenbook I would think that the forecast there is probably center-weighted in terms of risks I believe this notion of thinking about the economy on a sawtooth basis has something to it We've been waxing and waning, [moving in] fits and starts, or whatever you want to call it And until we get evidence that our employment numbers are somehow suspect and there are other reasons to expect income generation that would be consistent with a rising level of sales, we could see some slowdown in the consumption sector And beyond that, I'm just sort of struck by how much moods have changed in New England Six months ago everyone thought we were going into a triple dip; now people are talking about boomlets While I'm not quite sure that reality changes as fast as moods--and I was just looking at the quarterly standard deviation in GDP--I'm wondering how much of this is a long-term shift and how much a short-term variation; that is something we've got to see  ""B"" symmetric "
5169,1993-12-21," Thank you Well, the First District isn't outperforming the nation but we are seeing continued improvement And now I'd have to say that we have legitimately moderate growth [In our] area there is not a boom but a substantial amount of what I would call boom momentum, where people certainly are feeling a lot better about this The exception would be where defense is very important, in Connecticut and parts of Rhode Island We have a fairly extensive sample of manufacturers now and I would say that they are on balance substantially more optimistic than has been true in three or four years, maybe even five years Again, there is some significant variance, but people are generally pretty optimistic with the exception, as you might expect, of some areas that produce health equipment that are actually seeing some anticipatory turndown as well as the defense group On the price side everyone is very, very anxious to do anything they can to increase margins but at this stage they don't seem to feel they have the ability to do so A lot of them are complaining about that An interesting situation was reported to us in the steel scrap area For a lot of producers the increase in steel scrap prices has resulted in a net reduction in their costs And you say How can that be? It's actually that the increase in scrap prices has been more important to them [because] a lot of producers sell a lot of steel scrap back into the market And it has been more of a benefit to them than the increase in the finished product with the change in the mix between integrated mills and electric mills and how that's produced So it's just a question of having to look fairly carefully at some of the price data  Okay  What has happened is that scrap prices, as you know, are up substantially  But many of the users of these final products of steel generate a lot of scrap themselves And the increase in scrap prices has been of such a magnitude that it has more than washed over for them the increase in the output price of the finished steel that  -15-    12/21/93  they're buying And you say Well, how can that happen? As it turns out, margins in electric powered furnaces have gone down  And what happens is that now the marginal cost of steel is being [unintelligible], as I understand it, at the integrated mills, and as that has happened there has been a reduction in the margin that the electric mills have had  As I understand it--and Si would know much more about this than I do--the mix has changed between the integrated mills and the electric mills  Significantly  At any rate as far as the national situation goes, we very much agree with the Greenbook forecast in general We are more optimistic on the price outlook I have to confess that's on the basis of what one might call gross macro relationships; I guess you can read that to be Phillips curves  As for where we go from here, I think we're clearly into the most difficult time in terms of deciding what to do with policy The key question is how much slack there is in the economy because on this issue of how strong growth is going to be in the first half of the year or even for the year as a whole, we simply don't know what's going to happen with respect to an issue such as the tax increase and how much people have adjusted their consumption patterns for that So I think Al is correct that we need to be very, very sensitive to this whole thing But it does, as you say, depend importantly on what has happened to the real economy And some of this we just are not going to know  Early this year when we were asymmetric for a stretch, how long were we asymmetric?  What is the pattern over the years of asymmetry in one direction or another? And what's the longest episode where we've been asymmetric in one direction and not done anything?  Don, could I just ask the mirror of that question, which is What is your rough recollection of the portion of the times we've taken action without being asymmetric? In other words, 60 percent of the time we were asymmetric and did something What percentage of the time did we do something and we were not asymmetric?  As compared to how many altogether?  Mr Chairman, I support your proposal We're always going to be acting in a situation of uncertainty; that's just the way it is If it was certain, we wouldn't need to be here And I think the time has come, if we're going to make a mistake, to err on the side of tightening rather than staying in a non-neutral position So I think that should be the direction we're prepared to go in Ordinarily we might think of asymmetry in that situation, but to enhance our credibility and maintain that credibility it's much better that this group act as a whole at the time [the move is made] I would hope it could be done with some degree of consistent spirit across the group at the time that it's done So I would strongly favor staying symmetric now  A likelihood  Mr Chairman, what I find should guide our actions on these issues is that we're in no way nearly as bad as we seem to some people And I was even thinking--I'm not suggesting  -44-    12/21/93  this--that if people listened to the conversation we had about monetary policy today they would be impressed about the degree of ""technicalness"" that's brought to some of the judgments and the amount of information And I think we suffer generally--it's just raised to other dimensions here--from a misunderstanding by the public about what we do Conspiracy theories are abroad in the land, and it's not our business to feed them when we can avoid it So I favor your suggestion if it's not precedential in other ways In that regard I am concerned, though I would favor going ahead with this immediate step I personally don't feel that on some of these issues, such as the ability to talk to each other about what we were going to do in testimony, we necessarily should have been bound by a request by [the Banking] Committee staff [nor do] I feel that I was properly advised on what was the extent of that binding And I don't think it's reasonable as we go through this in the future, which we inevitably will, to believe that we can't have discussions among ourselves on the nature of how we're going to proceed and that we can't be advised among ourselves by counsel of the Committee about the degree to which we are able to in the best--  It's a separate issue  No, I support this The only reason I mentioned it is that I want in my own mind to be comfortable, which I think I am, that what we're doing in this area will not in any way constrain us on some of the things I think we probably should--  Direct correlation "
5199,1994-02-03," Joan, just on that point This apparently will be germane to the discussion that appropriately we will be having later about how we announce one way or the other What does the market think we are going to do tomorrow? Is there any perception of the need to stay flat? What would they think we would do if we were staying neutral?  They may be including prefabs plus mobile homes, in which case--  This prefabrication total has to be awfully high You see these structures coming in on the trucks--  Mike, just two technical questions On this elusive business of potential, there's obviously no clear answer, but do you have any feel for where the likelihood of an error is on the potential? We are getting to really fine points here, but if you were going to guess, is the risk that your point estimate on potential is too pessimistic or too optimistic?  I know you said that when one tries to explain price performance, one can do it with the traditional model pretty much without taking the external sector into account in a different way than it has traditionally been done through the import and export channels So, you don't think there's very much to this issue of whether there is excess capacity overseas? Your view is that capacity utilization numbers broadly can be looked at now in the same way as they could be looked at before?  Right  Well, that's right You are capturing the external capacity utilization effect through those channels  But I was just wondering whether independent of that--thank you  Thank you, Mr Chairman Well, conditions are legitimately better in our District The region's economy shows genuine improvement; I think it's cumulating The only state that's an exception to that is Connecticut Manufacturing--particularly in durables, products that are tied to autos and capital goods--looks pretty strong Exports are still soft, however, and medical equipment is one area where you might expect this Producers of medical equipment indicate that low ticket items are still doing all right, but that MRI machine orders, for example, are off about a third, which may be a good thing in the long run Retailing is more mixed, but again it follows the national pattern with autos and high-tech goods being better and some retailers in soft goods feeling that things are relatively weak The residential real estate market is, I would say, very strong In fact, realtors tell us that in certain price categories in the low end of the market inventories are getting quite thin now For New England, given the time of year, there's a lot of construction activity going on that hasn't been reflected in prices very much yet But we will have tight labor conditions in the building trades this spring, particularly since there are so many roofs to be replaced, ceilings to be put back in, and other repairs made necessary as a result of the cold weather Other than that, there is some improvement in employment Prices generally are well behaved except for items that Si mentioned--shovels and salt, where prices can be over $1 a pound for salt  -17-    2/3-4/94  As far as the US economy goes, we tend to agree quite a lot with the Greenbook, but I must say we're somewhat more optimistic about this 1994-1995 period We expect output to be somewhat stronger in 1994, though not enormously so, which is also reflected in some greater attenuation in the unemployment rate We also are slightly more optimistic on prices, but that is because at least in the short run I think we're more optimistic on potential Well, that's where we are Thank you  Mr Chairman, I have a lot sympathy with what you suggest, and it strikes me that there's another information-gathering advantage--  -29-    2/3-4/94  All I was saying is this Just as you thought, appropriately, that it's worth seeing when we put out the transcripts what the reaction is going to be, we'll also get information if we follow this course from what the reaction is to it There will be information in terms of market and Congressional reactions, and so forth If essentially we tell the financial markets what our policy is at 1123 of the morning after our meeting--if it is really the case that by our market operations we generally do that--I have a lot of sympathy for doing it more explicitly the evening before My own view is that by doing this once we will get some information on reactions and we may find out what its weight is My own forecast would be that this would pull the teeth in a longer-term sense, which we are not resolving now, on a lot of these issues about disclosure I know these issues wouldn't all go away, but the essential information is what the final score of the game is The rest of it is akin to finding out what play Emmitt Smith was asked to run on third down So I think there is a lot to be gained from this without locking us into a longer-term arrangement  No, there's no legal question The Chairman before in Humphrey-Hawkins testimony has said something about policy and what the Committee has done without announcing a vote  Why?  Then you'd have to disclose the vote?  The mini-series will be out!  -34-    2/3-4/94  We're not writing a press release and if we don't say ""small,"" people will think we've made the announcement because it's a 1/2 point or 3/4 point increase or something like that  Yes, that's exactly right  I agree with that  SPEAKER(?) That's right  You can reference your JEC statement  And over what time period  To start out, I guess I disagree with Bob Parry I came into this meeting thinking that we should do something As I read expectations and where things are, I would have thought that 25 basis points would not be seen by the market as something that was lacking in courage or testosterone on our part I want to make some other observations, but could I ask a question of Joan just as we are in this comment process?  And the question is, Joan What do you think the expectations in the market will be if we are to do something? What do you think the market reaction would be to 25 basis points as compared to 50 if either were announced about an hour from now?  Well, let me just continue I think policy has been stimulative but I don't think it has been inappropriately stimulative I don't want to argue about a month or five or six weeks one way or the other, but we went through a period in which we needed to do something What we all want to do very clearly is to maximize long-term growth in the economy, controlling real growth As Larry Lindsey said, controlling prices is a mechanism for doing that But the reason we're concerned about prices is that we care about long- term real growth, not for some abstract reason While there's no long-term tradeoff, in the short term the way things work--at least in my model--is that we can't avoid some lost output at the edges; and what we're trying to do is minimize that interval of lost output over time I'd be cautious about doing 50 basis points because I'm not sure that we have to raise rates 150 basis points And at this point I wouldn't want to start down a path with fairly fixed notions of where I'm going at the end of it in terms of rates or in terms of monetary policy I have a notion of where I want to get in terms of  -52-    2/3-4/94  the economy, but not necessarily on what we need to do to get there I think policy over time has been pretty effective We're already what I might call orally asymmetric in a sense, given what the Chairman did rather effectively in his testimony I would strongly suggest doing 25 basis points now with this accompanying change in process And don't forget this will have a big announcement effect both in the way it is done and the fact that we haven't done anything in 17 months and we haven't tightened in 60 months I would also suggest that it's not terribly long until the Humphrey-Hawkins hearing and there's going to be plenty of opportunity to be orally asymmetric, if I may use that phrase again, or to indicate how we see things So, I think going 50 basis points would be depreciating a little too much the opportunity we're going to have to put this in context and may not be fully taking into consideration the announcement effect of doing 25 basis points and announcing it after this long a period of policy inaction  May I ask a procedural question? I favor Bob's suggestion I would be a little concerned about setting a precise date just because we're in this process of change The announcement, for example, is a change and these are all things that we will openly discuss later on I think we have to be careful that what we're announcing today is--  I agree with that and I also agree with that from another perspective In being fully open and honest, which we should be, in what we discuss when we release the minutes for this meeting, we don't want half a picture conveyed We don't want to say that there has been a dramatic change in process and that we went along with this policy but it was with a contingency--that it was really a nod and a wink It's fine if there's a call, but it has to be on your volition without essentially a nod and a wink agreement that, yes, we'll do this but with a strong presumption that we'll do another 25 basis points in a call I think that would be wrong I think it still has to be an open issue  Why lower it and have to raise it?  I agree with what I think was implicitly the Chairman's suggestion, which is that I would leave these ranges alone I understand the point that Larry raised on debt, and I could go either way with that But my own personal view is that it risks putting a little too fine a point on this That's a tactical issue; it's not a substantive issue I think the comment was correct, but given our level of knowledge on these things and the disruptions that we are and have been subject to, I'd be very wary of making a relatively small change in one of these ranges because I think it could imply an ability to forecast and to understand these things that is greater than we have I don't know if you want my view now on presenting a forecast for 1995, but I would have fairly serious reservations about going ahead with that As has been said, that is far enough out that it certainly incorporates as much an objective as it does a pure forecast And I think that suggests we need to think very carefully about whether we want to do that or not Thank you  Good speech! "
