 Turning first to the regional economy, we may have the strongest regional economy in the nation, and I think a good monetary policy for the New England region would be an alternative D When you get together with our businessmen, all they can talk about is the labor problem--that they can't get the labor they need We hear scattered reports that people are spinning off their operations in eastern Massachusetts or Connecticut and putting them in the depressed areas of northern Maine, or they are talking about putting them in other parts of the country They are not moving their entire operation, but are moving pieces of it However, I don't think New England is typical We have an overall unemployment rate of 3 percent, and in New Hampshire, it is 22 percent And that is not typical of the nation, which is 6 percent So, you can't really look at the world through our eyes  In our view, the Greenbook forecast for the US economy in the next 15 months is almost the ideal scenario If we have a sufficient guiding system to accomplish what that forecast suggests, that is almost as good as we can expect, considering the constraints It is showing a real growth rate of something like 2-1/2 percent with the overall employment rates and capacity utilization rates only slightly different than they are now, which would suggest we would have only this minor uptick in inflation next year And that is an ideal scenario So the question is Can we get there? At least as we read it, there is not much risk on the downside any more The new orders that are coming in, the industrial production statistics, and the probable greater strength from foreign orders, suggest that the dangers of a recession, at least in the next 18 months, are pretty well washed away On the upside--the possibility of having something faster than a 2-1/2 percent real growth rate--we have set in train two actions just in the last 25 days which provide us some insurance [against that] And the staff talks about additional actions during the next year that--it is our best guess--would provide additional insurance Our hope is that we can achieve the forecast that the Greenbook so optimistically puts forward I don't think I have anything to contribute to what other people have said on the long-term bond rate  -28-    9/22/87   Well, wage rates are moving up faster   Well, you would have to talk about pieces If you talk about the price of housing, we used to be--   When you talk about rental housing, it doesn't show up that much But, in fact, when you're trying to bring in professional people, you can't do it All the businessmen we talked to say they can't bring in anybody to buy a shack that costs $250,000; so there is no labor mobility in view of the housing shortage Eventually, we will not have that housing shortage, as we didn't have it in the long run in California It may be three years away So there is not much mobility, despite the fact that we pay somewhat higher wages, because the real cost of living for someone moving in and buying a house is almost impossible   I support you, Mr Chairman $600 million and a symmetric directive
