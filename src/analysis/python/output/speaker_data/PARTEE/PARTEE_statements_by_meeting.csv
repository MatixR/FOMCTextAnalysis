14,1976-03-29,"  This is in determining M1  The question is, can we do better with the  federal funds rate or with some kind of reserve [aggregate]?  I think the answer was that there is  not much difference    I was speaking to that quote you read and also to these tests, which are  predicting the ability to determine M1    That has some federal funds rate--     If I may ask a question?  Jack, turning to table 2, now what we’re talking  about--the first proposal of the subcommittee--is that you substitute nonborrowed reserves for  RPD as an operating specification  Table 2, and I’m taking it to mean absolute error--as an  example, if one compares nonborrowed reserves to the third line with RPD--    Table 2    Well, I’m looking through the whole series, because the comment was  made that nonborrowed reserves were very bad and RPD was very bad in 1975, but as I look at  this year-by-year, comparing nonborrowed reserves with RPD, I don’t see that nonborrowed  reserves were at any time appreciably better than RPD as a predictor over this five-year run  Am  I reading that correctly?    Well, I guess my question though is that--    That’s exactly my question  That is, wouldn’t we be--my question frankly  is--wouldn’t we be as embarrassed with nonborrowed reserves missing it by a very wide margin  as we have been by RPD missing it by a very wide margin?  Is there that much to choose  between one and the other if one assumes that we’re not going to hit it--that is, that we’re going  to have the same kind of difference since we’re mainly interested in the monetary aggregates  rather than these [unintelligible] as we used to call RPD?  Would we be that much better off with  it than we were with RPD?    Do you mean that, with no federal funds rate constraint, you could hit it  better with nonborrowed reserves?    This is just doing it once every six months, Steve, is that right?  You’re  not talking about coming back month after month and adjusting your federal funds rate?    Then you’d miss the nonborrowed reserve [target]    The problem I have with it, Mr Chairman, is that once you admit that the  RPD wasn’t hit because of federal funds rate constraints--well-intentioned, proper policy as it  was--then you would have to conclude that no other reserve aggregate would be any better than  RPD  That is, I don’t know how you keep from saying [unintelligible] about reserves    Not with a federal funds rate constraint, he has no better ability to control  it    Maybe a paragraph in the Record of Policy Actions    The small changes are cumulative  "
39,1976-04-20,"  Just for the record, if the Mexicans devalue the peso, we’re fully covered  aren’t we?    On that side, there’s no sharing for that responsibility, on the other side of  this    While [we are] on the table [discussed by Mr Wallich], I think it is  correct, Lyle, and I would like to remind the Committee that what really these alternatives one,  two, and three show are the differences that you would expect to result if you had a little higher  money growth, a little lower money growth  That is, the basic presumption is that the 6 percent  rate of money growth would bring an increase in real GNP of some 5 percent    And that is the judgmental projection, and all the alternatives are giving  you are the implied differentials that would result from those alternatives  So all these figures  look disappointingly low to me in terms of real growth rates  But then the question is, is the  judgmental projection likely to be accurate or not?  Is the base rate of growth in real GNP likely  to be cruising down here around 5 percent or could it be higher?  This table, of course, doesn’t  answer that    But we don’t know that the differentials are increased    All we are using the model for is to estimate the differentials from the  basic judgmental projection    5-1/2 to 6 percent is your range?    The interest in internal funds is very sharp, very much more than--    So you could, I presume, finance a larger inventory--     --with those increased internal funds    It’s the same argument, isn’t it, that holding down interest rates prevents  inflation?    I was simply going to say that I  thought this first month was a telling kind  of experiment because, if I understand it, M1 and M2 were right on target, very close to the  midpoint  There was, in a sense, a mechanical problem and its specification on nonborrowed  reserves, that is to say, the multiplier, changed a little bit  So you would have had to have raised  the federal funds rate by 1/2 percentage point by the end of the period, even more if you hadn’t  been following a rule on constraint, even though the M1 and M2 figures were quite good  I think  you do ask whether there was a mechanical problem here in the sense of specification of the  multiplier that would have resulted in a disservice to the [unintelligible] had you used the  nonborrowed target    No, I don’t think that’s fair    No, I’m simply talking about the fact that nonborrowed reserves ran high  relative to the observed money numbers  Now that has nothing to do with the dynamics of the  situation  That has to do with the specifications of the relationship    But the lag goes the other way, because there are [unintelligible] two  weeks left    But that would simply be luck if that happened  There is nothing in the  observation of that relationship that would lead to that conclusion  It would just be luck    I see    Mr Chairman, I’m prepared to accept your recommendation for the  specification of the long-range rates of growth, but I think that I would like to make a couple of  observations about it to rather qualify my support  First, I think that the real GNP growth over  the next five quarters as projected by the staff is intolerably low  I don’t really believe that we  could in good conscience lower our growth rate targets for the monetary aggregates if we  thought that real GNP was going to increase only at a 5 percent annual rate--that would mean  very, very little progress in reducing unemployment over that five quarters, and it would be a rate  of growth that would be rather poor by historical comparison  Now, I think it’s going to be  higher than that  I guess I would expect something like Paul’s 6 percent rate of growth  I would  be surprised if it was as high as 7-1/2, Bruce, but it could maybe be that high    ’76 over ’75?    Well, even so, that’s a pretty    well, I guess that’s probably more like 7  on a quarterly basis    And I don’t know that it will be that high, but I want to make it clear that I  would support the slight lowering in the growth ranges in the expectation that economic growth  would be a good deal better than 5 percent     I don’t know any more what rate of monetary expansion is consistent with that rate of  economic growth  I don’t think we have really any basis [on which to proceed in specifying]  that, and so it seems to me possible that we’re specifying a rate of monetary growth that’s too     4/20/76 - 26 -           low for good continued economic recovery  But I think I would have to see signs that it was too  low, in other words, developing problems in the market  Today we don’t have those problems   We have very good savings inflows, credit is comfortably available, and interest rates are still, if  anything, inching downward, and therefore we certainly don’t have signs of monetary constraint  on the economy at this time  So that’s my first comment     My second comment is that I think that the Committee has to recognize that there’s a very  good possibility that it will overshoot the top end of its yearly ranges in the second quarter  That  is the very first quarter coming up  Now the staff midpoint projection for the second quarter  average is, I believe, about 7 percent on M1, and it’s also at the upper end of the range on M2   So there is a good possibility that in this second quarter, on average from the first quarter, we  will exceed the upper limits of the long-term growth ranges that we’re just now about to specify     I don’t see that as a great problem  We’ve had two quarters in which we’ve fallen  considerably short of the lower end of those ranges, and I think that we ought to be prepared to  support, or at least not move too strongly against, a tendency to overshoot in the coming quarter   I think that’s the way that one can justify changing the base [unintelligible] and yet regard the  thing with enough looseness that you’re prepared to see an undershoot or an overshoot  We may  well have an overshoot coming up  But I would not be prepared in the immediate future to move  strongly upward in interest rates in order to try to bring the aggregates in the short run down into  these growth ranges that we’re specifying  So those are the two reservations I wanted to convey   Thank you    You could have dissents and reasons for dissents  That’s the only thing I  can see    They’re in the Record of Policy Actions, you know    But we don’t report now, though, Bob, what our directive, what our specs  are    Yeah, well, there are lots of considerations  If you had to have immediate  release, that would mean releasing your [federal] funds rate range and the short-run specs  It’s  quite a changed ball game if we were to do that  I don’t think we were considering doing that  when we made this decision back in ’73, or whenever it was    When would they set the terms, Steve?    Yeah, that’s the point I want to make    Except the coupon    Well, Mr Chairman, I would be very hesitant about having a discreet  tightening move at this point  [I’m] trying to think of this in terms of (A) the condition of the  economy, (B) the record of monetary policy as it would be perceived by the public over the last  couple of quarters, and (C) the state of the markets, which I think would be very sensitive to an  increase   Now, as far as the state of the economy is concerned, we’ve had a pretty good quarter, if  the Commerce Department figures are right  We had a rather poor quarter, if the staff estimates  are right for the first quarter--    --5-1/2 percent, which I think a lot of people would regard as a poor  quarter at this stage in the recovery, with a 7-1/2 percent unemployment rate  But you know,  there’s a lot of room to go, and we’re just now beginning to get some life in housing, we’re just  now beginning to see the first indications of some possible increase in plant and equipment     4/20/76 - 39 -           expenditures, new orders for durable goods  And I think that a lot of people would  [unintelligible] that a discrete move toward tightening would be pretty premature on the part of  the Federal Reserve     They might think so, especially when they looked at the average rates of growth in the  money numbers over the recent past and saw what is shown here on appendix table 3--that M1  on a quarterly basis increased 2-1/2 percent in the fourth quarter [of 1975] and 29 percent in the  first quarter of 1976; and M2 increased 61 percent in the fourth quarter and 95 percent in the  first quarter of 1976  They might, I think with some justification, feel that this was a rather quick  move [to tighten], given these substantially lower numbers than presumably the Committee was  shooting at [unintelligible]   The third point that I wanted to emphasize was the state of the market  I think that an  increase of size in the [federal] funds rate right now would be truly--the market was burned on  this a month or so ago when they thought there was a sign of change in the direction, which they  regarded as a possible cyclical turn  They would this time, I think, figure this is for real, after  there had been some kind of a false signal before; but now [they would figure] there was really a  change, and they would now regard this as working into a period of rising interest rates  That  could give you quite a market reaction, I think, enough of a market reaction that you would soon  jeopardize the growth rates in M2 and M3     As Steve pointed out, I believe, we’ve got a lot of savings deposits out there that are going  to move, and they’re going to move when market rates move appreciably above 5 percent, or  5-1/4 at the highest, which is the savings and loan passbook rate  So I wouldn’t resist a little,  perhaps, tightening in the funds rate, but I think 5-1/4, which is half a point above where we are  now, is quite [a bit of] tightening, and 5-1/2, which you suggested as a possible specification for  the funds rate, is a lot of tightening, and so I just could not buy those suggestions     Now, I also think that we would be best served to leave the expected short-term growth  rates in the monetary aggregates centered on where they are in alternative B  Because there’s a  large increase in M1 for the month of April--it is not fully determined, but it’s pretty well in  place  And so you would have to bank on the appreciable moderation in the growth rate in M1 in  May in order to come down within a restricted target range  So my own preference is for  alternative B--I would take the specs both for the funds rate and for the aggregates as written in  alternative B    You mentioned 5-1/2    Mr Chairman, if you meant a 4-1/2 to 5-1/4 range for the funds rate, I find  that acceptable, but I would rather associate it with the growth ranges [of the monetary  aggregates] shown in alternative B    Did you call that alternative B,  Bruce?    But the funds rate B, ah, no--    All right    That is, the [one-]eighth    Mr Chairman?  That’s quite acceptable to me  My problem is that I think  that the 8 percent growth rate for M1 in April is pretty hard information    Because--    Well, all right, let me just say that my hunch is that April is going to be  8 percent, may be a little above 8 percent, and if so, taking a range [for M1] that has the 4-1/2 to  8-1/2 percent range rather biases us toward moving [the federal funds rate] all the way to 5-1/4    Well, I mean, that’s a different ball game if that’s what you want to do     4/20/76 - 47 -            5-1/4    --with a 5 to 9 range on M1  I believe that making a 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 [range  for M1] biases us toward the likelihood that we’re going to feel compelled to go to 5-1/4    The Court of Appeals is in DC, Tom?    I was going to say, I think we should ask Art, but there are differences  between a tape and a Memorandum of Discussion, fairly significant [ones]  I mean, I don’t  know that if you were to do the Memorandum of Discussion just as it is done now, and if you  were to compare it with the tape, there would be enough differences that it would raise questions  in peoples’ minds  Isn’t that right?    That’s what bothers me, Mr Chairman  I do think that sooner or later  we’re going to get in trouble with--because there will be a court that will define segregable facts  in a very broad way, because there will be petitioners that will go to very current minutes, that is,  of meetings within the last month or two, or three, or four  And sooner or later we’re going to  lose this, and in the meantime, as you say, there will be a great deal of effort put in to sanitizing  in response to each court suit the Memorandum from earlier times  So I can certainly see your  point of view  So it seems like a situation where the risks are very great relative to the benefits  that are gained    Well, I’m not so sure about that  I think a lot of people are going to say,  look you’ve just done away with the [Memorandum of Discussion], and therefore how could you  be more secretive than that    Is that so?    Does it appear in the Memorandum of Discussion?    A lot less than 30 days--    That’s got to be a lot less than 30 days  "
62,1976-05-18,"  Have such a sentence    I have a question, too  What would be the treatment of interim votes of  the Committee, or of interim telephone meetings of the Committee?  Would they be included in  that release?      Suppose the subject at the Friday telephone conference call had been the  bankruptcy of New York--then the discussion on that would be reported very promptly    --reflected in the policy record    Well, ordinarily there would be some action, that is, in the hypothetical  case    It would be a decision to constrain the [federal] funds limit, or something  like that  And I take it, then, the entry would be that the Committee had a telephone conference  or call to discuss the emerging problems of financial markets, particularly with regard to New  York, and had decided for the time being to constrain the funds rate  That is, without any  discussion of the ins and outs of the thing  It would be a simple reference to the thing  Well, I  don’t see that that does much damage, because of the public--something the public would know,  I guess, and it would even come out in three, or four, or five days, or after the [unintelligible]      You are not substituting anything, you’re just deleting it    This would be the first renewal?     You’d have much more effect on March and less in April last year, in  1975 compared to 1976     March or April 1973    March or April 1973    On the materials?    Whole index?    I might just note that the only source of indicated pressure that was  available in Washington in late 1972 came from the Redbooks     The Redbooks    There was no other government source or no other government agency  that had that information, so I think what we are talking about is very good, Frank  It’s a sort of  an attempt to develop a little further in the Banks a system for spotting this as it goes along  And  I would myself put much more confidence on it than I did at the end of 1972, when it seemed all  by itself out there as an interesting observation            Did you say in mid-’77 or ’76?    To supplement that, I think that there is typically a lag in business  reactions to an improving situation  That is, in the case of economists, there is a dramatic  improvement in attitudes in January and February, and as the sales figures came in, and the better  order [figures] came in, that spread to the business [unintelligible]  So I don’t think there’s  anything unusual about this coming in by the dozen      But I would point out to you, Frank, as Lyle said, he’s got a rising [rate] of  capital spending in real terms  And a 15 percent annual rate by the middle of 1977 in [real]  terms, which is a pretty good recovery  If that had been months ago, I don’t think the Committee  would have accepted [it]  The inventory accumulation is what, 20, 20 plus [unintelligible]    And that could also be related to stimulation, not astounding in either case,  but it certainly does depend on relatively strong business attitudes to get [that]    This is banks or--    Well, I was just going to comment that, earlier we were talking about  1973, and it is true that the world boom will have a considerable effect on the rate of inflation   But I think we also ought to remember that there had been two prior devaluations of the dollar,   so that the effect was to shift demand [to] the US markets, particularly for finished materials  used in [unintelligible] manufacture, like chemicals and steel and things of that kind, where the  product is exactly the same regardless of the country it came from  Now we are not thinking in  terms of further substantial devaluations of the dollar [unintelligible],  but that is one difference  now compared to [unintelligible]    Peter, in talking about the period, some of the language you used reminded  me of the language we used to use about “even-keel” during the Treasury financing  Would you  regard yourself as being subject to even-keel considerations during this unusually heavy period  of long-term financing?    Semi-even-keel?    I don’t have a figure in mind precisely, but given the projected size of the  federal deficit, I would assume that there is going to be a continuing, very large volume of  financing on a very frequent calendar    I just suggest to you that I think we need to be careful that we not  constrain ourselves too much by consideration of those Treasury financings, or we may find  ourselves quite unable to react to developments in the credit markets  I hesitate, having been on  the receiving end of these, to ask for a review of what our policy ought to be with regard to  Treasury financing and even-keel, but I really think maybe there ought to be a new look at it,  given the changes in practice and the frequency of financing      In practice, but I mean--    The point is, gentlemen, I think we have paid more attention over the last  several weeks     I did not sit in on the calls any day of this last period  My own feeling,  looking back over the period, and given the strength of the monetary aggregates, is that we  moved a little more slowly than I would have liked to have seen toward the 5-1/4 top on our  range    Well, Mr Chairman, I just have a couple of comments  I do believe that  the business situation is strong, perhaps stronger than the staff projections for the immediate  future, in any event  And with the kind of an increase we’ve had in employment in the last  month, and the recent performance of the production index, and the possibility that something is  going on in the business investment area and the inventory area, why, I have to agree with what I  think is the general view of the Committee that it’s too dangerous to just let strong monetary  growth run unrestrained even though, in fact, it may well turn out to be an aberration     We don’t know, but the fact is that it’s a dangerous thing to not recognize it, given what  we see in the economy generally speaking  So I guess that puts me in the camp of saying that  probably we have to move against this and we have to tighten a little further  Actually, I think  we’ve already made the really significant tightening move  That is, in the past month, that  switch into a rising funds rate is having a marked effect on market interest rates, as we thought it  would, given the sensitivity of the market  So this is just a question of how much continuation  we are prepared to see here in the period to come     Well, I think that what we take in the way of a constraint on the funds [rate] and what we  take in the way of a range in the aggregates is very much interrelated  That is, you can have your  choice  As Bob Mayo pointed out this morning, you can have a constrained funds rate but also  constrain your aggregates, and then, chances are, you are going to move right up to the top of  whatever funds rate range you’ve specified  Or you can have a somewhat broader monetary  aggregate range around the most probable point estimate and have a little larger funds rate range  and maybe not use the top of it     I have some inclination for going in the second direction rather than the first because I  think I agree with what Willis just said, that given the April profile as it leads into May, it looks  like we are going to have a fairly substantial May, and I wouldn’t like to see us immediately  giving the Manager a signal that indicates he ought to be at the top of the range     Well, I think my preferences for the specifications were exactly the ones that Phillip  Jackson gave, that is, an M1 growth range for the two months of 4-1/2 to 8-1/2--it would be a  surprise if we got 8-1/2, but the staff estimate is 7-1/4, and so it’s not that much above it  Look  how much we’ve been surprised in the past month as we ran from 8 to 15 or something like     5/18/76 - 47 -         that--5 to 15  And for M2, I think 6 to 10 is certainly better, even if we take your specifications,  Mr Chairman; 6 to 10 is better than 5 to 9  I don’t see that there would be that much impact yet  on M2, although I certainly agree there’s a sensitivity to interest rates in that, and that at some  point we’ll start to see these deposits run out     And the funds rate, I think 5 to 6 is perfectly good as a range, recognizing that we wouldn’t  get to 6 unless we had a high monetary aggregates [reading], that is, 8-1/2 for the two-month M1  and something like 10 for M2     And no one else has commented on this and so I would throw in also that I believe we  ought to continue to give something like a 50-50 weight to our reading of M1 and M2 as we have  done in the recent months, certainly because of the performance of M2, [but also because it is] a  proxy for M3, and M3 is very important to us in this period  That’s all, Mr Chairman    I would associate myself with that I mean, I can either buy that with the  low funds rate or higher [unintelligible] with the higher funds rate    Let’s try it the other way    And slightly higher funds rate    I think you forgot one    Over the month?    Yeah    The center is 5-3/8  "
87,1976-06-22,"  The first drawing, you are saying they will beat the mark?     6/22/76 - 14 -            And then there will be--    That is our 200 of the total 550    In any event, this particular drawing would--    It’s true of Washington  There have been reports in the press    Well, let me say that, looking at this last chart that Mr Gramley has  distributed, I think it certainly fortifies my view that this is a temporary kind of a move in retail  sales  I was fully expecting them to come back, too  Indeed, I would point out that the last  couple of months of observations in this retail sales line are based on preliminary data  And if  there was something of the kind that Ernie was mentioning going on, that is, a tendency not to  spend in conventional ways at the department stores and so forth, but rather to spend in the  course of vacations, that’s a very hard thing for retail data to pick up--the restaurant sales in     6/22/76 - 19 -           small towns and the motel rentals and that kind of thing  And so it could well be that what we’re  looking at here is going to largely disappear in the course of revisions  But I think that  [unintelligible] personal income and unemployment certainly suggest that retail sales ought to be  strengthening in the course of the summer as we go along    I don’t recall that you said anything about housing, Lyle, but would you  read the recent data as being rather disappointing?    Well, I think that’s quite right  The staff is caught by the assumption of  policies that they must take  But, as in the first quarter, when we forgave an undershoot, we  might well forgive an overshoot in the second quarter, in which case there would be some relief  in that first-half growth in 1977, which would modify attitudes toward great--    I would agree with your thrust, too, and I would prefer the 5-1/4 to 5-3/4  funds rate range because it seems to me that, within the range of monetary aggregates that we  have, we shouldn’t be terribly upset by something that leans toward the high end or the low end   I think I would stay with the monetary aggregate directive but look for greater stability     The only point that I might just have a little bit of disagreement about is, I would like to be  a little more provisional about the economic outlook  I think it is good  I think that we will  move ahead all right as we go into the summer and early fall  But at the moment, I am a little  troubled about housing and consumer spending  And I think that is a good reason for pausing a  bit in what may very well turn out to be a longer-term record of somewhat firmer rates and  somewhat firmer money market conditions    Yes    Yes    We know the [unintelligible] is 5-3/4 as the top in this past intermeeting  period  Is that the point you were making, Larry, that if you put in a higher figure than the 5-3/4,  it would look as if there was some movement that we could make?    I just wanted to point out a small arithmetic fact, and that is that saying  equal emphasis on M1 and M2 approximately means that in fact you place about 3/4 emphasis  on M1 because M1 is contained in M2, which is plenty for me    I do also think, Mr Chairman, that we ought to ask the staff to insert a  reference to the CPI  "
112,1976-07-19,"  I can’t resist then, Mr Chairman--of course the document can’t have more  in it than the discussion had  Something has to be said at the meeting to give the staff the basis  for saying something on the analytic end    Monroe, were these heavy construction--    You’re talking in every case about heavy construction?    I see    Well, Mr Chairman, I have three comments  On the pattern of current  GNP numbers, I’ve noticed that there tends to be a sort of zigzag  We’ve had that before in the  economy, with one quarter stronger, then one quarter relatively weaker  Notably in the 1966,  1967, 1968 period  I think one might want to look at the second quarter’s performance in light of  averaging on the first quarter, and if you do that, you get pretty close to a 7 percent growth rate  for the half year  That is, 9-1/4 and 4-1/2 roughly would be close to a 7 percent average rate of  increase, which was quite a satisfactory rate of real GNP growth       7/19-20/76 - 32 -   I understand that that’s dangerous because the first quarter had a lot of inventory turnabout,  and you can’t reasonably predict that there would be that kind of contribution again in the second  half of the year  But nevertheless, I think some averaging is called for, and we ought to look at  the figures for the half in that light     The second comment is that I agree with Mr Roos that the outlook looks extraordinarily  good, extraordinarily stable  There is a lack of speculation, and yet I think that there is sort of a  growing buildup of plans and expenditures in a variety of fields without the hazards of  overspeculation that results in a cutback later on  And I would remind the Committee of Mr  Reynolds’s presentation, which indicates that that’s not true just of the United States, that’s true  of the world  We’re getting moderate recovery in the world, whereas we don’t have any signs of  speculation in capital or in inventory     Yesterday, I happened to meet with a fellow from Japan, and he commented that his people  had been very badly burned in 1973-1974 with their inventory speculations  And they are not  going to repeat it  They’ve learned a lesson, and they’re going to be very careful as far as  making long future commitments for inventory of the kind that they have made before  Well, I  think that is the general attitude everywhere  And I think that’s a point of strength, which I think  is what Larry Roos, was saying, rather than weakness, in the whole outlook     Now the third comment is, having said all of that, I still agree with Governor Wallich that  the 5 percent average rate of increase in real GNP is rather disappointing over the next six  quarters, and I say that even though Lyle is quite right that 5 percent isn’t bad historically  The  reason I say it is [disappointing] is that, with 7-1/2 percent unemployment and production in the  materials producing industries at 80 percent of capacity, we’ve got room for a lot more  expansion than a 5 percent average rate over the six quarters     But I would also point out to the Committee that when you look at this projection, there are  a couple of areas that seem to me a little on the weak side  One is residential construction  I  can’t really believe that housing starts are going to increase only 60 thousand more at an annual  rate from the current level and then peak  And that is what the projection literally calls for  Now  I understand that that is due in part to the expectation that interest rates may rise  But the  increases in interest rates here aren’t really large, and the standard projection and availability of  mortgage finance is very good right now And [unintelligible] on that interest rate projection, if  it’s a little high it would mean that you would have better inflows  And I’m inclined to think that  residential construction could come up appreciably--not a boom, but appreciably higher than  the 15 million to 1550 million that is in the projection     The other thing that I would note is that government purchases of goods and services are in  every quarter of the projection below the average rate of increase in nominal GNP  Now it may  well be that government purchases for the next six quarters will continue to be quite weak  relative to the performance of the total economy  But I think that all members of the Committee  must recognize that there is at least a possibility that there will be greater strength in government  purchases than is in this material, which I assume essentially projects the official budget  numbers, looking ahead     7/19-20/76 - 33 -    Well, if you look at federal purchases, the second quarter is 34, the third  quarter is 65, and the fourth quarter is 12    And then it drops back again, a very moderate increase     I simply want to point out to the Committee that that is part of the  projection  And, therefore, I guess I think that there is a good chance that the growth rate will be  more than 5 percent on average--looking over the six quarters--more or less regardless of any  small difference in monetary policy with [unintelligible]    What did you say, Jerry, that it’s 15 down to 3 percent?    Under 3 percent?    What do you mean by manufactured homes?    --another half a house    An artificial basement    Is that prospective rents, or do they have it in hand before they start?    I [unintelligible] on that velocity    Your rising velocity continues right through ’77    If M2 were a little less [unintelligible], it would account for a bit less of  the proxy    I recommend that we do it, Mr Chairman    Yeah, it’s not exactly a 13-week period    We introduced it for this very reason several years ago  The same  discussion occurred virtually--    Well, I was just going to make one small comment on that, and that is,  isn’t the question of what we have done in the last four weeks a question of what this looks like  compared to what we thought it would look like four weeks ago?  And I think you’ll find it’s  lower; that is, the June-July average is significantly lower than we anticipated at the time of the  last meeting  Now your line here for the recovery, if you believe it, is a consideration for  [judging] current policy this time  But not for judging current policy over the last four weeks, I  don’t think    Well, I just wanted to say I have two things  I accept the change in the  base  I think we do this with judgment and it’s not that we don’t know what’s gone before, it’s  simply that we don’t have an arithmetic practice that averages out  I average the first and second  quarters, and M1 growth was 5-1/2 percent exactly--a little below the midpoint  I averaged the  period for the whole recovery, of the first quarter of ’75 to date, and I got 57     I must say, Paul, I disagree with you  I can’t understand saying now that we are going to  lower the range because of the second-quarter overshoot when we didn’t do any similar thing  when we had a large first-quarter undershoot  I might also say that the character of the second  quarter was not the kind of thing that leads you to make an adjustment like that  If we would  have had continuous strength throughout the second quarter, it would be one thing, but as it is,  we had one month of large increase in April, and then May was moderate, and June was low   And to come out now and say, well, that adds up to an overshoot and we’re going to correct for  it, I don’t think I could understand that     And I also can’t understand it in an environment where we have 7-1/2 percent  unemployment, where we just had a GNP number released by Commerce--right or wrong--that  was very much lower than it was before; and where you are utilizing only 80 percent of materials  capacity, according to our new revised index of materials  It would be a very difficult thing for  me to justify, so I feel very strongly against reducing the range that you specified  Now--     7/19-20/76 - 54 -    Yes, in the economic situation I would  But we don’t have fortunately--    Now, in M2 and M3, Mr Chairman, I’m a little uncomfortable with  reducing the upper limit on those because, if not worded just right, it might be taken as an  indication that we do not wish to see a further substantial recovery in housing--M3 particularly is  associated in the public mind with housing  And the fact of the matter is that, with a 9 to  11 percent range in M3, there is plenty of money to finance anything that even I see in housing,  much less the staff--     That’s what has to be negotiated now  I am inclined to believe that  Kichline’s right, that we have high ranges here  And literally speaking, what we ought to do is to  reduce the lower limit of the range because chances are, if interest rates do move up, we are  going to fall below the lower limits of these ranges  I’m not quite prepared to do that partly  because that I’m not sure interest rates are going to move up very much this fall  But a little  move I think is probably justified  So, in short, I accept the overshoot, and I accept your  specifications on long-range growth rates    I do, too    I don’t understand why; however, I’m repeating history by saying that   The same thing came up last time    Well, I must say, Mr Chairman, I don’t find the arguments very  persuasive  We don’t have a court decision  I think if we had court decision it would apply to  every specification we had  the funds rate, the short-range target for the Ms as well as the long- range  And if we had to as a matter of fact, I’m inclined to think that there would be less public  damage from reporting, say, our funds rate specifications for the very next period     And so I just don’t find anything [about] the long-range expectations that is so much more  sensitive than the short-range that we should have this special system, and I do believe that there  should be an opportunity for a Committee member to dissent from long-range specifications  because he doesn’t think it is [what] the economy needs, and therefore I think we should  introduce a vote on this    Well, Mr Chairman, I think there’s a good possibility that July is going to  be a strong month for the monetary aggregates  We started the month, as the newspapers  reported, with a very strong week, and it seems to me quite conceivable that what we have was a  surprising June sluggishness in the money supply that was associated with the change in the  fiscal year, and that July will begin to bring back that strength  Therefore, I think that the  Committee ought to be alert to the possibility that as it drops these ranges on M1, it thereby  increases the probability of moving up in whatever federal funds rate range is specified  I guess I  could [accept] the 4 to 8 M1, but I don’t think I’d like to drop it as far as President Mayo, down  to 7-1/2  We could have a somewhat lower M2 range, though I don’t know that that’s so  significant  As far as the funds rate is concerned, I don’t see any reason to prejudge, to have a  nonsymmetrical--    Well, then, let me respecify  I don’t see why we should allow for more  room on the upside of where we are now in the funds rate than we do on the downside of where  we are now because I can’t say, given the economic information and the reasons for the behavior  of the aggregates, that there’s more prospect of moving in one direction than another in the short  run  Therefore, I would prefer the 4-3/4 to 5-3/4, perhaps with an understanding that we’re not  going to use the far ends of range    Well, then, I would be prepared to pick 5 to 5-1/2, but I find it a little odd,  since just this morning we were talking about the need to have more variation in the federal  funds rate    Well, I think it was pretty generally, a lot of people want to subscribe to  it--    So even if they were right up at the extreme, you would expect by the end  of the period to have a funds rate right up at the extreme?    It was never out of the range, though, as M1 was    I don’t quite understand the logic, Paul, of waiting until both [M1 and M2]  are out [of their specified ranges]  It seems to imply a knowledge as to the effect of the behavior  of these aggregates on the economy that I, at least, don’t have     7/19-20/76 - 66 -    I know, but you know--    I take it you’re saying that not only M1, but M1 and M2 must be beyond  the bounds; or not only M2, but also M1 must be beyond the bounds    But then it’s hard to explain why it is we changed it  You have the same  funds rate range last time--that is, the same half point and we called that a monetary aggregate  directive and now with the same range we call it a money market directive    I didn’t understand Steve’s point  We’ve been at 4-3/4, we’ve been at  5-3/4, why do you want to skew the funds range?    You said 5 to 5-3/4  I myself much prefer 4-3/4 to 5-3/4, giving a range of  1 point    I think you have a little idea  We know that they started out being strong   There would be some presumption that it’s going to be strong   "
137,1976-08-17,"  Did I understand you to say, Alan, that you think that the dollar will stick  with the mark and therefore that the other currencies will depreciate against the dollar?     8/17/76 - 2 -      And against the dollar  So that our terms of trade will deteriorate to some  extent against those countries      It’s about the same rate as before, Ernie?    Joke    Mr Chairman, I think that Willis Winn has done us a great service today  by pointing out the pessimistic views  And I think I agree with him that that’s not the most  probable course, though I think that the odds of a disappointment have increased in the last  couple of months’ figures  There is no question in my mind that a pause of some considerable  dimension has occurred recently, largely in the retail area, although I’ve been bothered for some  months by the lack of more strength in housing     But it’s largely retail, and I note from the Greenbook--it’s only one month--but we have a  substantial decline in the rate of increase of personal income in June  That may be reversed in  July or August but, of course, the whole danger in a pause of any size is that you will retard  income streams  And thus what looked like the prospect for a rebound in retail sales and  consumer spending is impaired because the income won’t be there to support it     And it’s true that the labor force figures and the unemployment figures are highly volatile  month by month--and we’re having particular difficulty with them this year, I think, because of  the seasonal adjustment problem--but from May to July there’s been a considerable increase in  the unemployment rate for the adult man, household heads, married men--that is, for the stable  components of the employment force  And we also see a considerable increase in insured  unemployment over the last three months or so     So something is a little bit amiss in the way things have been going in the last two or three  months  I agree with Lyle that we should have an increase in capital spending, and the new order  figures do look better  The Redbook doesn’t seem to pick that up very well  It hasn’t for a long  time  The big Districts where machine tools are important, like Cleveland and Boston and  Chicago, haven’t mentioned real strength in that--    You mean new orders--    I don’t think we know what that would be    Well, I think the order figures do look pretty good, and furthermore, I’ve  always felt that if the profits were there, capital spending would follow  And the profits do seem  to have come back quite a way  One could say on Willis’s point that businessmen are much  more conservative than they were during the previous cyclical recovery  Their attitude both  toward inventory accumulation and toward extending themselves in any way on capital spending  is going to be conservative, particularly in an election year and all that that brings up  And  therefore it could be that we won’t see returns to normal rates of inventory accumulation of the  desired strength  It could be that we see continued slowness in the recovery in capital goods     And if that did occur, along with a less rapid increase in personal income and a  sluggishness in retail sales, why, we could have a pause that will even turn into a small decline   Probably not a decline of cyclical portions, but one more like, say, in the spring and summer of  1962, a year or so after the beginning of the recovery  [Or] one that started perhaps to show  itself in mid-1959, although the steel strike complicates that comparison  There have been times  during the course of a recovery when there was a pause that became rather elongated, rather  extended  We could be seeing the start of that now     I guess what it comes down to as far as I’m concerned is that I would still have to put my  bets about with the kind of patterns that the staff projection shows  But that is a rather  significant [change for] me because, all year, I’ve expected the recovery to be stronger than the  staff projections  And now I would have to say that my own expectations have deteriorated to  the point where I would say that maybe that’s about the most probable number, and there is a  significant minority possibility of a softness that Willis has described  I think there has been a  change in the character of the situation that we ought to recognize    Social Security is an important point that I entirely forgot  The other, I  don’t know, it’s variable from month to month  The increase in industrial production has  continued to moderate; that is, July was less than June  And you mentioned the August  doldrums, Bob  We don’t have any August measures yet  Maybe we’re really going to have  August doldrums  But with Social Security we should get a big kick to this July  That’s a cost  of living increase?    Mr Chairman, a question I ask myself is whether we ought to do anything  on our own initiative to help the trend in business activity, and if so what it ought to be  And I  guess I conclude that I don’t quite see what we could do that would be very helpful and would  not seem a very activist policy from the standpoint of the market  The flows are good, the  aggregates are growing well--not spectacularly, but well  If business truly does have a  conservative attitude toward what it wishes to undertake, then the prescription I would say is just  to lower interest rates in order to induce business to overcome this reluctance to invest     But I’m not quite convinced that they’re that conservative; I’m not quite at the point where  I would be prepared to push actively toward lower interest rates  In another month or two, if the  pause continues, I might have a different view  So I guess my leaning is toward ease in terms of  money market conditions  But I don’t feel strongly enough about it to want to vote for  alternative A or to have a meaningfully lower funds rate, so I guess I would accept your  specifications    Well, I was just going to say that with eight indicated in favor of the  money market directive, it would be quite appropriate, I think, to cut the range in the funds rate   And then if you’re outside the range on the aggregates, you have a wire communication, but I  would myself give them a money market directive [unintelligible]  I’d prefer 5 to 5-1/2 as the  funds rate range    Because of the money market directive, you see  "
181,1976-10-19,"  What kind of increase do they show for business fixed investment?    About a 7 percent rate of increase    Do you take votes among the staff?    Well, Mr Chairman, I’ve been gone for a little while, and I was disturbed  about the economy, the outlook, before I left but hopeful that there would be improving signs   But now I find myself looking at what seems to be a softer economy than [in] the period before   Incidentally, as I read [them], the staff projections are materially lower  A few months ago we  were adjusting to a second-quarter GNP increase that was a good deal less than had been  anticipated  But we were saying that the third quarter would show good strength  Now we’re  adjusting to a third-quarter GNP that is lower than had been anticipated, and we’re not expecting  increased compensating strength further on out, so therefore the level of real GNP must be lower  throughout the projection than it was six months ago  Is that right, Lyle?    Well, I wanted to make that clear because I think we have to be concerned  not only about the rates of increase in real GNP but also about the levels of resource  utilization--in particular, labor force utilization--that the projection implies  And it implies a  little less utilization than it did back awhile  And that’s somewhat associated with Frank’s  comment about, well, it’s getting to the point where the projection isn’t really one that we can  accept as a target       10/19/76 - 20 -   Well, as I look at what’s happened, I guess I have three main points that do disturb me  compared to a couple of months ago  The first is that there is now pretty strong evidence of a  slowing in personal income growth  Before, we had a low June, but then it was pointed out that  July would be strong, which it was because of Social Security and then some other increases   Now we have August and September, which are also [showing] low rates of growth, so that in  three of the last four months, the rates of growth for personal income have been distinctly low   To me that means that what’s happened is that the weakness in the economy is feeding back into  jobs and income  And when that begins to happen there’s a possibility that the poor performance  of income will feed back into the economy, and there is more chance of a slowdown than would  be true if you just had a very temporary kind of a pause of the kind we have had in previous  recoveries     The second thing I think bothers me quite a bit is the marked decline in the stock market   That doesn’t mean anything, really, by itself  It’s, I guess, 6 or 7 or 8 percent depending on what  index you look at  It isn’t an awful lot, but it is, I think, perhaps as good an indicator of mood as  Mr Sindlinger’s  And the mood that [the stock market decline] tends to convey is not a good  one  Now with a rather protracted period of sluggishness in consumer markets on the one hand  and a decline of some size in the stock market on the other hand, not massive, but some size, it  seems to me that you have to raise questions about how strongly businessmen will pursue  expansion on capital goods spending  We’ve been depending on a capital goods boom, and I  wouldn’t want to say that there’s not going to be an increase, but it seems to me that those two  developments make the odds less for a large rise in business capital  And so those two feed into  that point     The third thing that I’m terribly shocked by, I must say, because I really did lose sight of  this while I was away, is the extremity of foreign responses to something--to weakness in their  exchange rate, or defense of their system, or something  But as I look at the situation in many  European countries I can’t believe that it’s possible there is not going to be a marked  deterioration in real economic performance there compared with what we were expecting a few  months ago  I thought there would be a very good recovery in Europe  But now with the bank  rate 15 percent in the UK, with Italy taking very restrictive actions, with France restrictive, with  the Low Countries restrictive, I don’t believe there’s going to be a very good recovery, a  continuing recovery, abroad  And that will have an effect on our foreign trade  There will be a  deterioration there     So when I put it all together, I guess I have to conclude that I share a little bit in Governor  Lilly’s experiment, and I think the odds are that there will be a rather poor period of growth in  the economy  Perhaps for three or four quarters  Whether or not there will be a recession, I  don’t know  I think the odds are against it because we don’t have the imbalances that we had  before  And so chances are that we’ll have a modest continuing rate of real growth, I think, at  least for several quarters  But it looks to me as though it’s going to be below the rate of real  growth we need in order to apply [more of] our resources  And so I think the Committee has to  take that into account      Now there is one other major uncertainty today that ought to be pointed out, and that is that  we have more than the usual degree of uncertainty about government policy  And therefore we  can’t say whether there might be developments in government policy in the months ahead that     10/19/76 - 21 -   would modify in one direction or another the kind of projections we’re now making, and I think  we ought to keep that in mind  Thank you      Their [unintelligible] situation is pretty tight      Well, Mr Chairman, I was not commenting on the appropriateness of the  policies of the individual countries  I’m really not in a position to judge them      What I did mean to imply is that there are rather sharp changes in a good  many countries--not just with the UK [but] in a good many of those countries, and that I think  that we have to consider the possibility that this will affect our exports plan, directly and  indirectly      But it could also mean, Mr Chairman, we have a sluggishness, an unusual  degree of sluggishness, that you have to work hard to overcome      Yes, that is a good way to put that, I agree with that totally      Do they have a big increase?      When you say downside risks, you mean risks of absolute decline?      I didn’t hear you quantify the substitution question of Ml for time-type  deposits  Is it pretty substantial, conceivably?      Having the initial move      You are supporting some of the increase for M1--do you mean by that an  adjusted Ml--     6-1/2 instead of 4-1/2?       10/19/76 - 32 -    If there were changes in financial technology also earlier, I would have the  adjustments--     State and local savings deposits have ballooned in recent months--didn’t I  read that in the Greenbook or someplace?      I think it mainly would have come out of open market instruments      In addition, we get some indication from these surveys that they were  limiting it on compensating balances, so that even under [unintelligible] you might have some  insufficient incomes on the balance      May I answer that?      That helps to the degree of substitution--then we get the offsets of  substitution       10/19/76 - 35 -    [Unintelligible]     Four to five, Mr Chairman, I think that’s a question of 4-3/4  What would  be your starting point?      I guess my thought was, and I think maybe Frank thought, too, that really  the funds rate ought to 4-3/4 now and--      It ought to be 4-3/4  We haven’t used the full range available to us as  specified by the Committee at the last meeting  I wasn’t there  The aggregates would  [unintelligible] being pretty large, pretty well down toward that      I guess you’re right  M2 crept up on me, without my realizing it  You  were below, even on exactly equal weighing  It’s below the midpoint--      --below the lower point on Ml, and have been throughout Perhaps I  shouldn’t have, but I was trying to join Frank in [unintelligible]  I’m inclined to think that I  would prefer to see markets easing, and prefer to see them easing a little more than specified  [unintelligible]     Well, I find myself at variance with you this time, Mr Chairman  I  certainly can accept the specifications you suggested for the aggregates--5 to 9 and 9 to 13  I  wouldn’t cut M2, I don’t think  I think M2 is very hard to specify at a time when interest rates  are dropping, and there could be continued large reintermediation of funds from markets into the  banks, or [into] S&Ls in the case of M3  And so, although the 13 [for M2] would be a high  figure if we had it over a sustained period, I don’t see any problem with it as a shorter-term  matter  And on Ml, 5 to 9 seems to me quite appropriate, following a month in which we had  [unintelligible], which we ought to give some weight to even though it’s not in the average of the  two months that we’re looking at       10/19/76 - 40 -   Now, I think that there is enough weakness in the economic situation that I  would--assuming that the aggregates don’t give us surprises within the next couple of weeks,  coming in very low or very high--I would like to see us move down somewhat more in the  money market  And I think the way to do that would be to specify a range [for the federal funds  rate] of 4-1/4 to 5-1/4, with a midpoint 4-3/4  So that, unless we get some strengthening in the  aggregates from the current expectations--I didn’t know that the New York Fed already had it,  and perhaps they’ll be shown to be correct there--but unless we get that, it would imply a further  gradual moving down in the objectives of the Desk, from the roughly 5 or slightly below what it  has been quite recently, to about 4-3/4 over the course of week or 10 days, assuming that the  aggregates don’t come in strongly  So I feel that I would prefer that 4-1/4 to 5-1/4 specification      So you’re skewing the opposite way of last time      What did you say about midpoint?  I didn’t hear it      That, of course, would mean that the aggregates would be at the minimum      Mr Chairman, I think that my preference as of today, if we were to  announce this as you specified, in a matter of a few days, would be to hold just exactly the same  Ml range we now have, 4-1/2 to 7  And I do believe that gives us room, which we may well  need, to have a period of more rapid expansion in M1       10/19/76 - 46 -   My concern is with M2 and M3, because, you recall, we cut the upper end of those ranges  the last time on the technical grounds that it wasn’t reasonable, that the relationship didn’t seem  to be reasonable  Now I think in an atmosphere where interest rates may be lower than we  previously have thought, we may run into difficulty with these on the top end  And so I think I  would be inclined--I wouldn’t like to make much of a change there, but I think I would be  inclined to go back on the M2 and M3 to the ranges that we had specified prior to last time, that  is, to undo what had been done before and on the same grounds that it was explained before,  where we said, “Well, technically, we think that the relationship is not quite right”  But now we  can say, “Well, technically, in view of the way the markets have developed, we think that it was  right before, and so we will return to those previous levels”  Now, Steve, am I right in thinking  we have reduced--was it a 1/2 point on one of them and 1 point on the other?      And so what we would do [if we] go back, it will be 8 to 10 and 10 to 12?      7-1/2 to 10 and--     All right, I think that as of today that should be my thinking about it  On  the question of making further progress and ridding the economy of the monetary base for  inflation, I just think that this is a desirable longer-run objective, but I just don’t think that, with  the kinds of business news and employment news we’ve had, this is the time to make another  step      I say it for two reasons one is, I’m afraid that the targets, what we think  of--Ml and the range of M1--that the commentary would be that we’ve tightened another notch   And I don’t think that’s a good commentary to have about us  The second reason is at this stage  and in the economic situation--      My problem is, we would not be expressing the short-range targets that we  have adopted now because that still would be secret at the time you make the presentation      And therefore it will be the long-term [specification] that’ll be the news      It’s a little different though, because you’ll be testifying at a time when the  current specification is still the operating policy of the Committee      It might not be lower, Mr Chairman      And my substantive point still was that I think we may need to use much  of that Ml range [unintelligible] the period that is open to us, and therefore I don’t like to see us  reduce our headroom  And my final point is that we did have modest shortfalls in the last  quarter, and then to be reducing the target range on the new base following a little shortfall  would certainly bring comment, and I think it will seem [that it is] a little more tightening that  really is intended  That’s my feeling as of this--      Except in M2 and M3  That would be very strong    "
198,1976-11-08,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Gentlemen, can you hear me?   SPEAKER(?)  Yes    Well, I came into the meeting this morning thinking that it would be a  mistake to reduce the M1 target range even by a small amount given the performance of the  economy, which I consider to be quite weak  I think we ought to hear from Lyle  My  impression is that the fourth-quarter resurgence in GNP has not materialized in any way, and you  know that if the pause continues long enough, it’s no longer just a pause between expansions, but  it may affect the expansion     I think there’s considerable doubt about the business situation right now  I also was  opposed to reducing the target range for a technical reason  Willis Winn referred to one part of  it, that is, that we [had] a third-quarter shortfall of appreciable dimension  But the other part of it  is that, October, which [was] a very large month [for M1], adds to the fourth-quarter average, so  that in fact the chances are that we’re going to have a fourth-quarter average that is rather high in  relation to the M1 range that we’ve been talking about  Though it’s true that we’ve been talking  about it for a year [unintelligible]  And I think Steve Axilrod ought to speak to that point just  briefly     But my real concern, as I stated at the meeting a couple of weeks ago, is with M2, which I  think is way too low and is likely to prove the limiting force on monetary policy given the  different configuration of interest rates that we’re now living with and that may be in prospect  yet for some months to come  When we drew up this M2 range of 7-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent, late  last summer I guess it was, we were doing this on the basis of a staff expectation that interest  rates would be rising throughout the fall and winter period and that the rise in interest rates  would limit the natural growth in M2 because the market would be a stronger competitor than  before  That has certainly not been true thus far     Indeed, up to now we’re quite high, I believe, in the M2 figures; we have been running that  way for some months  There is no difference in October; in fact the October-November period is  even stronger, something like 13-1/2 percent as I recall--131 percent for M2, which is way  above the 7-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent range--and it is likely to remain so  And also there are a good     11/8/76 - 6 -           many economists that draw--rightly or wrongly--a parallel between M2 growth and nominal  GNP on a more or less one-for-one basis  Well, the midpoint of an M2 of 7-1/2 to 9-1/2 is 8-1/2  percent, and an 8-1/2 percent increase in nominal GNP is considerably short of what we need  assuming that we’re going to have something like 5 percent inflation     So to state my position in this rather difficult circumstance where all of us aren’t together,  my first preference would be to retain the current M1 target range of 4-1/2 to 7 and to raise M2  and M3 ranges back to where they were before, which is about a point increase  But I considered  the second part of my desire more important than the first, mainly because of the substitution that  is occurring, and that was pretty well demonstrated in that staff memo  Therefore, I would  accept a somewhat lower M1 range in return for a higher M2 and M3 range  Thank you    Well, my question to Mr Gramley was whether, indeed, the economic  evidence hadn’t been weak enough over the last month, or the last few weeks since the meeting,  to now raise considerable question about the presumed increase in GNP in the fourth quarter that  was in the Greenbook in the last meeting, and any other further comments he would like to make  on the pattern of economic developments     11/8/76 - 7 -            Well, I have two questions, I believe  The first is, isn’t it true that the M1  behavior in October, which wasn’t fully anticipated in the Bluebook at the time of the meeting,  now suggests a good deal stronger fourth-quarter rise on average than we’ve had before?  My  second question was, what about this M1-M2 relationship?  Was that based on interest rate  relationships that now seem unlikely to develop, at least in the period immediately ahead?    Here it comes    Well, I think we need to have a little bit more clarification of the relative  magnitudes, Steve, than you’ve given us  That is, if we look at the October-November  projection, it’s for 13 percent in M2, and I believe more than that in M3  So some moderation  would be required to get us down within anybody’s proposed longer-term range of growth for  those quantities, particularly in the case of M3, which I think has been running strong now for a  considerable number of months  So when you say a moderation, are you talking about a point or  two or are you talking about something that would put you down, let’s say, in the case of M2,  [from] 13 to 8 or 9?    Well, Mr Chairman, I appreciate the substitute, the increase in the range,  the slight increase in the range for M2 and M3, but I really don’t think it is going to be sufficient  to accommodate even what has been going on recently in the last several months  I would prefer  to have seen the alternative B specs that Governor Lilly mentioned, which would mean another  1/2 percent on the upper end of both M2 and M3  And so, I think what’s going to happen is that  M2 is going to become a very limiting factor as time passes here, in addition to possibly M1  being a very limiting factor  And therefore I think there ought to be a little more on the upper  side  "
219,1976-11-16,"  Do they remain in debt to the Treasury for that earlier, what was it, $300  [million]?    So that all the debt to the United States officially [will be] this 300, and we  have indicated to them that they can’t use any of the remaining part of the swap  Is that right?    Interim?    That’s awfully important, I think, because of the comparison with the US  situation    The way you put it Henry, it makes me sympathetic with the position of  the accountants    Mexico is the only LDC member    Well, they’re not exactly overdeveloped countries   SPEAKER(?)  They’re not basket cases   SPEAKER(?)  Overdeveloped    I would consider it very fortunate if we can, get it off, and get it accepted--    Mr Chairman, I don’t have any first-hand information, but just observing  the data and reading the Redbook and looking at the staff projection and that kind of thing, I  conclude that the economic setting [has been] weakening progressively over the last several  months  And it’s circular  The difficulty is that the sales haven’t come in in a strong way  In  real terms over the last six months, retail sales are not up at all  And as that has occurred,  inventories, which should have seemed moderate, have looked rather heavy, and output has been  cut  And as output has been cut, income has been lost  The increase in nonfarm personal income  from April to September in real terms has been at only a 2 percent annual rate  So the income  stream in fact does seem to be getting narrower, weaker, and that troubles me very much     And I can’t help but wonder, when you have sales, production, and income all working in  tandem to restrain the expansion in the economy and where that makes inventories look rather  heavy rather than light, whether the next development won’t be a general backing away from  capital spending plans  We often around here said that, well, in an up year, what you generally  find is that the surveys underestimate the increase in capital spending  We, I think, intended  [unintelligible] to look that way, even if the risk is assuming that it was going to be an up year   It’s also true that in a down year the spending surveys can overestimate capital spending     I sense the possibility that we’re shifting in that direction, and in fact our next major  disappointment may very well be what has been in the figures--some increase in capital spending  is going to lose momentum  I think that would be the next development that would convince me  that in fact we may well have a smaller rate of real growth than the staff is projecting now  I still  can’t see the basis for an absolute decline  I can’t see it in inventories, although I’m disturbed  about--they raised the level of retail stocks by 3 percent?    I think we need to reveal the stock-sales ratios    Up to that point, I had not really thought there was really any chance of  inventory shake-out  And for that matter, I thought capital spending couldn’t go down very  much--it hadn’t gone up very much  It didn’t seem likely that it could go down very much  And  I would expect that there could very well be a stronger fiscal policy than we have assumed in the  staff projection, though I would note that that probably wouldn’t occur before early next  year--maybe March or April or the first of May, but it is very distant--    This catch up for--    Just to conclude, Mr Chairman, I have to say that the figures to me have  been very disappointing, almost unbelievable in terms of my prior perception of what would  probably occur as we went through the fall  And so I find myself quite concerned    Yes, and I would remind you that the program was beefed up a few years  ago  Quite a lot of money was spent on it--four or five years [ago] or so, I don’t remember quite  when that occurred  It is a very hard thing to measure, with new stores opening--     A 1/2 point would come as a great surprise    Well, Mr Chairman, I agree to a very considerable extent with Governor  Wallich  I don’t know whether there’s enough liquidity or not, and the statistics seem to show  considerable improvement, but the economy is not performing well  And so, in terms of defining  what we want in the economy, why, I think we could use some more liquidity  The idea used to  be expressed as “you can’t push on a string,” but I don’t think we are in that soggy a situation   And I think that liquidity would improve borrowing and lending attitudes  One positive effect of  some increase in liquidity would be the downward pressure on short-term interest rates  Lower  short-term interest rates, it seems to me, would present institutional managers, particularly the  banks and thrifts, with the portfolio problem of deciding whether to continue to put their funds  disproportionately into very liquid assets at a possibly negative carry or whether to push more  aggressively to make longer-term loans and investments      This would intensify them  Their third alternative is to reduce the inflows  of funds by cutting rates off on savings  Some, I think, would go in every direction  But at least  some institutions would move more aggressively and try to make long-term loans and  investments and thereby communicate some easing in the long-term markets, some downward  pressure in the long-term rates       11/16/76 - 38 -           Now, as far as the aggregates are concerned, I’m not terribly concerned about that October  number on M1 because I do think now that we have to look at September and October combined   And if we look at that combined, if we look at the year to date, the expansion rates don’t seem  excessive to me  But in any event, if we choose an aggregates directive, which I think we  definitely want to do, we protect ourselves against the possibility that the aggregates will go up  quite strongly in November and December  Because if they do, we’ll move the funds rate, we’ll  be up at the top end of the range--and maybe above the top end of the range, and perhaps it will  be a reason for an additional instruction to the Manager if the aggregates do grow strongly     Now, I’m more inclined to think that the aggregates are going to grow quite weakly in  November and December because of the state of the economy  But then, that could be wrong  too  If they do, however, grow weakly, then having the aggregates target would mean that we  would be moving down in the funds rate and perhaps again have a special meeting  So I think  it’s an important time to have the directive stated in terms of the aggregates simply because of  our total state of ignorance of what is going to be shown in the aggregates performance in this  and the next couple of months     Well, I would support alternative A, but I would support it with the variations that  Governor Wallich suggested  That is, I think we could cut the M2 growth rate a little bit, and   then--I think you said we’d cut it a 1/2 percentage point on each end, didn’t you, Henry?    I’m speaking of M2    I think I would buy that, and I think I would also buy the 4-1/4 to 5-1/4  funds rate range, which means that the midpoint is 4-3/4, and it would presume a move to 4-3/4  unless the aggregates were performing quite unusually, quite abnormally high or low  We would  move, say within a week or so, to 4-3/4, so that would be my view  And I won’t say anything  about the discount rate    Below    Well, I just want to say, in response to President Roos’s last comment, that  I think he’s referring to the fact that alternative A, given the long-term ranges that we have  adopted, implies a firming later next year  And I would just want to point out that that presumes  that the staff projection of nominal GNP growth is correct  If, in fact, the staff projection of  nominal GNP growth was too high and it came in lower, you wouldn’t have as much money  growth and there wouldn’t necessarily need to be a tightening--so, that sort of a construct in the  way the Bluebook is put together  If that staff projection comes out right, and if we should hold  [for] four quarters to the ranges that we adopted in the telephone meeting, then you would need  to tighten some, later on in the period  But only under those conditions    Yeah, sure    Then we would be faced with the issue sooner    That last rate, the midpoint would be 4-7/8, is it, rather than being  skewed?    I have expressed the preference for 4-1/4 to 5-1/4  I would be prepared to  buy 4-1/2 to 5-1/4, but if so, I’d like to have it understood that the midpoint is 4-3/4  That is, that  we move in a timely way down to 4-3/4 and then look for further reductions from that point  So  in that sense, I would shift it    4-7/8 Friday, maybe, and then 4-3/4 midweek of next week--something  like that   [LAUGHTER]    And which directive?    This would say moderate monetary growth  "
245,1976-12-20,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  This is a holdover from the last meeting of the  Committee, and it represents, I would say, essentially a housekeeping proposal  Specifically, we  have discussed in this Committee from time to time the question of the proper location of the  long-range aggregates specifications and the short-run aggregates specifications  For a number  of years, they have been in a supplementary piece for technical reasons that no longer apply   Therefore, my subcommittee--which consists of Governor Wallich, Mr Morris, and Mr  Balles--met on one occasion in November and decided that there no longer was a reason why  these specifications couldn’t appear directly in the directive to the Manager, since, in effect, they  form a very important part of the directive to the Manager  And the wording as we’ve shown in  here accomplishes this purpose     I might say that one can naturally worry over the specific wording of including these  longer-range and shorter-range specs in the directive; and indeed, I have worried over them a  little bit more since the report was issued  So I have a small proposal [for] a change as compared  with the way it appears now [in our proposal]  But the concept is simple  It is that since the  Committee in fact discusses in detail and votes on both the long-run and short-run specification  ranges, and since in one way or another the Manager is expected to pattern his behavior on the  basis of what is happening with respect to those ranges, we believe that it ought to be in the  directive     If everyone has a copy of the appendix to the report with them--that’s the last three pages  of the document--I would suggest to you what the small further word changes that I would  propose are  First, on the first page of the appendix, item 1 deals with the longer-run ranges, in  the next-to-last paragraph  I would suggest that this read  “In light of the foregoing  developments, it is the policy of the Federal Open Market Committee to foster” and then add,  “bank reserve and other financial conditions” The reason I would propose that is that the  Committee has always been concerned with the rate in which bank reserves are being provided,  and this suggestion would be consistent with the recommendation in the second subcommittee  report that we’ll be taking up next on the agenda  So that it will read “to foster bank reserve and  other financial conditions that will encourage continued”--that’s the only change there       12/20-21/76 - 2 -         Now, when we get to the operational paragraphs--it is the last paragraph of the  directive--we have two kinds of formulations that we have customarily used  One is a monetary  aggregates formulation and one is the money market formulation, and I propose a small change  in both cases to somewhat loosen up the relationship between the performance of the aggregates  and the federal funds rate targets that the Desk would have  I believe Mr Axilrod tells  me--although my recollection is rather dim--that my suggested change would conform more  closely with what in fact we have done in the past     First, the last line on page 2--and this is the monetary aggregates formulation--instead of  saying, “will approach or move beyond the limits of the indicated ranges,” I would say, “will  deviate significantly from the midpoints of the indicated ranges”  The reason for that is that  there is sort of a staged response as we get further and further away from those midpoints  We  use the word “significantly,” and that’s a term of art  The definition of “significantly” could  vary, of course, from time to time, depending on thoughts as to ranges of indifference and things  of that kind      And on the money market formulation, the same linkage is covered at the very end, on  page 4, and there, about six lines down, “if given approximately equal weight to M1 and M2, it  appears that growth rates over the two-month period are deviating from these expected ranges,”  instead I would say, “are approaching or moving beyond the limits of the indicated ranges”   Again, that makes it possible within the strict terms of the directive specifications for the  Manager to begin to react, even in the money market directive, to deviation in the performance  of the aggregates that has gotten us close to either the high end or the low end of the range  And  I think that does conform with what we have done on quite numerous occasions over the last  several years when we did have a money market directive     So those are the changes I would propose  Now, Governor Wallich had some thoughts  about the linkage in fact being perhaps a little too loose already, and I would like to call on him  for any comments he would like to make  And Mr Morris didn’t have a chance to look directly  at the specific words we used in these proposals because he was out of the country, and I would  like for him to comment  And then, finally, Mr Balles, as the other committee member, should  have a chance to comment, too  So Henry, do you want to present your position    Yes, but there are questions of nuance in the exact words you choose to do  that    That’s all we’re going to--codify it, put it into the directive, and drop  that--what do we call it?--spec sheet that we have at the end    Yes, but I think we do that now--   COLDWELL  Not individually, we don’t have to    On the specs?   COLDWELL  I believe we record votes on the specs, don’t we, Art?    After having often voted on every aspect of the specifications and then we  vote on the whole thing    This, to answer--    This would mean that you would vote [only] on the directive--to show a  range directive, and the directive would include the specifications  Presumably we would have  decided on what those specifications ought to be by something like the same process that we  now use  And you also would vote on the long-range specifications when they are changed, that  is, when they are considered just before the end  I recall we did that at the telephone conference  call in November for the first time    It goes out as a package, doesn’t it, Art, after about 30 days?    Could I summarize the facts here once more, Tom, because I understood  that it didn’t make any difference  The lower court has interpreted the directive as including the  specification sheet, is that right?    That is not correct  You’re just speaking of the moderate growth in the  monetary aggregates, aren’t you  No reference to publish  But why don’t we publish it, for  Pete’s sake    Does that require changing the next sentence then?    Do you read the word “collaboration,” Henry, as going both ways?  That  is, if the Treasury wants to do something, that we’d collaborate with them and join them, or do  you read it only as our collaboration with the Treasury on actions that we wish to undertake      But it generally by itself says a great deal    May I ask, Mr Chairman--Henry, there is no room, as I read it, between C  of 1 and B of 2--that is to say, the subcommittee doesn’t have any separate area of authority  Is  that right?    Everything  I see, I see    Then it shoots to the Committee  I see, thank you    It seems to me that the Chairman is accountable and the subcommittee is  accountable under this procedure  If the procedure turns out to be offensive to the Committee,  it’ll be changed  As you say, in seven years there hasn’t been an example    No, I think it does require some time to talk about it, and I don’t know  when else the agenda of the Committee is going to permit the time    Well, Mr Chairman, this is a report by the [Sub]committee on [the  Directive regarding] nonborrowed reserves and the experiment that has been conducted by the  staffs at the Desk and then also at the Board over recent months--six or eight or nine months it’s  been going on  The question is whether it would be better, or whether it would be more precise,  or whether our purposes would be accomplished by operating more on providing a certain  quantity of nonborrowed reserves and less on the funds rate and on the other current  considerations that affect the operations of the Desk     This goes back a long way  The subcommittee has been in existence, I believe, for several  years, and the nonborrowed proposals which were a part of the report to the Committee some  considerable while ago were a principal [rationale] for this kind of an investigation  We are  transmitting staff documentation to the Committee, and we have a transmittal note to the staff, of  course     Naturally, in deciding what the experiment has shown and what our recommendations  would be, we relied on the staff work that has gone into the conduct of the experiment  The  papers attached are by a Board group, Mr Paulus, Mr Beck; and New York Fed views, Mr     12/20-21/76 - 24 -         Sternlight, Miss Tschenkel principally  I could call on each of those authors, but I think in the  interest of time, what I’ll do instead is ask Steve Axilrod to summarize the results of the  experiment as it was presented to the Committee and as resolved  So why don’t I start with  Steve Axilrod to briefly summarize the results of the experiment     Well, I think it’s true, John, that the longer the average chosen, the better  chance of success in getting something within that range  Of course, the Committee has been  operating on a two-month specification with the aggregates, so that is why the experiment was  specified in that way  I don’t know how they could have done it on a longer- range average--a  three-month average or four-month average--in the absence of knowing what the Committee had  chosen as its target for that period     Well, I think we should ask, Mr Chairman, whether there are any staff  comments  Mr Axilrod has attempted to summarize what the staff paper shows, and I think the  staff--Mr Paulus, Mr Sternlight--ought to have a chance to correct anything that he said that  they consider inaccurate  Is there anything, John?     Well, now, from that summary, Mr Chairman, the subcommittee reached  three operational recommendations that it wishes to present to the Committee  The first is the  conclusion, which follows from the summary, that there isn’t anything much to be gained in  adopting nonborrowed reserves as a target for the Desk so long as we continue to have a two- month short-run horizon, the kind the Committee has used before  Indeed, sometimes it appears  that it could be counterproductive, as for example in the last two months, when it was     12/20-21/76 - 27 -         consistently indicating--when the Manager would consistently have them operate against a  nonborrowed reserves [target] that was running above the target, and would have done that, I  presume, by raising the interest rates and raising them substantially     The fact of the matter is that neither nonborrowed reserves nor the funds rate are going to  be terribly helpful in achieving short-range target objectives in terms of the monetary aggregates   But the difference is that, in my view at least, whereas the nonborrowed reserves operational  vehicle will result in considerable interest rate fluctuations--sometimes rather extended  movements in rates over the four-week period--the use of the funds rate avoids that short-run  instability in the great [unintelligible]     Now that gets me through the second recommendation  We have always, in this  Committee--in the 10 years or so that I have been involved--felt that reserves were a very  important ingredient in this System’s operation  There has always been an effort to find some  reserve measure that we can point to and use in the Committee’s work  There used to be some  very considerable--in the first report, I think, Frank, it was total reserves  In the second report--    --into RPD  That was in the second report, as I recall  But in any event,  RPD was attempted, and now in the third subcommittee, recommended nonborrowed reserves,  and now the experiment is not shown to be terribly successful in the short run  In view,  however, of the fact that [unintelligible] the Federal Reserve basically does provide reserves [to  the] banking system on which it can base the expansion in its long-term investments on one hand  and in its deposit base on the other, we do believe that expansion should still be directed toward  reserves over a longer-range period, say, six months  And that, in the Bluebook, the staff ought  to specify what it expects to be the growth in reserves that would be associated with the targets  in the monetary aggregates and that it also chart the course of the original reserves against that  expectation  So that it would be a longer-term emphasis on the provision of bank reserves at an  adequate and not excessive rate rather than a short-term attention given to that factor  That’s our  second recommendation     Our third is that, since the short-range experimental attempt has not shown great success,  that the Committee ought to now tell the staff to discontinue the short-range experiment, which  is continued in the Bluebook which we have for consideration tomorrow, and, indeed, that the  subcommittee should now look at other problems rather than the short range control question  having to do with nonborrowed or any other aggregates reserve measures     There were some qualifications to these recommendations  There is a considerable interest  in reserves as a target, and there is considerable [disquiet] in the subcommittee with excessive  attention to narrow funds rate ranges and narrow control of the interest rate structure  So I think  I will ask the other members of the subcommittee who feel this way to speak  Governor Wallich  has a supplemental comment attached to the report which seems to me to show a considerable  underlined desire for some reserve measure for controlling the growth in the aggregates, and I  would like him to speak first  Henry      12/20-21/76 - 28 -          President Balles had a supplementary comment to the report also  John, I  don’t think you amplified everything you wanted to say in your earlier comments     That completes our report    That’s sort of an analytic background of [unintelligible] as I understand it   This is how excessive dependence on the market the funds rate--that is, if you’re really defining  excessive, I’ve got to say, what would you mean by excessive terms    Or at least it’s closely related     Yes, I would like to second what President Balles said  There weren’t  dissents--just qualifications, and those two recommendations, I think, do require some kind of  disposition by the Committee some time or other     Well, I did  I think there’s a time horizon here  I don’t know that I agree  that this short-term operating range [should] be longer  I think you have to be prepared to move  it over time, which is what every other--   [Unintelligible]    [Unintelligible]     Yes, I think that’s right   December 21, 1976   [Secretary’s note  The raw transcript for the December 21 session begins at this point   The session began with Committee approval of the Minutes of Actions of the meeting of the  FOMC held on November 16, 1976, and the Manager reported on, and the Committee approved,  System open market transactions in foreign currencies during the period November 16- December 20, 1976]    Are you talking about 20 percent?    Given your fiscal program, it shifts to about $15 billion deficit  I have lost  track of what that’s based on, whether it’s still a 4 percent unemployment rate--it would be a  higher real full employment deficit, and, of course, the Chairman added a $5 billion fiscal  package  But just taking your figure, 15, it occurs at the beginning of the second quarter of next  year, at a time when residential construction is still moving up rather substantially  And that  represents a change in projection as compared with a number of months ago, when we saw it  leveling out, but it’s still moving up rather substantially  Plant and equipment is doing pretty  well, rising 5-1/2 to 6 billion a quarter  It strikes me that that’s an awful lot of demand for funds   Have you done a flow of funds projection to see whether there are interest rate pressures that  would seem to come from this kind of scenario?    I think it’s basically a nonfinancial question  At least it’s not a monetary  policy question    Based on the flow of funds?    There is a very large mortgage demand    I had the impression that when the full employment picture had gone  sharply into deficit, on a full employment basis, that generally you’ve had considerable pressure     So that you don’t have enough tightness to choke off housing or any of the  other sectors within the year 1977    Did you add $7-1/2 billion to the deficit on the basis of Rivlin’s testimony  or did you deduct it?    I imagine she meant it would be smaller    You said the four quarters--6 percent at the four quarters  That’s the way  you interpret the goal?    Year over year, the average person would think of it as, and you would  have 47 percent for the projection, which is less than 5-1/2 percent for the four quarters    Am I looking at the wrong thing?  ’77, page I-7, and the fourth quarter,  it’s 5-1/2 percent, so you take it from fourth [quarter] ’76 period    Well, we’ve gotten off on the projection  There has been very little  comment about the economic situation, so just for the record, I want to say that I subscribe to  what Lyle said today about the improved tone  I think there has been a very marked  improvement in the tone of the business statistics in the last month  The staff has been  predicting it for some time, but one still feels better to have in hand an increase in industrial  production that exceeds the Ford and Deere comeback, and the sharp rise in personal income,  and the improvement and upward revision in retail sales, and the beginning of this inventory  adjustment that is so critical to the future development as we go into 1977  I think, and others  have commented, too, the situation has rather materially strengthened in the past four, five, six  weeks    Roger, is that for a good-grade farm loan?    How could snow have any implications for the drought--    You usually build up a lot more in those zones--    You said, Peter, that the reduction in short-term rates was a little more  than a cut in the funds rate, it’s really quite a lot in the reduction of a funds rate  The market  oversold in your view?  Is there a tendency to back up after a 60 point--was it 60 in bills?    4-5/8 you say is [expected]    Just to follow up on that  In the normal course, you would just provide  $550 million less    I’d like to follow up on President Morris’s question  I found myself being  drawn instinctively and more and more to M2 and M3 as relevant considerations  But most  relevant considerations, in trying to chart over the longer range, are based, of course, on  monetary policy  The difficulty I have with that is that I don’t think we’re nearly as well fixed  on what is an appropriate M2 or M3 growth rate range  We haven’t spent nearly the amount of  time concentrating [on them as] we have on M1     For example, you mentioned the last decade  Well, a decade ago you didn’t have any  certificates in M2 and M3 to speak of  You certainly didn’t have any four-year or six-year  certificates, which has an effect on the way you ought to look at the figures, I think  I just don’t  have a decent map in my mind of what we ought to be looking for in M2 and M3 growth rates  I  would hope [I] would be prepared to put relatively more weight on this if I had that kind of a  background, but I don’t have any at this point  I hope, when we look at the long-range targets  again, that we will spend a little effort on trying to set M2 and M3 targets, [unintelligible] in  association with the economy, and that kind of thing      I have a different impression that we have troubles    I, too, feel that somehow the move is coming to an end, and it is just really  a question of--if I’m right--how we manage the runoff or maybe slight turn up  I have a little bit  of a preference for [the position of] Governor Coldwell, which would carry the funds rate down  another eighth, and which is almost no difference in positions, but I think I sort of share Ernie’s  feeling that I would rather now have the market stabilized rather than back up some  And I think  it would be more likely to stabilize if we had just a little bit further move  And I also, for some  reason, prefer the 3 to 7 on the M1, just because they are round numbers; I don’t really have  anything to choose from     That brings me to the second point  I think it really is more important today to determine  whether we want the money market directive or an aggregates directive  And perhaps I have  been burned too much in the past, but I have a distinct feeling that the aggregates are difficult to  project in December and January--I think you can’t even say that January is going to be high if  December’s low or vice versa  It is just very difficult in this period  Now, if you want to impart  a sense of leveling out the market, it would be a shame to upset it by unexpected aberrations in  the aggregates, which would cause the Desk to have to move  That is, at least with this period  [of] 30 days that we’re talking about  So I would think that a money market specification is a  proper specification     And taking Governor Coldwell’s number, what I think that would mean [is that we] would  be leaving the funds rate at around 4-1/2 percent, which I would define as 4-3/8 to 4-5/8, where  it now is  Unless the aggregates on average are at the bottom end or top end of the range--[in     12/20-21/76 - 66 -         which case] we should move on toward the 4 percent or the 5 percent [ends of the funds rate  range]--but only in that case [do] I think we should move    Do you mean by using a word other than “moderate”?    If we’re decided on a money market directive--I gather there was a  consensus for that--why don’t we regard the center spot of the money market directive as being  4-1/2--4-5/8  Then I think you’d have virtual unanimity    I happen to think it’s a good thing to give the Manager a little range    I meant as his target    Well, he hits it within four or five weeks from now  "
271,1977-01-17,"  Mr Chairman, a clarification--our loan would be to the BIS rather than to  the Bank of England, in case we’re called upon?    We would lend at our discount rate?  Or our bill rate, or what?  What  would be the interest rate?     1/17-18/77 - 3 -            Which is ordinarily at the bill rate?    For half of this    Or repudiates its debt    It has to be a swap currency?    The peso as such?    Eligible    For 15 years we’ve been trying to--    That’s because of the exemptions?  Is that what makes it modest?  The two  exemptions?    Perhaps I didn’t understand Governor Gardner’s question  What do you  mean “modest”?     1/17-18/77 - 15 -            Tom, you didn’t mention transcript when you were talking in terms of the  possible implications [for] the Committee--is that because the exemptions make the minutes  possible?    In both cases?    But again you’d have the question of sensitive and nonsensitive parts in  the minutes    They weren’t looking at seasonally adjusted figures, they were looking at  the year-over-year, as I recall, which narrowed very appreciably, and made them gloomy    I know of one retail economist who looks at seasonally adjusted--     1/17-18/77 - 26 -            Well, Mr Chairman, I agree with the first part of Governor Lilly’s  statement, but I don’t think I really agree with the second part    The second part is that he is concerned with the possibility of overheating  in the course of this year  And I would certainly agree that the best-guess projections appear to  have changed markedly for the better in the last several months, not only the retail sales  Now,  Dave, those retail sales could be a little bit chunky; that is, we might find ourselves kind of  down, now, for a period of time, but it did have the very desirable effect of reducing observed  inventory levels and changing attitudes, and I think it is a real shot in the arm  And I think  housing looks to me as if it has sustained strength--you mentioned that too  And I agree that this  all ought to have an effect on capital spending as the year goes on, and it ought to be stronger  than we were previously worrying it might be  However, the staff projection for the four  quarters of 1977 averages a little less than 6 percent--I guess 59, 58, something like that    For the next four quarters  And so, even if that were, say, a point higher  than what’s projected, it would not be an extraordinary number  It could be a point higher if we  get a little more capital spending, a little more inventory than suggested  But even with that, it  seems to me that, as you reach the end of 1977, you wouldn’t be talking about really high  utilization rates, you wouldn’t be talking about, well, an unemployment rate that would be down  even to anyone’s objectives  So I don’t think there is that much difficulty if there should be  some moderate overrun from staff projections in the actual results of the economy in the course  of the year     There is another point, though, that I would like to bring to the Committee’s attention   Some few of us have continued to watch the full employment surplus and deficit numbers, and I  want to point out that the concept of potential GNP has been revised to reduce, I think, to a more  realistic objective the rates of growth that can be expected in the real economy based on  productivity and labor force growth  And also [it has been revised] to adjust for structural  changes in the labor force so that the unemployment rate associated with full employment is no  longer 4 [percent] on the nose but, as a matter of fact, for the year 1976, is 496 because of  structural changes--almost 5 percent  And that, also, is a desirable change     But the result is that, even with the proposed fiscal program--which I would think is more  apt to be altered in the direction of being more liberal than less liberal as it goes through  Congress and as the new Administration considers it--with that program, there is, on these new  figures, a rather high full employment deficit for 1977, calendar ’77  Our staff estimate is [for a]  $263 billion full employment deficit in that year  And related to potential GNP, on the new  measure of GNP growth, this is the highest proportion of potential GNP in more than a decade  with the exception of only one year, 1967  In 1967, the full employment deficit, on these new  figures relative to potential GNP, was a bit higher than is now projected for ’77     Well, it’s a very considerable increase from calendar ’76 to calendar ’77, from a  $12 billion full employment deficit to a $26 billion full employment deficit  That gives me     1/17-18/77 - 28 -           pause and concern about financial market conditions as the year goes on because, although I  never believed much in the idea of crowding-out on the basis of just the actual deficit figures, I  noted long ago that if you look at the full employment deficit figures and you see a sharp shift  toward deficit which is associated with tighter conditions and higher interest rates, it is going to  be a problem as the year goes on     It also does contain the possibility, this kind of a full employment deficit--which I’m pretty  sure will be the highest in the postwar period, although the figures were taken back only to  1964-- may have psychological effects on inflationary expectations in the economy    But it has a real effect, Mr Chairman, that’s what I guess I want to imply  to you    Well, that would be $70 billion or so, and that’s a very large number, too   But it also could have some effects that we can’t fully anticipate  So I think, although I am not  concerned about overheating things for the year immediately ahead, that the trend in these fiscal  numbers does give me real pause  And I think it also may cause very considerable pressures for  the central bank if in fact it brings some crowding-out, if it brings some tightening in the  market--which is likely, I think--and higher interest rates  The usual kinds of difficulties we  have when interest rates are rising and housing people can speak out about that kind of effect   Since it hadn’t been mentioned by Lyle, I just wanted to bring it to the attention of the  Committee    I wouldn’t subtract $10 billion  I’ve never felt that a refund didn’t have  any effect on the economy    It does have a rather high spillover into the saving flows, but I wouldn’t  say it’s a zero effect on the economy  And the other thing, the point that I would make, Lyle, is  that this is just the opening gambit by the Administration  The Congress has not yet dealt with  this, and the spending programs that are people’s pets have not yet been brought to the floor   The chances are that this number will be exceeded--not falling short--in actual practice as the  year goes on     1/17-18/77 - 29 -            It missed by an order of 2, I think    It missed by an order of 2, I think    Of course, if you continue to make adjustments because the model has  been weakened at the moment, it will finally get to the point where it overestimates the rate of  the price inflation because of adjustments that are made [judgmentally]  But I don’t know that  we’ve reached that point    That’s when it is, mid-March to mid-April?    But it comes at approximately the same time that the Treasury would have  to finance the refund, also    No, I mean the rebate    Is it also a rather high real GNP increase for the third year of recovery?    That tends to add to this pressure on velocity?       1/17-18/77 - 36 -            Well, basically, this is based on a measure of capacity of the economy   The unemployment rate just happens to fall out  But it doesn’t depend on a direct measure of  unemployment    I certainly wanted only to report to the Committee the figures  I think it is  a good thing to allow for structural change in talking about what the economy would hope to  accomplish, and in that sense I think this is a real move forward compared with the way we used  to measure potential GNP and [with] a 4 percent unemployment rate as an invariant target    Well, I was just going to ask, following up on Governor Gardner’s  comments and also Governor Lilly  One of the problems is in this question of the political  perception--and also your comment--[regarding] the rate of improvement in the economy  A  little technical difficulty in the staff’s projection, Lyle, is that the lowest quarterly increase is  [for] the first quarter in the projections for the year--5 percent  And I was wondering if you had  a view as to what the possibilities might be that in fact we could exceed that growth rate in the  first quarter--that is, start out in the year pretty well?  I note that you don’t have much inventory  accumulation in the first quarter, and I note also that you hold housing starts the same in the first  quarter as in the fourth  Could those two areas perhaps turn out to be stronger?    The point that I was trying to make with Lyle is that output could go up  faster here  It would show up in a little more inventory accumulation    Well, Mr Chairman, I believe I would support the ranges you proposed,  recognizing in each case that they’re pretty tight  With regard to M1, I’m a little surprised to  hear President Balles suggest a reduction in the range, when earlier he commented that the  implied velocity increase was extraordinarily large [on the order] of the 5-1/2 percent--that is  where we were--in the projection  And I want to comment on that because I think that’s true     I believe that a 4-1/2 to 6-1/2 M1 range [is appropriate], given what I think are fairly  optimistic views on inflation by the staff and a real growth rate which--it’s all right, but just--is  at the lower end of a range that people would seek, I think, in the abstract, for 1977     It’s a tight objective, 4-1/2 to 6-1/2  I’m not at all sure that there won’t be people who will  say that, “Well, in view of the fiscal program and the needs of the economy, the Committee  should have increased its M1 ranges”  But I think I wouldn’t want to increase them, certainly  not at this point, anyhow  I just would be afraid to make a further reduction, John, because of  the implied velocity rise, even allowing for Steve’s 1 percentage point for shifting definition   You still have a large velocity rise--if I understood you right, you said 58 percent for the year,  and if you take that point off, that would make it 48, and that’s still above the usual experience     Also, although I agree with what the Chairman said about the poor predictive results of the  St Louis model, I think the St Louis model must have said about the same thing, given  President Roos’s statement that we can’t make that real growth [projection] with the money  supply range we have  Therefore, I am a little uncomfortable with 4-1/2 to 6-1/2--I think that the  needs of the economy might be for more rather than less--but I would support the 4-1/2 to 6-1/2     Now M2 and M3--I think we need to recognize that what we’re doing essentially is  projecting interest rates  Given the M1 growth rate and the performance of the economy, M2  and M3 will be largely a function of interest rates  Governor Jackson is quite right that the upper  ends of the present ranges for M2 and M3 imply a considerable increase in interest rates   Because throughout 1976, we produced numbers a good deal higher for M2 and M3; and in the  fourth quarter of 1976, we’ve produced much higher figures for M2 and M3 given the interest  rates we had at that time  I’m inclined to think there will be some increase in interest rates, but I  can’t support President Black’s suggestion that we reduce the upper end of that range, since I  think it’s already a tight squeeze  It implies that we anticipate a considerable increase in interest  rates as the year goes on to get down within the present ceiling on M2 and M3       1/17-18/77 - 47 -           I would, however, be prepared to support a lower limit of the range, and the reason I would  is that we’ve been so miserable in our interest rate projections that, in fact, there could be a lot  more interest rate rise than we expect as the year goes on, which would tend to produce low-end  numbers for M2 and M3  And I doubt that, on those grounds alone, the Committee would want  to loosen up on policy  That is, [if we get], let’s say, a very high federal deficit or a shift--as I  said before--in the full employment deficit number to a much higher number, you [will get]  considerable upward pressure on rates, and those savings inflows [will start] to recede  significantly  I doubt that we would want, on those grounds alone, to pump a lot more money  into the economy  In fact, I think we’d probably be inclined to go the other way  And therefore,  I think it’s consistent to have a lower low end, Bob, on M2 and M3, rather than to reduce the  high end, even though historically you’re quite right that those numbers are a little bit on the  high side    Well, but with a 5 percent inflation rate, and the desire for real growth [to  move] from 6 to 7, it requires quite a sizable number I believe    And you’re suggesting an upper limit of 11-1/2 on the range for M3, and  of 10 for M2, which is less than last year’s result in both cases    My point, simply, Mr Chairman, is that I think the Committee must be  aware of the fact that--because we’re talking about relationships among the family of  aggregates--it’s basically projecting interest rates  It may be that, sometime in the year,  Regulation Q could give, which would hold the number up  But I hate to predict that, because of  the difficulty in negotiating those changes  So, altogether, I find myself prepared to accept the  numbers you have suggested  But I do want to note that I think that in each case, the range is  tight relative to what we expect the economy to do    That’s a question of short-term targets    Relative to GNP    Mr Chairman, I wonder, did the staff do any estimates to see what that  M3 would do to housing?  Did you project it?    No, but for the upper limit--M3, well anything    The question that I had in my mind and, I think, that Governor Jackson  had in his mind is whether coming down from where we’ve been recently--not with the upper  end of the ranges but where we have been--won’t create quite a wrench in housing  And that is a  matter of flow of funds projections    So, do you have a rising level of starts with an M3 within the ranges that  we’re talking about?    We should look at B as being the projection    Well, going back to President Black’s question, what we can look forward  to with some confidence is a bulge, maybe as early as March, with the refunds of 1976 tax  payments, certainly in May and June depending on the timing of the rebate  And so it puts us in  sort of an odd situation; the January and February numbers are not extraordinary in any way, but  we all look forward with anticipation to these bulges, and we can’t do much about it      I think we ought to break    Single or multifamily?    That would put them at about alternative C, if you shade them    Well, I don’t exactly agree with President Volcker’s “straddling” the long- term range  I think a lot of times you got a month, and the two-month average that we know is  coming in pretty high or pretty low  And so it becomes just impossible, unless you just disregard  it, to have something in that midpoint  This doesn’t happen to be one of those times, although I  guess generally [unintelligible], and tremendously so  I would rather have the lower ranges, too,  for these two months, because I am concerned about the bulge  And if we could, I would like to  save up a little room to accommodate the bulge when it occurs  Now I don’t mean by that to  make it a very low number, but 3 to 7 on M1, and 7 to 11 on M2 seem to me to be reasonably  high numbers  And if could save a half point there, why, we are going to need it, I’m quite sure,  if there is a [tax] rebate and if it’s of the size people have been talking about       1/17-18/77 - 60 -           And we should, I think, start now to plan our strategies so that we don’t seem to [take an  action] that people would imagine as a contradiction to the fiscal policy action--the kind of  response we got in the spring of ’75  So I would go for the short-range specs of alternative C     As far as the funds rate is concerned, I can’t really disagree with the Chairman--4-1/4  seems low and 5-1/4 seems high  But we are getting awfully myopic on this question of interest  rates, and if the aggregates were quite strong, I could imagine us wanting to do this, perhaps as  high as 5-1/4; if they were quite weak, I could then imagine us deciding maybe we ought to pull  back a little bit--perhaps as low as 4-1/4     So, although I don’t have a great deal of happiness about the bottom quarter or the top  quarter of that range, I would prefer the 1 point range--4-1/4 to 5-1/4  And I don’t really think  we have any good basis for continuing on a money market directive type of approach, as we had  in the past month, since we are through that period of extreme uncertainty  So I think if you’re  going to have an aggregates directive, you need a point range  So I would vote 4-1/4 to 5-1/4,  but use the 4-1/4 and 5-1/4 points sparingly    That is, well, you’d have to have a high number on both or a low--    If we got to the extremities on the aggregates  But we would have zones  of indifference--    All right, then I’ll retract  4-1/4 to 5-1/4 straight--that will be my vote    I said “to the extremities”    If you were at the extremes on M1 and M2  One other point, Mr  Chairman  I sort of feel, as I think President Volcker inferred, that we’re probably at the bottom,  and rates are going to be moving up  We’ve been wrong about that before, and we could be  wrong about it again, and I don’t think we ought to make the judgment final  And therefore, if  we did get extreme weakness, maybe we ought to let them drift down a bit    And not have to adjust it so much when we have it at hand    Which would be the bigger reaction?    Would you agree on the size of the adjustment, Peter--10 to 20 basis  points?    And they were at 480 yesterday    I suggested that last time, and you said I was being too tough on the Desk      Then it’s the whole range    Are we giving preferences?    Preferences?  4-5/8 as the midpoint, or 4-5/8 to 4-3/4 as the midpoint    When you say a very little damage, you mean some small rise?    I just wanted you to define damage  "
294,1977-02-15,"  What is a normative figure on inventory accumulation now?  Do you sort  of assume close to 1 percent of GNP would be a normal figure?    For next year  The whole of this year is well below that    You thought, Willis, that more will be used to begin to repay debts?    Well, car sales went up  That’s why you’ve got consumer credit    It would take a number of years at 6 percent--    Literally looked at, the unemployment rate drops to 71 in its projection  over the year; with 6 percent growth, [unemployment drops] from 79 to 71  That is an 8/10  [percentage point] reduction  So it would take another couple of years to get down    It was about 87-1/2    It would depend on how it is distributed, too  If you remember ’73, it was  rather a surprise that we had that much inflationary pressure with that level of capacity  utilization  It was, of course, reported lower than it is now  It’s been revised  But nevertheless,  it seemed as if there were lots of pressure points  And if you had a more general distribution of  demand so that we might not have a repetition of that--it would depend on the precise character  of the forecast    Well, I wouldn’t expect any 20 percent devaluation  And I think that had  a major effect on that rate of inflation in 1973    Well, Mr Chairman, I just thought that I might say, since I think we need  so many views on this, the economic outlook seems to me to be quite good and strengthened  over the last month or two  We did have Henry refer, I think, to this group of business  economists we had in last week, and they were also, it seemed to me, quite optimistic, talking  really about a very good outlook for their products and their industries in the period to come  So  I agree with the staff forecast that there is developing strength in the economy     But I do think that we have to recognize that, at this instant, we haven’t been able to assess  yet the full effects of the weather  I understand this  Now there is, as I think Jerry said,  somewhat of a strike effect there, that you cut output, cut inventory, cut income for a very  temporary period--but, in this case, over a very wide number of employees  And you would  expect that, when the weather changes, output will come back and the inventories will be  reaccumulated and the incomes will be restored, and so there wouldn’t be much overall effect     There also is an income transfer point here, which has been mentioned, that may not be  overcome; that is to say, that you shift income from consumers to sellers of fuel  And you could  presume, I suppose, that the sellers of fuel have a lower propensity to spend than the ordinary  consumers have, and we might get some depressing effect     So I guess I wanted to indicate that, although the prospect is that we would get a very good  snapback and maybe a very strong second quarter, it is not yet quite in the bag because we have  not quite yet assimilated the total effect that this weather development [will have]  And I think     2/15/77 - 18 -           we need to be a little cautious until we can see what the shape of our coming out of this weather  will be    Yes, but assume they would pay their gas bill anyway    You’ve got about a $40 billion increase in savings in the second quarter    You add it    You mean the CDs--not Eurodollars?  Issuing domestic CDs to foreigners?    What’s the number you’re referring to?    It’s higher than what you’ve projected    [Unintelligible] a lot of technology in V2, that is, to the extent some of the  shifts from demand deposits to savings accounts in banks [unintelligible]     2/15/77 - 27 -            Some of it’s going to thrifts    I’m surprised that your average increase in the second quarter was only 8  percent under alternative B    Paul, you could move to 5 within this specification     Because if you were toward the top on the aggregates, why, you could  move up  If the aggregates were very strong, you could go beyond 5 through the device of [a  Committee consultation]     Well, Mr Chairman, I find myself I guess mostly in agreement with  President Volcker  I think the danger right now is that we could have higher-than-expected  growth rates in the aggregates, and I think if we do, we ought to move against them fairly  promptly because of our feeling that the second quarter is going to have a bulge       2/15/77 - 32 -           I might point out to the Committee that it may appear that it’s made headway in gaining a  little room for the bulge because, as reported by Peter, the M1 was at or below the midpoint of  the range all through the intermeeting period  But if you look real hard at this Bluebook, you  will find that January is going to be revised up in the 46--or something like that--growth rate, to  58 because of the change in seasonal factors  And mainly what we’ve done is we’ve added to  the January growth rate and taken away from the March growth rate in that seasonal factor  adjustment, so that, in fact, we haven’t made any progress in providing room for the second  quarter bulge     Therefore, I guess, Paul, I would be opposed to raising that M1 range to 3-1/2 to 7-1/2  I  wouldn’t want to give any ground, and I think 3 to 7 as in alternative B is the best way to go   And I suppose I might have a small preference for a 4-1/4 to 5-1/4 range [for the federal funds  rate], but I don’t feel strongly about it if it’s understood that if [we] move up toward the high end  on these growth rates, we will be moving toward 5, and if we move significantly over those  growth rates, why, we’ll reconsider the instruction to the Manager  So I would go along with B  as written     The center point in the funds rate 4-5/8--      2/15/77 - 35 -            Well, Mr Chairman, the subcommittee has not made an effort in this  proposal to do anything substantive  All we wanted to accomplish in the way, you might say, of  a clean-up of the records of the Committee was to put directly into the directive the directive  [specifications]  And to discontinue the specification sheet, which is sort of a side agreement  that we’ve had for some years, and its position was never absolutely clear in anyone’s mind  whether it be a legal document or an instruction to the Manager     So that the purpose here--and I want to emphasize that [it] is not to make any changes in  the previous procedures or in the Committee’s way of speaking  The longer range, which  represents the thrust of the Committee’s thinking over the longer run and [is] voted upon with  the qualification that those long-term ranges could be respecified at any time  And [in] the short- term range we try to capture precisely what we’d recommend the Manager to do, that is, a  monetary aggregates or money market directive, [giving] attention to the aggregates or to the  money market  In either case, the directive is affected by where we’re falling in the projections  relative to the range of expectation  And again, we qualify the short-term specification, as in  practice that has been done, by pointing out that if the specifications are inconsistent [with the     2/15/77 - 36 -           money market range], the Manager informs the Chairman, and the Chairman may call for a  change in the specifications     So I don’t think there’s anything here that represents any kind of departure  The sample  directive from Mr Broida that we have attached to this memo, February 7, could be used today,  for example, by putting into the blanks in the monetary aggregates formulation the numbers that  we’ve just agreed to  And I think it would be an exact representation of what the instructions to  the Manager have been  And of course, it goes without saying that if the Committee were  prepared to adopt these numerical specifications, the so-called specification sheet would then be  discontinued, and this would be the record     I might note that there were differences, sometimes, about individual words that appear in  this directive language, and you may have noted that Governor Wallich would like, in the case of  the long-term range, to insert the word “target”  The subcommittee decided against that because  that would be a change in practice from what had previously occurred, but Governor Wallich  may wish to speak to that issue  I can’t recall that we had at the end any other differences,  among our subcommittee of four, that call for a [comment] by the members of the  [sub]committee, but if they would like to say something, I certainly don’t mind     Governor Wallich, did you want to say something about the use of the word “target”?     Would the other members of the Committee wish to say anything?  Frank?     John?     Well, as I say, Mr Chairman, it seems to me that that recommendation,  which may have merit on its own, violates the spirit of the exercise here, which was to simply  transfer what we now have into a different and more useful form  So I think it could be  considered by you and by the Committee if it wishes, but it is not a necessary part of the  transference [of] procedures that we have in mind      Well, you know, I must admit that I’m inclined to back away a little from  the use of the word “target” in the case of the monetary aggregates because I’ve always felt that,  as I think the Chairman has stated to the Committee, our target is the performance of the  economy  That is, our objective and the target we have in mind is a meaningfully good  improvement in the performance of the economy  And therefore, the monetary aggregates are  only an instrument toward achieving that     Now, it’s a little difficult, frankly, not to use the word “target” as shorthand when you refer  to these long-term ranges--because they are targets on the assumption that those will produce  economic results that we want  They’re very shiftable targets, and I think this might be  misunderstood when [one calls] them targets  So I don’t think I can go along--at least I feel  uncomfortable about accepting Governor Wallich’s suggestion at this point     Paul, you just voted on it    [VICE  We had a memo from the counsel on this     That’s exactly it      2/15/77 - 39 -            If it were a short-run target, absolutely  It would appear down here in the  operative instruction  Art, I’d forgotten what we had in the longer-run statement  Do we now  use reserves?  We had proposed that, at one point, to carry out the intent of the previous  subcommittee report  That is, it’s a longer-run thing if you look at it; reserves and--     Because we don’t have a specified target, you see     I’m not sure--depending on what we did, it might appear in the long-run  paragraph rather than a short-run paragraph     No, I think we could amend it, you know, and anyway amend their  operation  We would amend the instructions  And as a matter of fact, it seems to me that the  instruction--because it is specific and is what we’ve told the Manager to do--is more amenable to  a modification of [this] kind, than is the case now in our current [specifications]     My guess is that this is just the second time we’ve done that     I think that’s what it would have to say     It’s an instruction to the Manager, not to the Chairman     And maybe take the financing back     There’s a big difference  Unfortunately, the people who comment on this  don’t recognize this--it stirs up concerns     Mr Chairman I have only one question about the report  Let me just  check this with Paul  It’s a nice way of getting rid of these bits and pieces  My recollection was  that the financing bank was originally sold to the agencies as an optional source of financing   That is, it was wasn’t mandatory  For a while, the Treasury wanted to make it mandatory that  the agencies would do the financing with the financing bank  The way it was left, as I recall, it  was optional; they could do it if they wanted to or not do it     So it does suggest as a possibility, you might have some fully guaranteed agency in the  future that doesn’t use the financing bank  It goes out on the market itself, and then we may not     2/15/77 - 45 -           be providing--we could not be considering this, as I understand it, as we would consider another  agency, because of this narrowing, this particular determination we have made  Now, is that  appropriate?     Well, I think you are right  I agree with the thrust that we gave the  financing bank a lot of special support in listing it and putting it into our own assets, and so  forth    Should we move to adopt then?  I so move   SPEAKER(?)  Second  "
319,1977-03-15,"  Probably ranges widely, some years below and some years above   Because I can certainly remember a period in the middle ’60s--they ran consistently above  estimates    Did you say it was $9 [billion] to $10 billion?  Was that for January and  February?    Well, they are paying attention to it, though, Mr Chairman; there is an  effort being made to find out why the shortfall  And I certainly get the impression there’s every  intention to try to remedy the situation  So I think the thrust of what Jerry said--that some of the  shortfall may well be made up in the months to come, and we may well get more strength in  government spending--is [on] a reasonable basis    In total manufacturing    They’ve had annual increases    Well I, of course, don’t have a projection of the economy, Mr Chairman    Oh no, just hunches, and I want to share both Governor Lilly’s and  President Volcker’s concerns  As far as the physical side is concerned, it seems to me the  outlook is very good  In fact, I could make a case that it could be stronger than the staff  projection in the immediate quarters ahead  Not in the second [quarter] so much--you’ve had 8  percent already there, but in the third and perhaps the fourth, based on a real recovery in  investment expenditures, which I think is probably in process now, and also a larger amount of  inventory accumulation, than you have in the projection  So I think the real activity outlook is  quite strong     But as to prices, I must say that I find myself doubtful that the rate of inflation is going to  subside, as in the projection, to 5-1/4 percent, partly because I think food prices may go up more  rapidly than you are still allowing  And also partly because of Governor Lilly’s concern about  industrial materials and the kinds of tensions that may occur there  You have already, in the last  four weeks, raised the nominal GNP projection by 1/2 point--a quarter percent real and a quarter  percent price  You’ve got 8--even a little more real than that--and if you have more price than  that, it really begins to put pressure on the financial system  And I think interest rates could rise  significantly more than is now being projected, and that, of course, will have its GNP impact not  so much this year but in 1978, which I think does make a case for a different profile     Looking out further ahead than you have, Jerry, in your comments, along the lines that  President Volcker was mentioning, I don’t really know what we can do about this, because the  interest rate effect will come if, in fact, we have this kind of inflationary development and  inflationary expectation  And I suppose in the short run almost everybody would be happy to see  stronger real growth in the economy  But I, like President Volcker, see some difficulty in  financial markets as we get to the end of the year, and difficulty in markets which are greatly  affected by credit costs as we go into 1978--such as housing    Year-over-year?    Are there a lot of wage contracts in ’78?    Could I just say to Governor Wallich, it is a question of confidence in the  economy aside from governmental policy  And I do feel that one thing that hasn’t been  mentioned that ought to be mentioned is that I think the confidence in the economy is increasing  rather rapidly, and in particular, confidence in the new Administration is at this point quite high   The surveys show it--a very high proportion of the public approves of the way the President is  doing his job at this point  And I really do think that’s a new factor that needs to be mentioned,  and that in itself could lead to a stronger business rise if it’s not upset  And in coming months,  then one would just argue on the basis of past relationships in macro/micro stimulation    Well, I think we ought to have a summary table in the Greenbook now that  we’re doing them monthly  I think that’s a fairly recent development    ’75    If I may, Mr Chairman, that very point bears on President Morris’s  question, because my thought was that there could be more inventory accumulation than is in the  projection  There could be more plant and equipment, and there could be more inflation  All  that would add to the nominal GNP, and it would also add to the corporate, business financing  need of the year as it went on, so that the consistency of the flow of funds with the current GNP  projection has to be looked at both ways  But also can be stronger     3/15/77 - 16 -            Mr Chairman, is that [pessimism] there because of low farm prices?  Or  high farm prices?       3/15/77 - 18 -            As interest rates go up    Well, I also have a comment about velocity  I’m glad that Bob came back  to it, because it doesn’t seem so far out of line--I think a lot of comments about velocity that I am  hearing relate to M1 velocity, and they don’t take into account what we believe to be the  substitution process  That has been accelerating and may be reaching a level of a stampede   And so I think that we are in some danger here of reasoning on the basis of past relationships,  even making some allowance for them, that still don’t hold  It’s still not relevant because of the  rapid change in the meaning of narrow money supply to GNP       3/15/77 - 19 -           Now I have to admit that I can’t remember much about M2 velocity; perhaps we ought to  have more historical information on that, but I just can’t keep it in mind  But I do think that I  recall the times when M2 and M3 ran up less rapidly because of what Steve said of  disintermediation--rising market interest rates relative to institutional rates--and in which there  must have been increases in M2 and M3 velocity  Paul has got the charts; [do they] show it?    The M2 on President Volcker’s chart projection looks a little stronger on  the rise in velocity, and M3 doesn’t look out of line    Yes, and it seems to me quite possible  I might also say that I also have a  great difficulty with M2 velocity when you remember what’s in M2, that is, when you remember  what commercial bank time deposits have been added in order to make M2  It includes state and  local government deposits, it includes large CDs and nonnegotiable large CDs everywhere; it  includes negotiable CDs in the nonweekly reporting banks; and now it includes consumer  certificates having maturities of four to six years, [which] don’t seem to me to have an awful lot  of moneyness about them  So I am always nervous about this more than M2 velocity, and also  because of those definitional problems    We can’t distinguish between the federal funds and RPs     3/15/77 - 22 -            Federal funds in concept would be borrowed from another bank and thus  would not change total bank credit    --would fall just prior to the refund  I don’t think we saw anything like  that in 1975    Of course, you could have offsets, too  That is, the retailers could build it  up, and it could come out of the manufacturers in the first instance    That was 6 to 10 for March and April--those two months  You want a 6 to  10 range for March-April--before the refund is paid out?    Well, Mr Chairman, I’m in a quandary, really, which I guess results in my  being agreeable to your suggestion  I do think strongly that our problem in the months to come  is going to be overly large monetary aggregates growth and that we’re going to have deal  increasingly with rising interest rates as a prevalent thing to cope with     But on the other hand, up to now, we would have to say the aggregates have fallen short, or  at least that they’ve been on the low side  In particular, in January and February, for example,  M1 was 31 percent, Paul ,well below the lower end of the long-run range  And on M2, although  I never thought that we were going to any place close to the bottom, it’s only 79 for the two  months, which is getting down in the lower half of the range  And, of course, February was  more pronounced in both of those, in terms of a shortfall, than the January-February average   And so it just seems to me we don’t have the financial indicators that would permit us in good  conscience to take a step toward somewhat tighter conditions at this moment     Likewise, I’m nervous about M1  Not understanding why February was so low, but just  being given an explanation by Steve Axilrod, it occurs to me that there may have been some kind  of a temporary inducement to go into RPs or federal funds, in lieu of cash balances, that might be  reversed in this period immediately to come  So that, as [has] happened to us so often, a low     3/15/77 - 29 -           month could be followed by a high month  There’s a considerably erratic growth record in M1,  and I think we may stand a risk of getting a rather high growth rate  I don’t think I could accept  going as high as Bob Black suggests for these two months--6 to 10 on M1--but I could accept  either 5 to 9, which is the alternative B specification, or 4-1/2 to 8-1/2     I think the most important point is that we should not go above the 5 percent funds rate  without having a conscious redetermination that that’s what we want to do  But I think the most  important thing is to leave that funds rate range at 4-1/4 to 5, with the same fuzzy midpoint that  we’ve had before  So I could accept either 5 to 9 or 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 for M1; M2 looks okay  But  the most important thing is to leave the funds rate in that range until we have a solid  demonstration that we ought to go above    Is it true that you need to find this reasonably necessary to the functioning  on the market account?  Can you do that in good conscience with the volume of governments  that are outstanding now?    That’s what this says    That’s one of the major issues  You see, if you’re buying outright and you  have knowledge, why then you are in a conflict-of-interest sort of situation    If you’re dealing in RPs, it’s a financing mechanism  It seems to me you  can very readily just take the market’s judgment for the collateral you accept for the RPs  That’s  one of the reasons I supported the majority view of the [sub]committee rather than Governor  Gardner’s view  "
342,1977-04-19,"  That’s offsetting then--I mean, you’ve got the effect of somewhat lower  interest rates to stimulate, but you have the effect of a lower investment tax credit to hold back    Of course, I don’t suppose the interest rate effect is very large either  The  interest rates are maybe a quarter lower than the other    All you have to do is reverse what Sindlinger says    You did cut back the second quarter consumption increase, didn’t you?    Even though the rebate wouldn’t have been paid out until very late in the  second quarter?    If I might, it seems to me that’s consistent with what you would think the  interest rate effects would be  I imagine you’ve got more housing than you did last time  And  that would fall late this year and early next year because interest rates would be lower than they  would have been had the rebate been paid [by financing out of the market]  I am not sure  I  have not looked at it in detail  Is that right?     I don’t think we ever added anything like that into our projection’s fiscal  package    These are the state data on employment and unemployment    Roger, why didn’t they get CCC [Commodity Credit Corporation] loans?    Why didn’t they get CCC loans?    Well, coming back to the standard projection, you know, I was particularly  impressed by the flow of funds projection that was included in the material that we got over the  weekend  And I note there that on line 2 of table 1, the percentage of GNP of total funds raised  is rising from, it looks like, about 14 percent in the first half of ’76 to roughly the 16 percent  level, which would be consistent with rising interest rates  And I notice on line 13 that  household purchases of credit market instruments on a half-year basis go from negative 4 to an  18 billion, to a 26 billion, to a 38 billion annual rate, which I think is also very consistent with  rising interest rates  Indeed, that may show quite a bit of strain developing, and I suppose there  is a certain amount of circularity in that, but it’s associated with the fact that loans of banks are  growing more rapidly so that they’ll be able to buy less governments  And I guess the same will  be true of the thrifts, that mortgage loans are growing more rapidly, so they’ll be able to buy less  governments  So in effect, the public has got to buy the governments, and that almost always  means rising interest rates, and they would bring them about  So totally ignoring any money  supply analysis, Phil, I think that the flow of funds numbers come to bear out prospects, a  tightening up of--     Well now, the flow of funds numbers are consistent, of course, with the  GNP projection, and that’s the thing you have to ask yourself, whether the GNP projection is  likely to be about right or too low or too high  I can’t find a great deal to argue with in the GNP  projection, except that it seems to me that there might be exposure to a somewhat higher rate of  price increase than is in it  And if there is, why, the nominal GNP rise could be larger than the  staff is projecting, in which case this pressure in the flow of funds would be greater than it’s  being shown to be here  So I think that the probabilities are on the side of more straining in the  markets than is here projected    Well, I don’t think you can be quite that precise about it  But I don’t think  that there’s much variation  If the GNP pattern, as well as the projection, is right, [unintelligible]  so much investment, so much consumption, why of course, the whole thing isn’t generally  consistent and it tends to break up  Now you might have, for example, corporations borrowing  less than Jim has indicated that they would do  But if they do, they’ll buy fewer liquid assets  than Jim has indicated they would buy, and it would tend to net out both sides of the flow  So  there are lots of tricks in this, but I always felt that it was an alternative way of approaching the  question of the possible [unintelligible] of credit markets to money supply analysis  And all I’m  saying is that this strongly suggests to me a tension in markets developing in the projection  period    Well, no, I think the proper figure to look at, Henry, is the credit market  instruments    That’s with squeeze  That’s where they squeeze it  It’s similar to  Solomon Brothers’ residual line in their analysis of supply and demand for funds, I think  Isn’t  that right, Jim?    I don’t think it does very well for level, but it does well for the direction of  change    You say there is an initial price increase of energy, that is not  [unintelligible]    Well, it’s a price-rationing effect--it may not be a supply-inducing effect    Well, I disagree with Larry, and I agree with Bob, except that I feel that  we really shouldn’t make any move at all in the aggregates ranges at this time, in M1, M2, or  M3  First of all, it seems to me that what has happened with regard to the rebate is perceived by  the public and will be perceived by the Congress as a step back from a stimulative program  At  the same time, we also seem to be tightening up monetary policy a little bit  I think that it’s a  very bad impression that would be left because we still do have a great deal of unemployment in  the country  And it doesn’t seem that there ought to be, in all areas of governmental macro  policy, a stiffening at this time     Secondly, although one can agree in principle with getting the ranges down over time, I do  think you have to have enabling conditions  And enabling conditions just aren’t there if one  believes at all in the staff projections  In the staff projections, we have an increase in nominal  GNP over the next year of about 12 percent--some quarters a little higher, some a little lower  I  have criticized the projection as perhaps understated in the rate of inflation that is likely  It  certainly is true that the projection hasn’t taken into the account the energy program, which  would probably raise the rate of inflation to some degree  So it seems to me that we are stuck  with the rate of inflation of at least 5-3/4 and perhaps more over the next year, and we need to  have real growth in the economy so we’ll make some progress in reducing the unemployment  rate over this period     If one looks at the implied velocity figures from the midpoints of the ranges that we have  had, what you find is that we will need to be entering into one of the steepest rises in velocity of  this episode in M1 figures over this next year in order to validate the projection  Far steeper than  has occurred in earlier recoveries and steeper than we’ve had over the past year  It is about a 7  percent increase in velocity required over the year  The interesting thing to me is that it would  also require an increase in velocity of M2 and M3 to validate this staff projection  And, indeed,  I’ve looked at the previous five recoveries, and at this stage in previous recoveries, the velocities  of M2 and M3 have generally declined, not increased, at this stage  That is to say, M2 and M3  have grown more rapidly than the increase in nominal GNP  What shows up on the charts is a  year delayed  The kind of an increase in velocity--again taking the midpoint for M2 and M3--the  kind of an increase in velocity that in past recoveries has stopped the housing route, because if  we look at this recovery versus past recoveries, you also find that housing is still increasing,  whereas it had leveled off and to some extent was declining in previous recoveries     So I think that we already are dealing with very, very restrictive numbers in the Ms relative  to what we expect in terms of the performance of the economy and relative to maintaining a  reasonable, gentle rise in housing starts from this point on  And therefore, the way I see it, we  are going to need the upper end of that range in M2 and M3 in order to make this system work  over the next year  If we were to cut anything, I think it ought to be the lower end of the range  because I don’t think that will be effectively utilized over this time       4/19/77 - 28 -           But I would prefer as a matter of appearance, following right on the heels of the rebate  withdrawal and right on the heels of an energy program that is perplexing the public, I would  prefer to leave the ranges just exactly where we have had them in the last period    Well, I don’t think--maybe I made clear the association that I draw  between the long-range targets and the rebate; it’s partly the impression of increased restraint in  both areas, which I did mention  But in addition, there’s a real effect, and that is, the Treasury  will be borrowing some $10 billion less in the period immediately ahead than they would have  been had the rebate gone through  And so I think we may have a period yet of stable or even  lower interest rates  And there is a good possibility that the time deposit inflows will be quite  strong over that period because of a favorable rate relationship  So my preference because of  that rate relationship, which affects my preference, would be to wait until we can see if pressures  begin to develop, which I think will be [a quarter from now] rather than now, to reduce what will  certainly in the longer run have to be a reduction in the ranges for M2 and M3    Wouldn’t that wash out right away, the tax effects?    No, no, the tax  If people were accumulating for the taxes, now IRS  separates those checks and [the money balances are drawn down]?    Well, I think I would find this acceptable, your suggestion  I think you’re  right  It’s hard to imagine us getting down to 4-1/4 with an April number, but this, I think, is  likely to hold up and be quite a high number  So even if you had indications on a very low May  number, why, putting the two together, the chance [is] that we wouldn’t come down any more  I  would hope that we would use the top half of the range, that is, the 4-3/4 to 5-1/4, as part of the  range, if in fact it doesn’t turn [out] that the aggregates immediately quiet down  Because, I  don’t know, I think it’s a very mysterious business  I can’t quite credit Social Security having  that much effect over the monthly, and I’m a little uncertain about this income tax payment  thing  And it could be that we’ve had an increase here, some durability in the demand for  money, and if we have, we ought to begin to move  And so if we are prepared to use the top half  of the range, I think that’s a little acceptable    No, we didn’t move very much when we got evidence that the aggregates  were beginning to strengthen    What are the two months on M1 Steve?  Are they 13 and 3?    May looks like 3    Yes, but he said that if you came in as high as these numbers, and that  would mean you come in looking like 3 for May    You are going all the way up to 10 before you move?    You and Paul are taking exactly the reverse--    The precision of our language?    That means that you wouldn’t move the funds rate unless M1 was at 10  percent    Below 2    You misunderstood me    The other would mean you would move the funds rate if you were  significantly above 8  "
368,1977-05-17,"  Are these real estate loans, John?  Do they classify them as real estate?    So they are primarily secured by the real estate    Well, people offer more money every day for that property down there and  [unintelligible]  It must give a sense of speculative opportunity--every day the paper has got a  new higher price bid for that urban property    It almost has to be, if you read that footnote  That’s the only thing that  isn’t shown separately      Well, it’s also, if you look at the last column there, the year-over-year is  much less, possibly, than the other component  The other component would have to be  remarkably weak      Well, I want to return to this question of a possible pattern developing  throughout the year  I certainly agree that all of the figures currently look very strong  One can’t  really find anything--except for the concern about the rate of inflation--to be very disturbed about  with the performance of the economy in the last couple of months     But it is also true, as a number [of us] have pointed out, that the configuration could be  something like that of last year  As I recall, retail sales rose strongly in the first few months last  year to a March or April point--I would say a decline, although I think there were a couple of  months of decline, and then [it] leveled out for the next six months  And it wasn’t very long at  all before that had a marked effect on inventory attitudes, in particular  And the question is, is  there enough strength elsewhere in the economy to offset the possibility of that occurring again,  and you have it in a modest degree, in the sense that you’re bringing up the saving rate gradually  over the next couple of quarters, so your increases in consumer spending are less than they have  been running     But it isn’t a leveling off, by any means, that you have  And in that connection, I notice   that the March inventory numbers, I think it was March, really were pretty large  Thirty billion  or 31 billion in the supplement, and that made me wonder about the first quarter GNP numbers   So far, I guess, we’ve just had the Commerce preliminary, and there’ll be a final or semifinal  here in a few days  It could be that that inventory number is already higher than we think it is   Jerry, do you have a view on that?      5/17/77 - 10 -            Yes, but the total is $33 billion; that’s quite a large number      But you do have every line moving up strongly  Except net exports,  which moved up slightly; but everything else is moving up strongly in order to give you this  5-1/2 percent for GNP      But there could well be a pause there; you mentioned new cars  I recall  1955 as a year in which new car sales were extremely strong for a while, and when they fell off,  why there wasn’t really anything  Well, the economy continued all right, but there was a pause  in the sense that there wasn’t anything to take their place    Inventory to services--    But your overall industrial utilization figures are not so high until you get  into next year, I think by the middle of ’78  That’s a pretty high number    A lot of inventory accumulation, and then an 86 percent capacity  utilization rate  But for the time being, you don’t have that overall utilization pressure  And  what Dave said occurred, you have to remember--the effect would be a higher unemployment  rate  In other words, if there were slower real growth  And the question is, What would be a  congressional response to the higher unemployment rate?    You might, yes    From deliverywise?     May I ask, that first-quarter compensation increase had some--was  more--and perhaps you were referring to that, Paul, about the faster compensation rates  But that  had some special factors in it, didn’t it?    Are we seeing a speed-up in the size of contract settlements or nonunion  wages?  Are they accelerating?  Is there anything detectible as yet in the figures on that?    It must be at least 1 percent of payroll    Oh, no, no, on the contrary  The Secretary was asked about that, and he  said that it would have no effects on employment  And then he was asked about the effects on  prices, and he said it would have no effects on prices  And the reason is the business would  absorb costs      I had two questions  First, Mr Sternlight, as you stated in your review,  the adjustment in the market [to] the changes in observed Federal Reserve policy was  remarkably, extraordinarily smooth  Would you say, Peter, that it’s completed?  That is, would  you say, since it was so smooth, is it still partial?  Or, say that the federal funds rate stayed in the  525 to 530 range, where it’s been trading--do you think the market adjustment was not--    --or 535--    And that involved an increase in bills from about 440 to about 5 percent?      --450 to 5 percent  Which brings me to my question to Mr Axilrod   Now this last 50 basis points in bills was really not a segment of the [interest] rate range  competitive with thrift institutions and time and savings deposits  If you have another--and I  guess this is sort of like Phil’s question--if you had another 50 basis point increase, it would be a  much more sensitive increase wouldn’t it, from the standpoint of limiting growth in time and  savings deposit forms?  I think you made that comment in the Bluebook, but you didn’t dwell on  it in here, in your oral comment    And that could be even more so, I suppose, Steve, because we have a  larger proportion in time and savings deposit form now that are really sizable sums  I happen to  divide our categories in savings and time deposits between the consumer type and business or  institutional type, and the consumer type has held up very well through April  The cumulative  increase in consumer-type savings and small certificates is at a 106 percent annual rate through  April  Whereas the other, the residual, that includes large nonnegotiable CDs and things like  that, has dropped off from a 20-25 percent rate earlier to a cumulative of only 9 by April     You have a stock adjustment    And what that’s associated with is another increase in the complex of  market rates of about 50 basis points     5/17/77 - 21 -            Thank you    And it didn’t include April    Or vice versa if it’s toward zero    Well, two things restrain me from moving with anything like as much  alacrity toward monetary tightness as Mark Willes suggests  The first is that in addition to an  inflation objective, we also have the objective of maintaining reasonable growth in the economy,  and the growth rates that are being projected by the staff are not unreasonably high  This  quarter, and I agree that it will be a high quarter, is perhaps a little on the high side  But after  that, even with every considerable strength, as I mentioned before, in each line of the projection,  why we’re talking about a growth rate of around 6 percent or perhaps a shade below, which we  need unless we are to accept this unemployment rate as a permanent thing  And I think it’s too  high, of course, to accept as a permanent thing     So I would argue that the economic situation, which calls for some trade-off between  inflation and growth in the objectives, ought to restrain [us] from being too restrictive, Mark,  until you clearly see a period of excessive growth developing  The second thing, though, that  restrains me a little bit is we have done this twice before  We did it in the spring of ’75, and in  fact the aggregates then came in quite weakly, and we eased off  And we did it a year ago     And the aggregates eased off  But I would rather not go a long way in that  direction until I felt fairly certain this time that the trend was really with us  And I think it  probably is, but then I thought it probably was a year ago, and so I don’t know that I’m much of  a forecaster      No, I don’t think we did, because we did reverse, but I think it’s  something I would prefer not to do if I didn’t--    But in any event, you know, we only have one high month--now, it’s an  awfully high month     5/17/77 - 27 -            But on the other hand, there could well be a negative, which isn’t really  projected in the May-June period, because if one is to use that as a sort of a stock adjustment in  money supply, it may have been overdone  And it may not turn downward  So I think we ought  to be a little cautious for another month or two about going gung-ho toward increased tightness   The Chairman’s suggestion of zero to 4 for the M1 range I think is appropriate  According to my  figures, if the midpoints of the staff’s alternative B projection were realized, the December-to- June increase in the narrow money supply would be 6-1/2, which is right at the very top of our  range  And cutting that just a little bit would make me a bit more comfortable, so I think zero to  4, which I think may well be where we’ll be in May and June, is reasonable     On M2, I think I would go Governor Coldwell’s way and say, well, M2 hasn’t been all that  strong, and therefore we can afford to accept without real concern, say, a 4 to 8, which would  mean that the December-to-June growth would be at the midpoint of our range or even a little  below, if we fell in that range  So that in case there is a snapback in time deposits, and I think  it’s possible, I wouldn’t want to see us tighten if it were in that modest range of 4 to 8 percent     And on the funds rate, I would, as I suggested earlier, argue that the next half [percentage  point] is more important than the last half percent[age point] movement in the rate, and so I think  we ought to be fairly cautious  But a 5 to 5-3/4 strikes me as being a good range, with a 1/4 to a  3/8 midpoint range, which, as I understand it, is about where we are--we’re probably a little  above a quarter, so we’re probably not quite at 3/8  And so a 1/4 to 3/8 is about a  characterization of current condition     But unless we continue to get unusual growth in the aggregates, which we may, I don’t feel  I’d want to make a really major move in our posture, and so it’s only in that case, which would  call for a special wire, that I would want to see [us] go above 5-3/4 in this next--I guess it’s a  five-week interval before the next meeting, is that right?  It is a five-week interval, so we have a  little longer time to make  But it may call for a wire, but I would want to stop and consider  before we went above 5-3/4    It keeps the price up    Is that 150 from here, Henry?    Is there anybody left in Atlanta?  "
405,1977-06-21,"  Is the increase in the saving rate larger on the model than it is in the--     6/21/77 - 4 -          Jerry, I was surprised how pessimistic your comments were regarding  prices  I was surprised because I’m not that pessimistic, obviously  But I wonder whether what  you’re picking up in the GNP forecast, and second quarter forecast in particular, isn’t a reflection  of past increases, principally in food prices  If you look at wholesale prices of industrial  commodities, the rise is slowing  That’s particularly true at the raw stage of industrial  commodities, but it’s also true of industrial commodities as a group  Indeed the [total] wholesale  price index was up quite a lot less in May than before  And I know that the sensitive industrials  in our weekly index have been declining in the last couple of months  That’s just a few items,   but perhaps indicative of reduced pressure in the market     And if you look at the hourly earnings index, why it seems to me the performance is really  pretty good  Year over year [in May], the increase was 69 percent; [for the] month, the increase  was a 57 [percent annual rate]  But this far into a recovery, it seems to me that that’s a pretty  good performance for wages, and it implies that unit labor costs are not, at least at this point,  accelerating, looking through the bobbles you get up and down       6/21/77 - 6 -         I assume that the forecast you have given us is largely based on higher food prices  But  even there, the impression I had is that the agricultural situation is better, rather than worse, than  it was a couple of months ago in basic terms, because it’s rained, and the wheat’s coming in, and  that kind of thing  It might have some temporary effect in holding back meat animals and things  like that in the market and give you a little increase in prices But sort of fundamentally, as I look  at the picture, it’s improved in the last two or three months with regard to the price outlook,  rather than deteriorated  Are you going to comment on that?      6 to 12     But there we’ve been reading of reductions    Isn’t that a favorable factor?  To limit or possibly prevent the increases  that otherwise would have occurred--[that’s] an improvement, isn’t it?    I was referring, Mr Chairman, more than anything else, to the pessimistic  tone of Jerry’s comments about the worsening in inflation  Simply all that the--    If I may suggest a different explanation, it is that there has not been a  deterioration in the inflation outlook that we did not previously foresee; the amount of increase,  particularly in food prices, that [we] did not build in  [resulted from] the winter and the early  spring drought and that kind of thing--and, indeed, that fundamentally there really has not been  [an underlying] deterioration  At least that would be what I would submit on the basis of my  reading of the figures    Well, they could, but they haven’t yet    As you know, the problem that I have with that is that the last quarter in  the series includes the minimum wage increase and the increase in Social Security taxes  I think  it tends to give you an overly high reading for this most recent--    That is in the Southeast  I think--you were talking about the New York  attitudes, and Dave, Philadelphia  It may be a reason how effective some [unintelligible]    The first quarter could have had a lot of oil in it    Of course, the level of ’76 was much higher than the level of ’75    [Unintelligible] $40 billion in total profits [unintelligible]    Well, Mr Chairman, I just wanted to set the record straight  Although I  was a little critical of the comments on inflation that Jerry had, I think that the staff projection is  very defensible; and in general terms, the 5-1/2 percent increase in real GNP looks to me quite  supportable on the basis of the sector  The state and local spending outlook is vastly improved   Not only because of the federal transfers but also because of much better revenues as the  recovery has proceeded     I agree with you on plant and equipment  I think it looks pretty strong, and strengthening  for the foreseeable future  And with that it seems to me would go increased inventory  accumulation  So about the only black spot that the economy is likely to have, as I see in the  forecast period, is in durable goods sales to consumers, in particular, automotive sales    Well, I think probably most of the deterioration is over in foreign trade  It  may not be that there [will] be much improvement, but probably there won’t be much [further]  deterioration at this point  But we should expect to see car sales level off or even decline after  this period of extremely strong demand, and that will be associated with the rise in the saving  rate  But I think the other factors in the economy will overcome the phenomenon     The difference between 5-1/2 percent in the forecast for the year ahead and 5 is not very  great  I really don’t know that I could choose between them  I guess I’m inclined to think that 5  is a little weak, but in any event, if it’s 5 or 5-1/2, it’s still in the range of continued expansion at  a reasonable rate  And I think that’s what we ought to keep our eye on     Now, one other comment--although I’m not as critical of models as the Chairman--it is true  that the models very often, for short periods, are quite wrong  And the fact that our model  delivers lower business fixed investment doesn’t surprise me  It [has done so] repeatedly, and  it’s delivered a high one repeatedly  It’s just that it’s [based on] an average experience, and it  just doesn’t seem to work too well in short-period forecasting  And the fact that the model has  lower consumption than [does the] judgmental [forecast]--[that phenomenon] has occurred, as I  remember, repeatedly over the last several years  So there’s nothing terribly unusual about that   So I would not use the fact that it’s a model to give it added importance or added weight; it needs  to be taken into account, but I don’t think it deserves added emphasis for that reason    The stock market, I think, is probably having quite an effect--    Pardon?    Yes, except that that looks so unreasonable, doesn’t it, to see that the first  half has been going on at a very substantial pace, and then all of a sudden you have this slump   It just doesn’t seem very likely, you know, that it would be the way things would work  out--especially since, as the Chairman said, none of the other figures you would look at support  the idea of a marked, almost immediate slowing in the rate of increase in capital spending   Which is what you’d have to have for that Commerce survey to come off     But both could be consistent with not expecting a boom--    --a willingness to invest in long-term instruments and holding away from  the stock market    He thinks steel and autos are well ahead of their [projected production]  and so on    Those are for the second quarter?    [Unintelligible] It seems to me there’s one last week--     6/21/77 - 21 -          At higher prices    Do they have to buy them themselves if we don’t approve?    Well, is this seasonal?  You’ve had two occasions--two different weeks  and two different months, and the third one is coming up  Now, the two seem to go the same  direction, so do you already bet and change the seasonal?  What if the third one doesn’t happen?     It won’t happen, of course, in the same month  It only happens when, as I  understand it, the first of the month is a weekend      Exactly, or the number of trade days in a month     That’s for the month  I think Frank’s talking about the first week    Well, I think Paul’s got the right idea; you just emphasize it in the  statement  If you start to adjust your statistics ad hoc, there is a question of credibility  “Why  are you doing that?  Because you didn’t want to show a large increase?”    Well, I know, but I have always been a little nervous about that      6/21/77 - 27 -          Well, I would suggest that we might discontinue the seasonally adjusted  weekly figure as of the first week of July and give this as a reason  There are so many odd  things affecting that seasonal pattern, that we are going to stop seasonal adjustment      No, for permanently, of the seasonally adjusted weekly figures     You can’t discontinue the unadjusted figures  Freedom of information  requires--    You’d get a court case    Well, I am in agreement with your proposal, Mr Chairman  I think it  would be a good time to stand still because it isn’t altogether clear to me which way we are  going to be going from this point  There are a few signals in the economy that are a bit  bothersome  On the other hand, it seems to me the bulk of the evidence is that we’ll have  continued substantial expansion  Also, I think if you look at alternative B’s ranges--M1, 3 to  7--well, assuming June is right, at about 2 percent, that means M1 below 4 in July would get you  below the lower limit  Now 4 is not such a disturbingly low figure  And so I think it’s set about  right  And on the other side, to get 7, you would need to have quite a large increase in the month  of July  Now it is possible, so I think that these are very good outer bounds of the tolerability we  ought to have for what might seem to be developing as we go into the early summer     I’m inclined to think it ought to be a money market directive because of the very narrow  band on funds, and also because of this uncertainty we have about the month of July with the  technical factor that was discussed before, and with the question of how much rebound there will  be  And that would leave open the possibility of a special meeting or a special wire if, in fact,  July developed very unusually in terms of the aggregates  So I would take exactly the specs you  suggested, but I would prefer a money market directive    Yes, I thought it was a reasonable suggestion    Will we reconvene as the FOMC?    Well, one wonders whether the dollar shouldn’t appreciate    Yes, if you take out the OPEC countries, I think you still find the  deterioration    Well, if you break up the world into enough separate spots, you’re going  to find some place you’re in balance with      Did you say, Alan, that money market conditions were easing in  Germany?    Do you think it was a special thing?      One transaction    Would you start off by saying what we are doing at the moment, Alan?    Whether or not the account needs to have that reserve [drain]?     6/21/77 - 42 -          But that would have a reserve impact, Paul  It’s no different than dealing  for the System Open Market Account    [Unintelligible] right away, like you would if you bought bills for it    That’s finished?    How do you distinguish doing it for the foreigner and not for a US  government agency?  Let’s say the Home Loan Bank Board would like you to start investing its  money    Though, of course, you are talking about a billion and a half, if I  understand, and that’s a very large operation    We haven’t sent them a circular offering--     6/21/77 - 45 -         SPEAKER(?)  But I think we did make some for the postal--    The RP market’s not much different    And yet, you see, I’m concerned about the domestic operations effect   First of all, within the last five weeks, I testified on behalf of the Board’s support on this  Treasury investment process, emphasizing the fact that it was very difficult for us to have to deal  with all these Treasury balances moving in and out and the offsetting open market operations   Superficially, I fail to see the distinction between that and the difficulty that the foreigners could  cause for us by our having to engage, in effect, [in] open market operations     Secondly, I recall, Alan, that you were having trouble with Venezuela some years back   That it was hard to lay out that money that they wanted to invest  That was before the Treasury  had decided to bring all its money into the Fed, and so you didn’t have that scale of operations   Now if the Treasury moves back to its previous situation--and apparently this Venezuelan thing  has spread, so that it’s now quite general that people are doing the RPs--first of all, what’s the  defense?  Isn’t that just the opposite of what you said you wanted to avoid in the case of the  Treasury?  Secondly, couldn’t it cause us some days when [we would have] considerable  difficulty laying all that out    And they’re just repetitive    Yeah, get the money out of the account, that’s all    And that could still go ahead    Any secured government loan  That’s the issue isn’t it?    And that would have to be the Fed of New York   SPEAKER(?)  No, the System Open Market [Account]    It’s clearer, I think, for the System Open Market Account, but then I am  bothered at doing things in the System Open Market Account that aren’t called for as a monetary  policy action    This is not--we wouldn’t be indicating a preference for one of the three  I  have trouble with your dealing as principal with the Committee    May I also understand, Mr Chairman, that the proviso that Alan added,  which is that if there is ever any difficulty, interference with open market operations, he will  immediately bring it to our attention?  "
430,1977-07-19,"  With a differential in price increase of about 4 percent, I guess    About a 4 percent difference in price increase, I would guess    And a 14 percent depreciation    I might say, I agree with you, Mr Chairman, and I also think that it’s not  clear to me that it isn’t US official policy to let the mark and the franc and other countries with  balance of payments surpluses as current account surpluses rise against the dollar, so I am not at  all sure that it would be--without a great deal more checking--appropriate for us to intervene in  any sizable scale  Because I’m not quite sure of the US policy    That’s the opposite side of the plan    Well, there’s been over $3 billion on interventions     7/19/77 - 7 -      I might just note that, when you speak of massive intervention, that is a  residue from a previous massive intervention with the support of the Treasury  Still paying it  off, six years later    You have supportive business inventory numbers, as I read it    You have supportive business inventory numbers  That is, you don’t have  any collapse in inventory accumulation at any point  But it isn’t contributing in an algebraic way  very much more to the growth in GNP    What about the inflation rate?  What’s the inflation rate that’s assumed?   Is it the projection?    Until the 34th comes around    That was a 1 percent difference?    May I ask a question about capacity utilization?  I know the projected rate  of utilization reaches around 88 percent by the end of the projection period--that is, the fourth  quarter of 1978--877 for materials and 883 for all manufacturing  And the unemployment rate  is still 6-1/4 percent or thereabouts  Now what I wonder is, what kind of pressure that capacity  utilization rate would imply in light of what seems to be an Administration program for  continuing to have growth through the ’70s--that is, until 1981--on the order of 5 to 5-1/2  percent?  Does this imply that we’ve reached capacity bottlenecks long before we get the  unemployment rate down to the objectives, in your view?    Quite a bit, this is 87, this is 88    You’re 5 points below    Which would have implications for the rate of inflation    You mean 6-1/4 might be a pretty good rate of unemployment?     7/19/77 - 12 -      Although I haven’t heard anything here in the city that would suggest  acceptance of that    Going back to the mid-60s--    If you went back to the mid-60s    Well, I see no reason why it can’t be done in the same way the flow of  funds table is done, except to make it just once a quarter  But I would be opposed to giving  much Committee time to it, because I don’t think those figures are worth anything  I mean I  think that the aim of the Committee [as has been explained], properly, is to get the minimum  tolerable growth in the monetary aggregates, and that really doesn’t have to do with projecting a  year or two or three ahead  It is a question of what you can get in the way of minimizing  monetary aggregates over a period of time and still have an acceptable economic performance   And that depends on velocity, as the Chairman has so often said, and we have found that we are  not able to predict the demand function--I believe that’s what Jim said--well enough to make any  difference between 4 and 5 and 6 percent, say, growth rates on M1  So I wouldn’t want to see  much time spent on it in the Committee    I think Paul’s point is still that the staff can give you the schedule that’s  good for all time on what 1 percent [more] or 1 percent less of the money supply will do one  year, two years, three years out in terms of real GNP and the price deflator    That is, if you’re just reading the model  Now, we used to try to adjust the  model  We never did present to the Committee just the econometric model  If you go to the  econometric model, which I think is really all that can be done now [given] the state of the  information we have, why, it will give you the same answer every time    I think it’s meaningful in the sense that I expressed it earlier  We are  trying to probe to see what is the minimum rate of growth we can achieve  And I think, in that  sense, you do have, indeed, ranges of choices of the kind that are shown in A, B, C, and D   Except for D, there’s not very much difference between them    To clear this up, Jerry, they standardize inventory change in the GNP, but  the book-value figures are not standardized--    --and so the inventory-sales ratio is reflecting--in addition to a lag, say, at  the time that Ernie is speaking of--changes in the mix, that is, changes as you get more and more  LIFO firms and fewer and fewer FIFO firms; there would be a drift--    What I think Jerry was saying [unintelligible] quarterly report from the  annual report    You think that’s really biting?  I’ve been saying that for 20 years    In the last two or three or four years?    We sure did    About $10,000 you say?    The difference in price    So you trade down by buying a used house instead of a new one  That’s  your point, isn’t it?    You haven’t got good projections if it’s a Board model    Because it has been off for years    Not quite    Well, as I look at the projection of quite regular increases in real GNP, I  guess I have something of the same feeling that Governor Coldwell does, that the patterns may  differ considerably from what’s been projected  And I’m reminded, as I often am, of Governor  Shepardson’s complaint that the lines on the right-hand side of the chart when showing  projections are very steady, and on the left-hand side of the chart they are very jiggly  And I  think there is some truth to that, that this pattern is undoubtedly not going to materialize over the  next six quarters     But when you look at the average, which is a 54 [percent rate of growth] on real GNP over  the next year, and a I guess a little less if you put in the last two quarters of ’78, I don’t find  myself able to come up with a figure that I think is a lot more responsible than that  I think the  staff correctly has pointed to state and local spending as a source of growing strength in the     7/19/77 - 28 -    economy  That has been almost totally neglected by the private forecasters, and I think that is  something that will have a real impact in this period to come  I am rather in agreement with  Governor Jackson that car sales probably won’t hold up  But on the other hand, the staff already  has a saving rate rising to around 6 percent, and it seems to me that’s a reasonable kind of  projection  So all that lower car sales would mean in that context perhaps is less car sales and  more soft goods sales, restoring some balance, as often has happened, to the market that is  greatly affected when people go out and buy hard goods  And I also think that the outlook for  plant and equipment spending is probably one of sustained strength, though how high the figure  will go is very difficult to say     There are some sources of real concern to me in the outlook  I’m concerned about  insufficient capacity as we move ahead because I don’t believe that a 6-1/4 percent  unemployment rate is a satisfactory target  And I think we need to get more capacity on stream,  [but] I’m afraid that it’s just not going to get there in time  I’m also very bothered by the  international picture  I can’t quite put my finger on how it’s going to affect the US, but I feel  that the economies around the world are tending to slip, rather than improve  And I think that’s  going to have some effect on the United States before we are done  The exact path that it will  take, I can’t be certain of  The traditional path would be that we would import more and export  less and thus have a worse balance of trade  In addition, there could be a path that runs through  financial relationships that would result from poor business activity abroad  And I’m not sure  about that     So I think there are problems in the outlook farther ahead  But for the moment I’m not  concerned about the leveling off of retail sales, about the tendencies, perhaps, to a pause that we  are going to have in the economy  I think the basic thrust is still upward, and it’s reasonably  well based  So I guess that’s a long story to say that I guess, on average, I would support the  staff’s projection    Well, Mr Chairman, I didn’t find the staff projection of the economy  objectionable  I think the 5-1/2 percent rate of growth over the next year in real terms is about  right  I wouldn’t mind it drifting off a little bit as we go through the period and into the latter  part of ’78, and I think, indeed, that that probably is likely to occur  And in the second half of  ’78, the staff did have a lower rate of growth, and so I think that that’s about the proper  performance to seek in the economy, given the need to keep as much pressure as possible off of  price inflation while achieving some further gradual reduction in the unemployment rate     And that was based on an M1 expansion expected at 5-1/2 percent, which I guess is the  midpoint of what we now have  And that, also, I presume, was based on expansion in M2 and  M3 of more like the figures that we now have and some other considerations  So the fact that  there was an overshoot in the second quarter, it seems to me, has already been taken account of  in the staff projection  However, if you do want, Dave, to consider that there was an overshoot  in the second quarter, shouldn’t we also consider that there was an overshoot in the first quarter?   And you know, where do you stop in putting together these undershoots and overshoots?  We’ve  been perhaps fortunate  Perhaps it’s the way of the instrument that we tend to have alternating  periods of overshoots and undershoots, which brings me to the position I would take       7/19/77 - 38 -     If it so happened that we now have an undershoot in M1 in the third quarter, and perhaps  for the remainder of the year, I wouldn’t mind that in order to adjust for what happened in the  second quarter  And therefore I can buy the Chairman’s proposal that the lower end of the M1  range be dropped to 4 percent  But on the other hand, I think it’s very dangerous to reduce the  upper end of the range from 6-1/2 to 6 because it’s conceivable that we will in fact be developing  a good deal of pressure in the system in the period to come and a good deal of upward pressure  on interest rates  So I think it would be a shame now for us to be postulating a range of M1  growth that we won’t in fact be able to achieve     And that’s a distinct possibility, though I can’t quote the odds  There are inflationary  factors in the economy  We do have an energy program  The staff does have a $350 per barrel  tax [on oil] going on next January 1  We may wring our hands about the minimum wage  increase, but the chances are that there will be a minimum wage increase in the first of the year   And these are things that monetary policy can’t very well do away with by running tighter   Indeed, I think that, probably, if you try to run tighter as exogenous factors are causing upward  price pressures, you’ll just get more upward interest rate pressure, more strain in the system, and  a lower real performance in the economy in the period to come     So I think it would be a mistake to reduce the upper end of the M1 range at this time  I  also think a case can be made that M3 should be reduced; it’s probably a little too high  But I  dislike the idea of reducing M3 all by itself, that is, without changing M2, because that means  you now are, in a way, bringing about a lower growth in the thrifts and in home mortgages  I  just don’t think that that’s a very good thing to postulate all by itself, and I think the Chairman is  right that [M3] is not operational anyhow, in any real sense of the word  So it seems to me that  the cost of reducing the M3 range exceeds the benefits to be gained by the cosmetic purity of  having done that  So I would accept exactly what the Chairman proposed in terms of projected  growth rates, but I would be very reluctant to accept anything else    I think it would be the alternative C figure, Mr Chairman; 7 to 10    It might be [unintelligible]    Bob’s figure gives the same midpoint--    Yours [Mr Coldwell’s] would be lower    I might just say, Mr Chairman--Larry [Roos], the first quarter was an  undershoot  It could very well be that the third quarter would be an undershoot  If it is, a quarter  from now we’ll be meeting, and we’d be looking at how to evaluate an undershoot  I mean,     7/19/77 - 46 -    you’re basing everything on the second quarter as if that was the exactly right base number  I  don’t think there’s that basis really    Most everybody made payment the next day, didn’t they?    Did you allow for any shift from M2 to M3 on account of the wild card?    You did not make any allowance  Well, I’m not [unintelligible] that these  people were great buyers, that they were shopping for the best way, if they can get a better way  than this    Well, Mr Chairman, I would have rather done it the other way around   That is, I think it is time to have a monetary aggregates directive because the special  circumstances of early July are over  But I think there is some uncertainty about what the  aggregates are doing and certainly about what aggregates tend to do  I note that we have a July  projection of 7-1/2 percent, which would require, with your suggested range, a quite low August  in order to stay within  I note also, [with] Governor Jackson, that we don’t know quite what the  wild-card experience is going to be  And so we might consider using this occasion to broaden  the ranges for M1 and M2  In particular, I would have suggested 3 to 8 for M1 and 6 to 11 for  M2, and then I think we could use the whole 1 point funds range, 5 to 6  I would like to see us  begin to have a little wider funds rate range when we use a monetary aggregates target     The other point, the reason I reduced the lower end of both those ranges, all the way down  to 3 [for M1], is that I think the sense of the Committee, as I got it this morning, was that we  would welcome some weakness or some undershoot  We wouldn’t really want to move as much  as we would against strength on the other side    Well, that’s only 3/8 from where it is now, and we would only be [moving  there] in the case you were validating a 3 percent M1 for July-August  And you’re going in with  a 7-1/2 percent estimate for July; if that were realized, what would that mean--a minus for  August    But if we have a negative August--in a situation where the economy  seemed to be flat or weakened, well, I just--I can live with what you proposed, but I would have  thought that this might be a time to broaden those ranges    Regardless of any information we have received?  "
456,1977-08-16,"  You bought $77 million--is that what it amounts to in the market?  You  got rid of the $35 [million]    How much had you sold earlier?    But you haven’t quite recouped your position, I suppose    I think that’s full exchange    You said five new office buildings in Cleveland?    Well, Mr Chairman, I think I agree with Frank Morris that we’re likely to  have a quarter or two here of considerably less rapid growth in the economy, for much the same  reasons that he gives  I think that retail sales are showing signs of sluggishness  You can’t  really anticipate that durable goods spending by consumers, which has been extraordinarily high,  will rise  It’s more likely to fall in the period to come  Consumer credit has been rising at a  rapid rate, and historically, you follow periods of rapid growth in consumer credit with periods  of lesser growth as you get an adjustment in people’s appreciation of their debt service burden  and what they can take on  And so I think, as far as the consumer surveys are concerned, it’s  been pretty well demonstrated that what a consumer survey represents is what people feel like  now rather than what they will be doing in the future  They have not been very good forecasters  of the behavior at any time that I’ve been aware of in recent years  So I think maybe we’ll have  this quarter, certainly, perhaps two quarters, Frank, of considerably slow growth  And less than  the staff is projecting but more like 3 percent to 4 percent annual rate of growth       8/16/77 - 11 -           However, I don’t feel badly about the business situation because I think that underlying  this is the prospect of continued gains in 1978  I don’t really see any evidence that recovery is  going to come to an end anytime soon  I’m very impressed by Willis’s comments about building  in the commercial area  I think that’s about to take hold  There’s been a lot of indication on that  in Washington, too, by the way  Washington has got quite a bit of building that’s in the works,  both office building and shopping center construction  And I think capital spending is going to  be moving up  I don’t think profits are as bad as they’ve been suggested to be in earlier  comments here, and I don’t think there is the prospect that business will be responding as they  see more certainty that markets will take up the product that they might be able to produce with  new plants  So capital spending will be on the run     The stock market is a puzzle to me, because that certainly does seem to suggest that ’78  wouldn’t be a good year, at least not a booming year, and very possibly a beginning of a  recession  But I think there that we have to make an adjustment for perceptions that the capital  gains tax may be changed  You mentioned that Dave and I think it’s a very important thing   Anybody who has got a profit of size in a stock position, in order to play it safe, is likely to want  to realize some or all of that profit in a year in which capital gains taxes are still being treated in  the conventional way  And anybody who anticipates there may a push on that, that is, to [raise]  the capital gains tax later this year, is going to want to move in advance of that news so that he  can beat the market  And so the whole market will move in advance of a real prospect that that  might occur  And I think that, by itself, is a pretty substantial reason for explaining the  performance of the market in the last several months, when it’s been moving pretty steadily  downward  So that’s a level-adjustment type thing and it doesn’t really indicate anything about  future profits prospects or future business activity prospects; it’s simply a stock adjustment in a  capital value to reflect something that may happen in the future     So as I say, Mr Chairman, I think that there aren’t serious imbalances in the economy,  except perhaps a little overspending by consumers  We will have capital spending picking up as  time goes on  I think government purchases, federal and state and local, which have been rather  weak for the last two years, are going to be a source of considerably greater strength in the  period to come  And so even though we do have in prospect a quarter or two of lesser real  growth, I still think that the business recovery is alive and well and will be continued in ’78 and  that we ought to think in terms of that continued expansion as we try to develop policy  prescriptions    I agree with Governor Coldwell, by the way  I should have said that I  don’t think it’s a bad thing--the profile that’s developing    Was ’75 an up year?    Well, there are a lot of things going on in the market, of course, Phil  I  was just referring to a new incremental factor  Now there [are] certainly many individuals that  have got sizable profits in stocks like IBM, Xerox, and, you know, the high flyers of yesteryear,  even though they’re down from their peaks  I wouldn’t think that the gains would be nearly as  sharp in small companies because they’ve had an indifferent performance for quite a few years   But at the same time, I agree with you that the professional, the institutional investor, is tending  to grow more into fixed[-income] securities so that there isn’t anybody there really to buy up the  individual sales in the growth stocks except the companies themselves, which may buy their  [own] stocks because of the fact, as Ernie said, it’s the best place they can put their money    Expansion to continue   SPEAKER(?)  At what rate    At any rate    Significantly lower    Faster rate    Over the past year    Would you say that the market is adjusted to a 6 percent funds rate, or is  that process still going on?    Once they think the move is complete, why, they would tend to restore  [unintelligible]--or at least cover their position    What was the bill rate yesterday in the auction?    567    That’s the first quarter, but it has no reflection--    This 7 percent inflow to the thrifts--compared to what?  It’s been coming  in around 12    ’76 or ’77?    But it’s mainly just a question of adding in some of the items into which  substitution has occurred    You’re taking 100 percent of that  People wouldn’t have thought you  ought to take 100 percent because there were probably also some diversions in the market into  those points?    Might I ask, Mr Chairman, what did M1 do on an unadjusted basis in  July?  Do you know, Steve?    I thought for sure he would have the figures    I think it did, too--    Yes    Look at it over the next several months    You would expect borrowing to go up then     [Unintelligible]    Well, Mr Chairman, I have mixed emotions today  I’m troubled by the  increase in various defined aggregates because I think that I am rather in agreement with what  Dave Eastburn said, that we’re in the process working on a record that’s going to show growth  well above our limits in the narrow money supply, and perhaps even in M2, which has been  pretty strong over this most recent period  We had a surge in April, and then May and June  looked nice and quiet  And we had a surge again in July, that’s the second [unintelligible]--  whatever Bob Mayo’s analogy is  And [it] looks as if August and September are going to be  quiet  But the result of it is that you get a second quarter that’s large and a third quarter that’s  large  And so I’m troubled by it     Now your alternative definition [of M1] I think tends to show that we’ve had pretty  accommodative growth throughout the period rather than that we had slowing more recently,  [which is] why we get an adjusted money supply that is up quite sharply over the last 15 months  or so  So I’m worried about it  I don’t know, maybe we shouldn’t have an M1 target, but we do,  and the market makes quite a bit of it, and we make quite a bit of it and the need to reduce it over  time, and so forth; and so there is a credibility question here  And there also is a possibility--if  we use it as an index of monetary growth, imperfect as it is--that we’re going to have excessive  monetary growth in this period     On the other hand, I would note to the Committee that we’ve had a considerable increase  in short-term interest rates  If you look at chart 3 in the Bluebook, you can see that the funds rate  was very stable at about 4-5/8 in the early months of this year  It rose 3/4 [point] abruptly in late  April and May to the 5-3/8 range, and now it’s risen abruptly another 5/8 [point] in the last day  or two, to 6 percent  So we’ve had an increase of almost 1-1/2 [percentage points], and it takes  us into new high ground on this particular economic recovery     We have a bill rate that, it seems to me, if it has just a little more adjustment in it, Peter, is  increasingly threatening flows to the intermediaries, and we haven’t quite seen what that would  be  I have a perception that the market may not yet quite have adjusted to the 6 percent funds  rate, which is going to be a signal to the market, as Governor Jackson just pointed out to me,  quite clearly--if not now, [then] on Friday--when the publication of the Record of Policy Actions  will include the telegram and will show that the Committee adjusted its target to a high of 6  percent if there continued to be strong growth in the aggregates  So that 6 percent is certainly  going to be established in the market’s mind and there may be some further adjustment in rates  to that     I think it’s probably true, since I agree with Frank that GNP is not going to go up so fast in  the second half of this year  But the demand for money will be a little less than the staff  probably is projecting in this period  And so I think we won’t have the pressures that I would  anticipate if we use the staff’s projection of the second half GNP  And therefore, I would rather  like to see us pause for a bit and observe the situation     So I like the funds rate centered on 6 percent, say 5-3/4 to 6-1/4  I think that we should be  tolerant of a shortfall in money growth, either in M1 or M2, if we should get one, and I would  have chosen as my ranges, 0 to 5 for M1 and 3 to 8 for M2  It [would] keep a fairly high upper     8/16/77 - 42 -           end, open the range a little bit, and indicate, I think clearly, that we would have some tolerance   And, unless we get unusual growth or unusual shrinkage in the monetary numbers, [it would]  emphasize the stand-pat character for a few weeks here while we see what happens in the market  and let the forces regroup  I would also shift to a money market directive this time    Paul, may I clarify  Now you said you would have a funds rate range of  up to 6-1/2  That would technically mean that you would raise the funds rate conceivably from  its present 6 to as high as 6-1/2 with a monetary growth of 5 percent in M1 and an 8 percent in  M2  That is to say, you gave as your example, where the instructions were not consistent, which  would call for a wire or a telephone meeting or something, but then you incorporated that within  your funds rate range  Did you mean to do that?    That’s not the rule, I think  Exactly    Funds rate    A half, did you say?    I think its 3-1/2; [that is], 1-1/2 to 3-1/2 would be a zone of indifference,  [and at] 3-1/2 to 5 you would begin to move    That’s what I think  I would use the money market directive, Mr  Chairman  Because we are taking aggregates that are deliberately low in their range compared  with what our staff is projecting    Some years ago    Well, I think what we did was put out a number of them at one time    And it had been a six-year lag, but that made it a five-year lag  And that  they’ve communicated with you sensibly on the various things that could be deleted and so  [forth]     8/16/77 - 61 -            Shortly after the next coming year    The letter said they’ll get them in January    Out of court    I would say, I also am concerned about the arbitrariness of this  But let  me be pragmatic, which I think Larry was trying to be earlier  If we can avoid a court suit in  which we have to defend the arbitrary five years, we can avoid it  I don’t really care how we  avoid it  And so, if a discussion with the New York Times should lead to an indication that they  would press this, fine  If they want to press it in court, I think the Committee has a fair amount  to lose because this is exceedingly arbitrary  There is no telling what might flow from it in terms  of court decisions    Well, that’s what I said, that’s the pragmatic way    And that’s really quite recently--    Quite recently--    Well, Steve, if I might, the FOMC in 1972 did not know there would be  five years for sure before the Memorandum of Discussion was released  We had discussions in  that period  The Chairman remembers that, and we didn’t know whether five years or, well,  three years; the decision was made to take five and try it awhile  There was a sense of  movement, I think    The consensus of the Committee is that we should not depart from the  rule    I think 72 facts should not be worth very much    If we could count on it  Things have changed so much since we made that  decision, and now I would [not] put that much confidence in it    Generally consistent with what?    I’m sure not going to vote on that side if they sue us  "
483,1977-09-20,"  Seconded     9/20/77 - 2 -    Well, Mr Chairman, I have a couple of comments  First, I’m very  agreeable to your view of the current situation, that with the continued expansion in final  purchases through the summer--and as far as I can see, right up to date--we don’t have to be  overly concerned about the signs of slowing of the economy that show in such things as output  and employment  Probably a temporary thing  It might be [a] faulty seasonal or it might be that  we are having, as you pointed out before, a little inventory correction of the sort that would  occur repeatedly over this period  So I’m not nearly as concerned about a downturn in the  economy as I was a year ago, when I think it was a more moot point, since retail sales were so  weak at that time       9/20/77 - 14 -   Therefore, the current situation, I think, is adequate  I thought Jim gave a very persuasive  briefing, and I have difficulty in complaining about it or quarrelling with it, but of course that’s  our job, I think  And so I would--    Well, I was going to make the point about consumption generally  As I  look at possibilities of the projection being too high, it seems to me that an awful lot is being  asked of the consumer  If I understood you, Jim, you said you have a projected real increase in  consumption of about 4-1/4 percent above the trend    And that’s above the long-run trend    It’s a rather good performance in real consumption    Annual rate of 4-1/4  That’s strikes me--as I recall [how] the last few  years have been--a pretty good number following on what has been an unusual surge on durable  goods purchases  I’m not so sure--I think I would be more inclined to agree with Frank than  you, Steve  I think [we] probably won’t repeat the current car year next year, partly because of  the high level of consumer debt  Also, you have prices going up a little faster overall, and I  presume for the consumer sector, so they are not only financing real purchases of goods but they  are also financing larger inflation, and the saving rate is rising over the period  It seems to me an  awful lot, somehow, to have more real consumption, more price inflation, and more personal  saving altogether  The arithmetic, of course, checks out--that is, the income is there  But I  would point out that if, of course, the consumption didn’t occur, the income wouldn’t be there,  and the saving rate wouldn’t necessarily be any higher  I’m a little troubled by the strengthening  in the consumption sector     I also note that exports seem to me to be rather strong  The increase I’ve just calculated  from third [quarter] to third [quarter] is 13 percent in exports of goods and services, and there is  a 6 percent inflation there  It’s a real [rate] of about 7  My perception of the international  economy is more like Alan’s--that is, of considerable weakness--than it is like that of the staff  here  So I suggest, perhaps, the exports wouldn’t do as well as we had projected here       9/20/77 - 15 -   On the other side, it seems to me that a possible area of greater strength than we foresee is  business investment  Now you only have a 14 percent increase in BFI [business fixed  investment] over the next year  With a considerable rate of inflation in there, it seems to me that  if investment sentiment should [strengthen] as the economy improves or as people start to see the  capacity limit being reached or as inflationary expectations increase, you could have more BFI  than you had projected  And, finally, I think you could have more federal expenditures than you  projected, particularly if the unemployment rate does as poorly as is projected here  I think there  could be new programs beginning in the new Congress shortly after the first of the year that  would cause a larger increase     So what I come down to, I guess, is I can see reasons why the actual might be a little lower  than projected  I can also see the possibility that it might be a little higher than projected, so I  don’t quarrel with it greatly  I think it’s a dead-centrist position  I would, however, want to  echo Governor Wallich  If this projection is realized, and you have a roughly 4-1/2 percent  growth rate over the next five quarters, then at the end of that period the unemployment rate is  still forecasted to be 6-1/2 percent, which is not full employment unless you are in the Herb Stein  school  And the capacity utilization rates, although higher, are not uncomfortably high in either  total manufacturing or in materials  So it seems to me we are talking about an expansion in this  forecast which, if realized, is about minimally acceptable, but not more than minimally  acceptable to the society, to the government as the government now looks at things    100 percent increase from the year passed?    For the year, Jim?     9/20/77 - 20 -    Turkey, Spain, Portugal    A minor clarification, Mr Chairman  Dave, about “maintenance of the  patient”--you didn’t mean that you are now seeking a zero growth rate for the economy?    Maintenance of the present growth    Moderation    You did say, Peter, that the year bill is not up at all from where it was a  month--    Six-month bill  So that it’s really the very short end that has risen     9/20/77 - 29 -    That’s interesting    I would have thought that you would have responded to Governor  Coldwell’s question, that that very stable [unintelligible] deal would suggest that the market as a  whole is not expecting rates to rise    Do you include mortgage rates in that?    –intermediation?    Well, I think functionally, what’s happened is that M1 is growing more  rapidly, and the time deposits that are added to make M2 are growing less rapidly, and M1 has a  much higher reserve requirement than M2  There’s a time deposit component of M2, that’s why  the monetary base is growing more rapidly    Well, it’s just not interest rate levels either  It’s output and demand and  employment and profits and the whole fabric of the economy that has to be taken into account    Yes, in dealing with the inflation problem, which was your question    Well, as you look through the monthly ups and downs, I think one would  have to conclude, and maybe you said this, the evidence is that the number on M1 growth is  working higher    It’s a high number    It’s a question of whether to accommodate what we’re now getting or is  this more than needed, so there is no question [unintelligible]    Just to a degree    If they should try to recapture it, the growth rates would be staggering    They’re consistent in a recession, Larry    Yes    Well, let’s be clear  The staff has not assumed the same slope  I presume  that you have a much higher interest rate in the early part of next year    But not back to the previous relationship, I think  Henry was making the  point that it would be back to the previous relationship  That is, your model, let’s say, would be  right on the increments from now on out  If the model were right, to get that objective of  monetary growth that you have, you would have to get considerable interest rates    Then it puts it over the top range    You don’t need to specify that [higher federal funds rate range] because  the directions would be inconsistent and there would have to be new directions issued    Well, I agree with a good deal of what Governor Jackson had to say, but  when he finally got to the prescription, why, it wasn’t then the same prescription I would have     9/20/77 - 43 -   suggested  I think he’s right that it biases the outcome too much to take a range as low as 3 to 7  [on M1] if I understood you; 4 to 8--I didn’t understand what you said on M2    4 to 8  Now given the fact that September looks as if it’s developing to be  rather significant, and the possibility of October--well, October could be double digit on M1,  given the previous performance  And so I would rather also see a range that encompasses a  somewhat higher number--I would propose 3 to 8 [and] 5 to 9 for M1 and M2  Because I don’t  see any harm, I don’t see any great desire to see M2 significantly lower; 5 to 9 is a very  reasonable range for M2, as I see it  And I would accept your second funds rate suggestion, 6 to  6-1/2 with 6-1/8 as the beginning point    Now if we do get an October that is quite strong, we will undoubtedly go  over the 7 percent, the 8 percent top on M1  And when we go over the top, I would assume that  the Manager would report to you that the instructions were inconsistent, and then the question  would be changing the instructions, considering whether to take the funds rate above 6-1/2  But  if M1 came out, let’s say, close to 8 percent for the two months, which is not far from the  midpoint of the staff forecast, and if M2 was also relatively strong, as I understand it, we would  be at 6-1/2 percent by the end of the period  That is, if the aggregates were both at the upper end  of their ranges  And going beyond 6-1/2 would be a discrete decision based on overly strong  performance  So I would, I guess, accept your funds rate range, but I would have a somewhat  more expansive M1 and M2 range than you suggest    6-1/8 is the midpoint of the 6 to 6-1/2    What, the [Sub]committee on the Directive?    Yes, yes  But that was the subject that we had proposed to study, and we  were told not to study it    I will try to have some preliminary work done for the Committee next  time    If we stop on the 6, there can be hardly any backup?    7 percent at the top  7 percent is pretty likely, pretty likely [the] outcome    As it is, it seems to me what that does, Mr Chairman, is really raise quite  high odds that we will be at or close to 6-1/2  And if October [rises sharply], of course, we will  have to go above  Even if it doesn’t, I think the odds are very high that we’ll be close to 6-1/2    I’m taking the estimate of 66 percent for the monthly growth rate for  September as having some plausibility    Mr Chairman, if the range for the aggregates were widened [at the upper  end] to accommodate 8 for M1 and 9 for M2, I would go with it    Now, this is on the first vote?    What about M2, Alan?  What’s your M2 projection?    I agree  "
507,1977-10-17,"  That does assume, as you say, that there will be some acceleration in  growth abroad  Are exports pretty sensitive to rates of growth abroad?    You don’t have any protectionist, any explicit protectionist stuff at all    Now that, of course, Paul, would mean that it would also tend to hold  down the recovery anyway    It’s an algebraic subtraction    Is yours a supply constraint?    That is, then starts can’t stay up because there are shortages    Insulation, I guess, is important    Well, I might say that I talked to the economist with the National  Association of Home Builders recently, following that convention  He talked to a great many  builders in the course of that convention, and his impression is that single-family building is  likely to come down in the year to come, but the multifamily might well go up, and it might be  above, even--that is to say, the figure might not be so far from the overall figure that the staff has  got here, but there might be a little less single-family and a little more in multi  And if I may, I’d  like to ask Jerry the same question I asked Bob Mayo, and that is, in your projection, are supply  constraints holding starts [down], or are demand constraints holding starts down, or is it money?    It’s this bill rate    Could they come back in?    Is that an annual rate?    10 percent    How do you feel, Roger, about the outlook for farm products and  supplies?    That’s in wheat    When you say less without the well-head tax, you mean but with the  continuing control program and all?  I mean, what’s the alternative to the well-head tax?    So that the retail sales is a more current look, you mean?      Yet there is some circularity there, isn’t there    And Ernie was saying earlier, with the income and employment that was  being projected, you have to have very strong consumption; but on the other hand, if you don’t  have the consumption, you might not have any income    You were beginning to ask a question    I was interested in the answer to the question    Well, Mr Chairman, I guess I would veer in the direction, I think, in the  probabilities of a somewhat lower increase than the staff has  And I do this with some temerity  because I think it’s awfully hard to know what’s likely to occur  And I do it also with a clear  understanding that I don’t anticipate an actual recession in the period, at least not until the very  end of the period that we’re forecasting     But it seems to me that, in area after area that has been discussed here this afternoon, the  staff has been inclined to take a figure a little on the high side  Now in some of these cases, the  figure will probably work out, but in other cases it seems to me that a lower figure is probable   For example, we’ve mentioned net exports--it seems to me that chances are that net exports will  be weaker than are being projected, rather than stronger than have been projected, and that will  weaken, to a degree, the size of domestic output related to that aspect  We mentioned housing  starts, and I think maybe a 214 million rate is a pretty high rate for the year  Even if you get  214, I want to agree with my associate, Governor Jackson, that it’s likely to be more in  multifamily and thus involve less spending than would be the case in the staff mix  I see that we  still have automobile sales next year of 114 million units, up from this year  And it seems to me  still unlikely that that will be the case  In general, I wonder whether personal consumption will  be that strong     In the area of plant and equipment expenditure, well, it may well be that the staff will be  right  They have a 136 percent increase indicated in business fixed [investment], but I would  remind you that the surveys we’ve seen to date are a good deal below that  Now, it’s often said,  and I’ve heard it said just today, that the surveys tend to underestimate spending during the  periods of expansion  But I want to point out to you that that has a certain amount of circularity  in it  If this in fact does not turn out to be a period of high expansion, I think the surveys indicate  that they usually overestimate rather than underestimate  So that there is a presumption that  you’re thinking about, that you’re reading from, when you say that it’s likely to be more than the  surveys  That’s not a tremendous difference, but it is on the order of 3-1/2 percentage points in  that area     Perhaps there could be more of an increase in inventory than is being projected  But  business seems to be very conservative with regard to inventory, and I haven’t seen as yet what I  would call speculative exuberance in acquiring inventory  Therefore, if business is conservative  with regard to inventory practices and we do get a larger rise, that would be a sign of weakness  for the immediately following period rather than a sign of strength     So, I wouldn’t want to say each one of these areas will be weaker than the projection, but I  think there’s enough of a prospect that some will be that I think we’ll come out on the low side  of this  I will point out to you that what we’re projecting is a real GNP, the rise in which is  tending to diminish from a 5 percent rate to 4-1/2 percent rate over the projection period  Thus,  a lower number would get us down into an area of danger and an unemployment rate that is  dropping very little from where it has been--to 66, I guess, at the end of the projection  period--which is also much less progress than has been planned in that area over the coming  year       10/17-18/77 - 24 -         As far as prices are concerned, I am inclined to think they’re going to come in a little better  than the staff has projected  And I think I’m inclined to do that partly because I believe that food  prices will continue weak in the projection period, relatively weak, and also because there’s not  going to be enough worldwide demand for industrial raw materials to drive those prices up very  much  So I think those two somewhat exogenous elements in our price determination picture  will tend to give us lower increases rather than larger  I don’t really dispute the idea that the  basic underlying rate of inflation marked in terms of unit labor costs will remain 6 percent or  slightly above    He says if you want a large effect you need a large change    Shouldn’t you say they spent $20 billion on holding down their own  currencies?    No, I’m just referring to the phrase “supporting the dollar”  I don’t think  that was their motive  Their motive was to hold down their own currency    Well, you can’t erase the trade deficit, which is growing by leaps and  bounds  That certainly would seem to indicate the direction for the dollar, other things equal   And for us to try to resist that in volume--I mean, at first it might seem that we know something  that they don’t, but later it might just seem that we’re being foolish    Peter, as you say, you were coming to the upper limit on your ranges  almost right away, which is not surprising, because the Committee biased the ranges downward  last time  And then as I look at the Bluebook, why, of course, the latest estimates are well above  the upper end of the range for M1 and somewhat above M2  Can I ask you, at what point would  you notify the Chairman when you thought the instructions were inconsistent ordinarily?  I mean  how would the process go?    You didn’t regard this as being obviously inconsistent, at least until right  toward the very end of the period  Is that right?    They don’t hardly ever use it    I second it    Well, Mr Chairman, I’m in a real quandary today  I look at the economy  and I wonder whether it’s the kind of an economy in which we want to have a substantial rise in  interest rates, a substantial shift in the flow of funds away from the thrifts and the banks into the  market, and the characteristics of a tightening in the old terms, a tightening financial  environment  On the other hand, I look at the aggregates and I see that we’ve clearly been over,  and way over in M1, for a couple of quarters  I guess this is the time, or very close to it, when  you really have to test [people’s] confidence in the guides by which they run, and I have to admit  to you that my confidence in the aggregates is very badly shaken  And if I had my preference, I  would not specify aggregates because I’m afraid we’ve gotten ourselves into a trap     I’m particularly concerned, as Governor Wallich is, that what’s going to happen,  regardless of what we specify in the way of aggregates, is that the demand function for money  has shifted  And if we’re going to continue to have a fairly rapid--although not as rapid as it has  been here over the summer--increase in M1, and I dearly hope that President Willes is wrong,  and then we wouldn’t, in an environment like that, seek to get down within the target range for  M1 regardless of the consequences for the economy     Because the economy simply, in my view, is not strong enough to support a substantial rise  in interest rates  I sit here right across from the chart on selected monetary indicators  I find that     10/17-18/77 - 49 -         the third quarter saw an increase of about 150 basis points in Treasury bills, from about 4-1/2 or  maybe slightly more, to something over 6 percent  It is true that long-term rates haven’t moved  much this year on balance, but they have moved since the last meeting  They are tending up a  little    Yes, I understand that  I’ve done all those calculations, and I have them  from the lows and for what they’ve done this year and so forth, but I’m afraid that we may be at  a point where markets, with another 150 basis point rise in bills, would move and would move  considerably     Now the question is of strategy  I suppose that, if one looks at the real economy, the  conclusion that Governor Jackson reached is probably most appropriate  There are a few  bottlenecks, a few tightnesses in the market  They tend to be in the housing sector  They are in  materials and in some places in labor, partly for structural reasons such as Willis mentioned  yesterday  And so it might not be unreasonable to tighten up a little bit on the flow of funds that  we would logically expect to be going into housing  And that would call for--quite aside from  the question of interest rate relationships--a little bit of restraint in the growth of M2 and M3     I think I prefer Bob Black’s idea that we should reduce both the top and the bottom end of  [M2 and M3] by 1/2 point rather than just the top, and maintain the 2-1/2 point spread, because  we have no reason to think that we’ve become better in predicting what is likely on M2 and M3  And we are at the point [in the interest rate relationship where] we’re more likely to be wrong,  and the exposure to error grows as these market rates become quite competitive with Regulation  Q ceilings     So I think I would prefer 6-1/2 to 9 for M2 and 8 to 10-1/2 for M3 for the year ahead, and  that’s considerably below where we have been going this year  I believe Peter said that the two- year issue was expected to go up to 7-1/4  I think we’re probably about at the point where we  begin the impact on that rate of inflow  That’s a very sensitive rate, that two-year rate; 7-1/4 is  fairly competitive, 7-1/2 is quite competitive; [at] 7-3/4, we really would begin to have an  impact, an effect on the thrifts     That leaves M1  I think there’s a lot of logic to Governor Wallich’s proposal that the  range be broadened  Because we really don’t know what’s going on in M1, and we don’t know  what the demand function may do in the period to come  The trouble with that is that, if we were  to give a broadened range for M1, we would indicate, I think, by so doing, a degree of  knowledge about what’s going on that we don’t possess  One could say, why, you take a 3  percent low end in case there has been some kind of a surge in money demand, and it now  relents, and we can get this 3 percent, we would accept it  But I don’t know, it’s quite low to  maintain that for the whole year, and it really suggests to me that what we would be doing is  moving into a recession, and we wouldn’t be comfortable at 3 percent in a recession  environment       10/17-18/77 - 50 -         We could take 7 as the top, but on the other hand, our recent experience, Henry, is that 7  isn’t enough  And if that demand function stays where it has been over the last two quarters on  average, [it] will require more than a 7 percent increase in M1  And I think we would look  particularly bad if we were to specify a higher top and then not live up to it, and therefore I’m  inclined to say that we ought to stay just exactly where we were at 4 to 6-1/2, but with the caveat  to the [congressional] committee in our pronouncement that we’re not certain about what’s going  on here     Now the Chairman really said that last time  I reviewed his testimony because I had to  testify before [Representative] Parren Mitchell’s committee, and he said that, with regard to the  third quarter, that is, the specifications a quarter ago, that we were expecting a continued more-  than-normal increase in velocity, and that assumption was built into those numbers  We haven’t  had it  And it seems to me that he could very naturally follow up on that previous testimony by  saying we haven’t had it, we don’t know why, but we haven’t had that increase in velocity quite  recently  Secondly, he made the point that our concern, as I think [he] always has done in these  things, that our concern is the behavior of the economy, not the behavior of the aggregates, and  that we would be alert to changes in the economy and would be quick to change what we were  prepared to accommodate, depending on what the economy required  And I think that could be  repeated again     So I know it’s unsatisfactory, very dissatisfying, but I think our very best position, given  the degree of uncertainty we have, would be to stay right with the same range on M1 that we had  before and to reduce slightly the M2 and M3  Mainly, I wouldn’t give so much the [reason] that  we want to cut back on housing, but mainly on the basis of interest rate relationships and past  behavior and to say we would continue to watch the situation quite carefully  As far as the  overrun is concerned, I know it’s very substantial  We’ve had previously offsetting quarters of  overshoot and undershoot, and now we’ve had two quarters of consecutive overshoot, and that’s  what makes it look as bad as it does, Mark  It’s partly that this pattern was broken, but I think  we simply have to accept it on the grounds that to do otherwise would just be too debilitating to  the near-term prospects of the economy    I think, Mr Chairman, that all we have is worth only a very brief  comment  I believe the memorandum is clear and [properly] brief, and I assume you’ve all read  it  What it amounts to is that we haven’t been able to determine as yet with the assistance of the  staff whether it is a desirable thing to change the approximately equal weights we give to M1  and M2, because we haven’t been able to come close enough to approximating in the real world     10/17-18/77 - 55 -         what we have done  What the staff has done, as a matter of fact, indicates that it rather argues  against it  But I have some problems with the very rigid assumptions made in the way that that  work was done     As a more or less pragmatic view, though, we do think that it’s not unreasonable to say  that there could be a wider range in M1 and M2, reflecting the obviously greater noise and  unpredictability that we’ve seen in that--increasingly with the passage of time  In the memo, the  comment I think comes down to that on page 4, where it says, from 1974 to date, the average  absolute error, without regard to sign, in the staff’s forecast of two-month growth rates for M1  was 1 percentage point more than for M2, averaging 28 as compared with 18  And in 1977, the  average absolute error for M1 has increased further, to 33, whereas M2 has been only 17     Now, it could be argued that, well, the staff’s inability to predict is a reflection of  something going on in the economy  And over a long span of time, that may well be the case   But this year, it seems to me that our difficulty has been that there is just so much noise that we  haven’t been able really to take a great deal of confidence in the numbers that we were given and  the numbers that we were looking at  Essentially that’s what we were just talking about,  although we were talking about it in connection with the long-range targets     So I would have to also say, since he’s not here, that I don’t think President Eastburn feels  quite as confident in this proposal as the rest of us, but I believe the [sub]committee does come  up with the view--well, what [the FOMC] did last time [for the two-month specifications], more  or less out of desperation, was not a bad thing, that is to increase M1 to a 5 point range and to  leave M2 somewhere narrower, the 4 point range    Yes, that’s right  Either that or [the FOMC] took guidance from what the  [sub]committee had already done  But that’s all I have to say  This is a very important issue,  and we’re going to be exploring it methodically and in a concentrated way over the next several  months  But at this point, this is all the advice we can give  I don’t know whether President  Volcker, Mr Gardner, have additional comments they’d like to make    That’s it    Well it’s about 2 to 1  But I’m not sure that that’s the right thing to do,  you see    That’s about right    You still do feel, don’t you, Steve--staff still feels that there’s a lagged  response to interest rate increases?  I think, if it’s so, why, we ought to keep in mind that we are  talking about a considerably different level of rates than we were three months ago    Well, I was going to be very brief, but I must say, Frank, you’ve  challenged me, then, to speak a little more [unintelligible]  I’ve been in this room for a good  many years also, and I find marked differences between this and the previous occasions where  there have been surges  The first one is that we have a utilization rate much lower than it was  either in 1968 or in 1972 in the latter part of the year  Indeed, it’s a rather low utilization rate  both for plant and for labor, except in just a very few industries such as paperboard and  insulation and petroleum  Secondly, most of these earlier major surges you’re talking about  were times when there was speculative enthusiasm  In ’68 there was a great deal of gunslinging  in the stock market; you remember, in 1972, we were treated to a rising stock market, a great     10/17-18/77 - 60 -         deal of speculative exuberance  The Japanese were buying inventories two years in advance, and  there was a worldwide boom in process of development in that spirit; we don’t have that now   And then I would say, also, this is getting to be a rather old cycle  In ’72, one couldn’t  have said that, and in ’68 it depends on how you date it; if you consider that the Vietnam War  sort of started a new cycle, it was still a relatively new cycle at that time  To me this is more like  the fall of ’62 than any other of the past occasions I can remember  You remember, in ’62 the  stock market dropped sharply during the spring and summer because of the confrontation on  steel  You remember, in the fall of ’62 there was great discomfort and lack of confidence in the  federal government, and confidence was being very badly affected     Well, you might say there’s a lot more money growth than there was in 1962, but if I look,  I find that in this cycle to date we’ve had an increase in the money supply--narrow money  supply--of 62 percent, annual average  I find also that we’ve had an increase in the fixed-weight  price deflator, private price deflator, of 59  If you subtract and I don’t mean to fall into the JEC  [Joint Economic Committee] error here, but if you subtract the difference in the rate of inflation  and the difference in money supply growth, we are having a slower money growth, relatively,  than we were then, and so I don’t think it’s that kind of a situation at all     Now, based on what I said about the long-term aggregates, Mr Chairman, it’s clear that I  prefer a money market directive, because I don’t think we really understand what the aggregates  are telling us  I agree with Monroe [Kimbrel]  I don’t think it would be a good thing to see the  funds rate go down at this time  But rather than moving it from 6-1/2 to 7, I would suggest that  it’s quite consistent with a money market directive to have a range of 6-1/2 to 6-3/4; and that’s  where I would put it, and I would take the aggregates of the alternative B specification that you  suggested    Yes, I do    The other possibility is to take Paul’s suggestion but leave the money  market directive    I think Peter is saying that he would probably be moving even on the  money market directive if you were at the extremes    With [unintelligible] modification   SPEAKER(?)  Wording says, if you approach--    May I ask, Mr Chairman--Governor Wallich, you indicated a preference  for A, although when we were having our discussion you indicated a preference for a money  market directive     10/17-18/77 - 68 -          I, as a matter of fact, had a preference for B with a money market  directive    That’s the largest number yet  "
535,1977-11-15,"  That is, attempt to go to the Supreme Court  Is that correct?    Mr Chairman, I do think that there are two possibilities, as I see it,  [forcing] early release  One is that the Solicitor General will not take the case, and the other is  that the Supreme Court won’t take the case, which they often do not    No, but it would be--apparently they do it within the 30-day period  Is  that correct, Tom?    So it would mean that, sometime between December 1 and January 1, we  might have another possible report date, and it seems to me that, just as a matter of defensive  strategy, we might want to eliminate reference to a funds rate range in the current directive    I think we need a staff study--    --and it might also be desirable to change this one  Since this one might  be--    I think, Bob, even if you had the monetary aggregates formulation, that it  would still specify the funds rate range    What you could very well do is--now this would be some change in  procedure  You could instruct the Manager--the last phrase of the directive could read, “The  operational objective for the federal funds rate shall be modified in an orderly fashion from the  prevailing rate of about 6-1/2 per cent”    And there could be, you know, the Manager has--    Well, that isn’t the way it’s stated  Now it has a range--    Well, omit the funds rate range, yes    But I think, Mr Chairman, that everyone’s right that, since it will be 15  days, that this can’t have much market effect  That is, whatever formulation that we have, what I  was thinking of more, I must admit, is that we’re going to lose this  Now I hate to be that  negative, but I think there’s a high probability that we’re going to lose at some stage here  And I  suspect that where we’re going to lose is, the Supreme Court won’t take the case  And [it] would  be nice to have had in place a somewhat different directive before we were forced to release  what would be the December directive, probably  It would have to be released at the very end of  the year  And having had the precedent with a somewhat different November directive, there  wouldn’t be such a sharp break with a December directive  That was my point    Well, I think you may be right  But on the other hand, I think the  Committee has the freedom to change its directive    And if you say, you know, if they were expecting the aggregates within a  particular range, and you’re starting off on a funds rate, and the Manager ought to  shade--moving above that rate or below that rate depending on how those aggregates come  up--well, that’s not too harmful    He’s moving in that direction    I think there is a directive that we could put out--    Well, even your first point bothers me, Bob, because if you change to a  money market directive because you have a lack of confidence in what the short-run aggregates  numbers are telling us, and then you say well, since this court decision, we’d better go back to  the aggregates directive, you really are going against something you would otherwise do on  rational economic or financial statistical grounds    Well, I agree with you  As a matter of fact, it can go into the opposite  direction [of] what we intended to do  We’ll have to see  Offhand, I can’t think of a solution    We’re going to present a report at the next meeting that the Committee--    And we will talk about the pros and cons and possible alternatives    Well, the answer is we will have to publish what [we do] today  But we  will still have the option of molding what we do at the December meeting     11/15/77 - 19 -          Well, that’s one of the problems  I suppose, Tom, a supplementary  instruction--of the kind that we have had sometimes in the past--will have to be communicated  immediately under this same court decision  Is that right?    It’s not usually a case where you’re moving in one direction and then  another; why, that really is more sensitive, in a way, than the meeting itself    We will give you a range of possibilities    I think the assignment to the [sub]committee to be an operational  assignment--that is, assuming that you publish, what are your options, what kind of directive  changes might be desirable or appropriate--rather than a legislative matter or even the matter of a  court strategy     11/15/77 - 20 -          Well, Mr Chairman, I have nothing special to contribute  I agree that the  tone is a little better than it was a month ago  And I think the better retail sales--the retailers  have been talking about it for some time, but the statistics only showed them yesterday  It’s part  of it  I was surprised [when I looked] at the Greensheets [the tables section of the Greenbook]--I  hadn’t really focused on this--I noticed that federal purchases, which is only part of this story,  were up at a 23 percent annual rate in the second quarter and a 24 percent rate in the third, and  the rate of increase is now projected to diminish materially  And that could be having some  effects on the current situation     I have the same feeling I did a month ago--which, I guess, is just exactly the inverse of the  one that Ernie expressed--that is, that the staff projection is reasonable; if it’s in error, I would  think it would probably be on the high side, and we might get a little lower result for the year   The increase for the year averages only 46 percent in the current staff projection, which is 4/10  below what I understand to be the target projection of the Administration for the year, with a 5  percent desired growth rate     The problem is in the second half, really, more than it is in the first half of the year  And  there, too, I think if it continues to look as if the second half is going to tail off, well, we are  going to have a problem that we’re going to have to deal with in the government generally and in  the Federal Reserve also  As we get closer to the date--but I am reminded that it’s been  characteristic of economic forecasting for some considerable number of years to project the six- month, with nine months to a year out [to show] a diminishing in the rate of economic growth   It’s been a rather typical thing, and I think we have to guard against taking these figures too  solidly  Now, it could happen; indeed, it could be much lower than a 42 or a 41 growth rate in  the second half of next year  But I don’t think we ought to bank on it at this point     And so I think it’s too early to react with alarm at what appears to be the prospect of a  tailing off next year  In another couple of months, why, we may be able to see it more clearly   As of now, I know Frank is very much in favor of long-term forecasting and has expressed that  view, and other members have  I just don’t have confidence in our ability to project out that far  very well  That’s all I have    You would think, of all groups, financial institutions would be the most  likely to utilize their cash balances promptly, putting them in overnight markets or something  like that    I note that you’ve got a decline in velocity, an indicated decline in V1 in  the third quarter; that’s the first decline since the recession low in the first quarter of ’75  It does  seem like there would be some storing up in velocity    You’d cut by a half    Well, that’s agreeable to me too, Mr Chairman  I don’t quite understand  how we’ve gotten this stability, but we do seem to have it, right at the moment, and it might be  well to continue it for a while    The aggregates are very difficult to interpret, as usual  And Frank, it  could be telling us something, it could be telling us that it’s under control, or it could be telling  us that there’s been a change  We may start worrying about a low number, believe it or not, if it  continues for a period  Now, a 1 percent lower [limit] on M1--assuming that November is going  to turn out around 1 percent, which is a fair assumption--would mean, in December, 1 percent  too, and I suspect we’d be getting a little nervous by the end of the two-month period in which  we have been getting 1 percent  But I think that’s all right because we’ve had such overshoots in  recent months  And we could still have averages, for any period that can be calculated--that  longer period--that would be quite satisfactory     The statistical analysis does suggest that there’s some basis [for] recent deviations from  projections, that there should be about a 2 point larger range in M1 than in M2, and so I’m  inclined to choose the 1 to 7 [percent] for that reason also, like Paul, and also because I so well  recall that December is a very difficult month  And it could be that we would have considerable  problems with the month as it develops, simply because of the Christmas effect and the weather  effect and all that happens to you as you get into the winter season  The funds rate at 6-1/4 to  6-3/4, centered on 6-1/2, where we are now, sounds fine to me     I think, with this wide a monetary range, that we could go back to the aggregates directive,  although it’s a little early to do so given the fact that we still don’t [know] what’s moving these  figures  But with this wide a range, I think we can afford to do it    What’s this?    I would take either  I can see some advantage--I think honesty really does  indicate, as somebody said, that we are on a permanent money market directive, and perhaps we  ought to take it for that reason  On the other hand, I think the ranges are wide enough to justify  an aggregates [directive], so I would take either that the Committee would prefer    Do you see some advantage to a money market directive?  Did I  understand you to say that’s the way you would go?    No, now we’ve begun moving before it gets to the top  "
559,1977-12-19,"  And if they don’t accept it, Tom, that would make it, after the first of  January rather promptly, something we would have to do on a current basis?       Well, Mr Chairman, we were asked to consider on an emergency basis  this contingency planning, the question of what we would do in the event that we lose the court  case or have to suddenly publish the directive  The subcommittee had two meetings since the  last meeting of the Committee, and the staff met and drafted a report which has been approved  by the subcommittee  You all have it before you, and I see no great purpose to be served in  going through it in any detail with you today, since I am sure you have read it  I would say that  we considered three separate problems having to do with the directive, and they are taken up in  order in the draft material     The first is what to do about specification of the short-run instructions to the Manager   The recommendations are contained on page 12 of the report  We considered quite a wide  variety of alternatives in looking at this--having meetings more frequently, giving more  discretion to the Manager, turning to more qualitative kinds of characterizations of the directive,  having wider or narrower ranges for the aggregates or for the funds rate than we now do,     12/19-20/77 - 7 -         meeting on a different day of the month  We had quite a variety of proposals, and in the end we  decided that the best procedure would be to continue with the same kind of a specification of  short-range targets as now exist in the directive, I think for two reasons, principally     The first is that that this is something that we have worked out over a considerable period  of time, and it’s working reasonably well  And we would be fearful that to radically change the  procedure now could possibly upset policy and the carrying out of policy, which, after all, is the  major purpose to be served by the directive  And the second reason is that to change  significantly the procedures and the directive of the Committee could be judged in the wake of a  court determination as an effort to avoid the finding of the court, which would have some  disadvantage to us  Even if it weren’t a substantial criticism, it could still have a cosmetic  disadvantage to us  So our feeling was that, everything considered, we ought to continue to  follow along with the short-run specs much as they exist now in the directive     We did, however, think that two modifications in the directive procedures and language  might be considered by the Committee  First of all, we would add a sentence to the effect that  the Manager should take account of emerging financial market conditions  This is a variant of a  phrase that was in the directive for a long number of years, as you recall, but was taken out a  couple of years back because it didn’t seem to be actively used, it didn’t seem to have any real  bearing on operations in the ordinary course of events  Now, however, there will be two  advantages to reinsert such a sentence  One is that it would, in fact, permit the Manager to take  special action in the wake of the court decision, not knowing how market reactions would be to  the publication of the directive  And the second purpose to be served, I think, is that it would  establish a degree of looseness between the specifications and the Manager’s actions, which  would provide an uncertainty in the market’s mind so they wouldn’t think that deciding what  was going to happen to rates was like shooting fish in the barrel  And, therefore, we would have  that modification     The second [modification] is that, at least for awhile, we think that the Committee would  be well served to keep a relatively narrow funds rate range  Now, in fact, we have had a narrow  funds rate range for quite a few recent meetings, typically 1/2 point  And we think that the 1/2  point range might be continued for awhile just to reduce the exposure to large-scale changes in  market expectations that the publication of the directive might bring about  That raises the  hazard that there might need to be more frequent reconsideration of instructions and amendment  of instructions, but it’s a hazard we think that probably should be taken in the short run while we  are feeling our way, at least with regard to how publication affects market behavior  So that’s  our recommendation with regard to the short-run specs     Now, there is also a problem having to do with the longer-range specifications of  movements in the aggregates thought to be appropriate [for] the financial and economic  conditions that we seek  That is the 12-month specifications  The difficulty there is that the  current directive has no particular rationale for the choice of those, for the kinds of thinking that  goes into choosing and updating those long-run specifications  And it seems particularly  appropriate in the case of those that are mandated by the Federal Reserve Act as amended  It  seems particularly appropriate for the long-range growth rates of the aggregates to be associated  with a rather full explanation of the reasons why the Committee has chosen these particular     12/19-20/77 - 8 -         growth rates  Now those reasons in recent years have been given by the Chairman in his  testimony before the proper oversight committee  And rather than try to create a system of  explanation over and above the directive that would be published promptly in connection with  the revision of longer-run ranges, we think it best to continue to associate the announcement of  the longer-run ranges with the Chairman’s statements before the oversight committees     This means that the Committee could not in fact determine what the long[-run] ranges  would be until just before the Chairman testifies--a date that we don’t have total control over  because there is a Senate or a House Committee that controls the hearings  And it frequently  means that there would be a delay of a week or two weeks between the immediate predecessor  meeting of the Committee and that testimony  Well, on one, perhaps two occasions in the last  couple of years, the Committee has faced this problem with regard to the Chairman’s  appearance, and it has had a tentative discussion of the appropriate longer-range targets  I  shouldn’t use the word targets--longer-range aggregate growth rates--and then has had a  telephone conference call to firm them up the day before the Chairman is testifying     And we see nothing wrong with that as a procedural matter  Our general counsel feels that  this might, in fact, seem to be arbitrary--a way of getting around the court order  But it seems to  me that the need to have the explanation of the long-range targets, and also the possibility that  intervening developments might change our view on the appropriate long-range targets, make it  quite reasonable to have a preliminary discussion of that sort and then a final discussion, by  telephone if you wish, of the long-range targets just before they are presented to the oversight  committee  So that with regard to the long-range part of the directive, that would be our  recommendation     The third problem that we addressed, not very successfully because we didn’t have our  general counsel’s views at the time of our second meeting, is the problem of dealing with the  record of [affirmations and] dissents--votes for [and against] the regular short-term directive and  for [and against] the long-range specifications that I have just discussed  It appears that the  publication of the directive would either immediately or very soon thereafter call for a  presentation of the votes on the directive and on the long-run specifications that had been  decided upon by the Committee     The awkwardness there is that, as soon as the press, public generally, finds that a member  of the Committee has dissented, or certain members of the Committee have dissented, there  would be a desire to find out why  And although an individual could give a very quick brief  reason for his dissent, that would be in the absence of an explanation of the majority point of  view, which is contained in the policy record [Record of Policy Actions] entry and is not  published until 30 days, I guess, after the previous meeting  And it takes quite a while to  develop, as you know, the policy record, the orderly discussion of the proceedings of the  Committee--the review of that material, as prepared by the Secretariat, by each member of the  Committee, and changes in that, and then that policy record is adopted as a proper summary of  the previous meeting at the subsequent Committee meeting  And therefore it is difficult to upset  that rather full explanation of the give and take of the Committee meeting and of the reasoning  behind the consensus that was reached       12/19-20/77 - 9 -         It would be far preferable, in our view, if the fact of dissents, the particular names of the  dissenters, and the [numbers] of dissents could be held until the time we put that policy record  out  Our general counsel thinks it is very unlikely that we can do that, and so, if in fact we  cannot hold [the reporting of] those votes until an orderly time for putting out the Record [of  Policy Actions] of the Committee, why we would simply have to hope, perhaps reach an  informal understanding, that dissenters would not give an explanation of their dissents until the  time that the policy record had been cleared, which would be just following the next meeting of  the Committee  And so that was the third area that we discussed     There is also attached to the report of the Committee a little review of informal  conversations that the Desk has had with a number of securities dealers--banks and nonbank  dealers in the market--Peter, you [also] have one mutual fund listed here, and a nondealer bank-- indicating what their feelings would be as to the impact of current publication of the directive   It’s a mixed bag, as these things generally are  Some think that there would be a substantial  effect  Some could see traps for us at particular times when policy was in the process of  changing  I think it’s an interesting review of informed market comment--informed in the sense  that they follow the activities of the Committee; but not so informed in terms of what our  particular strategies would be in this event--that Peter, I think, was mainly responsible for  And  so, if there are questions about that, I am sure he would be glad to answer them     Well, that’s all I have to say, Mr Chairman  Our three recommendations, therefore, are,  with minor amendments  (A) We continue to publish the current short-term specifications in a  directive form just as they exist today  (B) With regard to the longer-term ranges for the  aggregates, we withhold a Committee determination until just before the Chairman’s periodic  appearances before the oversight committees  (C) With regard to dissents on both parts of the  Committee’s policymaking procedures, that preferably the directive [with] the dissents be held  up until the publication of the policy record [Record of Policy Actions] as a whole; if that is not  possible, then the dissenters agree not to give reasons until the policy record has come  Thank  you    --may well have comments  Governor Gardner and President Volcker and  President Eastburn     No, no, it’s just that it has a--I meant to imply that it has a precedent, you  see  So that it wouldn’t be so unusual to add that back in, since we had something like it earlier      Then would they have to file an absolutely new one with the next  directive?    Yes, but do you mean the first time, or each time?    Well, it’s simply, in my view--and each of the Committee members can  speak for themselves--that in the context, of, let’s say, the publication of the directive tomorrow,  the market will have two things to look at  First, it will have the funds rate range that was  specified to look at  And secondly, it will have the aggregates for the two-month period to look  at  And if they feel--if the betting, or the evidence, of the next couple of weeks is that those  aggregates are likely to run quite high in the range specified or quite low in the range specified,     12/19-20/77 - 12 -         the tendency will be quickly to force the funds rate to its limits  And in view of that, and in view  of the fact that we don’t know how bold they’re going to be in projecting the current information  that bears on the aggregates, or the two-month period, why, we feel that it would be desirable to  continue a narrow range     Now let’s assume that we set--and that 1/2 point range, by the way, is one we have used in  most months this year, and so it isn’t all that narrow with regard to our recent practice--now let’s  assume that we set a funds rate range of, well, let’s say, for purposes of illustration, 6-1/4 to  6-3/4 tomorrow and that we set a range for the aggregates that turned out to be, let’s say, way  low [So] the aggregates seem to be developing to exceed by appreciable margins the ranges that  we have set for them  In that event, the market would immediately move the funds rate, of  course, to the 6-3/4, but in addition, we would have the option, obviously--the Manager would,  as in the past--to inform the Chairman that he considered that the instructions were not  consistent, and the Chairman would have the option of calling for, after special consideration,  another 1/8, 3/8, or 1/2 to that range, as the situation warranted  It keeps it a little more in our  control, I guess I’m saying, as compared with having a wide funds range and letting the market  run it in one direction or another depending on how it viewed the aggregates as coming out      Yes, it would certainly have to  And in that event, you see, we would  have announced, in effect, to the world that the aggregates are running strong enough or weak  enough relative our expectations that we are changing our funds rate  But that’s an explicit  decision we make, and at that time we wouldn’t be misleading in the market, or the market  wouldn’t be moving falsely into one range or into another range  We would be saying, yes, you  were right, the aggregates are too strong or they are too weak, and so therefore, we are going to  adjust the market  So I don’t see so much harm coming from that, although there would be very  pronounced announcement effects    Where we see that we have the aggregates coming in strong or weak, I  don’t see anything wrong with that      Yes, and I don’t think it should be a fixed rule    I am inclined to think, Phil, that what’s going to happen is that market  people, like Morgan and the bond houses, will start to focus more than they have and more  publicly than they have on the two-month aggregate outlook  And they’re spending more time  on the weeklies now, but I think they will convert this to a two-month average, and seeing what  our two-month range is  We are going to get, I think, newspaper releases saying so-and-so  believes that the aggregates will run well above the specified ranges  And it does, I think--at  least if that’s what happens, and it may not--expose you to erratic changes in the funds rate  beyond the points that the Committee would like to see them go without its having its own  information on that  Perhaps Steve has a view on this  Do you, Steve?    I think Roger’s point is that you might get an unbalanced or not an  impartial view of why the majority voted as it did, from one member    You mean the current rate      I don’t know why we couldn’t say, Roger--now our current construction  says that we think the ranges for the aggregates that we have specified are consistent with a  funds rate of about [X]  And I don’t see why we couldn’t say about 6-1/2 percent  But the  Manager may move between 6-3/8 and 6-7/8 if the aggregates seem to be deviating significantly  from the midpoint of those ranges  I don’t know why that wouldn’t work all right--it is a skewed  distribution around the midpoint, but I don’t know why it isn’t okay     12/19-20/77 - 16 -          We may want to change the midpoint at the time the directive is put out   And the same range, we might say we think it’s consistent with the funds rate of about 6-5/8  rather than 6-1/2, and then a range from 6-3/8 to 6-7/8    Well, that would be a problem because you get nothing on the downside    In that case, I guess I’d have to say, Mr Chairman, we should violate the  rule of a 1/2 point in order to keep 6-1/2 percent in the directive    I guess you ought to be pretty sure you want it    That’s what I thought  In cases like that, you would move deliberately as  expectations were borne out     I think any of us could speak to this, and I hope they will  I guess my  view is, Larry, that it’s all right to have the 1/2 point to 3/4 point move in the market if that is the  deliberate policy of the Federal Reserve because of a clear, perceived danger that it’s working  against  But I wouldn’t want to have that kind of a move in the market that seemed to be  precipitated by a Federal Reserve policy statement where it didn’t really mean it, and where it  was reversible  And therefore, I guess, Frank’s case, where you need to move the market  considerably--I have less difficulty with [that case] than [with] the idea that the rate will move as  a result of being given a bad steer by us  A bad steer by us that is subsequently the reverse of  that size     So I guess it just depends on how badly you want to move it  If you want to move it, you  can move it a long way  Now the people that are hurt are obviously the people who didn’t  borrow the day before and the people that loaned the day before  Because if they had known you  were going to do this, they could have done better by borrowing before or lending after the  event, if it’s upward    The intention was to put weight on what the Committee thinks is  important now  That is, we did consider whether we should suggest a revolutionary change in  procedure to the Committee--for example, run on nonborrowed reserves, which was an  experiment we had some time ago  We could have considered, though we didn’t explicitly,  whether we have all become monetarists and didn’t want to pay any attention to interest rates  anymore  But our view was that the Committee, through its decisions, has got a balanced view  between not wanting to see undue changes in interest [rates] and not wanting to see undue     12/19-20/77 - 18 -         changes in the aggregates, and we didn’t think we ought to upset that view  We are just trying  carry out what we understand to be the purposes of the Committee      Then perhaps you could start off with a half, and then you can try 3/4 and  see what happens, and try a [full] point and see what happened  But I guess our recommendation  is the conservative recommendation--you start thinking small rather than start thinking big      I think there’s just no getting around that; that’s what’s going to happen   That is, when you move and you say you are moving, you’re going to get more of a prompt  adjustment than you do now, and so you have to be pretty certain of your ground     There were a couple of them back in April    SPEAKER(?)  There was one in April    Yes    Ordinarily--    It just requires careful thought--    --when you adopt a broader range      I think we would want to have an explanation when we [make] a  significant change in the directive if we were on a publications schedule--    Which is committee number one, is that the Mitchell committee?    We are exploring these things, John  This was just a sudden assignment  within the last 30 days  We are looking at the relationship within short-range, long-range  targets  We’re looking at the question of the different kind of [unintelligible], where I hope that  we will explore the idea of going back to a money market directive with the aggregates as only  an indicator for changing the money market directive     No, we haven’t done that as yet    That’s next month    No, but his point is, you can either widen the funds rate spread or you can  narrow the aggregates  Precipitate action on either--     12/19-20/77 - 28 -          I think that is a money market directive, and any time the aggregates are  running strong or weak relative to expectations, it calls for a meeting or a wire to move off that  rough point--you know, point plus or minus 1/8 or something like that    How would we tell the Manager that?  If we told the manager that, we  would be giving him an instruction      Well, we did, Roger, address the question of qualitative expression  We  decided that that was the step backward--to talk in terms of slightly higher, slightly lower--which  used to be the way the directive was put  The other, I think you’re distinguishing between a  money market directive, which shows [unintelligible] [and] an aggregates [directive] of the kind  we had, say, two times ago, three times ago  And there, I think, our thought is that the  Committee would be free to treat a money market directive or an aggregates directive depending  on what it saw as the circumstances of the moment    Well, it seems to me, Paul, that the evidence of recent months is that  there’s a very, very large amount of money available to be moved from border to border in a  speculative way  And this $7 billion intervention by the three other countries--it’s just an  indication; it’s been much more than that, sometimes      Well, I just think that, when you get a market move of size, with the kind  of depth of trading behind it that is occurring, intervention is unlikely to do very much     I mean, well, what is the program?  To have a smaller expansion  domestically so that we can be like the rest of the world?     12/19-20/77 - 34 -          Well, that would reduce the current account deficit    Well, I would, too    That might hurt their export markets    Well, isn’t it true, Henry, that the reduction in the price of the dollar  should tend to narrow the trade deficit?    That is, it’s a corrective in itself    I don’t think it’s so bad    I don’t think so    But the exchange rate is taken in for financial assets, and therefore they  will have appreciation    Well, then you can say they lose when the dollar goes up, and they lose  when the dollar goes down      Other than the Chairman’s    Well, I have to say I was surprised by the amount of intervention that  we’ve had  I realize we all voted this $500 million limit  I was thinking of it in gross, and I  hadn’t exactly thought of it in terms of being a net, but it turns out to be essentially a net when  the market’s running one way  And I agree there’s been no day that you’ve had a lot of  intervention, but the total $430 million strikes me as being quite a lot, quite a lot    It’s quite a lot in terms of our exposure, that’s what I--    But they are doing it in order to protect their manufacturers from having a  less favorable exchange rate    We won’t permit exports, is that it?    I guess--    As a straightforward matter, people would say we would like to have  larger interest rate differentials  And that either means their rates have to decline or ours have to  go up    Well, we’ve tried to deal with the yield curve sometimes, but I don’t know  that we have tried to change the general level of interest rates    That means they have lasted three months already     12/19-20/77 - 44 -          It opens another $500 million    With the subcommittee, you can have another 500    Yes, another 500 million    So that’s another 500 on top of the 430 that we’ve done     12/19-20/77 - 45 -          Well, I would like it to be known that I’m rather concerned about this, and  I think we ought to make an effort to hold down the amount of intervention while still doing  what the directive calls for  That is, dealing in disorderly conditions, and let’s not overdo    That’s what you think   SPEAKER(?)  I can see some disagreement on that    Well, that would have to come to the Committee      It’s 22 million    The thing to do with their teenagers is to ship them to Texas    That’s the beginning of the fiscal year, and I think that’s the reason      Well, Mr Chairman, I’m prepared to take the staff projections as a sort of  datum against which we can compare performance in the period to come  I guess my instinct  says that the very immediate outlook is stronger than the staff projection, but the longer-run  outlook is weaker than the staff projection  I think we have had a little twist in retail sales here,  and it looks as if the inventory numbers are adjusting downward, and now I think we can get a  sizable rise in output in the next few months  That would probably mean a first-quarter GNP  considerably above this number of 46 that the staff has     But I am concerned about [a cutback in] auto sales, and I think its impact would fall in the  spring  Producers continue to produce pretty well through the winter to see whether the market  comes, and if it doesn’t come, why, they will make a sizable cutback in the spring--that is  historically what they have done  And I would think they would do it again, that is, assuming we  are only talking about a mild reduction, say, of a million units or so below the staff projection,  which I do think is the prospect  And so, therefore, there could be a spring slow-up in the  growth in the economy because the automobile industry’s effect is very widespread as they deal  with suppliers and the parts people and textiles and rubber and steel and all that     Later on, I think the prospect would depend on plant and equipment coming in, and I, too,  am beginning to grow a little restive about the prospects of a sizable rise in plant and equipment   I have continued to feel that it was coming, but I must say there hasn’t been--well, it just  continues to look a little sluggish to me, and I’m starting to wonder whether we are going to get  the large rise      No, no  That was my next point  I think that that’s offset by the prospect,  which Henry first mentioned, of the fiscal package, one aspect of which is likely to include  something intended to stimulate investment  Perhaps an investment tax credit effective back to  the date when the President announces it, or perhaps accelerated depreciation, or perhaps a  general tax cut for corporations  And that could make a difference as we go through the year,  even though the effective date of the tax bill might be June 30, or even September 30  There  could be retroactive aspects to it, and there could be impacts that would occur in advance of final  ultimate passage of a bill by the Congress     Now, I don’t think it’s going to be all that easy to get a tax cut--a package that everyone  will agree to  The Administration has had great difficulty with the Congress on particularities of  proposals this year, and I see no reason to think that they won’t have the same kind of difficulty  unless they have become much more adept next year  So I don’t--it’s a little bit like counting  your chickens before they’re hatched to start to talk about the stimulative effect of a tax cut or a  fiscal initiative, because it’s got quite a distance to go  But I am inclined to think that in the  absence of some kind of a constructive fiscal initiative, that the economy will be weaker in the  latter part of next year than the staff projection  And therefore, that will make that awfully  important in our consideration of policy as we get into the new year     But for the very immediate prospect, I would expect more of a pickup than the staff has  projected  I might say that one of the difficulties that I am more struck by is that people are so     12/19-20/77 - 61 -         much affected by where they come from  Ernie is without fail bullish, and I sometimes feel that  the whole state of Texas will be paved over by development down there  But it is more and  more the case that the average performance of the economy contains two aspects  One, very  strong growth in the South, and the other, rather weakish growth, particularly in New York and  Pennsylvania and New Jersey--in that section of the Northeast--and Ohio, I would say also  And  that’s something I think we need to take account of when we are evaluating what the overall  outlook is    They can still pave--there’s a lot to pave--    You might have eased a little bit if you had an aggregates directive this  time?      But, of course, that doesn’t necessarily mean a blip; it could be the  opposite    You mean to refer to both, domestic and international    SPEAKER(?)  Yes, domestic and international    Well, that would be within the [federal funds rate] range that we would  select--your 6-1/4 to 6-3/4 percent?     Very reassuring    Well, I’m somewhat sympathetic with Phil Coldwell’s point  I think that  the 2-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent range will bias the result in terms of a higher funds rate when the  period is over because the midpoint of the staff estimate is in the upper part of that 2-1/2 to 8-1/2  range  And I must say that, without knowing anything at all about what’s going to happen given  the increase in economic activity that we all see occurring right now--higher retail sales, perking  up industrial production, better employment figures--I would be inclined to think that the  exposure, the risk is toward a higher growth in the aggregates, not a lower growth, than the staff  has projected  So I do think it biases it     I’m somewhat sympathetic with President Roos because we do have a range that we are  seeking, although I think in fact we won’t be able to achieve that because velocity just won’t  grow as much as we anticipate in the period to come     Well, I guess I’m prepared to accept your specifications, recognizing that there is probably  some upward bias in the funds rate in the acceptance of that  I think in view of the fact, as Steve  tells us, we have such great uncertainty at this time of year, particularly about the aggregates,  that the money market directive is appropriate  I think it also appropriate because of the  modification that we made for the international--the international phrase was added  So I would  go for the money market directive with your specification    Probably very temporary    It’s pretty clear what it is     One thing we’re studying    Yes    That is, using this as the midpoint of a quarter  "
577,1978-01-05,"  Alan, I just got back from vacation, so I’m really not very well up-to-date   I’d like you to discuss briefly, if you would, your operating rationale in intervention  You are still  under the dollar limits, I presume; on the other hand, with this announcement you must have a new  rationale  You said we were being tested by the banks  I presume that means that they weren’t  covering but they were deepening their short positions in dollars  At some point they ought to  cover, it would seem to me, if they were convinced that in fact there was a defense of the dollar  going on  And when they cover we could have quite a sharp increase in the dollar rate       Well, does that mean that you’ll be inclined to move in on any weakening  of the dollar during the day?      What are your notions as to possible volume?       That was the cover yesterday, I guess  And today you get the testing      Well, it’s a very difficult situation without an awful lot of precedent  It’s  hard to say exactly what will occur  But as I read the statement coming home on the plane  yesterday, I was inclined to think that it might mean there will be very large scale operations  I  haven’t spoken to any of the other Board members about it yet and I just wondered if that was your  view, Alan  Do you think that we might in fact be talking about big money here?       1/5/78 7   I don’t either, Paul      Well, I assume the orders are placed through the banks    "
599,1978-01-17,"  Ted, you reflected on this 7-1/2 to 10 percent, I think you said, decline in the   inflation-weighted price of the dollar as perhaps indicating that [the dollar] could be undervalued  relative to other currencies  But if that were the case, wouldn’t you think that that would be  showing up in the trade data with a reduction in imports and an increase in exports?      What kind of lags do you have on that response?     Tends to turn adverse     Yes, I understand  But, as I recall, you don’t have an improvement for the   year in that current account balance     One often used to hear, Mr Chairman, about leads and lags in connection   with other countries--I don’t seem to have heard the term used with regard to the United States  [I  think you said] that the leads and lags have gone against us over this past year      And there’s [unintelligible] of rate change that could occur that could amount   to $10 or $15 billion or in that area     That’s a lead     I had in mind the whole financing effect--the very short-run financing and   payment effect, which I think can snap  It’s sort of like an inventory change  It can algebraically  amount to an awful lot from one quarter to another  I suppose it has been against us and it could go  for us  So the sort of more permanent financing problem, so to speak, might not be as large as the  Chairman suggests      Well, my difficulty is--and it’s the reason I asked Ted that earlier question--   that I don’t know what a proper exchange rate is for the dollar  I look at that chart across the way  from me and it shows that the dollar is still well above the trade-weighted average value it reached  in 1973 and in the first half of 1975  It’s true that it has come down sharply but it went up very  sharply in 1975 and early 1976  We didn’t resist very strongly the rise in the dollar in ’75 and early  ’76, and I just don’t have an anchor to windward here  I don’t have a notion of what the proper  exchange rate is from the standpoint of long-run equilibrium in trade and current account balances   What disturbs me about the notion of defending the dollar at a particular point--this is quite aside  from the question of moving in to take care of destabilizing conditions in the markets--in a massive  way through higher interest rates or intervention or any other policy of that sort is that I wonder if  we’ve picked the wrong point  If the strong basic characteristics are still tending to drive the dollar  either down or up as the case may be, I wonder whether we won’t lose in the end--lose a great  deal--in trying to support the dollar at a point that is not its [equilibrium] point  And since I don’t  have any idea where the basic [equilibrium] point ought to be, I have great difficulty myself, of  course      Well, the Chairman was talking about a decline     I was responding to the Chairman’s comment     Suppose that none of these actions occurred  Suppose that there is no   anti-inflationary program, that there is no energy program worthy of the name, and that the tax cut  in the end turns out to be hardly at all for business and almost entirely for consumers      All right  And that Germany and Japan--     Well, I thought your fourth point was expansion abroad  I wasn’t going to   throw that in because I don’t know what would happen     It reminds me of our discussions of extending credit to New York City  That   is, you’re talking about bridging actions, but you don’t have anything that you’re bridging to if in  fact those three things don’t occur  In that case the dollar, I presume, if it is not competitive today,  would have to decline further and we shouldn’t resist it  Would you agree with that?      I reckon     1/17/78             8     Well, you’d need to get some kind of a currency guarantee     That’s right  But I still don’t [fully understand]  Would the bank that’s   buying take an exchange risk?      A dollar security     So the Bundesbank would take the dollar risk?     But we’re seeking a widening in spreads     [Unintelligible] the question when you said the Germans were interested in   mopping up excess liquidity in their economy, because that doesn’t sound like something they  would want to do if they wanted to widen the spread between the dollar markets [and those] in  Germany      Sounds like a down market to me     Bob, an importer, for example, could [cover] his imports not at all or for   three months or for six months or for a year  It makes a tremendous difference in the demand for  the currency  And I don’t know whether you call it speculation or protection      Up to an hour and a half ago      I think I agree with President Volcker that the $500 million in transactions   should be the limit  It was intended as the limiting constraint on operations without consulting the  Committee  The other is sort of like the national debt limit; it is just hit because [the Desk] might  run into [it in the course of executing transactions within] the $500 million which it is otherwise  permitted to do with Subcommittee consultations  So I think [the limit] ought to be raised to  $1750 billion for the outstanding debt  That’s about right, roughly     1/17/78             17     The material in the Greenbook is consistent with the Chart Show, I take it    There is a price projection and a profits projection in the Greenbook     I think it’s a little hard to speculate  I don’t know what Steve would say but   the key role here will be played by the Home Loan Bank Board since we have to maintain a 1/4  point differential against the Home Loan Bank Board  That means they have the veto power on an  increase in rates  If inflows are sufficiently poor or show clear prospects of being poor, I think the  Home Loan Bank Board might conceivably agree to an increase in ceiling rates  It’s one of those  things that is easier said than done, Bob, but I can understand it  I think if there is a clear need for  it, probably the Home Loan Bank Board, with extensive coordinating committee discussion and so  forth, might agree to some limited increase in the rate ceilings      I believe the staff assumption is that the increase [will occur] March 1     Oh, I think for some category it would be a half point  A quarter point seems   so small relative to the problem  But it might not be across the board; it might just be for a  particular category      Cost to the S&Ls  They probably would argue that the cost of raising the   rate in terms of the drain on funds otherwise available to go into reserves would exceed the cost to  the S&Ls of having some outflow of funds  That has to assume a willingness to let the home  builders go, but in the last tight money period they let the home builders go      The Home Loan Bank Board has just lost their economic staff  I don’t know   whom we’d talk to over there     Seconded     That helps on that     Well, Mr Chairman, I must admit that I am happy that we don’t have to   focus on the longer-range targets--if I may use the term--at this time, because I have some qualms  about the economic situation that may be somewhat resolved in a month  On the other hand, they  may not be  But within a month we’ll have the specific formulation for the tax program from the  Administration and will see what the Congressional response is  We will have whatever kind of  anti-inflation program is going to be proposed and, again, will be able to evaluate it and see what  the response is  We might even see whether momentum is possible again on getting some energy  legislation, which right now we--or at least I--have really very little feel for since Congress hasn’t  returned to Washington at this point      First of all let me say I agree with Governor Coldwell that in the very short run the outlook is   good for rising output, rising activity, simply in reaction to that stupendous surge in retail sales in  the fourth quarter of the year  I do believe that production has run behind final sales and now there  will be an upward adjustment in production in response to that final sales number  That may,  however, [result] in rapid inventory accumulation if at the same time final sales flatten out, which  they quite possibly could do  So, the concern I have has to do with the second half of the year, not  the first half of the year  And there I’m a little disturbed by capital spending prospects  They  haven’t come along as well as I expected  I was disappointed by that plant and equipment  expenditure survey, too  The stock market is very bad, really  That price earnings ratio on Jim’s  chart is fantastically poor; it’s even below what people used to think was a conventional price  earnings ratio in the ’30s  And that’s not a very good indication of the prospect of the kind of  business confidence that would lead to rising capital spending      I’m also very concerned about the mortgage market  We have said and I’ve said at times that   there was an awful lot of excess credit being [generated] in the mortgage market and, therefore, the  mortgage market could decrease in size significantly without greatly affecting the prospects for  housing  But again, the chart Jim--or maybe it was Jerry--presented this morning on the housing  area gives me pause  For example, it shows that the volume of homes sold has reached 5 million  units  Now, if you assume 5 million units and an average value of $40,000, which isn’t too far  from a [likely] average--I don’t have one specifically in mind--that would be $200 billion a year   There is an association, I am sure, in the turnover of used houses to support new home sales just as  there is an association in the car market with used car sales supporting new car purchases  So I’m  not sure there is as much fluff in that mortgage market as we have conveniently imagined  I hope  to have some work done on that in the next month to see whether that’s a reasonable prospect or  not  So, in fact, if you had a rather considerable drop in willingness on the part of mortgage lenders  to lend, you could have a rather sizable expectational and then real impact, I think, on the new     1/17/78             32  housing market  I’m also impressed by that chart on outstanding mortgage commitments at savings  and loans  They have gone up like a rocket  The total outstanding commitments seem now to be  about $32 or $33 billion      $34 billion  If I were a savings and loan, and I had this many commitments   outstanding and I suddenly became more concerned about my cash flow, my reaction would be to  stop making new commitments  And that could have quite a pronounced effect, it would appear  I’m a little concerned  I’m just not sure how this housing area is developing  It could be on the  weak side      I’ve said before that I was bothered by the prospect--what I consider the unlikely prospect--   that there would be another year of very high car sales  The staff forecasts are pretty high for car  sales, even though in that chart they had on car sales it looked like an irregular downward zig-zag  movement as 1977 went on  And I was interested in the note in the Redbook, Bob, that there seems  to be quite a lot of doubt about sustaining sales out there in your area, as expressed by the Detroit  economists too, I believe      Then finally, I was wondering some months ago how the weakness in the foreign situation   would come to affect us  It is now more obvious that it can come to affect us  Our balance of trade  has not shown any improvement; that continued to deteriorate as the [past] year has gone on and  apparently may deteriorate, or at least not improve, in the immediate future  The price of that has  been a surplus of dollars in international markets that has caused the dollar to decline, is going to  accelerate domestic inflation, is causing concern abroad, and may be the source of instability in  world economies  I  believe that our staff has a projection of accelerating growth abroad in the  coming year--by about 1 percentage point or something like that you said yesterday, Ted  [You  expect] some acceleration in growth, yet as I look at the charts we have on industrial production  and employment and things like that, they’re not moving anywhere  So I wonder about whether  that might continue to be a very grave source of concern and maybe even an exacerbated concern  as the year goes on     The final point I want to make, Mr  Chairman, is that I also think there is a rather hefty   allowance for the immediate impact of a tax package in the projection  It’s quite a bit considering  the offsets in rising tax rates and social security and unemployment compensation and so forth  It  seems to me, just judging it without having seen the work that went into it, a rather higher  multiplier than we experience on average; it may well be a time when we will get a lower  multiplier than average     So I guess I feel that the immediate outlook is okay  I’m not prepared to say that there is   likely to be a recession by the end of the year, but I do think that there are problems in the outlook  as ’78 goes on  And when we get into ’79 we may in fact get to that point where the growth rate is  so low that the economy tends to stall       1/17/78             33   You would do 2 basis points on [transactions by] both SOMA and the New   York Fed?     Really qualified?     I would agree with that  I think it’s very [important] to avoid [options] 1  or   2, not because of the operations that are engaged in here, but I just don’t like having a precedent of  using the open market account to support an activity   Because once you support this activity, you  can support other activities and I think that’s the reason for avoiding 1 and 2  I think 4 is probably  a little better than 3      Peter, it seems to me that that was an awfully large market adjustment to the   news over that weekend--one of the largest I can ever recall, as a matter of fact  Do you think it  was because quite a few people thought that 7 percent would be the target?  And as they focus in on  6-3/4 percent, is there a chance of more of a rally in that market?      It has backed down some     I guess every bill and even the intermediates have backed down a little     Well, Mr Chairman, with a sigh, I would admit that this is no time to back   the money market down--it having made this very difficult transition to a somewhat tighter  condition  I think we have set in stage forces that may weaken [economic activity in] the second  half of the year, particularly in the housing and mortgage area  And I would say that the rate  structure is still in a very sensitive state in any event  That is, to me at this particular point and  assuming there isn’t a change in Regulation Q, I think the Committee needs to assume no change  over the next month  There could be one, but it’s a hard thing to bring about  There’s quite a  difference between a 6-3/4 and a 7 percent funds rate  There’s a lot more difference between 6-3/4  and 7 than there is, say, between 5 and 5-3/4 or something like that because we’re in such a  sensitive state  I also would like to point out that some of the numbers that have been floated  around indicate on the aggregates really quite a restrictive policy if in fact we have a 12 percent  nominal GNP  Was it 12 percent nominal GNP, Steve?  Is that what you said?      You might expect that we would get M1 growth of as much as 10 percent in   the quarter  It may be less than that but the odds will be in the direction of a high number  On M2,  although Paul was talking about overshooting, I find that in the fourth quarter--that is, from  September to December--the annual rate of increase was under 7 percent  Now, a lot of people  have identified M2 growth roughly with nominal GNP growth  That certainly wouldn’t hold for a  quarter, but I think if you’ve got  nominal GNP running around 12 and M2 running around 7, say,  for an extended period, that would certainly indicate future difficulty for the economy that we  would be bringing about  I don’t see that we are over-utilizing our resources or that the prospects  for a boom are so strong that that kind of crunch policy is called for at this time     To sum it up my view would be that we ought to have a money market directive because of   the great importance of the interest rate level at this particular juncture, so we might as well be  forthright and say that the range is 6-3/4 percent for a bottom and I wouldn’t want to go over 7  percent for the top, with a 6-3/4 “midpoint”  And I would accept the idea that under those  circumstances we could perhaps reduce the range for M1 to 5 points, to 3 to 8 percent, although     1/17/78             47  [given] where we start out--at the bottom of our federal funds rate range--the lower numbers on  those aggregates don’t mean much because we’re not going to ease unless we have a special  meeting of the Committee or a wire from the Chairman or something like that  So again, I would  take 6-3/4 to 7 percent, with a midpoint of 6-3/4 and a money market directive with aggregates  ranges of 3 to 8 and 5 to 9 for M1 and M2 [respectively]      That’s a low end on average   "
624,1978-02-28,"  The first function is related to the conditions of the marketplace   And, as I   say, we did discuss actively with the Bundesbank this [issue of] when they might pick up some  marks for us but the conditions were not right  The second consideration--I=ll say it because it was  discussed earlier on--is this question of relative profits and losses  But that is not the first objective      Well, I think there are two questions here and they=re really aspects of the   same question  The one that was raised by Frank Morris about the Desk exceeding its limit is  whether there needs to be an intra-day limit on gross transactions  I think perhaps there does, but I  do think as a matter of strategy it is desirable sometimes to show your presence and then to offset it  later in the day  And I believe that is exactly what happened on Friday  You had a large gross but  the net wasn=t very big for the day  You apparently sold in the morning and bought in the afternoon  and largely offset [the sale]  And I think that kind of thing is to be encouraged where it can be,  particularly with the market as volatile as it is between Europe and New York  As the day  progresses, that offsetting of gross sales--to the extent it can be accommodated--I think is desirable;  it reduces the net exposure on the day  Then extending that thought to Governor Jackson=s  [question], I think over time you also want to be looking for opportunities where you can reduce  the net exposure position  I=m sympathetic, I believe, with the idea of relenting on the daily gross  limit but I don=t think I would do away with it entirely because I imagine we could get very, very  large gross figures  We might even have a very large gross figure that you expect to offset later in  the day and you can=t offset it  So it can lead in a way to an exposure that=s unanticipated  But  given the kind of markets we have, I think a $100 million limit on gross [transactions] is probably  too low      Seconded     We could just pay it back     But what difference does it make, Alan?  If we take a loss on this one, we get   a profit on something else     Would the latter come up, particularly with this 2-year thing?     Would you or Alan like to comment on the scale of operations point that   Henry made?  Would you say that the scale of operations has increased over time relative to the  scale of disorder?      Well, I question that, Mr Chairman  Do you [at the Desk] think that you=re   defending, say, 204 more strongly than you defended 207?  I put it in your terms, I think         2/28/78           13   The reason I asked the question was that I didn=t have the same impression   that Henry had  It was, as Scott said, a very quiet period for the most part since the last meeting  and it was only with this new wave of selling of the dollar that our operations have picked up again   So I was a little surprised at your comment, Henry      Oh, yes, but the 70 is less than the 90     I said, “Did you defend it [more strongly]?”         2/28/78           14   It=s a bit like trading in bills, I think--the old argument  You=re supplying, I   guess, much needed or much desired foreign currencies through your swaps and there will be  arbitrage between the currencies  And the question is  Do you get more by trading in a range of  currencies or in only one currency and assuming the market will make the arbitrage?  It’s a lot like  the bills only--       That would give you about $350 million in leeway if we went to $2 billion?     Yes, but they=re $100 million under that now     Mr Chairman, I would prefer, I think, not to do it through that device  We   have a $300 million limit on the Desk before the Subcommittee, as I understand, needs to approve  an increase, and I would rather see us reduce that $300 million  But I think this [issue] of overall  exposure is properly a full Committee responsibility and I think the full Committee ought to  discuss whether it wants to have an exposure of as high as $2 billion, rather than leaving it to the  Subcommittee  I would be agreeable to the $2 billion        Yes     Well, it=s $1,750 million now, as I understand it, and the proposal is to raise   it to $2 billion, which would give the Desk in practical terms $350 million leeway  That leeway,  however, could be constrained by the Subcommittee      And I think $2 billion is suitable  I hope you don=t use it, but as a matter of   protection, I think we need to give you that [leeway]    SPEAKER(?)  I would second that     You could go over that on a really bad day     Well, Mr Chairman, I’ll start today by saying that I agree with the staff   projection  I think it presents a very reasonable configuration  I had felt earlier that the car sales  and housing starts figures were a little high and I think now they’re very much in accord with my  expectations of the most probable [outcome] for the economy as the year goes on  [The staff  projection] does call for only about a 4-1/2 percent rate of growth on a fourth-quarter-to-fourth- quarter basis, which is very close to the CEA projection contained in the Economic Report--maybe  a trifle lower, but just a very trifle lower than the CEA  I think we can take that to be, in the  absence of anything else, an indication of Administration desires as well as the projection of the  Council [of Economic Advisers]      I do think that there are some uncertainties in the situation that lead me to say that there is   also a chance that the economy will be weaker than projected  Jim did not mention the stock  market  The stock market continues to bother me quite a bit  There has been a fairly [large]  decline in the six weeks since the last Committee meeting and I think it indicates a continuing lack  of confidence about the prospect for business and the prospect for business profits that can be       2/28/78           20  undermining in effect  I agree with the thrust of Jim=s comment that we ought to have a sharp  recovery from what seems to have been a weather-induced and an energy-induced shortfall here  earlier this year, but I=m not quite as sanguine as he was  Sometimes strange things happen in the  course of the dynamics of a slowdown that can affect the subsequent recovery  In particular, what  bothers me is the fact that incomes are also being negatively [affected]  And an income loss, even  temporary in the first instance--if it feeds through to demand and smaller sales--can have the  beginnings of a change [or of a] groundswell in the economy  So I do think there are some  questions      I also continue to be bothered very much by the world outlook, which hasn=t been touched on   That=s not so much the declining value of the dollar which is, I think, inflationary in its character  for the United States  But I still don=t see clear signs of a [foreign] recovery of the sort that is  anticipated and underlies the trade deficit estimates and so forth in the Greenbook  So I think there  are some questions about the economy that we=ll have to look at very carefully as the weeks pass   But I agree that the most probable course is that there will be a quite moderate, continuing  expansion, barely enough to reduce the unemployment rate over the next year or so      I heard [about it] just yesterday, incidentally  I had an inquiry from the   homebuilders  They want to object to the use of this thing because it is diverting funds from the  thrifts to the banks, presumably on the presumption that people won=t pay the taxes      You mean the bank is violating--     Well, Mr Chairman, I thought long and hard about this, too  I=m bothered by   the same kinds of arithmetic that bothered Governor Wallich, and I really don=t know what to do  about it because I think psychologically it would be a bad time to increase the upper limit of the  M1 range  But the arithmetic is that we should anticipate here in the next four quarters a rise of  certainly 11 or maybe 11-1/2 percent in nominal GNP  The comment around the table today was  that the staff=s inflation rate may be understating what will occur  We certainly know that there=s a  built-in inflation rate of some considerable size resulting from the cost increases [in] the labor  contracts that have been negotiated and will pay off regardless in this period to come  It calls for a  very large rise in velocity to be able to be within the 4 to 6-1/2 percent range and to be able to  accommodate an 11 to 11-1/2 percent [growth in] nominal GNP  And yet not to do so--not to  accommodate for that--certainly means rising interest rates and a change in the whole economic  outlook  That is a rise of size in interest rates and a change in the whole economic outlook that will  unfortunately affect real activity as well as prices  In fact, every [study] that=s ever been done  suggests that the immediate short-run effect will be more on real activity than prices  I wish it were  not so, but that=s what every bit of analysis indicates     So, although I also feel that we will have difficulty keeping M1 within the 4 to 6-1/2 percent   range, I guess I=d rather continue with it for the time being, and if necessary err a little on the high  side as time goes on  I really don=t see any other short- to intermediate-run strategy that the  Committee can follow  I wouldn=t narrow that range  If  anything, I would widen the range if I  were making a change because I think so much depends on assumptions on institutional changes  and on velocity and so forth that we can=t with any conscientiousness say that we understand what,  within a couple of points, is the right money supply increase for the economy to have      On M2, I would make the same point that Governor Jackson did  You have to remember that   a large part of [M2], an increasing part of that, is not subject to Regulation Q ceilings  And we=ve  seen some very large increases in large non-negotiable CD sales at the banks and indeed, you  remember, it even includes negotiable CDs if they=re issued by other than the 350 largest banks  So       2/28/78           36  I think there is more room for expansion there than traditional analysis may suggest on the basis of  interest rate relationships  Therefore, I think we=re safe enough to leave that at 6-1/2 to 9  I would  leave it in any event because of this tendency for a good many rather simple analysts to draw an  identity between M2 and GNP growth  I think they would become really quite agitated at a  reduction in the M2 range so that the top, and thus the implied increase in nominal GNP, is below 9  percent      Well, there are a lot of them in the Street and among the monetarists and   even in academic circles  On M3, I would be sympathetic with Bob Mayo=s point of view, except  that I don=t really believe that the House Banking Committee is the group to tell that growth will be  a lot less unless we can get an increase in Regulation Q ceilings  I think it would just cause trouble  for the House Banking Committee, whereas the person that has to be told that sits in an office in  another building in town  And there the problem is to convince them rather than just to assert it     So I guess I=m being a coward today, but I think I would just cut the M3 range by 1/2 point as   the Chairman has suggested, realizing that that may be high because it does probably require an  increase in some sensitive area of Regulation Q ceilings by midyear  There, too, though, I think  there might be a tendency to be overly affected by the very poor savings inflow figures that  generally are inherent for February  They seem to me too radically lowered to reflect only interest  rate differentials  There must be something else going on there, but it=s probably an aberration and  I think we=ll probably get some recovery in thrift institutions in the period yet to come  So, for all  those longish reasons, Mr Chairman, I support exactly, I believe, what you proposed  But for M3,  I would only cut the range by 1/2 point--that is, to 7-1/2 to 10 percent, simply because I think it  would cause more trouble than it=s worth to cut it a full point at this stage      I only feel cowardly on M3, I think     It wouldn=t be for a long time anyhow     May I make only a comment with [regard to] setting bank credit?  I think it=s   not such a very good strategy to be raising the bank credit range at the same time we cut the M3  range      We never sell agencies?     Peter, could we sell to the Federal Financing Bank?     We can do that, Mr Chairman--or perhaps [consider] institutional credit,   which is quite [unintelligible] to M3     It depends on how much volatility there is     When we [discuss] the difficulty with the aggregates, everyone is assuming   that March may be a very strong month  What if the coal strike goes on?  March could be a very  low month  I think there are so many uncertainties in the picture that we can=t really, within a  range of 10 points, say what M1 is likely to do in the month of March  I like Paul=s suggestion  because I think it is the truth  We aren=t likely to cut the funds rate below 6-3/4 percent unless  something really dramatic happens--in which case undoubtedly there would be a conference call   And we aren=t likely to put the funds rate above 7 in this three-week interval, particularly since for  half of it we won=t know what the coal miners are going to do  Therefore, it is a strict  old-fashioned money market conditions situation and we ought to recognize it as that and have a  very small range on the funds rate  I don=t really care [about the aggregates ranges]; I would be  prepared not to have any aggregates ranges for this three-week interval because I just don=t think  they are at all reliable  But I suppose that=s too dramatic a change, so I would take the alternative B  aggregates as a good proxy for a wide range of the possible experience      He does very well     Mr Broida wants to [comment]     I might note, Mr Chairman, that page 1 shows that over the last six weeks   the Manager has deviated from plus 5 basis points to minus 3 basis points from a 675 percent  average, so I think it=s safe enough to say about the current level      I can=t believe that myself     Yes     Or go above 7       2/28/78           53   "
663,1978-03-21,"  Scott, you didn’t buy anything at anytime during this period?     Would you anticipate, on a rising market, buying some marks?     You said there was one period in which [the dollar] went up 5 percent     The market was very thin, I take it     With less intervention overall?     In a quantitative sense     It’s their domestic tax level That [and the fact that their] exports are much   less expensive     [Accept a] lower growth rate in the domestic economy in order to keep the   dollar up?   Is that what you are saying?      I’m amazed that that would be a view in the Administration     What if it goes up again?     Well, I think I feel the same way  I understand, Alan, that to the extent   $200 million is twice $100 million it will be less limiting than before  But it doesn’t seem a very     3/21/78              12  satisfactory solution to just say that the limit has stopped us so we will raise the limit  I can’t  understand--but I don’t know all of the details--why we can’t measure in algebraic terms  That is,  [we could measure] from a net short to a net long or from a net long to a net short position in the  course of a day and leave the limit at $100 million       Why?     Well, the net position limits are not being changed       3/21/78              14   Without sharing it     Would this agreement be written down as we understand it?  Will we have   an exchange of letters or what will it be?     You can lose the Secretary of the Treasury overnight     I certainly want to second that, Mr Chairman     I think there is real public exposure here because we’re using public money   without a Congressional authorization  Just as the Treasury indicated that they were concerned  about that--      Well, as you say, they can borrow from the IMF     But without Congressional authorization     You never came out of the recession     I’d like to turn Frank Morris’s comment to you, Henry  I think we   shouldn’t be too certain about what’s going on in the labor force or the unemployment rate  I  couldn’t help but note when I looked at the Greenbook that over the last three months the civilian  labor force has increased at an annual rate of 09 percent; over the last year it has increased at an  annual rate of 29 percent   So I’m wondering whether the low indicated unemployment rate for  the last month or two might not be a fluke  That is, to some degree I would expect a reversal  I  don’t think [the unemployment rate] is going to go down as far as in the staff projection  This has  been a very unusual period and, as you say; the rate was totally unforecast--by everyone, I think   I’m inclined to think there are some oddities in these figures, perhaps because of the weather or  some kind of seasonal aberration that has given us some difficulty there  At the same time, I’m not  really concerned about the prospects for the immediate future, Frank      Again, I’m looking at the employment data  I was interested in the large figures on payroll   employment; I’ve felt that there might be an aberration in the last couple of months or that they  might reflect the government programs  So I looked at the increase in establishment employment  in the last six months in the BLS series and I find that over that period the gain for the total  establishment series was somewhat larger--267,000 per month--than it was in the last year  Then I     3/21/78              31  looked at the private nonfarm data--to take out the state and local and the effect of these temporary  employment programs--and I find that it was still larger over the last six months than it was over  the last year, at an average monthly rate of 233,000 as against an average of 227,000 for 1977   Then I looked at it for manufacturing alone and I find that there, too, it has been larger over the last  six months, on average, than it was over the past year  And it’s larger for production workers  within manufacturing  I agree with you that a lot of these indicators are no good right now  And in  the absence of decent indicators, I’m inclined to think that when people hire employees they have  something in mind for them because it’s a big commitment  It’s true that we haven’t seen it in  production yet, but I think that kind of sustained strength--not over a month or two but over the last  six months, for the whole fall and winter period--in employment growth in what I consider to be  the better BLS payroll series suggests that there ought to be good strength in the economy in the  period immediately to come  So I certainly am watching, too  I very well remember that 1959-60  experience but for now I’d have to say that the outlook for the immediate term is pretty strong,  even though I expect the unemployment rate to go up again      Well, if you believe those figures          Yes     They don’t generally buy anything but bills or something shorter, right?       3/21/78              40   We ought to encourage them     Why don’t you tell him what was wrong with the benchmarks?  The FDIC   just made gross errors in their calculations  They did it on the weekly samples, too     Well, Roger, it’s a little hard to do when market rates are drifting down      I missed the Board meeting on that subject      That’s really a very narrow range on inflation--[66] to 7 percent     I think we’d want a wider range than that     Certainly     You’re right  Absolutely    SPEAKER(?)  How about using “precipitous”?  [Laughter]     But a very much constrained one     And you’re recommending the alternative C ranges for the aggregates?      Well, I don’t take great exception to the figures that are being cited, but I  certainly do to some of the language that’s being used  I don’t think this is a good time to take  advantage and move  What have we learned?  We’ve learned that this morning the fourth-quarter  GNP has been revised downward for the second time and that the first-quarter GNP will be at best  3-1/2 percent and could well be below that  We don’t know whether the coal strike is settled or not  at this point  What we see, as Frank pointed out earlier, is weakness in numbers that we have on  the economy at this point  And I just don’t think the public would understand at all our talking  about seeing this as an advantageous time to move up interest rates  Now, if we’re forced to move  up interest rates because the aggregates are strong, that’s a different matter  But I think that’s the  only basis that we have right now for contemplating any kind of tightening move      I don’t much like to look back and say Well, what would growth have been with the old   seasonal?  If we do that, you know, we’re playing a game all the time  What is the real number?  Will it please stand up?  If you look back at the old seasonals, you would say that February was  very weak because, after all, we added 3 points to February with the revision in the seasonal factor  I do think it’s possible to say that, having made corrections to the seasonal factors, we now should  regard a strong month as a more serious proposition than a strong month was previously  And in  that sense, a substantial burst in the money numbers in April--which is strictly a projection on the  part of the staff because they don’t have any data whatsoever but only the instinct that the numbers  are likely to move up--would be a damaging development and one that would give us a basis for  tightening a bit  And I think that’s what we have to ride on      I also don’t like the idea of cutting these ranges as much as has been suggested pretty   generally because I don’t know that we have a more stable series than we previously had  If you  look at the seasonal factor adjustments for last year for M1--the seasonal factor adjustments alone  without regard to sign--you’ll find that the average error was over 2 points  That isn’t the kind of  situation in which we should significantly narrow the ranges that we’re asking the Manager to look  at because, as Chairman Burns used to say, 4 is really 8 in this series  And there is a lot to be said  for that--4 may be 8 and 8 may be 4  I think we’ve just had a very fine demonstration in those  seasonal factor adjustments, if in fact, they are correct  However, I would be prepared on this  occasion, because we are dealing with the possibility of a large April, to reduce the range to 4  points  Since we have a relatively moderate indication for March, we have to guard against the  possibility of a quite large April  It’s not a question of a small number as against a large number,  but of a moderate number presently projected for March and then a possibly large number for  April Also, I think perhaps a little bit of bias in the specification of the aggregates might be  prudent at this time since we are so concerned about inflation and the possibility of a new upsurge  in the aggregates     The ranges I put down are 4 to 8 for M1, which is the same as yours, Mr  Chairman, except   that I cut a point off the top  And I think I would want the M2 range to be narrower than the M1  range  I would put that at 6 to 9, which is a reasonable rate of increase  I think our experience  [suggests] that we ought to have a somewhat smaller range on M2 as a matter of convention than     3/21/78              56  on M1  And 6-1/2 to 7 is okay by me on the funds rate  Even with that narrow funds range, I  would recommend an aggregates directive because I think our posture--if it is true that we’re into a  period where we’re likely to be coping with large aggregates and upward pressure on interest rates- -is better with an aggregates directive than it is with a money market directive      What is the midpoint of that higher range, Alan?  What do you interpret to   be the midpoint of that higher range--7 percent?     If the aggregates came in on the upside     I wouldn’t be prepared to do that without talking in order to take it above 7   percent  I think we really ought to consult before we go above 7  We may need to do so  [We]  biased our specs on these aggregates so that we have a greater chance of being quite high on them,  and it gives us an opportunity--      Second     We’ve never done it, though     Is this [like] the British deal, Henry?  Was this done for the British?       3/21/78              63 "
687,1978-04-18,"  Did you buy any in the last two days?      Scott, it is not only that  You have $2 billion in debt to pay off      I thought these were secret      All right, Mr Chairman  We have a brief report here      That is right  We have a brief report here and I’m sure everybody has read it,  so I won’t go into it in any detail except to say that, after meeting and giving a good deal of  attention to the proposal from Ernie and also to the letter of endorsement from President Roos, the  subcommittee still felt that it could not support the proposal mainly because of the dangers [we  perceived  One was the danger] to the System in terms of a further loss of credibility if in fact we  could not achieve a targeted level--presumably reductions--of growth in the aggregates  [Second  was a] danger to the economy in the case where we felt that our credibility was so important that  we had to succeed even in the face of economic pressures that would clearly indicate the need for  more monetary growth     I just might remind the Committee that our performance with respect to the 1-year ranges has  not been particularly good  So one wonders whether the markets, seeing what that performance has  been, would put a great deal of faith in a 3-year projection of our plans  And this business of the  markets putting faith in the projection is terribly important because [without that] there is no chance  whatsoever that in fact contracts would be written with a view toward less inflation and less  monetary growth [or that] inflationary pressures originating from the cost side would be diminished  unless the market did feel that we were going to do that  If we had a situation in which the  contracts continued to be written on the presumption of cost-push pricing and of continued     4/18/78             7  inflationary forces and we continued with our attempt to get the aggregates down, it seems to me  that there is an obvious clash that could cause real difficulty for the economy  So we just think that  the problems are too great to go ahead with this in any kind of an announcement or any kind of a  position we would take publicly     I might also mention that we are a little uncertain at this stage as to what the Humphrey-  Hawkins bill will require  As it came out of the House there seems to be an inconsistency  That is,  we are asked to report our 1-year targets and what those 1-year targets mean for a 5-year plan of  the economic performance as issued by the Administration  In one version on the Senate side our  requirement to link up with the 3rd, 4th, and 5th years of the [Administration’s] plan has been  dropped, but it is conceivable that it would go the other way and they would ask us also for a plan  that would be consistent with the Administration’s goals for a 5-year period  With the uncertainty  as to what might develop in the Humphrey-Hawkins area and the obvious cosmetic character that  probably will accompany much of that Humphrey-Hawkins material, we feel it might be   embarrassing and dangerous also to have an independent 3-year plan that is being projected  So we  can’t support the Baughman proposal     We would, however, stress that there probably does need to be more attention devoted to the  question of the longer-term implications of the monetary policy that we are following than the  Committee has given  So our proposal is that the staff emphasize more than before the possible  scenarios--problematical and indefinite as they are--that might result from different monetary  postures  Jim  Kichline has a memo today to the Committee that extends [the outlook] over three  years in something like the old fashion, but it is somewhat expanded from what it used to be  We  think that ought to be continued and perhaps other scenarios presented also to the Committee for its  consideration of the possible effects over the longer run of what it is doing right now  I think that  completes my report, Mr Chairman  Perhaps President Volcker and President Eastburn would like  to add their own views      Equal time, at least, Ernie      I think the scenario kind of thing that I was talking about, Phil, you wouldn’t  want to do every quarter        Well, Phil and I had a general opening discussion with Home Loan Bank  Board members just last week and I thought it was a very agreeable discussion  We didn’t get  down to specifics, but I think they recognized that they have a potential problem  And they are  looking at options--at things that might be done to improve the attractiveness of savings and loan  instruments that are offered  So I would say that the chances are not zero  They could be better  than zero in the event that market interest rates rise considerably  Now, what happened there was  that they got excited about it--as I did for that matter--in January and did some thinking about it but  then short-term rates eased off in February and early March, so for the moment they’ve got it on the  back burner      But I think [the discussion] was reasonably encouraging  Would you agree  with that, Philip?      Starting in the latter part of this year?     4/18/78             17      I have something of the same feeling that Frank does  I can’t find fault with  the staff projections; indeed, they have moved most things the same way I would have moved  them Unfortunately, I would have put the inflation rate up, as they did; I would have recognized  that the trade deficit is going to be bigger, as they did; and I would have tended to cut down the rate  of real growth over the whole expansion period, as they did  I might not have reduced the trade- weighted exchange value of the dollar as far as Ted did because I think the financial flows are so  important in determining that; it hasn’t been all that closely associated with the trade experience in  my view  So I would have moved in the same direction as the staff did in each case except that last  one      But I would put in the caveat--and maybe Frank meant it as a caveat--that it is possible that  we are going to get a much stronger economy in the short run than is in the staff projections  There  are dynamics in change and the change is very rapidly upward  It’s partly catch-up, but it is still  upward  I pointed out last month how strong our employment data were  We have added another  month’s data since then and that has come in even stronger--on the establishment series on  employment  Of course that employment generates income, which generates sales, which leads to  a demand for production  There is a circularity there that could give us more of a dynamic increase  over this spring and summer than is in the staff projection  And we need to be concerned about that  because it can be quite destabilizing at this point  I also have to say that it seems to me as I go  through the year--the 5-quarter projection that the staff has--that the end point of the projection     4/18/78             21  presents a situation of instability in every figure of importance  Now, I am not [inclined] to think  that a 58 percent unemployment rate represents full employment, as Henry does and apparently as  Frank does  But what I think [is] really so very important is an unemployment rate leveling off at  58 and tending to drift up as it does in the still longer-run model projection that Mr Kichline  presented in memo form  That is unacceptable to most people in Congress  It is unacceptable, I  think, to the Administration  It is unacceptable to the drafters of the Humphrey-Hawkins bill and it  is probably unacceptable to large segments of the population  So if that rate stops there or even  starts to look as if it is going to go up, it is going to bring further action that we don’t have in our  staff projection and that we can’t quite anticipate     Likewise, I think a 7 to 7-1/2 percent rate of inflation, which is the projection for the first and  second quarters of l979 is unstable  I agree with Mark that an intensification in the rate of inflation  as the year goes on, as is projected here, will almost certainly bring larger wage gains and larger  price increases as we get into l979  The Teamsters’ contract is one of the first major ones up in  l979; it’s in March  And I believe the head of the Teamsters is already on record as saying that his  objective is [to match] the coal miners’ settlement  That is going to be the kind of labor  environment I think we will have if we have this much inflation over the period  And I can’t say  that we won’t, I am sorry to say  So I think on beyond maybe the very end of the projection stage  we will probably have more inflation in prospect than seems implied by these figures, though I  can’t say that with certainty at this point     Finally, I would say that the financial markets look [likely] to me to be more unstable by then  than is suggested  We have in Jim’s Chart Show presentation that chart on GNP and interest rates  in which we have a level of bill rates that is about as high as it was at the peak in l974  In l974 the  financial markets were certainly in turmoil  Now, maybe there is some adjustment to a higher level  of rates as time goes on  Nevertheless, I would remind you that in l974 housing starts were 1  million and in l975 they were 115 million  That is the kind of market response we got from that  level of interest rates then  Also, just looking at that relationship between GNP and M1 at the top  of that chart, I’d say that the implied increase of velocity is very, very large  And I don’t know  whether, in fact, we would get that relationship with only a rise to the 8 percent rate levels that are  projected  It might take more if in fact we are to have that M1 and GNP relationship  So, Mr  Chairman, my feeling is that the projection is okay as a statement of what is probable, at least in  early l979, though there could be more strength in the interim than is projected  But we have a  major problem developing in the economy on all fronts with regard to all components that are in  the staff projections  I am in a quandary because I don’t have any proposition to make to the  Committee that would rectify this      I guess we had better work on that problem!      Well, I would support leaving the ranges where they are, too  But I do want  to point out that the implication of that is that we will have a good deal tighter money than we  previously were thinking about because if everyone agrees--and I think virtually everyone did -- that the inflation rate is likely to be higher, the chances are very strong that nominal GNP growth  will be higher  If that is so, it is going to be very difficult in the case of M1 to stay within this 4 to  6-1/2 percent range  And it is going to imply very much higher interest rates as the spring and  summer go on than we have had  Now, M2 I think we are safe enough in leaving where it is  because I would point out again that there are quite a few time deposit components of M2 that are     4/18/78             30  not subject to interest rate ceilings and they have been growing quite rapidly and will probably  continue to grow quite rapidly  So that I think we can do  It probably would be theoretically most  appropriate to cut M3 although we were told last week, Phillip, that the S&Ls are going to start to  push--and the Home Loan Bank Board is going to encourage them to push--the sale of large CDs,  which are also not subject to interest ceilings  So if they are successful in marketing these, that  might mean that M3 will do a little better than the staff is expecting  So I think I would prefer to  leave it and to fall low and to say afterwards that we fell low because the interest rates that were  being paid by the thrifts were not high enough to be able to compete in the market circumstances  I  would stay with [the current ranges] but I do want to point out that it means in all probability a very  substantial rise in interest rates as the spring and summer go on      Is 7 to 10 percent what is being proposed here?      The fact is that we can’t do much about it if it comes through higher, so  perhaps we ought to try to put it where it is likely to be      I think I agree with Paul that the formal expression ought to be a personal  view but that informally you can certainly indicate the range of diversity in the Committee or a  general consensus of the Committee [if our views are] not far different  The reason I think the  formal expression should be personal is that I think you will be better able on your own to handle  the projection of recession that will eventually come than have it be a Committee vote, so to speak,  that a recession is in prospect  [The latter] carries with it policy implications in the minds of many  Congressmen  So I think there is great difficulty in that  I also don’t think that we are a  particularly good forecasting panel  So we shouldn’t get into the business      I agree with that      [Unintelligible] if you got zero      We could wait and see what this week’s aggregates look like      I, too, think that maybe the time has come to make a move  And I think we  ought to take advantage of the probability that April will be a month of large growth in the  aggregates to do that  We need to have an explanation and I think that provides us with the  explanation  Also, in a way I agree with Dave that maybe we ought to be a little bolder on the  funds rate than has been suggested  And I agree somewhat with Paul that we ought to have a  somewhat wider range on M1, though I don’t think I’d go all the way back to 6 points from 4  points  Therefore, what I would propose, within the context of a monetary aggregates directive, is  that we take a range for M1 that cuts just a little bit from alternative C on the downside  I would  say 4 to 9 percent  I don’t want to go as far as some have suggested because it does look as if April  is going to be a large month and it is not reasonable to have something that is just totally outside  the [figures] that are possible  And I would take 5-1/2 to 9-1/2, a 4-point range for M2, which I  think is consistent with the M1 numbers that I gave and would mean about the same kind of deposit  expansion as in alternative C  On the funds rate, I would say 6-3/4 to 7-1/2 I don’t really think we  want a funds rate below 6-3/4 and I don’t think there is any sense in having a range that [goes  below] that  My midpoint would also be 7     4/18/78             48      On my 6-3/4 to 7-1/2 percent range, I would move to 7 if this week the  aggregates tend to confirm that April expansion of 10 percent  One other change I think I would  make, Mr Chairman, is in the directive in lines 27 and 28  I think it is a good idea to reverse the  order of the longer-term objectives that we have at this point  What I would say specifically is  “foster bank reserve and other financial conditions that will resist inflationary pressures while  encouraging continued gradual economic expansion and contributing to a sustainable pattern of  international transactions”      It rather shifts the emphasis and yet it leaves in gradual economic expansion  as one of our objectives     SPEAKER(?)  Did you mention an aggregates or money market directive?      A monetary aggregates rather than a money market directive      Well, of course, he can’t do anything for about a week around that financing  and the 6-7/8 is really very little change      You did last time, too!      No, I wouldn’t  I think we ought to go to a 5-point range      I think that is somewhat tied with the funds rate range selection  If you have  a 4 to 8, Paul, that means--if that 10 percent [M1 growth estimate] holds up for April--that 5 or 6  percent in May would touch off the full use of the range to 7-1/2 percent on fed funds  And I really  think that is pretty precipitous  So my feeling, Mr Chairman, is that if we had an 8 percent top, I  would want to [cut] another 1/4 on the funds range; but if we had a 9 percent top, I would be  prepared to go up to 7-1/2 on the fed funds range      Yes  Then there would be no M1 reference      Well, I just don’t think, I can’t ever recall a directive that didn’t refer to M1      But I still don’t--      I would be very much opposed to taking it out    "
705,1978-05-05,"  Well, I would support your recommendation for waiting a week or two, Mr  Chairman  These are extraordinary April numbers and I have the impression that the week of May  3 that Steve was talking about, which is preliminary, could revise considerably  It sometimes has,  either way, in the past  In addition, it does seem to me that the number is so high that it’s giving us  some kind of a false signal  Therefore, I’d like to see it settle down  But I must say that I don’t  think that really has to do with the question of moving on up in due course, because I think we’re  now facing a very real problem  I think the economy has a great deal of strength  When you [add]  460,000 to a nonfarm employment figure that, remember, was already increasing at a very rapid  rate throughout the winter when production wasn’t doing anything, I have the sense of a good deal  more steam in the economy than we may be picking up in comments from businessmen at this  point or seeing in the current statistics  Also, it seems to me that the inflation problem is much  worse than we have previously recognized because I now am convinced in my own mind that food  prices are going to be [rising at a] double-digit [pace] this year  And food prices I’ve always felt  are far and away the most sensitive thing from the standpoint of touching off wage demands and--      You heard nothing at all!  Well, I was just saying that I’m prepared to go  along with the idea of waiting a week or two to move the funds rate to 7-1/2 percent but I think it is  a question of waiting rather than not doing it  The money numbers [may quiet down]  I would  expect them to quiet in time; they always do  Nevertheless, the average is going to be very high for  the second quarter and I believe the economy has a great deal more strength than is now generally  recognized  I also believe that inflation has a great deal more strength, particularly in food prices,  which have such a sensitive effect on wage bargains and wage determinations  So it’s really just a  question of timing more than anything else  I like the idea of getting the discount rate [increase] in  before we take a marked further upward movement in money rates  I think, Paul, what you were  suggesting was what we used to call “err on the side of tightness”  I would construe that to mean  that we resist strongly a reduction in the funds rate below 7-1/4 percent and if it tends to drift up a  little, we might let it go 5 or 10 basis points or even 1/8 point higher if the market is producing  what I think it is quite possible that the market will produce, particularly after the discount rate is     5/5/78              8  moved It may be that a week from now it will be quite easy to slip in the movement up to 7-1/2  percent  But I think even a week’s time is a valuable thing to gain on the Washington scene and it  does permit us to see--along the line of Steve’s argument--whether or not we get a $5 billion  downward revision in that May 3 preliminary number, which would make us look at April  somewhat differently      Well, I think probably Alan could answer the question of the dealer positions  [better] than I can  I would like to give them another few days  Especially with the probability that  we would move 1/2 point, I think we ought to give them just a little [time] to clear out their  inventory  Therefore, I wouldn’t move today and I wouldn’t move Monday  Next Friday I don’t  like because that’s a bad day from the standpoint of fairness because the news system is closed  down essentially for the weekend  So that leaves Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday of next  week I might say that we could move as early as Tuesday, depending on what Alan says about the  dealer positions, except for this question on the coordinating committee  I think we have a clear  chance of being able to get them prepared to do something that will deal to some degree with our  [disintermediation] problem  I know we can’t get it done before Wednesday; in fact, I’m not sure  we can get it done on Wednesday--perhaps Thursday or Friday but more likely the next week  I  think it would be very good strategically if such an overt move as a sizable increase in the discount  rate were either accompanied by or promptly followed by some special efforts to deal with the  disintermediation problem  Therefore, I guess I lean toward Thursday with the possibility of  Wednesday if we can get other things in place fast enough      The exchange markets are doing pretty well, aren’t they?    "
727,1978-05-16,"  I see  The point is that it wouldn’t make any difference ordinarily whether  you got them indirectly or directly from the market  But in this case the Germans would use the  dollars for sterilization purposes        Domestic monetary matter      It retires some of the debt      But I certainly--      I do want to subscribe to [the view expressed by] I think it was Dave, or  maybe Henry, that we ought to move right ahead while we’ve got the chance      Well, I don’t know how cautiously      There’s a difference in emphasis that I particularly subscribe to      Well, I was just going to comment that I would be inclined to say that I don’t  quite know what the natural rate of unemployment means  “Natural” in what sense?  I presume it  means the unemployment rate that would be associated with no acceleration in inflation, in which  case we must already be below the natural rate of unemployment because we’re having the  acceleration in inflation  But if you’re looking at what is achievable, I would say it certainly could  be brought down to 5-1/2 percent and perhaps a little lower  So I disagree with Henry  Just  looking at the age structure, the quality of the labor force, and that kind of thing, I would say it  could go lower  I wanted it to be clear that I disagree with Henry on that point      Well, I’m sorry to say that I don’t think the economy is developing very well  I agree with Frank that the third quarter is a very strategic quarter from the standpoint of what’s  going to happen in the cycle  I don’t think it makes too much difference whether [GNP growth in]  the second quarter is 9 or 10  It’s going to be a big quarter, partly just because of the arithmetic of  the comparisons of the three average months against the three average months  But I’m inclined to  think we are developing the steam for continued rather rapid expansion into the summer, made up  partly of capital spending which I think is taking off  And some of that [unintelligible]  You are  right, Bill; you can’t really do that in a long-term new capital project but things like heavy trucks  apparently--according to the Chicago report that I read yesterday--are in very large demand  There  are a number of things you can spend money on where you don’t need to worry about  [unintelligible] and I think we are getting a surge beginning now in capital spending      I’m also inclined to think that some consumers at least are more inclined to spend in  anticipation of inflation than had been the case for the thirty years in the Katona survey because  they have been so badly burned by [inflation] in the past  And finally, I would point out to you that  the staff doesn’t have an inventory cycle  You never project an inventory cycle  There’s no way to  project an inventory cycle  But there is a source of instability that isn’t in the projection--a  considerably bigger buildup in inventory in the summer and the fall and then a retreating from that  next winter or early spring that will bring on a recession in the spring of 1979      Now, I also happen to be even gloomier than Henry about the rate of inflation  I think it’s  going to be very substantial in the period to come  It wasn’t mentioned, but some information that  we received yesterday from the staff you ought to have in your mind  And that is that the inflation  rate that is predicted by the staff is based in part on a decline in the rate of increase in food prices to  the 5 to 6  percent range from here on out  I think it’s more likely to be double that because of meat  prices principally  And that’s going to make a high inflation rate for the year as a whole, which  will then guarantee an even higher inflation rate for 1979 because the wage settlement round that is  coming up is wholly based on this year’s inflation and will be very, very large  I am halfway  inclined to buy your businessmen’s 10 percent expectations for next year on the rate of inflation,  [Mark]  And that’s of course going to upset, as it has done before, real activity and calculations  about the future and in the end consumers’ ability to spend  For some time important segments of  the consumer society won’t keep pace with that   So I think we have probably already set the stage  for a recession next year and one with a relatively high rate of inflation continuing  And finally,  Mr Chairman, I don’t really think that what we are doing in monetary policy will change that rate  of inflation very much one way or the other  It’s going to be high regardless of that      Well, we don’t have to worry about currency right now      Well, I think Steve answered this, but I just wanted to clarify  The precise  figures you gave on M1, Steve, fourth quarter-to-April and April-to-April suggested something like  an unchanged trend rate of growth of 7-1/4 percent  Now, that just happened to be that way  because the last period that you were using was a quite weak GNP period  And I think you said  that you would anticipate that the trend rate of growth in M1 has moved up from that      Into the 8 to 9 percent range      Yes, so that without action to over time impact on the growth of M1, it  would be more than 7-1/4      Well, I’m not really far away from you for a very short-term strategy  But I  think I probably am considerably away from you in terms of what the ultimate result may be  As  many people around this table have probably long suspected--and I shall now admit--I’m not much  of a monetarist      I’ve always looked at [money growth] as an index, as a guide of what we’re  doing rather than a quantity that is of any significance to control in and of itself  But I think at a  stage like this in the business cycle, with these differences that have come to light here this  morning on what may develop after we get through this temporary bulge, that what we especially  have to guard against is the creation of too much credit  We have to be sure that the conditions in  the credit markets are such that if there is a self-generating burst of credit demand--and I must say  that I see some signs of it in business demands for credit and in consumer demands for credit  You  know, the consumer credit increase reported in this last month was the largest ever for one month   We have to be in a position to resist that  For that reason I think the aggregates have significance  as an indirect proxy for that purpose, and that may mean substantially tighter conditions and  substantially higher rates  I am particularly bothered by the fact that the kind of interest rates that  we are talking about may not be at all sufficient if in fact there’s been an  acceleration in inflation  of a point or two since the end of the year  So I do believe that we may have to move and move  substantially as the spring and summer go on      For now we have given the market quite a shock in the increases that we’ve had in the last  several weeks  And we have touched off, certainly, the basis for disintermediation  Perhaps the  new certificate--which is where I put my confidence rather than in the 8-year note--will help  forestall that to a degree  I don’t know  But I think we have given [the market] a shock so I would  say that we ought to go easily and carefully for the period right ahead  I think an 8 percent funds     5/16/78              35  rate is really too high to contemplate unless we again seriously consider the implications of an 8  percent funds rate  So I come out with a fairly narrow funds rate range--7-1/4 to 7-3/4  I would put  the midpoint at 7-3/8, Mr Chairman, which is just about where we are now, but move if in fact the  aggregates seem to be strengthening within the ranges I am going to suggest  The ranges I am  going to suggest are 3 to 8 for M1 and 4 to 9 for M2  I think that does bias the probabilities a little  on the side of our being high in the ranges and, therefore, needing to move up the funds rate but not  greatly because this 19 percent increase was so large in April that we may well have a backup from  that in the period to come  So that’s what I would propose; and I would of course have a monetary  aggregates type directive  No one else has mentioned that, I think       You are specifying an 8 percent funds rate, in other words  Why bother with  the aggregates?      Yes it is  Almost certainly      Just one comment, Frank  On M2, you ought to recognize that those new  certificates go in on June 1 and there could be some stock adjustments [unintelligible]  It’s more  likely at the thrifts than at the banks, but there might be some at the banks      Two-fifths      Is the midpoint 7-3/8 or 7-1/2?      I see  And you wouldn’t want them to go above 7-1/2 no matter how strong  the aggregates        5/16/78              43    But last time we went on Wednesday      I must say that I don’t think people generally recognize that we are at 7-3/8   They may see that we’ve had an average that has been a little above 7-1/4  I think there are a  considerable number of people in Washington who think [our objective] is 7-1/4      That you don’t want to go below that      I think [going to] 7-1/2 is a considerable move  I think we will make it in a  week or 10 days or so, but I don’t--      A week to 10 days, Phil?      All right, I can accept that      Yes, I’d rather not have it in the directive      I realize some people might not like the “mainly,” but since we referred  earlier to money market conditions including foreign exchange market conditions it isn’t correct  unless we have--      But some people might prefer just “guided by”      I don’t understand the purpose of this addition, Mr Chairman      The first sentence of the paragraph says that      That’s why I asked you the second time      Well, I might say, Mr Chairman, as the Chairman of the Subcommittee on  the Directive, that I don’t think the proposal that you made--with the modest word amendments that  I suggested--represents a change in policy or in the prescription for policy and, therefore, I don’t  think it needs to be referred to the Subcommittee on the Directive  I do think the idea of changing  the relative weights given to M1 and M2 is a change in policy and does require referral  In fact, we  have already studied it and concluded that 50-50 is the best we can do  But we will study it again      But as far as your--    "
753,1978-06-20,"  We ought to commend the Desk for a very good job      The proposal is that it be net      I wonder if the Manager has any comments on these proposals      I was wondering particularly, Alan, about [what seems to be] rather a term  of art in subsection C, any operation that might generate a “substantial” volume of trading in a  particular currency      My only point, Scott, is that “substantial” means different things in  different contexts      I just wanted to confirm, Jim, the figures for May that you cited  Although  they are below the earlier figures in the year, they are still pretty high  The production index is  an annual rate of increase of more than 7 percent  Nonfarm employment is growing at 175,000;  that=s more than 2 million a year  I see the retail sales in May were 4 percent above the first  quarter average, which is a 16 percent annual rate of increase  It=s going to take a significant  further moderation in those growth rates, I take it, to be consistent with the GNP projection for  the third and fourth quarters      You mean to say that a 4 percent GNP will be associated with more than 7  percent in production?      Well, perhaps I should have mentioned that, but what about production and  employment?      Like the labor unions      Well, if I had to present a standard forecast, my forecast would be very  much like the staff’s  I think it=s a safe forecast and a reasonable one  Not only that, it=s not  much out of line with other forecasts  But I have to say that I think I=m much closer to Phil  Jackson than I am to the staff forecast  And I do believe, although it=s all right that we put the  numbers out, that we ought to talk about the process  The process is not developing well at this  stage  I think there=s a substantial risk of a period of speculative exuberance and influence in the  period immediately to come that would be followed by significantly weaker conditions, probably  within this year that Philip=s talking about  So the average, looking second quarter to second  quarter, might not be that much different from the staff forecast, but it might be associated with  substantially higher inflation than the 7 percent rate forecast for the second half and substantially  higher GNP growth than the 34 percent rate that is forecast for the second half of this year        Well, I sort of agree with Ernie that consumers are going to stay in there  and buy for a longer period because they=ll figure that it=s their last opportunity to do so in what  looks like an inflationary environment  I think housing demand is very strong  As for business--  maybe I=m being misled by the Redbook--the Redbook reports sound to me a good deal stronger  in tone than the staff projection with regard to capital spending  They=re not yet talking in the  Redbook about inventory accumulation, but I would expect that also to occur in the period  immediately ahead  And I just don=t see the inflation rate slowing down that much  Today  Alcoa [announced] a 61 percent increase on flat roll products, which is a large part of their line   It’s their second raise of the year and they had the gall to say that they thought it was consistent  with the President’s program  That=s going to happen, you know, in very many areas  Steel is up  10 percent, as I understand it  I didn=t get a staff confirmation on that, but it=s close to 10 percent  with all the increases they=ve put in this year  They do it just a little bit at a time, but it adds up   That is what=s occurring, I=m afraid, in the economy  And finally, I=ve had a healthy skepticism  about food prices moderating to the extent that has been forecast for several months and I  continue to have it        6/20/78                16   So what I foresee as at least a substantial risk is a period of more rapid growth, with more  rapid inflation, that lasts not too long--two or three quarters--followed by a  significant  weakening in the economy  Now since everybody else has spoken about monetary policy, I have  to say that that projection does not take into account the possibility of 3-1/2 percent growth in  the money supply  In fact, it doesn=t take into account the possibility of 5-1/4 percent growth  and maybe not 6-1/2 percent  But what it takes into account--      What it takes into account is the prospect that interest rates will rise  moderately throughout the forecast [horizon] or at least until the second quarter, say, of next year  and bring some problems      Well, I=ll buy the ones that Phil Jackson mentioned      What was it second quarter to second quarter, John?  Could you summarize?      You’d get a credit crunch at that time      From here on?  From the second quarter--      I would be reluctant to cut the aggregates limits because I think there=s a  considerable exposure to July being a fairly big month on M1, which has been the case in the last  number of quarters for the beginning month of the quarter  Also, M2 [growth could be strong] with  the new money market certificate, which under the circumstances could be pretty saleable  That first  week=s result is that sales of the certificate are very large, indeed  And I think we ought to recognize  the probability that for M1 par for the course is 8 percent and this range has only an 8-1/2 percent  midpoint  So if we just abstract from our preferences and look at what=s going on, [the staff has]  something that is already pretty moderate here in terms of a projection  If you want to widen [the  range], as Paul did--and I certainly don=t see any harm in widening on the bottom--I would also  widen on the top and make it 5 to 11 for M1, indicating a certain amount of uncertainty as to what  might happen with regard to that figure  For M2 I think we might take 6 to 10       6/20/78                32   Now, on rates, I would point out that we=ve had a considerable adjustment in rates thus far this  year  I just looked at my book and compared to the fourth quarter, the funds rate is up 125 basis  points, the bill rate is up 60, the triple A long-term corporate is up 75, and the primary mortgage rate  is up 75 basis points  Those are pretty considerable increases  And I do think that we can get to the  point here where we endanger the prospect for the kinds of spending that depend on the flow of  credit in the period ahead  So I would think that from this point on we ought to move pretty  gingerly  I could accept the 7-1/2 to 8 percent range, Mr Chairman, but I think I would move very  moderately within that range in an upward direction--maybe, given the market, just a little knock  here in the next few days to 7-5/8 or something like that  But choosing the 7-1/2 to 8 percent range,  I wouldn=t want to bias the outcome by taking aggregates [ranges] that are so low that we=re almost  certain to signal that we=d be at the top of the funds range by the time the period is over      To be at the upper end      By the end of this week?      Well, I would want to move to 7-5/8 by the end of this week  There is also  this financing question that Peter raised, and to do a quarter by the end of this week may be a little--      I think there is some case to be made for 6 to 10 on M2  We typically have a  smaller range and it seems to be growing well very recently and it would make them a little  different     6/20/78                37      The longer-run growth rate or the short-run?      This is a linkage to the long-run statement of objectives      I know, but the problem may not be in the language  It may be in the  specifications      Yes     SPEAKER(?)  It sure does      The time period is just too difficult      “Moves in the direction of the longer-run ranges for the aggregates”      That=s an alternative      SPEAKER(?)   I=m not sure how good it is       6/20/78                39    This has been in [the directive]      You might change it to “reasonably consistent”  You probably ought to have  that in there in the first place      Or does “broadly” offend anybody?      In a range of 7-1/2 to 8 on the funds rate with a 7-3/4 percent midpoint, what=s  the jump?  If the jump is up a quarter or down a quarter--      Yes, I would feel with an aggregates directive that I would need 5 to 11      I think 6 to 10--      Mr Chairman, I think this is a singularly bad time to be talking about any  significant reduction in our participation in the agency market  Here we=ve been talking all morning  long about the fact that housing is going to go down and that mortgage markets are tighter, and all  this means that there=s going to be a bigger supply of agency issues  For us to not be rolling over  [agency issues] and so forth will tend to raise [rates on] those agency issues relative to other market  rates  And it will be a problem, I think, in terms of the structure we=re looking for      To try to lighten a little over time     6/20/78                46      Those are minor issues      A little selling      And we would run a monitoring [from the Board]?      It=s mostly against the rules    "
778,1978-07-18,"  As a quid pro quo for something?     7/18/78              3      Jim, there’s one thing I wanted to clarify that came up in a seminar we had  with the Board last week  Some of the papers were distributed to the members of the Committee   If I understand it correctly--although [you] say your last table is put entirely in terms of M1 growth  rates and their effect--the projection period of your forecast, extending to 1979, has a monetary  policy based on a pattern of interest rate change  That is, your fundamental input is interest rates,  not M1  And then there’s the additional step from your presumption of the linkage between  interest rates and M1  Is that correct?      Sure      And that’s about 8-1/4 percent for the funds rate?      It’s 8-3/4; the 8-1/4 is for the bill rate      All right  Thank you      Will that come right at the beginning of the year, Jim?      Yes, because it’s a one-time increase for that year      Roger, spending would rise to a higher level  Then it would stay at that  higher level and since the GNP [unintelligible] first difference is right in the first part of the year  I  think that is the reason      But that’s not the average for the four quarters        I think the difficulty in providing the numbers that you have asked for is the  question of the precise timing of the probable recession  If the recession comes early, the numbers  will be much lower for the year, the four quarters  If it comes late, it may indeed be that the staff  projection will be right, which doesn’t get even into a growth recession until the second half of  l979, and that is a real possibility  I was worried about a recession within the forecast period  beginning the last time and I guess I feel that way still--in fact, maybe a little more strongly  I  agree with much of what Frank said  I think that the financial tensions projected here are very great  and almost certainly imply a recession in the foreseeable future without quite getting the timing  straight on that  The other feeling that I have that is different from a month ago is that last month I  was worried about a bulge in demand in the third quarter  I don’t think that is [likely]  I think  instead that the demand is quieting and quieting fast  It appears that consumers indeed have been  buying in anticipation of higher prices, borrowing from the future  And I think we can expect  lower consumer spending in strategic areas--in cars and other durables and houses too--as we get  into the fall  So if it comes down, I am prepared to incorporate--almost--the staff’s real GNP  within my range, which would be 3 to 3-1/2 for the next four quarters      It is pretty close, yes  On inflation, I am not quite as bearish as some of my  associates on my right, but I do think it is unlikely that inflation is going to slow very fast with the  kind of wage increases in prospect and with the increases in the minimum wage and in social  security taxes early next year  I would put the inflation rate between 7 and 7-1/2 percent for the  next four quarters and rising in the latter part of that period  Because of that, I think there is going  to be more labor force participation than the staff has projected and, therefore, my unemployment  range would be rather wide  It would be from 5-3/4, which is fairly consistent with the 3-1/2  percent real GNP, all the way up to 6-1/4 for the second quarter of next year on the presumption  that we could have more labor force growth than [the staff assumes]      And I want to agree with many of my associates around the table in that I think monetary  policy can have some influence in making this outlook not quite so [adverse] as otherwise  In  particular, I think it could have some influence in reducing the probability of a marked slowing in  the economy next year in the spring and summer  But to do so I’d say we would have to avoid the  kind of financial tension that is being produced by monetary policy rather than just hope that  somehow, as a philosophical matter, people will feel that if there is less money growth that means  there will be less inflation in the future       7/18/78              17    That doesn’t come out to the numbers  We have 10 who have spoken      You wouldn’t have a figure for an M1 projection?      Well, Mr Chairman, everybody’s talking public relations  Since we are not  supposed to talk very long, I won’t talk economics except to say that based on the relationship  between money growth and nominal GNP growth in the past year with a 210 basis point increase in  the federal funds rate over the past year I would say that the [M1] increase everyone would  associate with their desired nominal GNP growth in the next year would be at least 7-1/2 percent  So my forecast is that M1 will go up at least 7-1/2 percent next year, and that is based on an 11  percent nominal GNP  You can have more inflation or less inflation and more real growth or less  real growth and probably some further movement up in interest rates even to keep it to 7-1/2  We  have a record that anyone can look at that says in the past year M1 has gone up 79  And we have  in my view the probability that in the next year it will go up 7-1/2, maybe minus a half or so for the  automated transfer but that isn’t a very big factor--I agree with Frank--initially in what we do there      So the question is Will we in the end be better off to continue to hold 4 to 6-1/2 percent as  our desired target and continue for another year to exceed that target by a very substantial margin,  which as I look at the figures I assure you we will do?  I think the answer is no  I think we have  gone along here with an actual growth rate that was far in excess of our targets and that the honest,  rational, intelligent thing to do is to recognize that M1 growth has exceeded the target over a  protracted period and that is because there has been a great deal of inflation in the system, which is  induced by wage increases and government actions and things like that  And therefore, we hope to  be moving down as we are able to within a reasonable range  I don’t think 7-1/2, as I think about  it, is enough, Bill, for the top  I would put the top at 8 and go with maybe 4 to 8 on the weak  grounds that perhaps automatic transfer will make it possible to get down to the bottom of the  range  Perhaps it would have some effect in reducing the inflation psychology but I do think the  time has come to recognize what is the fact of the case, and that is that the money supply is  increasing faster than we have been prescribing for a long period of time      I am not prepared to go to M2, as Frank suggests, as the primary or only driver of the  operation and my reason for that is that I feel we don’t have enough control over M2 to do that   That has large certificates in there that are not subject to interest rate ceilings; we could have a  blow-up in the issuance of large certificates by banks and that’s quite uncontrollable on our part   On the other hand, it has a lot of ceiling rates in it, which we might not be able to raise because this     7/18/78              27  is subject to veto by the Home Loan Bank Board  To take M2 is to put ourselves to a degree at the  mercy of either the banks with their marketing strategy or the Home Loan Bank Board  So I just  don’t think we ought to be [using M2] as our primary driver  I agree with Frank that we will have  to come to a different definition; I think what it will include is transaction-type accounts no matter  where they are, whether at [savings] banks or member banks or nonmember banks  But that is  something, I think, for the future rather than for this time  So my proposal is an M1 long-run  target growth range of 4 to 8, expressing the hope that we can be moving down in that range with  the passage of time; and for M2 and M3 the ranges as specified in alternative B by the staff      It doesn’t include negotiable CDs of 350 banks but it includes large CDs that  are non-negotiable everywhere  It includes negotiable CDs at the banks under that top 350 group   And it has been a major mover in the behavior of the time deposit component of M2       I don’t believe it      I would like to ask all this great assemblage who believe in maintaining the  range on M1 what they would say about the way to get growth down within the range  Are you  going to get down within it?  Are you going to raise interest rates 300, 400, 500 basis points?  Is  that what you would have the Chairman say to the [Congressional] committee?      You would permit him to say  Well, that’s our range but we may exceed it      You are giving him a very difficult assignment      Well, because almost everyone has a forecast for nominal GNP that is in the  vicinity of 11 percent for the next year  Some have more inflation and less real, some have more  real and less inflation  For example, the Chairman stated his point estimates at 3-1/2 and 7-1/2   That is about 11 percent nominal GNP; it is a little more actually, because there is a compounding  effect  [So, my belief is based on] observation of the relationship that we have had now for a few  years running between M1 growth and nominal GNP  Last year, that is in the year [ending in the  second quarter]--with the second quarter as a given although it is a projection--we had a money  increase of 79 percent  And on average from the second quarter of ’77 to the second quarter of  ’78, the fed funds rate went up 2l0 basis points  It seems to me that it is just very likely that we are  going to have more than the staff’s 6-1/4 percent projection associated with that interest rate  increase if we have something like an 11 percent nominal GNP  And I think it would be a  disservice for this Committee to seek a smaller increase in nominal GNP than 11 percent over the  next year, recognizing as all of you do that there is going to be in any event quite a lot of inflation  in the figure, because to do that is to seek a recession  I don’t think it is the purpose of this  Committee to seek a recession in the United States economy      Well, I think that the Coldwell proposal, which I would accept, does imply a  considerable further increase in interest rates      But it is very hard to imagine that getting--      I maintain my negative      No you don’t, because there are an awful lot of sales of non-money  instruments      I will change mine to “B”      No, he hasn’t said a word  No, he [isn’t] finished      I would go with alternative A or B  I really would have preferred an M1  range of 5 to l0  Remember, we are including July and it still may be a bulge month of some size  So, I guess I would [propose] an alternative M1 range of 5 to l0  I certainly think we have had  enough movement in interest rates for the time being  The figures that Peter was reciting on the  increases over the last month were very substantial and I do think that we have a lot of restraint in  [unintelligible]  It certainly is occurring in the mortgage market in every major city in this country  and I think it is broader than that  I think it is part of the explanation for the behavior of the stock  market--the increase in capitalization rates that has occurred over the time  So, I would very  strongly wish to remain at 7-l/2 to 8 [on the funds rate range] with a 7-3/4 midpoint      [Unintelligible]      Mr Chairman, I would suggest that the 7-3/4 and 7-7/8 people are very close  together  And 7-3/4 to 8 percent is an extremely narrow range; it is much more like a money  market directive  How about going to 7-7/8 as the midpoint with that 7-3/4 to 8 percent range and  make it a money market directive?      I think I would buy that      Well, pretty soon  There is this financing--      I think if you had a money market directive, you might be able to do that      Not with the money market directive      Well, if you take 4 to 8, it really does cut it [close]  There is no question  about it       I don’t think 5 to 10  I think [the M2 range] ought to be 6 to 10  I don’t want  to cut it too much [because of] the time deposit component      You could make these ranges to 5 to 9 and 7 to 11  I would prefer that      That is a midpoint of 7      With a money market directive      That is as high as I am going to go      I think that is perfectly okay with this very narrow range      Wouldn’t the problem in your suggestion be that the obvious line to tap  would be the New York to Washington line?      The only comment I was going to make, Mr Chairman--I’m sure everybody  is quite aware of it--is that of course any President or Governor is quite welcome to join the call  either here at the Board or in New York even      That’s right      And they wouldn’t feel that way if it was just a Governor!     7/18/78              56      But it’s after the fact    "
803,1978-08-15,"  What are they--three minutes?      I think maybe that partly answers my question  I was going to ask you,  Scott, whether you sense the kinds of conditions that would be characteristic of a climatic sell-off  in the market  That's an analogy with the stock market and I gather that you are [getting] much  more participation in the selling as you see it  The volume is up and the thing is moving now very  rapidly  You can't tell how far down it will go but it is of the nature of that final sell-off surge      So it could go much further      Well, of course, you have all the Americans with their holdings of dollars  that they could move into foreign currencies       8/15/78             5    The recognition of profits and losses quarterly is also quite fundamental   We've never done anything like that before      That's the second quarter you're talking about?      One of the particularly striking aspects of the forecast, Jerry, is the  continued relatively low personal saving rate that is projected That is relatively low by historical  comparison, and I wonder if you could talk a little bit about the justification for that      You can't even find the tax cut there      I'm disappointed, Phil  I thought you were going to say that you could hear  the roar of Nancy all the way up there!  I think Phil is exactly right to feel that the signs of serious  labor difficulty are the most important developments of the last month  I would be inclined to feel  that would mean both that wage rate increases next year will be going up more rapidly than we had  anticipated and also that there will be considerable strike interruptions in the course of the period   It is, of course, very difficult to forecast  I do believe that the effect of the labor developments are  more in terms of a continuation of a high rate of inflation next year than of changing the outlook for  the twelve months under review here, of which a large part is already predetermined by the wage  increases in process, and the minimum wage and social security [increases to come]  And food  output, which may have improved somewhat in the course of the past month, [may also be a  factor]     I haven't really changed my view either from the last time  I feel that we'll come out on the  low end of the real GNP projection that the staff has here--probably with a little better second half,  although the second half is not looking so good right now, and a distinctly weaker first half next  year  I would say 3 to 3-1/2 percent for real GNP over the period  I haven't much quarrel with the  price projection; 7-1/2 is probably now about right for this period, but I think it may be gradually  rising, so if you were to look at 1979 as a whole, it would be more than 7-1/2 percent  And I would  still say that the unemployment rate will be a bit higher by the second quarter of next year, say  6-1/4 percent      Do you [expect the economy to] weaken over the period, John, or is it  pretty much even?      They always do talk about shortages in skilled labor during the late stages  of a boom  I've never known it not to happen      You mean in some quarters?      Did you mean money market or monetary aggregates directive?      Yes, but you said money market      Those of us who can get on it      Well, I think we are reaching a fairly sensitive stage in monetary policy  I  wasn't able to discern as we went around the table earlier any feeling that there is going to be an  explosion of economic growth  Indeed, the average for the Committee members and the other  Presidents, too, was that GNP was likely to grow less than the staff projection--perhaps at 3 or  3-1/4 percent or something like that over the period      And I consider that just barely acceptable  I think anything [less] is going  to give us a real possibility of a stall and anything more is going to give us a very real possibility of  political repercussions of a stimulative nature in the Congress      Now, there was some discussion of scarcities but it seems to me, as I said, that a little  shortage in skilled labor reported during the latter stages of a boom is a typical, regular experience  that I've always seen before  Indeed, it is the way you get employers to train people and improve  the skills of the working force  So far as the shortages of material are concerned, it seems to me  that they largely relate either to housing, which we expect to be coming down, or to very strong  durable goods sales--such as in the sheet area, Willis  And again, we expect durable goods sales to  be coming down, particularly car sales      So I don't see anything in the real economy that would call for a tighter monetary policy   We are having more inflation, and typically monetary policy has brought recessions by reacting to  the inflationary threat; and I think that's the danger again  But now in addition we have the  international situation where essentially, as I see it, the market is calling upon us to create the same  bad economic conditions here that exist abroad  And I think that would be the wrong way for us to  go     I don't have any great problem with your specifications, Mr Chairman, because I don't  think that constitutes much of a move  I would prefer to remain at 7-7/8 until the aggregates  beckon us to move and I think we ought to be alert to the possibility that the aggregates will be  coming in low rather than high  If in fact the economy is weakening underfoot, which is a  possibility, we'll begin to see it in the aggregates and I think we ought to be evenhanded  So when  I say a range from 7-3/4 to 8-1/4 with, say, 5 to 9 percent for M1 I mean that we would back down  to 7-3/4 if in fact the aggregates came in at the low end of the range, which I think is a possibility   Probably Steve is right that they are going to come in on the high side rather than on the low side   But there's a chance that we will begin now to see in the monetary financial statistics the signs of  recession  And we ought to try to adjust to them fairly promptly as we see them  A monetary  aggregates directive, I think, is appropriate       8/15/78             25    How about trying 5 to 9?      Oh, I think the market will move it tomorrow      I would have thought that would have belonged around line 41, Mr  Chairman      Where we say “while giving due regard to developing conditions in  financial markets…”  Add it there especially--      Yes, or you could even emphasize the international        8/15/78             31    Well then, let's tell him what to do  There's no direction  I presume he  would not ease on account of international      You're biasing the whole result      Will you repeat the specifications?      Promptly might be a better word than initially      Or you could do just the foreign; you could take it to zero      Would the sharing arrangement have to be negotiated?      It's in there, isn't it?      I haven't been an advocate of intervention as a general rule, but I must say  that I'm beginning to warm up to a yen intervention program, particularly if we can get some of the  conditions that you have specified  I would not as one of those conditions want to encourage them  to have a special imports scheme for materials  I think they did that in the early 1970s and the  effect of that was simply to tighten up the materials market and raise prices with a lag, and I don't  think we ought to encourage them on that  If we can get them to lower the discount rate, fine  But  I think we also ought to try to get them to agree to make credit more readily available in Japan  because, as I understand it, that is not such a rate-oriented market; it also has a great deal of direct  steering by the central bank  And it may be that you would have to have better access to credit to  get any positive effect  That would be perhaps more important even than the rate in the way it  works      So far as our intervention is concerned, if we could get some of those arrangements, I think  I would agree mainly because surely the dollar is oversold [against] the yen and, therefore, the  chances of an ultimate loss on this series of interventions would be quite slight indeed  I realize  that the Swiss franc has gone up as much, but that's sort of a currency without a country, and the  yen is a currency with a country  Therefore, I think I would be prepared to do it      I know they're doing it, and I've been a little worried about it      I wouldn't want to encourage them to do any more, for sure      But $4 billion is an awful lot, Frank  It might come to that but I don't see  why you'd operate on that scale to begin with      Well, I think Phil meant $4 billion on our end, and that is pretty big      The yen would run up      Yes, we put [a reserve requirement] on specially some years ago; there  hadn't been any before that      That clock is slow     8/15/78             46    "
830,1978-09-19,"  I think it depends partly, Mr Chairman, on what you think the intervention   is for     Yes, and I think there's an advantage to the counterpart currency as much   as there is to the dollar  I think that's the basis of the principle for the sharing  I see no reason to  back away from it          9/19/78            7   Yes, but I think that there's quite a different attitude regarding the effect of   the exchange rate from the standpoint of the foreign partners as against the United States  And I  think the basis for the 50-50 split is perfectly reasonable  Now, I rather agree in principle with the  second point that Alan made  It seems to me that when we renew the contract, we might renew it at  the current price  But I don't agree with doing away with the 50-50  Now, perhaps the memo will  convince me      I think Frank Morris put his finger on something we have to look at very   carefully in the next several months  I'm troubled by the sharp drop in durable goods new orders  for business equipment, although it's just one month and I think we need to see the pattern over two  or three months  But I certainly find the amount of steam in plant and equipment spending less  than I anticipated it would be as the year went on  And I think it is conceivable that it's going to  fall well short of present staff expectations, looking ahead into 1979      That survey that you mentioned I think I heard about a couple of weeks ago, at least on the   basis of preliminary figures  It's not only that you're getting more pessimism expressed by  businessmen in the survey  Whereas before the typical pessimistic view was that the economy is  not going to do well but my company's prospects look very good, now a significantly higher  proportion of executives feel that their own company's prospects are not very good  So we could  have, instead of a generalized pessimism, a specific pessimism; and it could have a considerable  impact on capital spending plans and even on inventory strategy for the period to come      As before, I tend to be a little on the low side of the staff projections for real growth over   this period--3 to 3-1/2 rather than the 3-1/2 percent average  That means in practical terms that the       9/19/78            14  unemployment rate will be drifting up, rather than with good fortune staying constant if the staff  projection is right  Of course, I would point out to everyone once again that the staff projection is  only for 3-1/2 percent real growth, which is rather minimal real growth  For this late point of the  recovery it’s not so bad, but rather minimal because anything much below that will mean an updrift  in the unemployment rate       That's the first time  This is a rather new survey and it's the first time   they've ever found that     I don't want to comment     It was a little milder than I had anticipated     I thought it was     I don't know that they've ever been constrained     I so move    SPEAKER(?)  Second     I, too, had thought that there was a possibility for perhaps a little help in the   international area on operation twist  But I must say, as I look at this yield curve, that it is about as       9/19/78            21  twisted as it can get, in my view  That is, as Paul indicated, the peak is before two years and it  declines progressively as one goes out  And that's a pretty extreme situation  I must say I don't  think there's a lot of chance of an appreciable further decline in long rates if short rates remain  where they are or a little higher  I just don't see how it can occur because I think the arbitrage  would become too big of a consideration in the placement of funds      Well, my problem is that I don't consider the 2-month average M1 growth   that's being projected extraordinarily high relative to the economy  It may be a trifle high, but not  very  If we have what we were talking about--roughly an 11 percent increase in nominal GNP--I  would expect an increase in narrow M1 of 7-1/2 to 8 percent  If we want to have M1 growth far  below 7-1/2 to 8 percent, that means we want to have a nominal GNP growth well below 11  percent  And I am afraid that we are close to the stalling point in the economy and the effect will  not be so much to restrain inflation but to restrain economic growth and give us a recession--at  least a growth recession and maybe more      I do agree that the Committee faces a practical problem in that a 6 to 10 or 6-1/2 to 10-1/2   percent range, on the order of the specs here, seems quite inconsistent with the long-term range that  the Committee has adopted, and perhaps that can't be faced  Therefore, it might be that the range  needs to be reduced, recognizing that that means the probability is that you'll go to the top of the  range and you'll touch off the top of the interest rate specification that you've given to the Manager  You could take 5 to 9 [for M1] and 7 to 11 for M2, which I have put down, and assume that that  will be the result  But then the real question is  How far do you want interest rates to go up in this       9/19/78            25  immediate period?  You have preordained, almost, that they will go up as far as you specified in  your instructions to the Manager     My feeling is that we have had a large increase in interest rates  I guess that's no secret    But I was just looking at the chart on the federal funds rate in the back of the book and I find that  during 1977 we raised the federal funds rate 200 basis points and so far this year we have raised it  another 175 basis points  That’s a total of almost 400 basis points in less than a 2-year period  And  I don't think the economy looks as if it is getting away from us in the sense of explosive growth in  demand or prospects for expansion in activity      So I think it’s time to pause in the rise in interest rates and see in fact whether Frank's   concerns about plant and equipment may be borne out  And other concerns people have expressed  about consumer spending may be borne out  [Let’s see] whether in fact, as most Committee  members have suggested, the growth rate is likely to be less than 3-1/2 percent rather than more  than the 3-1/2 percent in the staff projections  So what I would do is to take those aggregates  ranges that I have mentioned--5 to 9 and 7 to 11  Then I would constrain the funds rate to 8-1/4 to  8-1/2, stay at 8-3/8, and have the money market directive in effect to hold it constant during the  coming period unless the aggregates are notably stronger than the 9 or 11 tops of these ranges      Ten is awfully tight on the top of M2     I think 7 to 11 would be better     And [your Bank] has an 8 percent projection and staff here has 8-1/2  So   you'd move immediately to the upper end of the range     What was the number?   "
853,1978-10-17,"  Scott, I have the impression, though it's sort of a vague one, that our interest  rates relative to those abroad have a larger margin than the difference in the inflation rate  Why  would that then be a concern?  I would think that the prospects are for an increase in the inflation  rate abroad and that everybody would recognize that      Yes, but that's just a run in the market  I mean that has to reverse      But it's a satellite country of Germany, of course      How far away are you?      Well, I don't know  I'm still dubious about the proposition  It seems to me,  as far as the interest rate differential is concerned, that it might have not held because a lot of times  the foreign country, our partner country, might not be doing what is appropriate for it to do in terms  of international dealings  Indeed, I think we've had some difficulty over this phase--looking back  over the last several years--in getting the Germans to put their rates down as far as they should have  been given the economic circumstances of the country  And I can imagine situations in the future  when a difference in points of view on economic objectives could in fact give you an inverse  relationship  So I'm not nearly as confident as seems to be assumed here that the interest rate  differential will work in our favor      Secondly, I have the impression, rightly or wrongly, that often in the past we have  intervened for our account in a foreign currency in a [situation] when we were under considerable       10/17/78 8             pressure from the foreign country to do so  Now, I'm not saying that it hasn't been in our self  interest to intervene when we have, but I think the tendency has been that we're almost always  being encouraged by the partner on the other side to intervene, to keep the market open in the  afternoon, to show the Federal Reserve’s hand  It seems to me, without being able to cite  examples, Alan, that frequently it's considered sort of a matter of statesmanship for us to get into  the market and to show that we are also not letting the dollar just go wherever it would but are  exercising some discipline on it  I think what that reflects is the fact that there is usually a dual  interest in our intervention, an interest at least as great on the part of a foreign country as there is on  our part  It seems to me [unintelligible] all right, when we intervene in our own self interest as  dictated by our own circumstances  And I think there's a change--      Mr Chairman, the question of what constitutes a disorderly market is--      Well, my impression over the years has been that we have been under  pressure to intervene      I realize that      That's precisely my point  My point is that there is a very strong interest on  the part of other countries in our intervention  And when we do it, I think it's reasonable to say we  do it on a 50-50 basis      Yes, in some sort of large sense, I guess we do      You may be quite right from the standpoint of [fairness]  Perhaps we've got  an unfair advantage  My point simply is that I believe we're giving up an advantage      Just as a matter of clarification, Jim, in the next to last table in your  presentation, the 1972 unemployment [and other] rates are averages for the year?      And, of course, real GNP was growing rapidly during 1972, so the peak rate  of GNP in '72 would have been quite a bit above the '72 average  The capacity utilization,  however, is what--a quarterly peak?      The peak month  How do you account for the rather pronounced difference  now compared with then in the materials industries as against overall manufacturing?  I hadn't had  the impression that capacity had expanded that much in paper, pulp, steel, aluminum, and other  basic materials industries      I just have one other point of clarification  I just want to be sure       Do I understand that the base projection for 33 percent real growth over the  next five quarters assumes a bill rate of 8-1/4 percent?       10/17/78 11                 It was 821 yesterday      They might be tighter than other companies      But this is based on historical experience isn't it, Jim?  It’s not based on  some new theory but on historical experience      But I still think, Mark, the test of the pudding is in the replication of the  past  Again, no matter what your theory is, it has to be a model that--      To show it works, and this one is based on the past      Well, I feel a little better about the economic situation than I did a month  ago  I think we’ve [now] got more evidence that production has moderated and that final sales  have picked up and it's one of the most important balancing items there is in the equation  So if  we're getting another adjustment--a modest, midcourse adjustment--in production and if sales will  hold up, I'd be inclined this time to take the staff's projection, whereas a month ago I would have  been on the low side of it      I also feel a little better about inflation  I don't think it's going to be as wild as some people  have been noting, partly because I think the President's program will have a marginal impact and  partly because the food supply situation is really quite good  It has been an awfully good year in  growing and I think that has a fundamental influence on price behavior  I guess I feel that the  unemployment rate is a little low here  Although the staff has assumed that people will stop joining  the labor force because jobs won't be there, I'm not so sure that that's so  So I would have a little  more labor force growth and, therefore, a somewhat higher unemployment rate     Finally, I would point out that fundamental to my acceptance of the projection the staff has  here is the policy assumption of a bill rate of 8-1/4 percent  Just as Larry has in his an assumption  of the 6 percent money supply growth, my emphasis is on interest rates  And I think that this  interest rate level is about an equilibrium level relative to the growth patterns that are projected  here      You think these unemployment figures are wrong, John?      That's a West Coast observation      Is the money supply increase also a reflection of the inflation?         10/17/78 25               I just want to say that the Subcommittee on the Directive met yesterday and  we've been struggling with this question of relating the short-run ranges or targets with the long-run  targets  We reviewed the Humphrey-Hawkins legislation and, of course, it does change in some  rather fundamental respects the setting of targets because there will be no sliding base  Therefore,  we agree with you that it does change things enough so that it is a new ball game beginning next  year  And we will have a report for the Committee by the January meeting on a recommended  course of action, relating to the new system, however, rather than the old  I would point out, Mr  Chairman, that the amendment takes effect on January 1, 1979 so I agree with you in that I think  we are really obligated, though it may mean nothing, to have one more year ahead in our projection  of the aggregates  I think it would be misunderstood if we didn't have an M1 range but it ought to       10/17/78 29             be wide enough to accommodate possibly a considerable shift into savings deposits from M1 forms  [of deposits]      No, I agree with you      Even if there is a stay, I would point out that New York has NOW accounts  and that's a big state, and we would have to take that into account      Well, we now do [set ranges] for the upcoming year  So for example, this  time we're considering third quarter to third quarter and last time it was second quarter to second  quarter  Now the lock is on the calendar year and the re-estimate in July is on the same calendar  year and the next one; so there won't be the kind of slide that there was before      It seems to me not unreasonable, Paul, to do that, although I do think there  is the possibility that we'd run over the top of M2 because of the diversion of funds from thrifts to  the banks  My own preference would have been for 5 to 8 on [M1+] for the same reason  I think  it's very hard to estimate  And remember, M1+ will include all of the ATS accounts whether  they're truly transactions accounts or idle balances  It will include any conversion from thrifts to  the banks that are put in there in order to raise the minimum size of the account to the point where  there are no service charges  But that is a minor problem      Well, I agree quite a lot with Phil Jackson, but I think what we have to  recognize as more important than anything else is that M1 can no longer be a control variable   There will be no way of having any precision in the estimate of the proportion of ATS that belongs  in M1  What we'll get in ATS is a combination of heretofore passbook account balances and  heretofore checking account balances  We could ask the banks, and we plan to ask banks, what  they think the split is but, you know, that's going to be within 10 or 20 percent of an accurate  number and it has no longevity  We can't ask them a month down the road and then two months       10/17/78 33             and three months because they won't know  So, there is no way that we can keep M1 as a control  variable for policy, assuming that ATS goes into effect      I would do what the Chairman suggested  That is, I would specify some kind of an M1  range just for the cosmetics of it, but I think what we have to say is that we don't know how to  judge that range because we don't now how quickly or to what extent the ATS service will take  hold  Therefore, it seems to me that we do have to have a memo item on the M1+ just in order to  satisfy people that we're doing a respectable procedural job     And Mark, on your point, I think what we have to say about our M1 range is that how we  will feel about where we are in that range will depend on how fast we believe that ATS is taking  effect  If it's very slow, we'd expect to be toward the top of the M1 range  If it's quite fast, we  might be well down in the range; we might even be below the bottom because we can't say  I have  a very difficult time choosing between 1-1/2 percent and 4-1/2 percent as being the effect over the  first year  Frankly, I think it will be quite low  The staff thinks it will be quite high  I just don't  know  I think it would be very dangerous to try--given our total lack of knowledge about this--to  estimate a center point and say that we have allowed for this amount      We have to modify what we say about the other measure  What we will  accept within this range will depend on the extent [of the ATS effect]      No, I think you could still use M2, as we have before, because that shouldn't  be affected  It's just the distribution [between M1 and M2]      We'll have to make an estimate, Ernie, as time goes on to see if we feel that  money is moving from the thrifts  But you could use [M2] because savings accounts have existed  heretofore in that, so you'll be getting both the savings account proportion and the transactions  balances; [there’s just a] shift of the proportions in there      No, I think it is the only control variable for a narrow money definition          10/17/78 34               Well, what I think you do is put in a qualifying phrase      Well, as I said, we defined our obligation, Larry, as being one where we  have an investigation of these questions and report to the Committee by the January meeting or  before--maybe by the December meeting         Now, in writing our report we are going to be using staff input and there  could well be some staff contribution from staffs other than those represented by the members of  our subcommittee  If there is something that can be done, Steve Axilrod is the staff director of the  subcommittee and he's the one to work through  But I agree with you that there are a lot of  important issues here, and I think we will have to look at them carefully  I realize there's an       10/17/78 38             affection for M1, but there's no way to estimate it and have it be worth anything anymore  And the  point about interest rates being frozen, Roger, the same thing is true of demand deposits  The  interest rate is zero on demand deposits  And the interest rate is frozen on savings accounts at 5  percent--same condition      I think what we ought to do is cut down that definition  I noticed they had  credit union share drafts in there  Maybe we ought to just say M1+ is M1 plus savings accounts at  the commercial banks for now  That picks up the NOW accounts at banks and it picks up the  automatic transfers         10/17/78 39               Very little      Just define M1+ as being M1 plus savings accounts at commercial banks      I meant for just now, Steve  And then for the first of the year we can talk  about redefinitions       Well, because we don't know  There might not be any automatic transfer  shift at all      Well, I think the money market directive is most important  And I regard a  range for the funds rate of 8-3/4 to 9 as staying right where we are  We are at 8-7/8 percent, I  think, and that just gives us a little latitude on both sides  I would argue that we ought to stay there  for the time being for several reasons  First, we do have the Administration’s program coming up  sometime here in the next few weeks--the next few days, perhaps--and we don't know what the  program has in it  And it's presumptive for us to be moving interest rates in anticipation of  something [as important as] the President's program that we don't know about      Second, Paul says we've moved very gradually this year, but we have moved 200 basis  points since April, and April was only four months ago  And we haven't had time for the lag  structures to work on anything  So we don't know where we stand; it's time to hold up a little to see  where we are and to see what may occur  It may be that we'll need to go higher, but I think we  need to get a look at it And for the time being I think we've taken rates high enough     And third, I find that the staff projection is about the only acceptable projection we can have  It has minimal growth in the real GNP for my taste  It has too much inflation, surely, but I don't see  that we can knock down that inflation greatly by our actions in this period to come  And it does  assume an interest rate level not very far from where we are right now  Therefore, I think we  should hold up for the time being until we can see what the shape of the future is, consistent with  the staff advice we're getting in the form of a projection      As far as these aggregates are concerned, I really don't know  I guess I favor alternative 1,  incidentally, not alternative 2  And I do believe we ought to have some room on M2 because we       10/17/78 46             don't [know] whether there are going to be shifts into it or not in this period to come  So I’d be  very much opposed to Phil Coldwell's 5 to 9 [range for M2]; I think it ought to be 6 to 10  On M1,  maybe what we could do is put an upper limit on it--so long as the narrowly defined money supply  does not exceed 7 percent, for example--and forget the bottom end  Maybe use it just as a one- sided [target]  I agree with Paul that it would certainly tell you something if M1 went up with ATS,  and perhaps that's a way of utilizing it      I happen to agree totally with Steve that the only weekly figure we will be getting that can  be a guide to the Desk--that would bear on this and isn't sullied by the ATS thing--will be for M1+   That is, we can pick up member bank savings deposits on a daily average basis as we've been  doing, so we can add that to M1  And therefore, it will provide a control vehicle--the only control  vehicle that makes any sense at this time below the M2 level  So I would put in an [M1+] range  I  don't care [about the precise range we choose]  I think maybe I’d put in 4 to 8 but I guess 3 to 7 is  all right  Who's to say in this period?      Well, no, I said 7      The money market directive did win      It's only because of that 7 that I agreed to the lower range on M2      And that it would be a cap sort of thing?      You just said we're getting the automatic transfer; that makes it uncertain  what M2 will be  The M2 will be higher than it would otherwise be      Then 6 to 10 on M2?      I think you'll lose my vote      We wouldn't ordinarily do it anyhow, unless we're at the top of those ranges      It was a very biased vote--biased toward the aggregates      Oh all right  Don't you fellows who were for the 6 give up now  Come on  vote  Seven  We lost somebody  Who'd we lose?  Yes, we lost Willis      I think this is a Board matter, not an FOMC matter      Well, you can't--      More likely [it will be expressed as] a hope that interest rates would be able  to come down  That's more likely the kind of sense--    "
877,1978-11-21,"  What do we do with the currencies, Alan?        In Germany?     11/21/78              6      And would we pay a rate of return to the Treasury on the warehousing?      Well, I was just wondering, would we put it into some kind of short-term  investment?       Because that might [amount] to quite a bit      It would be counterproductive to pay off the Germans      Accounting [is what] I was thinking of, but I think the monetary influence  would be counterproductive if we pay them off  That is, you wouldn't get the advantage that the  Chairman cited of borrowing abroad  And when you use it, you won't expand the money supply      Very successful, I think      These are long-term expansions      I just wanted to raise the same question I raised yesterday [in the Board  briefing]; I think it should be raised again today  The supplement to the Greenbook points out that  general merchandise stores such as Sears, Penney's, and Federated--the big department  stores--added to their stocks at a $42 billion annual rate in September  And a chart on the subject  shows that inventory/sales ratios are the highest they’ve been for a long, long time, and far higher  than just before the ’74 recession began  I wondered what comment you might have on it      It used to be, Jim, that department stores did 15 percent of their year's  business in the five weeks from Thanksgiving to Christmas  I suppose, of course, that we have  seasonally adjusted ratios here but for those whose inventories are now quite high, it’s a very, very  important season that they are moving into       You want to do fourth to fourth rather than the third to third that's in the  Greenbook?  They have the policy period of Q3 ’78 through Q3 ’79      I had figured out what I'd put down for the third quarter to the third quarter;  I don't quite know what I'd put for fourth to fourth      If you take out the fourth quarter of this year and put in the fourth quarter  of next year, it could make quite a difference      I think the staff projection is reasonable, and I think they are quite correct  to have put in considerable effect from the happenings of the past month or five weeks  I also  believe it is plausible to think that we have moved over the watershed into a recession phase  I  don't think it's bad for us to talk about recession  If we don't talk about recession, the effect is very  counterproductive  Perhaps we ought not do it publicly but we ought to do it privately  As people  know, I've long been a believer in the importance of the Christmas season and it seems to me that  we have a situation where a poor Christmas season will bring us into a recession  And I think we  are going to have a poor Christmas season because of uncertainty, concern, the behavior of the     11/21/78              14  stock market, and the feeling that things are tight in the money market  And you don't know what  the future may bring  Once we get that, we have enough weakness generally in the economy to  develop [further weakness] in housing, plant and equipment spending, and state and local spending  Then we could have a recession, which hopefully would be just a teeny weeny one      It doesn't amount to much, Paul  I just don't think it’s going to do anything  So my figure, which is a plausible scenario I think, is a real growth rate of 1/2 percent third quarter  to third quarter  I think probably there will be some price effect, and I would guess [inflation]  might drop to about [unintelligible] for the four quarter period rather than 7-1/2  And at the end of  the period I would project an unemployment rate of 8 percent      The reason I get a plus 1/2 is because of the fourth quarter  It adds quite a  bit      You might sell a few coats      Well, Bob, it used to be that every year I looked at State Street the day after  Thanksgiving  We really tried to look at it, and it always seemed that it was at capacity  And  sometimes they were good years and sometimes they were bad       11/21/78              17    They don't spend anything; they're just coming out      Would you repeat why it is that there's going to be an increase in the  demand for money?  I didn't understand the reason for that      You don't mean in the monetary aggregates  I don't think you do, but that's  not a fact      In the monetary aggregates, I don't think so  In bank credit, you may      In the last month we've had a 50 percent rate of increase in CDs, which are  not in the monetary aggregates      Well, I would just offer one alternative explanation for that tipping down  on long-term yields that somebody in the market must have felt  And that is that yields were likely  to be reaching a peak because of the prospect or the increasing probability of a recession, rather     11/21/78              21  than that there would be success in dealing with inflation as a result of the measures  That must  have been [in the minds of some]  Had I been a market manager, I would have bought longs the  day after, too, but not because I felt inflation would be reduced    (?)  Ernie, aren't you concerned about the tendency of banks now to issue  these CDs--nonnegotiable CDs--in large amounts?      I can agree with Dave 100 percent  I believe that this is a time when we  want to stand still if we possibly can because there are so many rate relationships that have not yet  adjusted  The prime rate probably has another quarter, perhaps another half to go  The mortgage  rate is in the process of adjusting in most parts of the country  The long-term rates, I think, have  not yet found their level, reflecting the very difficult adjustment they have to [make to] all the  things entertained here  Therefore, I think what we want to do is to hold very steady on the funds  rate, and 9-3/4 percent is okay with me  I like your ranges, and I certainly think a money market  directive is called for  But I would agree that if something breaks loose here--either internationally  as Paul fears or domestically as some people fear on the aggregates--that we should talk about it      We have a better land line now, don't we?  And we can consult better      That's tight      I would just point out that the M2 midpoint projection is a little over 8-1/2  percent over the two months  So it’s tight  There's a good possibility that the 10 percent funds rate  will have to be negotiated with a telephone conference call, but I find it acceptable      I don't really think you need the ""in an orderly fashion"" if you only have a  1/4 point range      It's very hard to predict it      No, we can't  You're biasing the result      That's a true money market directive      That's a very small point      Of course, it hasn't been at 9-3/4; if we put it at 9-3/4, we have put it up  from where it was  You want to put it up 1/8 point more, apparently      But with a notion that it probably would be within [2] to 6 percent     11/21/78              29      5 out of 10      It just shows with Mark that you can't satisfy him very long  We raised  [the funds rate] very substantially and he liked it, but now several weeks have gone by and we  haven't raised rates anymore      Abstain?      He hasn't answered yet      Assuming November is right      Which we don't know      You are [not] going to risk any further rise in the dollar?      That's a very considerable departure from past practice      I don't think the announcement said that      I don't want to go toward that      Strengthening what?      Strengthening means you are going to continue to run it up, and I don't  know how far we will run it up      Yes, I think that ought to go first         We intend for the December meeting to have the report of our  subcommittee on addressing the question of procedures and practices with regard to the new  Humphrey-Hawkins bill  That will at a minimum require a change in the February meeting date  and the July meeting date, so that we can meet sometime before we have to submit the written  report, which is by the 20th of February and the 20th of July  I also think we will review the  question of schedules perhaps with the view to reducing the number of meetings per year to ten   But we haven't looked at all of the pros and cons on that yet  So, we have a little--      That's right  And because of the special reports, we really will have a  longer-term thrust, I think, in policy as a result of the Humphrey-Hawkins changes in the Federal  Reserve Reform Act  So, therefore, we might not need to meet quite so frequently; it would be  perhaps more on a five or six week interval rather than a four or five week interval  [We haven’t]  talked about it, so I really shouldn't say that much about it      What did we decide--the 6th?      We will probably have to have two days of meetings because of--      And likewise with July       11/21/78              35    What about July, Steve?      Those two we ought to be able to pin down, I think    "
901,1978-12-19,"  Just to follow up on that, though, Ted  If the price rise for oil means that  our trade balances are less good by a few billion dollars by the end of the year, isn’t it true that  other countries would be proportionately even less well off as a result?  That is, we import less oil  than Germany, Japan, Switzerland, or France, at least, and so I should think they would have a  greater deterioration relative to previous expectations than we would      Relative to GNP or what?      You mean our oil bill is a larger proportion of our imports than would be  the case in Germany?       That’s hard to work through  Then our exports must also be smaller  relative to--      You said Merry Christmas      This doesn’t include the OPEC thing      He had a very brief statement today, didn’t he?       How about real growth?      Also working down throughout the projection?       12/19/78          11      But year-over-year, Bob?       The first quarter of ’78 to the first quarter of ’79         I think that’s as asymmetrical as you can get      They could be two different entities doing these two different things  Well,  I was going to emphasize just briefly without a long-run go-around the very strong nature of the  conflicting signals we are getting on the economy  We have an assumption, if you believe the  figures, that not just durable goods but nondurables too are very strong  Attitudes are weakening  quickly and we have the P&E surveys [indicating] a future weakening  But durable goods orders  and indications of capital spending--and the kind of thing Ernie mentioned on the cost and volume  of nonresidential building and that the Chicago economist reported--suggest great strengthening in  the capital goods area  And we have employment and the nominal GNP going up like mad  And  the money numbers are very weak; it’s not just M1 but M2 also  In the last couple of months they  have been weak, and M2 shouldn’t have been affected adversely by ATS  Indeed, if anything, it  should have been positive because of possible shifts from thrifts into the banking sector      So the pattern that I see is that the real numbers we have are strong and numbers that might  indicate the future are weak  And I don’t know what to do with it  It could be a last gasp, as Dave  suggests  On the other hand, it could be a new boom, as Henry seems to suggest  Certainly,  Henry’s view of the process--that is, that heavy final sales could bring inventory demand, which  could bring output, which could bring capital spending--is the way that the economy operates   That could easily be the case, and we might be at the beginning of a totally undesired boom in the  economy  I just don’t know which it is  I’m more inclined--      I have a position I’m going to take which allows me not to do that  I would  say this  The trouble is that we are up against capacity constraints and this has been very bad news  to have this last burst because it means we have no room on the up side  We can’t make an error on  the up side  If we do, we will greatly aggravate what I believe is now becoming a horrible inflation  outlook  I don’t think anything could have been worse than the announcement effects of the OPEC  price increase  On the radio and the television around town in the last couple of days they’ve been  pointing out that that increase is double the wage guideline that the President specified  Now, what  does that lead [people] to believe?  [I’d say they’d feel] that they can’t settle for that wage  guideline  And I think that kind of effect is going to rapidly spread  It’s not just the real effects of  the price increases; the announcement effect of the price increase is just terrible          I have no idea where inflation might go in the period to come  I do think that if we are  going to have continued strength in the economy along the lines I’ve seen recently--and if we are  going to have rapid price escalation, which is possible--then it’s got to show up in the monetary  numbers  On the other hand, if we are going to have weakness in the economy developing, it’s  going to have to continue to show as weak monetary numbers      Therefore, I’m strongly, strongly, directed toward looking at monetary aggregates, [weak  though] they may be, because I think it’s the only decent kind of steering mechanism we have in  this kind of environment  I would say that we ought to be guided by the monetary aggregates  If  they do explode--and they could well explode in January and February, Bob, because I think every  past experience we have had would suggest that, unless this is the turn, we are going to get another  mark-up in those monetary aggregates--we’ll see it and react against it by raising interest rates   And if they don’t explode--if they weaken further--we will see that and we can react by reducing  interest rates  So, I think now is the time for the Committee to show some flexibility in interest  rates on the basis of what it sees developing in the aggregates, and that would be what I would  recommend        And, Mark, might I point out that December’s not in the bag  I think the  biggest weeks are still to come  Historically, you know, major movements occur right before  Christmas and right after Christmas--the window-dressing  We have less than the normal amount  of confidence in our forecast for December than for other months at this time of the month         What he does is he hits 10 and then errs on the side of tightness       Well, I find your proposal acceptable  I would say that I’m becoming  increasingly concerned that we do not find ourselves in a lock as we begin to move into a period of  weakness  I think this tends to do that because we don’t really allow for any downward movement  in the funds rate  That’s all right with me because of the international situation but I would like it  understood that if these aggregates are really weak--or if other things develop in the economy that  look very unsettling--we can reconsider  I say that because I think we are going to have to start to  consider the possibility of actually reducing interest rates in the economy         He’s like an Episcopalian not being a Catholic       But I think the answer is yes, that we’ve got to have pretty weak aggregates  to drop below the 10       We’d have a February meeting before February 15, wouldn’t we?       There’s very little [likelihood] that we are going to pay off--what was it-- over $2 billion?       I think I have some preference for a limit, but I think we [unintelligible]  and if it turns out--       This has the effect of transferring income from us to the Treasury, doesn’t  it?  But it’s income that we would be transferring anyway       If it were $5 billion, you’re talking about maybe 4 percent or so, so that’s  $200 million in income       The magnitude would be approximately--     SPEAKER(?)  Debt management       You’re not speaking about owning foreign exchange, I think, Henry, but  rather of developing a position where one of our assets is an exchange rate guaranteed, non-US  security  That [involves] proportionately fewer US securities in our portfolio and that might  sometime become large  I agree with the principle you are expressing, but we more or less  participated and agreed and urged Treasury financing--say, a $10 billion figure  And it seems to  me that having been so prominent in the discussion of that, it’s up to us to be prepared to finance up  to $10 billion in that  It won’t get that large because we’ll probably use up some  So, although I  agree with your principle, I don’t see any problem with the $5 billion figure that’s been suggested  because we’ll reach it soon and I can’t imagine that we would say to the Treasury, “don’t go to  Japan; we were wrong back in the fall”      Yes, so I don’t see--       You’d rather have a year       I think that’s right  There’s no possibility in six months unless there’s a--       Oh, this is a vote?       It depends on the issue  For example, if the Committee agrees to the  proposed meeting schedule, then there won’t be any January meeting  And then I think we will  have to do in February--in terms of a report--what is suggested here because there won’t be any  meeting prior to February to change the thing  Some other issues could be delayed       Well, Mr Chairman, I might say that we did, of course, consider this with  some time pressure because it’s something that has to be instituted very shortly into the new year   But it seemed to me, and I think to the other members of the committee, that many of these  decisions were procedural in nature  They had to be taken but they were procedural  Where we  had quite fundamental issues--for example, running on nonborrowed reserves as an operating  variable--we did not take them up because there just was not sufficient time  That certainly could  be discussed at a later date  Although it has been discussed time and time again for the last decade,  it could be discussed once again  We do have a couple of dissents, as everybody can see because  we’ve put them very prominently in the beginning of the material  And we also presented the  material in a way so that we could go through these eight recommendations one by one  They start  on page 2 of the memo  And I think that’s the best way to do this, to go recommendation by  recommendation       Well, recommendation 1 is simply expressing as the Committee’s intent  what the law requires us to do  It says that we have to specify [long-term growth ranges for the]  money and credit aggregates for the calendar year  And recommendation 1 is simply an expression  of the Committee’s intention to do that  So I don’t think there could be much dispute about that  recommendation       For some reason, Phil didn’t get it       The law replaces old Concurrent Resolution 133, so it’s the--       I would say, Phil, the expression is very general; it’s monetary and credit  aggregates  You could conceivably drop M1, drop M2, have nothing but credit, or have different  credit aggregates  There’s good flexibility but specification of an aggregate for the current calendar  year and in a tentative way for the forthcoming calendar year in the July meeting seems to me to be  required by the law       That’s recommendation 2  That’s later on       That’s correct  We can change it at any time and we could go broader than  that, I think  Well, we could report this to the Congress and be operating on something entirely  different, but--       I really think that that is getting too complicated       The word “targets”?       Well, it says the objectives and plans with respect to the ranges of growth       Well, proposal 2 does get to the question of how we define the calendar  year  There seem to be three possibilities  One could say that it’s December to December  Well, I  suppose one could say it’s the last day of December to the last day of December, but in practical  terms it’s the month of December to the month of December  We rejected that on the grounds that  the base is too unstable, especially since December is such a volatile month      12/19/78          43        One could say it’s the quarterly average--the fourth quarter to the fourth quarter; that’s  consistent with the way we look at GNP and quite a few other numbers in the economy and it gives  you the effect of the passage in time  That’s our committee’s proposal      One could also say a calendar year average to a calendar year average  For example, the  Germans use that, I noticed  The difficulty we see with that is that, in effect, the averaging  procedure is so much more elongated since you really pick up the whole profile of the previous  calendar year in determining the base  And after that it becomes very difficult to affect very much  the figure you specify for a calendar year; once you’re into it [there’s] hardly any time at all  For  some purposes we might want to use the average year over average year in terms of references   But we think what is consistent with the way people report and analyze and use our data and the  GNP data is to make it fourth quarter-to-fourth quarter  That’s all the second recommendation is       I just don’t know  I must say, as an economist who has been forecasting  for a long time, that I can’t even remember a year average on anything  I just never use it in  analytic terms myself; maybe some people do I think it’s a very interesting device to create  confusion because the year-over-year average is always different than the developments of the year  as it goes on  I think where it might be used, Phil, is let’s say in July you have an [overshoot] and  you don’t think you can get it down or that it is inappropriate to get it down within the year to the  range you had set earlier  Then I think you use the next year, which you are permitted to do in  July  That is, you could say we are running over for various reasons and you cite them       You would adjust the current year upward and you could very well say  we’ll have a more gradual adjustment period that would run into the following year  That’s the  way I would use it rather than to take the yearly average       You mean so you get an average  I just never do that myself       I never discuss the yearly figures; I think they’re highly misleading       I think it’s become much more common to talk fourth quarter-to-fourth  quarter  That’s the way the Council [of Economic Advisers] presents their estimates of the GNP       What’s happened so far and what that implies for--       Well, it seems to me that it will be in the report  We haven’t written the  report; and the Chairman will testify and he hasn’t testified  But it seems to me that he would talk  about how the year has developed thus far and the implications of that for the second half of the  year--that is, the second to the fourth quarter--and whether that has implications for the coming  year       [No shorter] than a quarter?  Well, I sort of agree with that  That bears on  one of our later recommendations       Well, we slip the base every quarter now       I do think this is a separate issue      [MR COLDWELL(?)]  What other recommendations do you have?         Well, there’s recommendation 4, which has a great deal to do with the  question of whether we can say that what the Committee has done has some relationship with what  the President wants done  And I think [following] your suggestion would make it less likely that  we’d consider it consistent       SPEAKER(?)  And that comes up in recommendation 4?      The only base drift I see has to be very publicly reported  It has to be that  we have given up our original expectations per se on 1979 and either intend or don’t intend to make  up for it in 1980  That’s the kind of base drift there will be, an annual base drift       Yes, an annual base drift       I think that would be a problem  If we shift between February and July  [how we define] the year the way you’re talking about, I think the [Congressional] committee could  very reasonably say that we’re trying to obscure what’s happening         Recommendation 3 has to do with meeting periods--a rather sensitive  subject  There are really two aspects to this recommendation  One is that we feel it’s necessary for  the Committee to change its February and July meeting dates so that it will meet at a time in  February, for example, when the staff has been able to analyze the President’s objectives and yet in  time for the report to be written  In July there will be a midyear budget review and perhaps some  new specifications or objectives; and in any event a report has to be written and delivered by July  20th  At the minimum we think we have to change the February and July dates as we specified  here to February 6 and July 11  February 6 is farther from the deadline of February 20 because we  figure it will be a harder report to write  July 11 is closer to the deadline, July 20, because we think     12/19/78          48    it will be easier and, in any event, to have it a week earlier would interfere with the Fourth of July   So, those two changes we thought we had to make      In addition, we made two changes in dates from the calendar previously sent out to you just  to even out a little bit the time intervals  We had to change the May date from the 15th to the 22nd  and the August date from the 21st to the 14th  Otherwise, we left all the dates the same  It’s on the  table here  You’ll see that we changed May to the 22nd and that we backed up August a week in  order to give us two 5-week intervals rather than a 6-week and a 4-week interval  In future years, I  think we could do better with this but we felt some obligation to try to [stay] as closely as we could  to what had previously been suggested to you as tentative dates      Now, the third aspect of this calendar is that it proposes excluding formal physical meeting  dates in January and June because they would necessarily have to be at times that would involve  only 3-week intervals  We felt that, in view of the fact that a full review of our situation was  coming up and the reports would be written and all that, it would be better to skip those and have 7- week intervals, understanding of course, that there could be telephone conferences  In the future, I  believe that we will never be able to avoid [a 7-week interval] in the December-January period-- assuming we don’t want to meet between Christmas and New Year’s Day, and I assume we don’t   But for the July meeting, I think in the future we’ll be able to cut that to a 6-week interval rather  than the 7-week period we now have        So there is first the change in the February and July meeting dates; second, the changes that  we made in the May and August dates; and third, the question of skipping the January and June  meetings         The only reason we didn’t do it was because Memorial Day is a holiday      Well, apparently that’s not true in every state      SPEAKER(?)  Some places observe it on the 30th       I seriously considered that and, as a matter of fact, if it had been my choice  alone, I would have moved that date      I have a note here from Murray Altmann that one of our difficulties is that  the BIS meeting is every second Monday and, therefore, we would have to make it the second  Wednesday, or our people who go to BIS meetings can’t get back  Even then it’s not all that good  to bring them back from Switzerland immediately to an Open Market Committee meeting  We’ve  taken a look at almost every combination, Roger  If you take the first Tuesday, which also might  be proposed, then you would wind up with very little new economic data for the month because it  isn’t out yet  I don’t know, but I guess we didn’t really look at the fourth Tuesday; that wouldn’t fit  the need anyway of the July and February dates          No, not seriously, although some people may think that moving from  twelve meetings to ten is a tendency in that direction       Well, except that it means that Paul or Henry and staff--Scott or Alan--will  be very tired       Yes, although we will have to do it soon, because people like to get their  calendars [scheduled]       Well, I do think we can discuss it really quite well       Well, not having the January meeting, we won’t release the policy record  for today’s meeting until a little later  Other than that, I can’t see--       Yes, I think so      The reason we release it when we do is because until then there is an  operational instruction         I would rather not       You know, we do have telephone meetings that--perhaps I should defer to  the Secretary         It’s not mandatory  I think the Chairman said that he had every intention at  this moment of calling you up on the 16th          Just as we do when we have a meeting by telephone late [in the  intermeeting period], it’s reported maybe a week or ten days later      I don’t know; the careful hope came from both directions       The Board does have to deal with the question of how we organize to be  responsive to the mandate of Congress  It is a question we all have raised  First of all, there is  nothing in that bill that calls upon the Committee to adopt explicit economic objectives for the  calendar year [or] for the two calendar years and we would recommend that the Committee avoid  doing so  We in general would; Nancy may want to say something here       Secondly, there is nothing here that requires that the Committee develop monetary paths  that it considers most probably quite consistent with the objectives that the President has set  And  we would propose that the staff not be directed to develop that path that would be most consistent  with the President’s objectives  Rather, we propose that the staff be prepared to talk about the     12/19/78          53    probabilities regarding whether or not the ranges specified for the monetary alternatives for the  year are [consistent with or how they are] related to the President’s objectives and also the question  of the consistency among the objectives  In other words, at this point we are not proposing a major  change in the way the staff material is prepared for the Committee nor are we proposing a major  change in the way the Committee specifies its objectives  We simply suggest that the staff have in  mind in its collective wisdom what it thinks the relationships are between the monetary alternatives  and the economic objectives stated by the President  That’s our committee’s recommendation       I think Nancy ought to be permitted to speak on this for a minute and I think you might  want to hear from Jim Kichline, who is really going to have to organize the research that backs up  the Committee’s [decisions]       But the President will have specific short-run objectives for the economy     12/19/78          54        If we think it will be       It’s really point 3, I think, Mr Chairman The relationship of the aforesaid- -       And that has to do with the monetary aggregates      I think that’s right, if it is obviously that [inconsistent]  I don’t think that it  is  Many times before, the outsiders have said that the monetary policy was not consistent with  general objectives, and in fact it turned out to be consistent  So who knows?        It may lead to more of a crisis in this period [unintelligible] because then  the [Congressional] committee will make its recommendations for different policies to the  Congress, so Congress could instruct us to do this       Yes       But we haven’t been prepared to say that the Committee’s economic--       12/19/78          56       You remember we passed that through       And then furthermore not directing the staff to develop an economic plan  that would be consistent with the President’s but to develop reasonable alternative economic and  monetary plans and then talk about what the relationship [to the President’s economic goals] might  be        That it’s reasonably consistent        I think any nominal GNP is achievable  I think it’s the price/real [GNP]  relationship that comes to [unintelligible]  If he said he wanted a 20 percent increase in nominal  GNP, I’m sure you could achieve it with monetary policy  Then he might say it would be 8 percent  real and 12 percent prices  We might think it would be 4 percent real and 16 percent prices         Well, is it okay if this first time we go about it the way that is described  here?       Yes, I think this will have to be a probing thing       Well, number 5, I think is pretty easy       We went out of [order]; I lost my page  Oh, there it is  We just have  [proposed] some minor word changes in the directive to conform to the expressions used in the  Humphrey-Hawkins Act  It might be possible also, in the future, to discard the first several  paragraphs of the directive  The [rest of the] committee impressed on me the wisdom of waiting  until we find out what the Merrill decision is before we decide on that  So this involves just a few  minor word changes          Yes, really the main thing is the phrase used in expressing our long-term  monetary objectives, which follows the Humphrey-Hawkins language  A couple of other word  changes [are suggested] because of other factors; we are talking about annual rather than moving  12-month targets  So I don’t think there should be any discussion       I think it is fundamental  I think the last sentence of recommendation 6 is  the one to read  We wanted to assist you in saying what the Committee decisions ought to be from  meeting to meeting by tracking what has been happening in a very explicit way and by having the  staff provide alternative feasible routes for getting back [within the ranges]  We had in mind  maybe a 3-month adjustment period and a 6-month adjustment period  That may have to vary  some, but we don’t want to be caught with a fixed rule that forces the Manager to do something  between meetings that hadn’t been anticipated  And that’s all we are saying here       Well, I think that ought to be subject to a straight vote, Mr Chairman  He  is suggesting changing the recommendation to the inverse of whether or not that’s--       Well, he changes a sentence in another part of it  But I think what the new  law requires us to do basically is to say what kind of economic results we are going to have--not  what kind of monetary aggregates [in terms of] target estimates, but what kind of monetary  aggregates we have in mind as a means in the process of getting to the general economic results     12/19/78          61    [we want]  And I think, since we won’t be slipping the base, that is what it requires us to do and  what I would expect the Chairman to say--       Many [times in the] middle of the year it doesn’t look as if we are going to  have monetary aggregates for the year that we thought in February were appropriate  And the  reason is that the way things have developed they are no longer appropriate and, therefore, we are  changing our target for the year  I think that is quite a different thing than saying we are going to  live by a fixed monetary rule, which is really what Larry is suggesting       If we are going to have a fixed rule, we have to have it in place in  February      Also, Mr Chairman, there’s a question of what we decide at the meeting as  to what we authorize the Manager to do  We think the time for the decisions is at the Committee  meetings and not--      I like Ernie’s proposal       I don’t think number 7 has to be decided  What it means, in effect, if we  don’t decide it, is that in February we will continue as we have today to have a short-run 2-month  growth range that is the trigger range for determining action  We tried simply here to develop an  arithmetic equivalent that will be more stable for cosmetic public relations purposes  It wasn’t to  have any effect on the way the Manager responded or the speed with which he responded to  changes but simply to give something that would reduce the amount of instability in the reported  monetary aggregates we are looking at as our specialized targets  But there is disagreement    President Volcker doesn’t care for it too much; I really pushed this in part because of the people,  like President Eastburn, who wanted to have a long-run profile for the Committee, but he’s not sure  about it  So I would suggest that we just drop this       Let me add, the baloney is what the baloney is, no matter how you slice it       That is the main intent       I would [note], Mr Chairman, that this was in the Bluebook this time  But  it was so far buried that I at least didn’t find it the first time through  It’s Appendix 4 that presents  the information in the new style  I would suggest that next time we ask [the staff] to do it in  Appendix 1, as an alternative, and we can discuss it more in February       Well, we’ll bring it up into the text, then       No, it won’t go as high, but they will be not as high longer       The last recommendation, Mr Chairman, is a non-recommendation  It had  been proposed by some that we add to the long-term targets specified under the Humphrey-  Hawkins bill something like reserves or the monetary base or one of the basic monetary aggregates  We can see no particular purpose for doing so because whatever problems there are in specifying  the long-term money numbers for M1, M2, M1+, and M3, and so forth, will exist also in specifying  the monetary base  So we don’t see any advantage to doing that      We have been trying to do that  And I must say it’s a very complex  question        As an operating variable     "
926,1979-02-06," I think that's a good idea I really don't know  what great 1-elevance it has, and we certainly can raise it easily  enough, but I think Phil's right It's a 6-week interval and there is  a lot of churning in the market We don't know what the weather is  going to be Why not make it $5 billion?   You remember we had it at $5 billion and then we  raised it   M R   COLDWELL We raised it another $1 billion   I see Well, I hadn't quite noticed that  earlier   That's how they get rates as low as they did  If we didn't have that shift in demand for money, interest rates would  be higher   3 percent   Well, the recipient of the check has less,  according to the bank   That's assuming that the bank gives credit for  funds not received   I hope you're right because it certainly would  help to explain January if you are right   Well, we're going to have to address a number of  issues and make a number of linkages to get to these long-range  aggregates The first is the question of the correctness of the  staff's economic projection I can't say that I see anything much  wrong with it except that I was reminded of Governor Shepardson's  comment one time many years ago after a chart show like this There  is a tendency, which I noticed throughout your charts, for the dotted  lines on the right hand side of the charts, [representing your  projection], to be a lot more stable than the solid lines on the left  side [depicting actual data for the past] And I wonder why that is!   In a way, that's the problem here Because  although I understand why the dotted lines are fairly straight, the  line for the rate of growth in the real economy is straight at an  extraordinarily low level That is, for 6 quarters running the line  shows an increase in real GNP of around 1-1/2 percent   And the staff has 6 quarters of industrial  production increases of 1-1/2 percent or thereabouts Similarly, for  consumption and investment and business inventories, the [growth] rate  numbers are all very stable and really quite moderate The question I     2 / 6 / 7 9  -12-   suppose a business cycle economist would have to ask is whether we can  have 6 quarters of such low growth without something happening--either  [the economy1 tipping into recession because of a lack of momentum or  something coming, say, from the international area in military  preparedness [spending] or something like that which would in some way  speed up the [expansion] process I have to say that I’m inclined to  think that we’ll tip into recession during this period But even if  we do [not] tip into recession, there is a second problem as I see it  And that is that if the staff forecast is correct--and I still think  it’s on the optimistic side rather than the pessimistic side from the  standpoint of real activity--it is below the Administration’s goals,  particularly for 1980,  and we do have to associate what we’re doing  with the short-run goals of the Administration I looked it up,  Nancy, and it is clearly two years   M S   TEETERS At this time?   Yes, at this time we have to say what the  relationship of our policy for the next year is to the 2-year short-  run goals [of the Administration]   No It’s clear if you read the language of the  Act, as I did yesterday afternoon   We are to give our monetary objectives--   But you see, maybe this [requirement] was  somewhat deliberate on the presumption that monetary policy has a  leading effect on the economy If you look at this [forecast], you  see that although we‘re not far [from the Administration] for 1979  on  the real and the nominal, in 1980 we depart quite a bit further And  the reason for that is that in the second half of 1979  when the  Administration goal shows a recovery in housing we don‘t have one  It’s one of the biggest single differences Therefore, I’m inclined  to think that unless policy does something on the real side, we‘re  going to run short of the stated goals of the Administration Now, it  could be argued--and perhaps this is the best thing to do--that we‘re  also going to miss their goals on the inflation side because it  certainly seems improbable that the rate of inflation will decline to  the extent that they have in their projections But one of the  developments that takes place when we’re talking as we are about such  a very low rate of increase in the economy is a rise in the  unemployment rate And that gets the unemployment rate to a fairly  significant level--over 7 percent in the staff projection--by the end  of the forecast period In my view it will get to 7 percent by the  end of this year, not next year I think the economy is that much  weaker So we do have that problem     2/6/79 -13-   Now, with ATS and velocity and shifts in the demand schedule  and all that, we can probably assert that almost anything we put down  is consistent with the objectives of Humphrey-Hawkins and indeed it  may be because the range of variation and experience on, say, the  demand schedule alone is larger than the kinds of variations that we  talk about in the growth of the aggregates But we do have this  additional problem, as You said in the beginning, MrChairman, that  we’re going to have to stick with these ranges throughout the year  And, therefore, they will become a little more binding than before I  think 2 to 5 percent or even 2 to 4-112 percent on M1 is okay, but we  ought to say we’re assuming that ATS and NOW accounts will continue to  come in at something like their recent rate, which has had an effect  of about 3 percentage points on the observed growth rate in M1 Then,  if that changes, which in my opinion it might well do, we will be able  to say it has changed and therefore the recorded numbers have changed  But on M2 and M3, I‘m inclined to want somewhat higher growth ranges  than might otherwise be indicated by the present situation because I  think it will be very difficult to say we‘re going to have  substantially lower growth in M2 and M3 as well as M1 in this period  to come So I would take the risk of having a wider range, even  though it might result in some criticism from the Congress I would  pick the numbers that Steve last mentioned--5-1/2 to 8-112 percent for  M2, believing myself that it’s more likely to be 5-112 than 8-112, and  6-112 to 9-112 percent for M3, believing that it’s likely to be 6-112  And, as I say, I’d choose 2 to 4-112 percent or something on that  order for M1 I think we stand a fair chance of being able to live  within those ranges as the year goes on   I think, Bob, that ‘79 and ‘80 are legitimate  projections and the next three years are nothing but a straight line  [extension]   M R   MAYO Well, that’s true But even in ‘80 I think one of  the main reasons we are more pessimistic than the Council relates to  their attempt to have a dotted line again   They’re aware that it’s an election year also   What if they are wrong?   But you do understand M1   In the Dallas area?   1 - 1 / 2  percent?   That's right   I would point out, Nancy, that there was no  reference made to this table on page 1 4  [of the Bluebook]   The midpoint of it, yes, but not really [the  whole range]   It looks to June and to the middle of the fourth  quarter It tells us how much growth we have to have in the future to  make up what has happened to date And I believe the midpoint of the  ~1 range is what's now being proposed [as our objective], isn't it?   So, to get up to the midpoint of the proposed  long-term range--   --we'd have to have 8  3  percent growth between  now and March and 51 percent between now and June And those are--     2/6/19 -26-   I understand that, but we’ve got that behind us   I don’t think the comment you made that it  implies higher interest rates is necessarily true, Nancy It depends  on the economy If the economy is strong and we get a lot of  inflation, they probably would go higher; but otherwise I think it is  fairly neutral   Mark, I think, wants it much lower   So you ought to be put at least in the Axilrod  group   Well, it's for a whole year We can't really  tell   The staff thinks that the interest rates in  Appendix I go with it, assuming that their GNP projection is right   A little higher   On the other hand, if we get a cyclical decline  of the kind Frank was talking about--   We're hopeful that velocity will grow more than  normal but we won't put that in those numbers   And we were taking 6-1/4   Assuming that ATS accounts continue to grow   I'll change my ""I guess so"" to ""yes""   All these numbers are lower than before, and the  foreigners might perceive it--   1-1/2 percent is not the bottom   It's below that because we might have a negative  on the demand shift   The ATS won't reverse; it can stop, but it won't  reverse   This kind of a range, of course, is just for  discussion inside this room     2/6/19 -31-   I think we can say it's supportive but that we  will have to review it as time goes on   It's goals rather than projections on their  part   can say well that's what we tried to do and then we got higher or  lower--   I would prefer the other   I agree with that, but I don't see why we should  raise the funds rate if the aggregates are strong   It would I have great confidence in Steve but,  on the other hand, there just isn't a wisp of evidence of what he's  predicting   Which is what the nominal GNP is; that's how it  gets there   You're talking about a real money market  directive without any aggregates specified It has been a long time  since - -   I think we want to look even-handed, too, and  that [Bluebook] directive would not look even-handed     2/6/19 -31-   But it’s equally true, Henry, that there is a  strong reason for not letting the rate rise if we think the economy is  vulnerable, and I think the economy is vulnerable   We could refer to the improved telephonic  system   I would take a somewhat lower range on M1 and M2  than those suggested, but I would want to cut the funds range to  10-1/4 percent, [not retain] the 9-3/4 to 10-1/2 percent I‘d focus  on aggregates around those ranges, which I think is very close to what  Dave proposed to us   Both ends   I must say, Mark, that I really do think we’re  talking about an arithmetic--   Yes we’re way below   That’s why I think we ought to cut the funds  rate range to a range [centered] around where we are, [by going to]  9-3/4 to 10-1/4 percent I must say my notion for accepting these  lower aggregates is associated with [the presumption of a centeredl  funds rate--with the idea that [we will consult] if we run up toward  the high end or down toward the low end   Where is it exactly now?   So we use the full range of 3 to 7 percent?   Maintain about the current rate     2/6/19 -44-    Who cares about the domestic economy? We're  only concerned about the foreign exchange rates!   I really think we could do away with that whole  phrase  "
950,1979-03-20," Right where it was before You [at the Desk]  have overcome this entirely   May I ask just one, M r   Chairman? Jim, you  mentioned the decline in contract awards I presume you mean  nonresidential   Is it considerable and what kind is it? Is it  in some [particular] kind of building? There is an offsetting  development in the strength of durable goods orders That's why I  wanted to pursue it a bit   It's drifting off   It is in the structures area, not in electric  generating or something like that in the nonbuilding area   It‘s a projection really   Yes, netting out their certificates, and they  mainly hold CDs Of course, that’s double counting not to net out the  CDs    Mr Chairman, last week I appeared before the  House Subcommittee on Monetary Affairs to discuss monetary policy in  the context of our Humphrey-Hawkins report, but the discussion soon  turned to current monetary policy Steve and I did our best to defend  current monetary policy before the Subcommittee The reason I mention  this is that I'm obliged to report to you that the Chairman of the     3 / 2 0 / 7 9  -11-   Subcommittee, Parren Mitchell, wants the FOMC to know that he is  concerned He says he’s concerned not as an economist because he  isn’t an economist, not as a monetarist because he doesn’t understand  the arcane area of monetarism, but as an historian because he has  noted that every time there is substantial and sustained weakness in  the money supply, a recession follows He wonders why the current  situation would differ from previous situations   Now, I must say that I‘m not a monetarist either, but I do  have some sympathy with Chairman Mitchell’s view of this It does  seem to me that we’ve had a sustained period of weakness in the money  supply It has been five months, October through February Perhaps  that’s marginal; it may need another couple of months to be truly  sustained, but it’s getting pretty close to a sustained weakness now  I think it is also true that the weakness in money supply growth is  substantial If one makes the adjustment for ATS and NOW accounts,  which I think is appropriate, one gets about a 1-1/2 percent average  rate of increase in the narrow money supply over this five month  period, compared with the 8 percent rate of increase recorded for a  good many of the preceding months That is a significant step down in  the rate of expansion I don‘t really believe much in taking these  developments such as money market funds and money market certificates  and RPs and that kind of thing as an explanation because they have  occurred in the past That‘s simply the reflection of what happens  when interest rates are high; the rate of return on cash money is zero  and people try to find substitutes It’s the process of finding  substitutes, as I said on the phone the other day, that we’re really  describing when we look at this   Turning to the economic situation, I, too, think there are  indications that we are in the last stage of a boom Consumer  spending has flattened; it has declined in real terms since the first  of the year There’s a little push in car sales, but that‘s simply a  matter of clearing out the small cars because of the prospect that gas  prices will certainly be higher and gas may be in short supply  Housing has clearly turned down I don‘t think there’s any way one  can read the decline of the last two months as being an entirely  weather-related phenomenon because those developments are too  widespread There are too many other indications of weakness  developing in that area, and we’ve just taken an action that will  assure that the big lenders are not going to have as much money as  they did before to put into the mortgage market I don’t think  capital spending is going anywhere I’m quite impressed by the  decline in contracts; I think all we’ve had is a little bubble in new  orders for capital equipment that isn’t going to last very long and  can, after all, be reversed by cancellations One should always  remember about those new orders that a great many of them are subject  to cancellation; many orders were cancelled after there was a bubble  in ‘74 and then the recession of ‘75 So, that can happen It is  conceivable that we will have a period of rapid business inventory  accumulation and we may have some scare buying of materials; that  seems to have been going on, but I don’t think it will last very long   So, I would have to say, looking at the real economy as well  as the monetary numbers, that I now believe a recession is very  likely--a recession which at this point the Federal Reserve will have  done nothing about We will have made no effort to block it in any  way We will have sat here again, seeing very weak monetary     3 / 2 0 / 1 9  -12-   aggregates as a precedent to the recession phase I believe we're in  considerable danger of that happening You often ask us to give our  views on [economic] growth over the policy period [relative to the  staff's views], which are at the bottom of page 8 [of the Summary and  Outlook part of the Greenbook] I don't think we're going to have 17  percent real growth this year It could possibly be a bit above zero,  but not very much I don't think we're going to have 87 percent  inflation I think the staff has finally managed to predict a number  that is higher than the one we will realize That's partly because of  my weaker scenario, but partly because I'm also very convinced that  businesses are raising prices in anticipation of wage and price  controls And whether or not wage and price controls occur, these  firms have taken their action and there will be a moderation in those  markups in the period to come And, of course, I don't expect the  unemployment rate to be 63 percent at the end of the year I think it  will be 7 percent or above So, that's the situation as I see it   I wouldn't think you'd build anything in that  weather !   We should have had Ernie here to view those  large tractors   That's "" B  ""    Well, if I had the nerve, I would suggest what  Frank Morris did because I think that is what's really required if  we're to have any chance of avoiding a recession And [even] that  might not do it, but it's a start But I do think there is more of a  signal hazard in the current rate of inflation than that policy would  make appropriate I believe that we have lost a lot of ground with  reference to the projections that we gave to the Congress just six  weeks ago and we don't have a sliding base or anything of that kind  any more So I would hate to see us lose any ground relative to those  presumed growth rates in the aggregates, unless we could say to  Congress that we're doing that because the business outlook is really  very much stronger than we expected, and that's not the case If  anything, it's very much weaker than we anticipated or than we said  was consistent with our policy I think it's important to look at the  aggregates and I would go to an aggregates directive I could live  with 4 to 8 percent [for Ml] If you look at [the chart on1 page 13,     3 / 2 0 / 7 9  -28-   4 percent picks the growth up just a bit and 8 percent would get us to  about the lower limit, so I could live with 4 to 8 percent in the  spirit of compromise I would like to raise M2 to 4 to 8 percent also  because I think it’s very difficult to interpret what may happen in  terms of the distribution of money market certificates between banks  and thrifts when there is no differential and that is going to tend to  favor the banks over the thrifts Therefore, I would lift that range  just slightly in order to allow for that contingency So 4 to 8  percent on both M1 and M2 I think would be satisfactory   On the funds rate range, I would like to tilt it downward a  bit, though not as much as John Balles would I can‘t visualize  within those aggregate ranges any reason at all for taking the funds  rate over 10-1/4 percent So I think 10-1/4 percent ought to be the  top and 9-1/2 percent ought to be the bottom And I would treat [the  range1 asymmetrically; that is, I’d leave the funds rate at 10 percent  or a tad above where it is now until the aggregates begin to move If  they begin to show weakness within their ranges--toward the lower end  of the ranges or below--1 would then move the funds rate down I  think the time has come to do that, if in fact we have another month  where the aggregates are quite weak Now, the staff is predicting  that they won’t be and if the staff is right, there wouldn’t be any  easing But if the staff is wrong, there would be an easing So my  preference would be 9-1/2 to 10-1/4 percent with a midpoint of 10  percent from the standpoint of current Desk operations   We don't know that for sure We might actually  be in one   Of the voting members?   And then just have a money market directive   It is just four weeks until the next meeting, is  that right?   Well, I would buy it for four weeks, but I find  it too tight   With a quarter point range on the funds rate?   What would we do in the case of a tie?   You mean just continue the present fed funds  range?   I think so, too   Oh, really? I thought we had a range   What would be the effect of that anyway, Henry?   I see   I agree with you It's undesirable   What is that differential customarily, Peter?   About double?   Without contacting the Subcommittee?   Then why not make it subject to prior approval,  if there have been prior conversations?   In that case, the Chairman--   If the Chairman is not accessible, does somebody  substitute for the Chairman?   SPEAKER(?) Yes     3 / 2 0 / 1 9  -40-   I think it's procedurally poor   M R   COLDWELL I think it is, too, but it's even worse on the  next page I don't think it's desirable for the Subcommittee to  authorize an open position above $1 billion The full Committee ought  to look at an open position change above $1 billion   Well, I don't disagree with $1-112 billion, Mr  Chairman, but I think the Subcommittee ought to be formally involved  before we get to $1 billion, maybe at $600 million     3 / 2 0 / 1 9  -41-   Say $ 6 0 0  million, or 2 days--  "
969,1979-04-17," Silence is golden!   Alan, had there not been all this intervention,  do you believe that the dollar would have been substantially higher?   That is, it wasn’t supply bringing forth its own  demand?   So speculators against the dollar might have  been squeezed in the absence of this intervention, I suppose   Would you say that there would have been  disorderly strength in the dollar?   Well, it's a breakthrough then     4/11/79 -3-    Peter, after these fluctuations over the last  six weeks or so, how would you characterize the short-term markets--  the short-term government market and the short-term private market--in  relationship to the funds rate? That is, do you think the  relationship is about normal or are rates high or low relative to the  funds rate?   So the government rates may be a little high  relative to the funds rate, but the private rates--those on commercial  paper and CDs and so forth--are low, aren’t they?   Willis, I might just say that it took a little  while for this money market certificate change to take hold There  were various cut-off dates The credit unions didn't [get] cut off  until the end of the month In one city in Alabama we let every  [institution] go to the end of the month It took a while to get all  that adjusted out, but the intention--and the expectation--is to do  away with that differential, which will shift some flows from the  thrifts to the banks   They might because, after all, the compounding  effect was cut back, so there is also a greater disadvantage compared  with the market than there was   Well, I just want to comment on what John said  I have some sympathy with that, John The fact is that I might admit  that [what you talked about] used to be one of my inside devices for  forecasting if we had extended misses in the staff projections  Incidentally, Steve doesn't really do those In his position I used  to find that if the extended misses were in one direction, it was an     4/11/79 -10-   indication of a change But what one has to examine is the reason for  that Is it that the staff is assuming there will not be a  substantial change in the relationship between activity and money  growth? The issue right now, I think, is whether there has been a  change in the relationship that is not indicative of the future but  indicative of a change in the demand function So when you point out  that the staff has misforecast over the last six months, all you’re  pointing out is that there has been some kind of change in the  relationship, which the staff increasingly has come to believe is a  change in the demand function S o  it doesn’t really answer--in case  this has happened and I’m inclined to think it has happened to a  degree at least--the aggregate [unintelligible] You would have to be  a strict monetarist to believe that there can‘t be a change in the  demand function of money and, therefore, [that money] must be a  forecast of the future   Well, I think the picture is mixed It seemed  to me possible that we could have one final surge of activity and I’ve  been quite worried over the last six weeks or so that that might be  developing in the business sector in business equipment and in  inventories Whether right or not, I‘ve become rather more calm about  inventories in the last couple of weeks For one, the February  numbers were better; retail inventories were down For another, there  do seem to be some explanations--Jim cited quite a list--for the  inventory accumulation The Teamster’s strike, the possibility of a  rubber strike, the automobile situation, and so forth may have  accounted for the unusual inventory accumulation that was reflected in  the Redbook and for the raw materials price figures in the first part  of this year So I‘m prepared broadly to accept the staff’s forecast  except that I, of course, think that the economy is going to weaken  further and we’ll have a recession toward the end of this year and  [into] early next year But let me say that for the time being the  staff’s forecast looks reasonable to me   Another problem that we’re all struggling with is the  aggregates and how to interpret them It seems to me that it has  almost reached the point where it may just be a matter of one’s  predilection Some people say we ought to tighten regardless of the  aggregates because they’re no good anymore and other people say the  aggregates are just as potent as they used to be and are terribly  important Trying to sort through all this, I’ve been looking at the  various credit numbers Bank credit, which had shown some strength,  seems to have been weakening as the quarter progressed as have other  credit numbers M5, for example, has been weakening steadily But  that measure doesn’t include RPs and money market funds and things  like that One of the difficulties we have at this time when interest  rates are very high--we’ve had it before--is that there’s a good deal  of grossing up in credit flows And it’s easy to double count credit  flows For example, if a money market mutual fund expands rapidly in  size and buys bank CDS, you can’t count both the bank CDs in the bank  sector and the money market mutual fund on the other side because  that‘s double counting That’s not really demand for credit or a  credit flow If a savings and loan or a mutual savings bank issues a  money market certificate and buys a bank CD, the same is true There     4 / 1 7 / 7 9  -15-   is excessive grossing, which doesn't really have anything to do with  the economy   They are, but we don't really [track that]  I've found, for example, that our Bluebook doesn't have M I   But they  are netted out in another way That is, the f l o w  of funds accounts  have a line for funds raised by nonfinancial sectors That is like  final demand in the GNP, if you will In looking at that and relating  it to GNP, I think I have found something of significance for the  Committee to focus on That number has been quite high over the last  six quarters It was lower in the earlier part of the recovery and  expanded sharply in the last half of ' 7 7  and the first three quarters  of ' 78   Going through those five quarters, for example, the numbers  were 2 0  4 ,  1 8  7 ,  1 8  8 ,  1 8  3 ,  and 191 percent The average is a high  number; it's distinctly higher than it had been before In the fourth  quarter of ' 7 8  funds raised as a percentage of GNP dropped from 1 9  1   to 1 7  6  percent And in the first quarter of this year the estimate  of our flow of funds people is that it dropped further to 1 4  2   percent That's a rather marked drop--almost 5 percentage points in  two quarters--carrying it well below where it was earlier in the  recovery phase And I think it is indicative of the fact that for  some reason the demand for credit isn't there It may be [because of1  interest rates, it may be nonprice terms, or it may be as Steve  suggested that the expected rate of return on capital is dropping  But fo r  some reason [that demand] isn't there And I think it does  indicate in a very real sense that in the financial sector of the  economy a fading is occurring that is consistent with very slow growth  if not a downturn in the economy shortly And I believe we ought to  keep that very much in mind as we talk about making these [decisions]  that affect the demand for credit and make credit even more  restrictive or less restrictive   It depends on the expected rate of inflation   Because of the tornado, that’s true   I wonder what would happen if we didn't have a  [new] directive I guess we would continue on the old directive   Mr Chairman, I think we really ought to be  easing It’s past time We’ve already gotten ourselves into  considerable difficulty with respect to the behavior of the real  economy And I agree that there isn’t much we can do to restrain the  kind of inflation we have now other than to encourage moderate demand  over the long pull That’s really the only instrument we have  available to us to affect prices The difficulty with easing now is  that the public perception is wrong In fact, all these newspaper  articles and so forth have trapped us, or at least they have trapped  me I can’t quite ease in the face of that Also, I have a modest     4/11/19 -26 -    concern yet about the March employment numbers--I'd like to see  another month's figures--and the possibility of an inventory hump I  think the latter is still possible, but less likely than it seemed  before   So for the time being I would favor an unchanged policy but  in an easing mode, one might say And for that purpose we might as  we11 have a money market directive because that certainly is what  we've had all year It doesn't make any difference what those  aggregates have been We've kept the funds rate unchanged and we  ought to do it again And if we are going to do that, it seems to me  that [our decisions] ought to begin to reflect something of the  longer-term strategy that you've indicated here--relating to these  charts that have to do with our Humphrey-Hawkins pledge so to speak  I think 3 to I percent is too low for M1 if we intend to move back on  track at all I would make that 4 to 8 percent, as I think somebody  else suggested Well, there were a number of suggestions along that  line And I think we need to raise M2, which is going to miss the  range even more In that case, 5 to 9 percent would be a [step] on  the way to that That's within the context of the money market  directive That doesn't necessarily mean we would move, but we ought  to try, to the extent that it is at all feasible, to have short-range  target growth rates that are not inconsistent with moving back into  the [long-run1 bands that we have specified Otherwise we ought to  decide to change the bands and so inform the Congress So, I would  raise those two specs a little but with an unchanged funds rate of  9-314 percent I'd be happy with a range of 9-3/4 to 10-1/4 percent  I don't know why the range needs to go up to 10-1/2 percent; we're not  going to move there, I hope, in the period to come   I had the same specs as you did, Mr Chairman   Henry’s safe!   HOW about 3 to 9 percent?   An indication?   What about the aggregates?   No, you certainly didn’t Of course, you’re not  looking with us on the money market-- [Laughter]   Yes   M S   TEETERS Yes   Yes   What would it take to get two aggregates  directive people on line for the [money market] directive?   That's certainly better   You're going to try 4 to 8 percent on Ml?   Mr Chairman, I have real concern about the  Federal Reserve holding substantial foreign currency balances I  don’t think it’s the appropriate thing for us to do I’ve never liked  the idea of US institutions in general holding large foreign  balances [It means they] aren’t financing their primary activity of  spending or investment or whatever it is I think we have a swap  system that is perfectly adequate; it was developed over time I  found the reasoning in both memos very strained as to what the  advantages would be in terms of being able to operate without the  blessing of the Bundesbank or whatever That’s because, in fact, when  we spend marks--whether we borrow and spend them or we [hold them and]  just spend them--the Germans are going to have the same liquidity  problem We’re going to have the same tolerance of their sentiments  as we would otherwise Also, let me mention that we seem to get a  good deal lower rate of return on these [balances], at least in the  case of Germany and I guess Switzerland and [Japan] I was interested  to see that apparently my concern was shared by the framers of the  Federal Reserve [Act] because both memos specify that the Federal     4 / 1 7 / 7 9  - 3 8 -    Reserve Act says that it is against the law for the Federal Reserve to  hold foreign currency securities Then they go on to--   The one [reference] says government securities;  the other doesn’t The other says foreign currency securities Then  [the memo1 goes on to say that we can get around the law I don’t  think that‘s an appropriate thing for the Federal Reserve to do--to  find a way to get around the law If we have a need for relatively  small working balances, that‘s one thing But if we‘re going to  develop [a program for1 large amounts of foreign currency holdings,  that’s another I also noticed with interest that the memo from  Messrs Holmes and Pardee says on page 9 that a good cushion to begin  with would be two or three days‘ worth of heavy intervention That  signals to me an intent here and a very possible threat of building up  large balances So I must say I oppose it   Well, why the prohibition on foreign government  securities if it is--   Did they prohibit everything that there wasn‘t  anything of?   Oh so they didn't prohibit it?   That, of course, was built up when the dollar  was weak Now we're going to build up a risk when the dollar is  strong   I just want to make one additional comment on  another aspect that perhaps Committee members haven’t thought of I  have agreed to talk to the farmers who circled the building a few  weeks ago and who want to borrow from the Federal Reserve at a low  rate I will tell them that we can’t use Federal Reserve credit for  that purpose because it’s used to run the monetary system and all we  do is invest in government securities and try to provide the right  amount of reserves A few years ago we took the same position with  New York City when they wanted to borrow--that it wasn‘t a proper use  of Federal Reserve credit But we are talking about using up to $2  billion of Federal Reserve credit to support the mark or the yen, or  the Swiss franc at a low rate of return And I think that reduces our  ability to resist these other demands for the use of--   It’s pretty hard to do that with the  agricultural bloc they have in Europe   Oh, so it isn’t disorderly conditions It’s an  appropriate rate for the dollar   No   M S   TEETERS Yes  "
991,1979-04-27," As I look at the M1 number, it appears that we are going to have a  two-month average here that’s very high It seems to me that the staff estimate for May is making  full allowance for the oddities of the April figure and, therefore, we will have an 8 percent or  thereabouts increase for the two months and it could be considerably more I’m also impressed by  the strength of the bank credit numbers--both the revision and the April bank loan numbers at the  large banks--which seem to me to put us back more on the track [prevailing] early in the year than  in March And finally, I’m impressed by Peter’s argument on the Treasury financing These are  long-term issues and I think if there is a prospect of [our] moving, that we ought to signal it before  those auctions because it’s not just a standard financing in my view when they’re going to be  selling a 30-year bond So I guess I would proceed to follow along the directive as written and do  what Peter suggested--raise the funds rate to 10-1/4 percent with the idea that if the strength holds  up we’ll move up further in the range in a couple of weeks   It’s fine  "
1012,1979-05-22," Gretchen, I've been interested in the strength  of the gold price during this same interval when the dollar has been     5/22/79 -4-   strong What do you hear about that or what is your view on the  movement in the gold price?   It could also be consistent with your comment  that it’s not so much that people have improved their opinion of the  outlook in the United States but that the outlook has deteriorated  everywhere else So all currencies are looking almost equally bad,  which leaves gold as the alternative   Zurich and Paris?   Would they have a negative carry on that, Peter?   But not knowing the real GNP!   Higher for [food] and for gas   Including defense?   Except for April   Was it a 13 percent increase on average over the  [first] quarter?   Well, that's one difference   I just wanted to say that I think Jim gave an  admirable answer to Frank on probabilities except that we do have the  energy situation, which is very, very difficult to [judge] It is  such a new factor Obviously it's going to lead to more inflation  than otherwise It's also obviously going to lead to less spending  than otherwise But how far either will move, I just don't think     5 / 2 2 / 1 9  -12-   there's any way of knowing One can imagine that the inflation effect  will fan out because it will show up in wage demands and automatic  cost-of-living increases and that kind of thing, and we may get as  much secondary effect from it as initial effect One can imagine on  the spending side that not only will people have to lower spending for  other necessities, but that it will have a great psychological effect  on spending, as you say, for durables, for housing, for vacation  homes, and for tourist travel We're getting into the summer season  when tourist travel is a very important element in budgets Who knows  what's going to happen? So there's an unusual amount of uncertainty  connected with the energy situation today But I think it's on the  negative side   Where else but in Texas would the legislators be  fugitives from justice?   Well, I come to exactly the opposite conclusion  that Steve did I think we ought to pay careful attention to the  aggregates and the growth in the aggregates in the period ahead I’d  widen the range on the funds rate and guard to see that we don’t have  undue weakness in the aggregates There‘s a good chance that the turn  has already occurred in the economy, that March will have been the  high in industrial production and that the second quarter--and we’re  two-thirds through the second quarter--will be the high in real terms     5/22/79 -23-   There is a very good chance that that's true We've always, with no  exception that I can recall, had great difficulty keeping the  aggregates growing in the early stages of a recession To go to an  interest rate target now at this turning point in the economy would be  exactly the wrong prescription for the Committee to follow S o ,  I  would say that we ought to have an aggregates target with modest  growth What we ought to do to fight inflation is to see that we have  only modest growth in the aggregates over a sustained period of time,  not crunch the economy into what--1 agree with Frank--could be a very  serious recession I think we could be in a much more serious  recession this year than the one in '74-'75 So I would like to see  quite modest growth in the aggregates over a sustained period, and I  think that probably means that we ought to have a wider funds rate  range If I could echo what was said I guess by John Balles, it may  be that a somewhat lower funds rate would be consistent with the  discount rate   I think that's an important point you made, Bob,  about the funds rate range having been at 9-3/4 to 10-1/2 percent, so  there would be an appearance of tightening if we went to 10 to 10-1/2  percent Of course my view, as I expressed before, is that we ought  to ease So I would put the funds range at 9-1/2 to 10-1/2 percent,  making it a little easier than last time There has been plenty in  the news to justify an immediate reduction of a quarter point in the  funds rate I'm referring not only to the new orders figures, which  are going to hit like a ton of bricks, but also to housing starts,  which were disappointing, and to industrial production, employment,  and retail sales data All those data have come out since the last  meeting of the Committee and in addition we have the fuel shortage  In effect, it's all new news that we're looking at in today's meeting  So I would take 9-1/2 to 10-1/2 percent as the range, with a 10  percent midpoint and a prompt move to the 10 percent     5/22/19 -31-   On the aggregates, just judging from this longer-term chart,  I would not like to see M1 as low as zero for the two months, which  would put it below the bottom end of the range again So I would  suggest 1 to 5 percent for M1 On M2 I think we ought to recognize  that money market certificates are doing much better in the banks  because of our success in getting rid of the differential, and for M2  I think we ought to have 5 to 9 percent, which would also move us  about to the bottom--perhaps just slightly above the bottom--of the  range by the end of the projection period And as I said before, I  would take the aggregates directive I think it's much more clearly  indicated now than it has been at any time in the last six months   Yes, I think [most] were for 0 or 1 percent on  the bottom and 4 or 5 percent on the top   I can't support it   I could accept it a l l  if we had a monetary  aggregates directive   [in a position similar to that of] John Balles, I suppose You want  to tighten and he wants to go lower and you can't change your  philosophical position I suppose   funds rate, to 10-3/8 percent, but I don't see anybody who is much  inclined to go that way   Oh, no it can't be consistent with that   He said we wouldn't go below 10 percent--   I don't know why you say they're so unreliable  They haven't been unreliable at all except for one month--April  They've been very reliably weak every month   All we would do is move the funds rate 118 point  at 3-112 percent [on M11 That's right at the borderline isn't it,  Steve?   And M2 would [have to] be up there, too   I thought it was clever     5/22/19 -31-   No, I don't I'd rather cut the funds rate to  10 percent right now, so I feel unhappy if I'm not permitted to do  that I would rather [vote against] the directive if that is not  called for   Especially with a I-week interval   What do you mean by once again sharing  Deutschmark purchases? We have shared them in the past?   Deutschmark purchases?   I see   It could easily amount to a couple hundred  million dollars a week, couldn't it?     Can’t we separate these two issues?   We could stay with the $500 million [limit] on  one [currency] and then have an additional $1 billion approved in a  special arrangement I just want to indicate that that’s the way I  probably would come out I didn‘t want to--   This is on going to $2 billion [on outright   Well, my preference would be $500 million I  think there's a great deal of exposure involved here I believe the  dollar may be considerably undervalued and that there could be a very  considerable appreciation of the dollar over the next year, and I  wouldn't like to see us lose this much money I also have a feeling  that the shoe ought to be pretty binding on the other side That is,  when a currency is declining as sharply as ours did last year, it  ought to be up to the country involved--   Well, that's right It finally went so far that  I agreed to it I think a country has its reservation points And it  seems to me that it ought to be the concern of the country as to what  that reservation point [is when its currency is] on the decline   Well, I had that attitude, too I was very much  opposed to it until [the dollar's weakness] went so far that I knew it  was oversold   I meant I wanted the $ 5 0 0  million in the  aggregate   No, I would remain with $500 million   I think that's a good way   So $800 million more--   And a couple of hundred million for the  Treasury, so it's about $12 billion   This would be in concert with the Japanese?  They would be in, doing 10 times what we're doing?   Well, I know On the other hand they've had  quite a decline in their currency So, yes  "
1032,1979-06-27," I guess I’d agree with Bob Mayo It’s very difficult to know what is  happening but it seems easy to conclude that monetary policy isn’t having much influence on it  The economy is moving down Jerry didn’t mention the [apparent] leak of the second-quarter  real GNP figure, which may or not be right, but it’s quite negative The economy is going to  move down further I don’t know how fast or how far We could be in for a quite deep  recession But the downturn has been caused by energy or energy prices and the income  redstribution that has happened because of that And I don’t think either the rate of inflation or  the rate of real growth is much affected by minor differences in monetary policy in this  environment My feeling is that over time in a situation like this we are best guided by the  aggregates and not by interest rates And although we’ve had these two blips [in money growth]  in April and June, we don’t quite know what accounts for them It could be a change in the  patterns of handling money Over a longer interval we’re really very much within our growth  ranges for both M1 and M2 And I think M3 probably is below the lower end of the range for  this interval So I don’t think there is anything at the moment to signal the need for a tightening  in order to try to restrain the growth in the aggregates Indeed, I would say that market rates have  dropped relative to a funds rate that has remained unchanged That in itself will tend to make     6/21/19   reserves ss available so there   5   I S  in fact been some tightening hink we have to guard against  a serious weakness in the aggregates but that isn’t our immediate problem So I think we ought to  stay right where we are  "
1054,1979-07-11," If they want the rate to be [unintelligible] and  if the fundamentals won't support that, to try to keep them from doing  that would seem to be a very wasteful exercise   Satisfy whom?   Well, I was going to ask Governor Wallich's  question on the other side I note that the total price index  excluding food and energy shows very little decline as a result of the  recession The chart that you have here doesn't show us what happened  in the '74-'75 [period], but I have the impression that there was more  reaction in those price indexes in that recession And when I look at  corporate profits in the Greenbook I find that they're very well  maintained rather than dropping rather sharply, as I would have  expected them to do So I wonder whether there isn't a possibility  that in fact you've overstated the price increase   Do you k n o w  what happened in ' 7 5 ?  W a s  there, in  fact, a decline in the base rate of inflation?   Excluding energy and food?   Are these fourth-quarter-to-fourth-quarter in  all cases?   It was just a regional recession   You are accepting the upward adjustment in the  average   Well, I think we ought to hold with our current  ranges for 1979 in a rather strict sense And I think we ought to say  that we are adjusting them simply for our changed ATS estimate As I  understand it, [that estimate] is down from about 3 percent to about  1-l/2 percent And I would state that in the document I'd say that  the assumption is now a 1-1/2 percent rate of increase rather than a 3  percent rate of increase, and I would then adjust M1 literally to 3 to  6 percent That would be [the equivalent of] 1-1/2 to 4-1/2 percent  or whatever it was--plus 1-1/2 on each side I think M2 ought to  remain at 5 to 8 percent, and I would leave the M3 range at 6 to 9  percent And I don't think I would change the bank credit numbers,  although that's not very significant and that could very well be done   For 1980, I agree--1 think it was Bob Black who said this--  that it is more PR than anything else at this stage It's very, very  provisional I would prefer to say that we would hope to have or we  would expect that we could have monetary growth within about the same  ranges in 1980 as in 1979 I'd make some very general statement like  that One of the reasons I think we need to be provisional about [the  1980 ranges] is that there has been very little attention to this  hand-out that shows our forecast against the Administration's  forecast And that does indeed create a considerable problem That  is, we have to indicate whether our policy is reasonably consistent     7/11/79 -27   with the Administration’s goals, and it doesn‘t look as if it is in  1980 Therefore, I think we have to be somewhat provisional to be  consistent with those goals   I also think we have to be very careful about 1980 because  this recession that’s being projected is an unusual one for two  reasons The first is that, as I understand it, given a fundamental  shift in consumption that is being predicted, I don‘t think there is  enough accelerator principle effect--that is, the reverse accelerator  effect on the business side That is to say, [the downturn] may well  turn out to be deeper Secondly, I know of no previous instance where  at this ‘“going in” stage--in the face of a major change in income  distribution and loss in income as well as a significant external  increase in the rate of inflation--there is no adjustment in either  fiscal or monetary policy to accommodate to that And if that in fact  occurs--that is, if we don’t have a $20 billion tax cut to consumers  to offset the loss [of income] from petroleum shifting to OPEC, and we  don’t have a high rate of growth in the money supply--1 think the  recession could be much deeper and much longer, and we may well have  to have an adjustment later on So, right now we ought to be  concerned about the appearance of these ranges for the aggregates that  we show to the public I would think that we ought to make just that  simple adjustment in 1979, and I wouldn’t want to alarm the market or  anybody with talk about an easing, although it may well occur, Emmett   Yes, but we are going to be talking publicly  here about our projections for 1980 and I just think it would alarm  the market I would rather do it in January when, in fact, we could  see how deep the recession is likely to be   It's not a [matter of substance]; it's a  measurement [issue] It's [how it is] measured   I think it has almost none on transactions  balances   [We'll be] high in the range or above the range  if ATS slows or stops   CHAlRMAN MILLER But we'd come out the same on an adjusted  basis as we would have previously Now, that's one way to approach  it We've made the full disclosure but haven't got the press putting  out new numbers with all the confusion that goes with them I don't  know whether that's satisfactory or not [but it's1 a possibility     7/11/79 -31-   It’s more a question of the impressions that  people have rather than some [number of] basis points   We didn't cut the money growth [ranges] for the  other things   Yes, but we've got to explain that   We can't really make out where we are   Added in ATS   I would accept it   Well, we would adjust the ranges   M R   GUFFEY Pardon me?   We'd adjust the range     7/11/79 - 3 6 -    That's our present plan   I wouldn't be prepared to support anything  except an expression of hope, in much the way you did Frankly, I  don't think we'll be able to do it   You could have ""giving due regard to the  domestic side"" overriding attention   Well, I agree with Nancy But in deference to  the international situarion, I would postpone the reduction in the  funds rate until next week [But] the fact of the matter is it’s  going to get worse and worse and worse And if those people are going  to follow a policy of deliberate appreciation in their currencies,  which is what the British are doing certainly, and I think the Germans  are also--     1 / 1 1 / 7 9  -46-   Well, I don’t think we ought to get dragged  along with them into a worldwide depression And I think we ought to  stop it So I agree, but what I would do is take the aggregates  specifications-- Well, I would take all of the specifications   Those of alternative 11, but I‘d call for an  immediate reduction in the funds rate to 10 percent   We have had one of the sharpest declines [in  retail sales], as far as I can recall, over 4 or 5 months It‘s  really staggering when you consider the size of that component in GNP,  to have a 6 - l / 2  or 7 - 1 / 2  percent decline over a 5-month period   At $125 a gallon   Well, I guess I‘ll take money market this time   Well, I take it on the fact that we don't know  what the President is going to say on the oil crisis   I think that’s right I wouldn’t do it now   I feel closest to the same reasoning Henry  [cited] unless somebody says there‘s a strong advantage to it   Use the word ""advantage""  "
1077,1979-07-17," Well, I agree with Phil that it's a little early It looks as if it could be quite a problem but it's a little early to say for sure I believe that a significant tightening of money would have bad consequences for the US economy in a situation that is weakening [Our economy] is weakening already and, therefore, it's something that I would contemplate with only the greatest reluctance But I guess I have to indicate that if we have a snowballing situation, with a cumulative decline in the dollar and a loss of confidence in the currency, that may be our only course I think that an increase in the discount rate wouldn't be sufficient; we'd have to follow through with some federal funds rate action So, let's be clear about it What we are really talking about is a tightening in monetary policy that isn't associated with the performance of the domestic economy and that is a major, major step to take In the meantime, of course, I think we ought to try to defend the currency And we ought to have an active intervention program because it's particularly difficult for the President in the way his speech is received to see the market declining hour after hour and day after day That will certainly undermine whatever psychological effect it might have had "
1120,1979-08-14," Why would you want to do it?  Whether it's below water? But we're not going to liquidate the account  That's the reason  Oh, really that long?  It's probably completely under water then!  The British [action] is a change in policy, and to some degree it looks like the Canadians might be included in that  We have a $2 billion [swap line] with Canada  The projected deficit goes up $10 billion next year, Jerry, and I don't think it would go up if we didn't have a recession  Demographics  I just wanted to ask for your interpretation of the retail sales figures, Jerry [The article] in the paper was a little confusing The July increase looked very small to me but then there was some talk of a revision in May and June and I couldn't really make it out  But were they revised very much? This is just a question of fact  One percent?    8/14/79  Sounds like a tight money man!  A little latent optimism!  On balance I guess I agree with Frank Morris more than anyone, although there are points of similarity [with other views] I think the economic outlook is so bad that I wonder whether I'm missing something That is, it seems to me that a substantial drop in consumption will have more effect than any other factor on capital spending A substantial drop in capital spending and consumption will have a major effect on inventories, and the prospects  -31-    8/14/79  are that we're in for a very serious recession if this continues So I've looked around for some things that would tell me I was wrong about that There are a few First of all, Frank, the stock market hasn't gone down I've looked back and in every other recession the stock market has dropped fairly early In fact, it has gone up over this period And those are people who are betting their money on the future course of events  The second thing that's interesting to me is that the risk premiums haven't increased in the securities markets They are close to their lowest point even for Chrysler, which is probably only the first of a number of corporations that will get to be in serious difficulty Even Chrysler hasn't [seen a rise in] those risk premiums, looking at low-grade corporates as against high-grade corporates or corporates as against governments or municipal bonds, low and high grade And even for Cleveland, the low grade muni premium is not large  The third thing is that the behavior of the money supply is extraordinarily strange We haven't had a period associated with a recession in which we had really weak money growth followed by quite strong money growth It has been a rather mixed picture, but generally speaking the monetary aggregates weaken and stay on the weak side; they may be positive but they stay on the weak side until pretty close to the lower turning point This time we seem to have had 4 to 5 months now of strength It could be a change in the demand function, as Steve suggests, but that always bothers me because we can just do that Arithmetically anything we don't understand [is explained as] a change in the demand function Or it could be an intent to look through the recession Indeed, all three of these indicators might be a reference to the public's attitudes--an attempt to look through what they perceive to be a modest recession and to build on the future If that's the case, we might not have much recession  So, I'm pretty much forced back to the aggregates as the only decent guide we have And as long as they're rather strong, I'm not terribly uncomfortable about our contribution, plus or minus, to what's happening to the system They're a little too strong, I think, because they are running up through their ranges pretty fast And as Bob Black and I guess Mark Willes pointed out, they could very well get to the top of the range or go above it in another couple of months if we happen to have strong numbers I know all the problems with the aggregates, but I don't think they're as bad as most of you do And I think we ought to be guided by the aggregates, recognize that they are high in the range and take a little defensive action on account of that I also think the market so anticipates some little firming as a result of today's meeting that not to do it would have its own impact on psychology and attitudes So I would be prepared to see a little tightening partly because I'm not sure what these strengths in financial markets mean and partly because we're running high on the aggregate ranges and we have just again reported to the Congress on them and our intention to stay within them  For the funds rate I would suggest maybe a range of 10-3/4 to 11-1/4 or 10-1/2 to 11-1/4, with a midpoint of 10-7/8 percent I think we ought to reduce the short-term aggregates ranges a little but it's a mistake to reduce them too much because we will just look silly  -32-    8/14/79  since we don't have any effect on them--to speak of--with our policies in the next month or two I'd maybe take a point off the aggregates of alternative B, both the lower and upper ends and go with a money market directive That is what I would propose today  Well, that does; but the other range gives you 11 percent  -38-    8/14/79  I never heard anything that sounds more like a money market directive  I'd prefer that, too, because I think it would look awfully bad to have a biased directive in what may be a developing recession of size So if we have that very tight constraint on the funds rate, we won't move it obviously without consultation I might point out that we can move it up if in fact Mark's fears are [realized] and September turn outs to have a double- digit growth rate We can always have a telephone conference  They did before, too  So, you're asking Is this acceptable?  I would like not to charge because we do in fact get the return on the securities This is a--  SPEAKER(?) But don't we want to urge them not to do this? "
1149,1979-09-18," To say a word in favor of devaluation, it  strikes me, Scott, that we're not the only ones by far having trouble  maintaining our currency against the mark I notice, for example,  that last week the Swiss were buying their own currency in quantity  and selling dollars in order to finance it at the same time we were  selling marks and buying dollars; the two institutions were working at  cross purposes  to keep their rate from rising either I notice, for example, that  the figures you've cited and that we've looked at don't show the  German intervention as being very substantial over this period Well,  if everybody is having difficulty maintaining [their currencies]  against the mark and if the Germans don't much care and aren't doing   And the Germans don't seem to be doing terribly much     9 / 1 8 / 7 9  -3-    anything about it why is it that we persist in throwing great amounts  of money into maintaining this pegged rate of 180 or 181 whatever it  is? That's the difficulty with going away from the idea of  intervening [only] in disorderly markets This is not a disorderly  market definition but we intervened in quantity in order to maintain  a pegged rate I do believe the term ""devaluation"" has some  significance when countries operate as if there is a fixed exchange  rate   It's been quite a while that we've been trying  to keep the rate at 180 or 181   But what do we do if the rate really does need  to be 170 instead of 180?   In terms of purchasing power parity, rates of  inflation--   That's about the area of the teamsters  [settlement], isn't it?   The businessmen always say that, Willis   M R   WINN I know, but they read it in the press   Their business is off 1 percent from the very  highest level it ever reached that's a very good rate of operation  It's the inflection, and I thought the Redbook started to point out  quite a few areas of inflection   The answer is yes   Well, on that point though, John, we were  getting an increase in velocity of 9  8  percent in the fourth quarter  and 123 percent in the first quarter That just couldn’t continue  It may have gone too far the other way it was negative in the second  and third quarters--or slightly negative Certainly something was     9/18/79 -15-   going on there in the way of a shift It was a rate that just  couldn't continue   He's adding the ATS back in   M R   BLACK That's right I think that's the way we have to  judge it At least we have to clear up that confusion ourselves  Lord help you when you have to explain this to the Congress and to the  public because I get confused every time I think about it! When we  get down to the specifics, I would like to propose that we take some  actions to try to get close to these targets, although I don't think  we can achieve them [fully] because of past misses   Well, it‘s very short-term money   I think Nancy’s point is that most borrowers pay  something more [than prime] and a 20 percent compensating balance   Well, I've been gone for a couple of a weeks and  I feel a little out of it A significant recession is not a certainty  but it's a high probability One could read this as an automobile-led  correction and a shift in real income from consumers to producers and  distributors of oil, both of which have had a marked effect on retail  demand But I guess I'd go along with Frank that the indicators all  point to mounting tendencies toward weakness in the economy And it  seems unlikely that we'll get a smooth and easy inventory correction  as the staff is projecting S o  if in fact these pressures continue to  mount, we'll probably have a deeper recession than is forecast by the  staff   I've been concerned over the last 4 to 6 weeks, as Nancy has,  about the possibility of overshooting I think it's important, very  important, that we try to keep the aggregates within the ranges that  we specify And I think it was very appropriate that we moved  interest rates up significantly over the summer because of the bulge  in the aggregates in the spring and summer, which was to a  considerable degree unexpected But we have to remember that those  changes in rates affect money growth with a lag We've had the  increase in rates and we have another lagged response yet [to come]  We also have to remember, as Nancy said, that if we look at M1 there  has been a significant slowing in demand deposit growth It was [at  anannual rate of] 17 percent in June, 10 percent in July, and is  forecast at 3-1/2 percent in August That has been masked by an  explosion in currency We don't really know [why that has occurred]  It seems most likely to be some kind of aberration; we don't really  think it will be sustained Feeling that we have moved rates quite a  bit in the last month or two and that the aggregates are in a lagged  way likely to be reflecting that, I also agree with Nancy I think  the best thing to do, as the Committee often has done over the last  decade or so, is to pause for a while and see what develops   It‘s the Susan B Anthony dollar   It's a good leading indicator, John!   You shouldn‘t cut a point and a half off the top  of M2 for that M1 change M1 is about half the [M21 total   No it is not consistent   Yes, that might be pretty close   If I had my preference, I would put 9 percent as  the top because I think we will have a large [number in] September  [Ml growth1 will be probably on the order of 10 percent; it could be  12 or it could be 8 or something like that Why, when October [Ml  growth] is moving down, would we raise the funds rate? There's an  inconsistency about the whole thing Also, I might point out that a 9  percent increase in money with the rate of inflation that we have and  cannot stop--it will be there in fuel and in food prices over this  period--is not a terribly high increase in the money supply   It’s not zero, but it‘s very low   Not much   I’m concerned about that M2 number because I do  believe we’re getting considerable shifts [of funds1 from the S&Ls to     9/18/79 -44-    the commercial banks But that, of course, would tend to result in a  higher number rather than a lower one It wouldn’t go the other way  unless market rates were quite a bit lower, which isn’t in prospect   A very well argued brief there!  "
1184,1979-10-06," Of course, the real estate situation is entirely  different, with 18 million housing starts That compares with what  we had, say, in the summer of '74 when starts were down to a 11  million annual rate or thereabouts and there just wasn't any mortgage  money   That's true   Was a year ago bad, do you recall?   Wards had a very small change over a year ago   Lead went up 20 percent   I might make a general comment, Paul I  approach the situation a little differently than Phil does And I  don‘t pay as much attention to foreign and international aspects as     10/6/79 -13   you do The thought I would like to emphasize or underline is  uncertainty I think the staff forecast--which I believe is not that  much different from the forecast of the Council [of Economic Advisers]  or from those one sees in standard private market services--is quite  plausible We certainly do have a lack of final demand right now We  certainly do have a decline in real income and we are going to  continue to have a decline in real income And today, at least in  Washington, the winter heating season is beginning The drain on  purchasing power from that is going to be much greater on a seasonally  unadjusted basis over the coming six months or so There will be less  money available for everything So it's fairly reasonable to think  that there is going to be a recession trend rather promptly, one that  develops and continues over the winter and into the spring If that's  so, why of course we are going to want to try to keep the monetary  aggregates growing And we will have a sudden shift in our problem,  which will be overly slow growth rather than overly rapid growth in  the aggregates That's one scenario   On the other hand, I was extremely bothered by the market  developments of the last two weeks I think the spreading of the gold  [market psychology] into the more remote metals is very bothersome  Silver we understand and platinum we understand, but the spreading to  copper, zinc, and lead is very bothersome And not only grains but a  number of other futures prices were moving [up], with no real  justification for those moves It leaves one with the thought that  because of a run from currency--a desire to get into goods and out of  money--we might have now a new development in our economic experience  that would lead to a ""last gasp"" round of demand for goods, probably  most intensively for inventory That might last 2 or 3 months or it  might last 4 or 5 months It's very limited but it could last for a  while And then when the recession occurs, it will be much deeper  because in addition to having to adjust to the lower level of final  demand, people will have to liquidate inventory They will move from  inventory accumulation to decumulation and we will have a recession  that is more like 1975 or perhaps worse than that If that's the  case, for the next few months or during the period in which there's  this anxiety and concern about possibly moving from money into goods,  it is very important to restrain the growth in the aggregates, and we  could be talking about significantly higher interest rates   With that uncertainty, it seems to me that our traditional  method, which is to estimate the short-term market rates that will  adjust the demand functions for various kinds of money on a lag  structure, has [inherent in] it the danger that we are going to miss  [Either] we will miss an intensification in the demand for money and  be behind the gun, as we have tended to be here over the last six  months, or we will miss a decline in the demand for money and overstay  and be behind the gun, as we traditionally have done [going] into  recessions It's an extremely dangerous, risky proposition to change  our operating mode We have tried it a couple of times We had RPDs  back in the early '70s and we had that experiment a few years ago  For one reason or another--and we know the reasons--they didn't work  But even though it is extremely risky, I think it's the less risky  course than to stay with our traditional system So my emphasis is on  uncertainty and the need to be aware of the fact that we no longer can  specify interest rates given this uncertainty, rather than our need to  tighten up or anything like that at this time     10/6/79 -14   Unless they think it’s more of a commitment   M R   MORRIS That means that we also have to have some  traditional measures to go along with it that they will understand   The stock market is open, but that’s it   We’d run it for several months in any event   CWlIRMAN VOLCKER Oh yes I think we are committed for  several months   Which is what direction--up or down?   Those are the objectives   They will, of course, be able to make a  calculation if we say we’re determined to be within the targets for  the year They will see how much more room there is for the remainder  of the year for growth in the aggregates that we have been using as  [our target] variables   We might have to underline that   Well, the 46 percent [growth in M1 for  September to December] is not at the very top That gives us 53  percent for the year and the top of the M1 range is 6 percent   Well, the M2 is a little [above] and M3 is  below There has been a shift from the thrift institutions into the  banks and that accounts for some of that     l0/6/79 -35-   We already have to have a November-December  averaging below October   I must say that I agree with Nancy If this is  the nature of the detail, then I can‘t agree to it   Well, if you want to go around the table, I  would view the figures in the right-hand column [at the bottom of page  31 as quite appropriate objectives I would be prepared to bias the  initial funds rate range Oh I forgot, you don‘t want [us to address]  the funds rate yet   I would leave the money supply [range unchanged]  and bias it with the funds rate range in the initial go-around Then  we can review the funds rate range depending on progress I would  point out that with that projection for the first month [of the  quarter] being above the 46 percent--and September deposits have  determined reserves for the first 2 weeks of October--we already have  a bias in the money supply €or the initial two weeks of operation   Yes, sure we do   I don’t think we are going to affect it much   That’s going to be the operational period   But [the choice] has tremendous interest rate  implications   MS TEETERS Yes   That’s 13 percent   Was his suggestion $1 billion?   My only concern is whether that [range] is too  constraining on the funds rate     1 0 1 6 1 7 9  -44-    I can see a real possibility that it will hit  14-1/2 percent and if we seem to lock on it, it will then establish  that as the rate   The borrowing is a starting point, I think   Since you’ve already got the [request on the  discount] rate   The foreign exchange markets are open   M F t   MORRIS We can’t wait   A little on the low side   Well, some preference   M R   MAYO Your feeling is semi-strong, Nancy   I don't know how much difference it will really  come down to I think we have a better intellectual agreement   I just wanted to point out that this last  paragraph I think has a little range implied for Ml--and for the other  aggregates--and the range is centered around 4-1/2   But this is the exact statement of what Paul  suggested It seems to me that at the press conference what he'd be  saying is that we are determined to hold these aggregates within the  targets previously announced My point simply is that if we happen  to come out at 5 percent for September-December we wouldn't be outside     10/6/79 -54-   the target range I think 4-1/2 percent does imply a [bit of a]  range Now for safety, we'd rather be on the lower side of 4-1/2  percent   Again, it seems to me that you can trade that M2  off against M3   Yes We're going to have an awfully hard time--   Except for the press conference   Toward the top  "
1204,1979-10-22," I think it’s important that we try to observe  our nonborrowed target, and for that reason I think we should use the  full funds rate range I think the rate this week is unlikely to  average above 15-1/2 percent since, after all, four days of the week  are below that level That won‘t necessarily put the money supply on  Lrack, of course, because the safety valve is borrowings and I should  think borrowings would move up My goodness, with a difference of  this magnitude between [the cost of] borrowing in the market and  borrowing at the window, I would certainly think that borrowing at the  window will go up So we will have to face that issue and, if [the  recent trend] continues, the issue of further expansion in reserves  and further expansion in the money numbers after we get them But  let’s not give up the nonborrowed target we had   It ought to show up in borrowings   What do we do if next week's money supply figure  is strong?  "
1227,1979-11-20," You do business with 35?   With everyone on the list you have some  activity?   You said after the first part of the year it's  about 10 percent So you have a 20 percent [increase] and then a  drifting up from that point   M R   TRUMAN AS far as the OPEC contract prices, we have a  20 percent increase on the first of January and then 10 percent across  the year When you translate that into our import prices, that  translates into a 23 percent increase fourth quarter over fourth  quarter That's because the spot market activity will be [reflecting]     1 1 / 2 0 / 7 9  -7-   some of the OPEC price increase--in effect, the official contract  prices--in this quarter as it did last quarter   Is your fourth quarter of 1979 price higher  than you had before, too?   M R   TRUMAN Yes, by about 10 percent Another way of  characterizing it, although I decided not to put it into this little  story, is that a couple months ago we essentially had assumed that the  real price of oil was going to be unchanged in 1980 Now we are  assuming, in effect, that the real price of oil will increase by 20  percent So, for the fourth quarter of 1980 the price is now 20  percent higher than we had assumed I’m not sure if that helps   M R   PARTEE That certainly wipes out any monetary policy  effect   Right, that’s what he said   M R   WALLICH On the other hand, not to seek to achieve a  monetary policy effect would just mean that that effect would be all  the bigger   M R   PARTEE It‘s a large increase   M R   TRUMAN Shall I continue?   You’ve taken into account the higher oil price  increase in doing that?   M R   TRUMAN We tried to, let’s put it that way The  forecasts are all supposed to be consistent   With respect to Governor Coldwell‘s question,  in your additive process you haven’t really included any dynamics in  the business effects That is, there must be a point at which another  3/4 percentage point decline in real consumption would have a material  impact on inventories and capital spending that would run through the  economy in an accelerated way   And then of course you still have output  [data] You still have manhours, too, and you can look at the  manhour s    M R   KICHLINE That’s right And we have physical product  data with a lag that accounts ultimately for about half the series   And it could go the other way, too, couldn't  it?   You mean rational expectations are an empty  box?   May I ask just one question? Steve, did I  understand you to say that you were assuming $2 billion as the initial  borrowing on alternative C?   M R   AXILROD Alternative C   And $1-1/2 billion on alternative B?   And what on ""A?""   All right, that's an important variable that I  think we ought to--   Yes, of course That's one of the things I  think we ought to vote on   You don't show rates for January   It's a lot higher than that, I think   M R   AXILROD From September to January, the growth rate  under ""B"" is 48 percent   How much correction does ""C"" make on that?  What is the growth rate under ""C"" from December to January?   Certainly in January we will, [ahead of] when  we go up to Congress   You have a particular problem, [Tom]   Well, we are plotting a path [for the provision  of reserves], and there never will seem to be much difference in the  short run in the paths that we plot because they only work out over  the long run But I think there is a difference between alternatives  A, B, and C There’s a different implication for the shape of  monetary growth in the first quarter that transcends the very precise  [short-run] period we are talking about In a coming recession,  whatever its shape or size--and it may be quite different than we are  expecting right now--1 think it is important that we continue to say  that it is our job and our intention to provide for a reasonable  amount of money and credit growth That’s really about all we can do  [And we need to do so] as safely [as possible] with inflation on the  one side and unemployment, which I would point out to you is projected  by the staff to be as high as 84 percent for next year, on the other  side About all we can do is to have that kind of ambition I would,  of course, as we have sacrificed the mortgage market, sacrifice the  foreign exchange market at the right point in the battle to maintain  moderate growth of money and credit over the period to come   Now literally it seems to me that we would stay with  alternative B here because we have had some shortfalls in monetary  growth rates in October and some are projected--perhaps [they will  occur], perhaps not--for November Remember, all we are doing is  talking about the path of our provision [of reserves], not what will  actually develop in monetary growth But I dislike that a little  because it seems to me that it implies providing too many reserves in  December I think we have to have a strategy for making up shortfalls  and overshoots, and we haven’t really quite developed one yet  Although we have had a shortfall, I don’t like the idea of running too  strongly in December for fear that it will extend over into the early  part of next year So my view is that we ought to try to make up a  little, but not the full amount, of the shortfall I think that puts  me between alternative B and alternative C The path I would propose  for the Desk and Steve to work on is 5 percent for the 2-month period  in M1 and 8-1/2 percent in M2; and I don’t think M3 has any great  significance in path setting in that time frame To be fair, it also  requires the setting of an initial borrowing level and my view of the  matter is that we should stay with $1-112 billion I was thinking  that perhaps it ought to be a little higher, but then I was reminded  that the reason the borrowing is [currently] above $1-1/2 billion is  that we’ve had a few misses so to be absolutely even-handed we perhaps  should have the $1-1/2 billion initial assumption   On the funds rate range, I certainly wouldn’t want to narrow  it I agree with Larry Roos We have announced to the world that     11/20/79 -33 -    we’ve changed the way we do things And to appear to be constraining  [the funds rate1 again or to seem to be moving toward a constraint is  unnecessary and hardly makes worthwhile the anguish that the market  has gone through in adjusting to our announcement of the change in  policy Now, if we open it up a little, I really don’t care I think  for this particular period I would leave the range at 11-1/2 to 15-1/2  percent; we‘re just about in the middle of that right now and I  believe there probably won’t be any need to raise it on the top end in  the period to come We can open it up later by reducing the lower end  if in fact the performance of the monetary aggregates comes in below  our expectations I guess that’s it   We've got this concept of a crunch in  mortgages, which would probably be exacerbated   M R   COLDWELL HOW would you feel about an 11 percent rate?   He also said a giant step, I believe   For the two months   If I might just tag on, Phil, I think I'd also  like to extend the projection into January     11/20/79 - 3 8 -    M R   COLDWELL I would, too   That was sort of my notion of going in between  8uBu and muC#G and then saying we'd continue that for January until we  have a meeting and can review it again   Well, all right I think maybe you want to say  that it's 5-1/2 to 4-l/2 percent, you know That's one way of doing  it But it is a path that we're setting here, or telling the staff to  set, regardless of where the money supply actually comes out This is  the rate at which reserves would be provided, as I understand it Am  I right about that?   What did we specify for M2 back in October?   It was 7-1/2 and we now have 8-3/4 percent?   How does the $17 billion compare? How would  you interpret that 17, Steve? Would you interpret that as a neutral  initial borrowing assumption or is it a little restrictive, or what?   You sort of weight it in relation to the  average reserves, as I would see it That is, the components of M2  have less reserve requirements so they don't get equal weight any  more   Why don't you take a couple of tests on  expressions of preferences I think it would be very desirable, if we  could, to have a large number of people voting for whatever [the  decision] is   For path purposes   M R   MAYO But Steve's point could be accomplished, couldn't  it, by weighting the average of ""B"" and ""C"" on M2 toward ""C?"" Just  have it 8-1/2 percent, say   No, it would be less than that, I think It  would be an impossible construction   Do you want a ""can live with"" indication?   Do we just write it up as November, December,  and January and then it would be 5 or 4-112--   Yes, we can always have a meeting   Not the 4th; I won’t be here   M R   WILLES Could we not precede [the FOMC meeting] with  our Conference of Presidents   I think that’s true Why don’t you turn it  around?     11/20/79 -48-   "
1254,1980-01-08," Well, just a comment I think I understood the direction of your adjustments, Steve, as you went through this But I certainly don't understand it from this table on the second page I can't make out the magnitude of the adjustments The arithmetic just doesn't work very well, at least as I was trying to follow what you said, although I understand the direction of change The other question I have is on the very last comment you made, which was that even after these adjustments you fell short of the desired adjusted reserve path because you just couldn't supply the nonborrowed reserves Would you explain why it is that you couldn't get in the nonborrowed reserves?  Well, one of the things that is disturbing me-- about the whole period really but particularly the last month or so-- is that we don't seem to be getting any market impact We have to have feed-through if this process is going to work And yet, regardless of the shortfall in reserves and the shortfall in money and the fact that borrowings were coming down, we held the funds rate at about 14 percent all the way through It looks as if somebody else is determining the funds rate My question is Under those circumstances, since we weren't anywhere close to the bottom level of the funds rate range that was specified, why didn't you put in more nonborrowed reserves in order to try to get this process of adjustment in the market going more strongly than it did?  There may be a fair [amount of] instability in that demand You may remember a month ago, or seven weeks ago or whenever [the meeting] was, we thought there had been an increase in the demand for borrowings compared with earlier in the experience when there wasn't  I know it's awfully early, but what bothers me about this whole experiment so far, Paul, is that I don't get any sense of dynamics working That is, we had a very nice outcome taking the quarter as a whole I think everybody around the table would agree that the money number calmed down and the markets have been better and all that But that all could have been an adjustment to the one-time change in conditions that occurred early in October, with much higher rates and the availability constraint and that kind of thing Since then I haven't had much sense of dynamics in the process that would lead to, say, restoration of a higher growth rate in money if it were lower than what we wanted And it has tended to be lower than we wanted Perhaps it's just too early, but I don't see it That's what bothers me  I think that's probably right  Well, we still haven't found out whether there are any dynamics here that will work or not  You didn't comment on the excess reserves, but I don't suppose that can go all that far  They got an extra billion dollars?  -10-    1/8-9/80  You'd want to substitute $500 million in deposits for the $500 million shortfall in currency  We haven't [moved the funds rate], anyway  Shifting back from a very successful experiment certainly would be hard to explain  It surely would  Well, we could have limits similar to what we do on foreign currency [operations]  The only trouble is that I don't have any sense at this point of what those limits ought to be; and I think it would take a staff paper to indicate what might be the tendencies  What's a reasonable ""x""?  -15-    1/8-9/80  I don't mean to disagree with you, Phil; I think it's something that has to be looked into I would disagree with you, Ernie, in that I think we are concerned about nonborrowed as well as total because we have preconditions [bearing on how the operations affect] the circumstances for the next meeting But that all has to be worked out  But of course in '75 [rates] fell below the fixed rate ceilings So even the passbook rate was affected That obviously is not in the projection; it couldn't be  -21-    1/8-9/80  I think it's more M-1A and M-1B that we're comparing, Bob The bigger the growth of NOW account-type deposits, some of which will be drained from M-1A and some from M2--maybe something like 50-50--the bigger the divergence between M-1A and M-1B, so we thought we needed both The one, M-1A, will be running too low  -22-    1/8-9/80  to reflect reality; and the other, M-1B, will be running too high to reflect reality until this stock adjustment process is over  Old M1 with M2?  You won't have M-1B as quickly for Desk operations, will you, Darwin? M-1B will not become available as speedily as M-1A  Yes  It's much colder! [Laughter]  Yes  Besides, Paul, it's additive M-1A plus the components make M-1B, which then goes into M2 So it's logical just to extend it along the columns  Yes, and we'd drop the M-1B components But we're certainly going to get share [drafts], which are developing  Well, the Board has to [indicate] what projection is consistent with the numbers it chooses [for the aggregates]; and that is the scenario  -39-    1/8-9/80  And that could be wrong  First, I would use the 3-point ranges that we have had As a matter of fact, if I could, I might choose a 4-point range as Phil [suggested] [But] given the fact that we have had ranges of 3 points, I just don't see us broadening them out I would remind you that we fully used the ranges this past year In fact, we more than used it in the case of Ml Now, maybe our new procedures will make the variations a little less, but I would guess that we may use pretty much of the ranges this year In addition, I think it would be desirable to borrow a little from tomorrow to have [money growth] on the low side in the first part of the year and on the high side in the second part; therefore, we might want [wider] ranges just for that purpose So, I would have 3-point ranges  Secondly, I would not make any 2- or 3-year statement regarding specific reductions in our monetary growth rates because it's unrealistic For example, take this econometric projection We would be saying that after unemployment got to 81 percent we would reduce the monetary growth rate again and then presumably after it got to 105 percent we would reduce it again I just don't think that's [realistic]; we're not going to do that Indeed, I don't think we are going to reduce the monetary growth rate a great deal until some of the things that are adding to inflation tend to fall off For that reason, it's important that we be pretty conservative with 1980 because I doubt that we will be able to reduce the ranges much beyond the 1980 ranges that we set In fact, I don't think 1980 will be much of a problem in terms of [growth] being within the ranges because there will be enough of a recession that we're probably just saying how low we want interest rates to go when we set the ranges for the year So, I would say that we ought to center the range on 5 percent for M1, which would be an improvement over what we experienced [last] year, and that would mean about 3-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent, [with] a little more on M-1B and the other ranges in accordance with that And then [we should] hold to it I might remind you that not only do we face the possibility of recession, but we may be in a semi-war [status] and it will be important, I think, to have a range that is quite explicitly stated to which we can hold  Yes, that's right And, as I said, I'd drift a little low in [the range] in the beginning with the view that growth will be rising within it later on  Next month he will  Your projection of the average earnings increase is up into that guideline, isn't it?  That's not his projection  -50-    1/8-9/80  On the level of the index or--?  For a year So it raises the level of price increases by 2-1/2 percent?  Well, I think the emphasis on the consumer is certainly appropriate here I would point out, Phil, that in nominal  -53-    1/8-9/80  terms goods expenditures rise every quarter, which I think makes the point that consumers are being pressed not only by taxes but also by inflation, particularly the inflation in oil prices which doesn't really have a personal income counterpart in it The saving rate behavior is extraordinarily interesting I calculate that in '78 and the first half of '79 the personal saving rate averaged a bit above 5 percent, fluctuating up and down but never getting much below 5 percent and being above it in some quarters That was a period of rapid increases in installment debt, which reduces the saving rate of course from what it would otherwise be since it's a reduction from gross savings Then in the third quarter of '79 it dropped to 43 percent with a lesser rise in installment debt; and in the fourth quarter it apparently dropped below 4 percent to maybe 3-1/2 percent or something like that with a still further decline in the rise in installment debt So the question is In terms of components, what is moving that saving rate so strongly downward? I suppose one could argue that if people are moving from cash to goods, the financial saving is falling off That would be one indicator If, on the other hand, there is a generalized sort of squeeze so that people don't have enough income to cover [their expenditures] and there's an attrition in saving that results, that's a different kind of story If it's the first case, we could have a continued high level of consumption But that doesn't seem to me consistent with the reduction in installment credit If it's the second case, we would have a very substantial decline in real consumption You probably don't have much information on the components of the saving change, but do you have a view on what is happening there?  There couldn't have been much of an increase in car sales in that period; they probably declined Were other durables strong?  That's based on what--6 percent Ml growth?  Is that M-1A or M-1B?  2 percent for what?  Okay  Although there was a decline in the saving rate in the second half of the year, do you mean they suddenly recognized their wealth?  There's no impact on real activity through government policy?  Then you are saying that we can't affect aggregate activity through government policies  This is very, very [specific]  The Committee on the Directive tried valiantly to get that put in a year ago without success So we're happy  December  You don't have to recant in the presence of--  I'm pretty sympathetic with Dave Eastburn's comments I think fine-tuning is difficult in practice, and I would point out that the main misses that we've had have been large misses That is, it really isn't that we expect 5 percent and get 4 percent We expect 5 percent in a month and get zero or a minus; or we expect 5 percent and get 10 That has been the nature of the chunkiness of that demand function for money, and I think that demand function is there just as it always was The question now is What kind of response will a sudden change in the growth rate of money bring in terms of policy? I guess I would say that under our new procedures it would bring a very abrupt and considerable change in interest rates,  -66-    1/8-9/80  either up or down So, without fine-tuning I rather like the 5 percent on the old definition I guess we're talking about current definitions, aren't we?  We would specify it in current terms I like the 5 percent of alternative B, partly because that would give us 4-1/2 percent for the quarter which, if we get it, will be on the moderate side from the standpoint of the ranges that we choose for the year I would be willing to tolerate a little shortfall from that 5 percent, say, to 4 percent But if it comes in significantly weaker than that, I think we would want to be supplying the reserves and we would want to be seeing interest rates move There is something to what Larry says, although he perhaps overstated it a little, that we have to be prepared to see interest rates move in response to a need I would like to see us take the alternative A specifications of 7-1/2 and 8 percent for M2 and M3 rather than those in alternative B We don't really know what success that new [floating rate] certificate is going to have It's being advertised very strongly by the thrift institutions and I wouldn't want to see us tighten up because it happened that the thrift institutions had a good inflow from the promotion of the 2-1/2 year certificate [On the funds rate,] I think we're a long way from either 11-1/2 or 15-1/2 percent and I don't see how we could get to 11-1/2 percent without taking action on the discount rate So I would leave that range right where it is at 11-1/2 to 15-1/2 percent  With able help  We will [indicate our preference] in the Policy Record, certainly  Well, the second part of it could affect the character of the recovery  One cosmetic thing Would it be better to say ""about"" 4 to 5 instead of ""between"" 4 and 5? It sounds very specific, as if we expect it to come between the numbers I realize that's what we mean, but we won't accomplish it So maybe if we said ""about"" 4 to 5 percent--  And ""on the order of"" is what you have for the second part  I do think that the level of borrowings is somewhat of an index of possible need That is, if we got a high and rising level of borrowings, that would mean we're exceeding the monetary targets and there would be more indication for a rise in rates than if we got a low and declining level of borrowing; in the latter case [reserves] probably would be falling below target and that would be consistent with the reduction so--  Yes, I don't think it really will seem all that inconsistent over time  -80-    1/8-9/80  Because even with nonlagged you still have this tremendous multiplier Yes, I agree  Reduce the money supply and get lower interest rates!  Well, I am on the opposite side Somebody needs to speak It looks as if the chances are that we will have something like 5 percent [Ml] growth I don't think we ought to be deliberately following a mechanism that pushes rates up in this quarter, which is  -82-    1/8-9/80  probably a declining quarter in the economy I'm prepared to have 4 to 5 percent to accommodate other members, but I certainly wouldn't want to center [the range] on 4 percent, which I think does bias it in favor of a rise in interest rates  The one thing proposed for deletion is the Bank of England's attitude toward support for the institutions operating in London I would have assumed that would be public knowledge by now  I'm really asking another question, Henry There is something in a memo of yours, apparently, that is going to be deleted  My only question, Ted, was that I thought it was  He happened to be representing the Bank But if it is more explicit than even current public understandings, then there is a basis for excluding it, yes  Well, if you read the Humphrey-Hawkins Act, that's what it seems to require  It says the Board's view of the relationship to or the consistency of the Open Market's Committee decision with the outlook for the economy  I know it's going to be hard to back up on it because it was very well received by the Committees Very little attention was paid to it, though  We'll be working off the staff projection at that time and I think an indication of agreement or disagreement or points of agreement or disagreement might be helpful "
1282,1980-02-04," We haven't done that yet  Well, I speak somewhat tentatively on this subject which I have observed raging around here for many years It is somewhat religious in character By the way, St Louis, I think has always been on the side of the angels, Larry! They might have had a little falling off or--  I would say you were always in favor of contemporaneous accounting and I would say that Bob Black has always been against it because he saw the public relations cost or the bank relations cost The latter was a major factor involved, I thought, in the Board's accepting the lagged way in the first place I am impressed by Henry's argument I do think the speed of adjustment is something that is going to plague us because I personally believe that sooner or later, but perhaps not right now, Willis, we're either going to get a big surge or we're going to get a big collapse in the aggregates and then we are not going to be able to do anything about  -12-    2/4-5/80  it because of the lags with which the demand schedule can be affected And two weeks is a meaningful amount of time in shortening that process, if indeed it does shorten the process I don't know that it necessarily would because, after all, the Desk knows that the money supply has surged or has fallen out of bed before the reserves have to be put up to support the higher amount or the lower amount; and presumably if they don't follow a strictly mechanical formula, they can begin to make adjustments for it early on in their strategy So even that can be overcome  My biggest problem is that I would lean toward contemporaneous accounting except that I think the structure is much too complicated to use it Reported deposits are extremely complicated; there is quite a variety of deposits with different kinds of reserves against them And it seems to me all of that is much more difficult [to manage] on a contemporaneous basis; it would not be a disadvantage otherwise if we had a very simple structure Now, it also happens that the membership bills all propose a very much simpler structure of reserves than we now have And it seems to me that if [the structure were simpler], that would also tend in some sense, Bob, to do away with the bank relations problem because it is no longer an optional matter as to whether to follow the specified procedures It seems to me that a very much simpler structure and the change in the whole reserve apparatus that would be associated with a new bill, which probably wouldn't take effect for six months or something like that, might be a time for introducing a change But I would tie it to those kinds of developments; I wouldn't do it now  By the way, I do believe the point made by Frank and others has some value With our current way of processing the daily report of deposits and the programming that exists we probably don't have the capacity to make the change without risking a collapse of the structure That has begun to bother me So, I wouldn't do anything now; but the introduction of a new simplified system on different terms and conditions might be an occasion for going to it  Paul, if we are going to be doing additional studies on this, I have always been very taken by the notion of doing away with Saturday and Sunday, which is another gimmick  Yes, excuse me, for Federal Reserve purposes only, because of all the inefficiency of flows back and forth  They give them to us?  For dollars? How do they get an advantage out of that?  The drawing has been outstanding for six months, Scott?  We do have the revised seasonal, Paul That's an annual event to revise the seasonal  -20-    2/4-5/80 -21-  Well, it happens to have done what the market expected it to do That is, it raised the seasonal factors for the winter quarters and dropped them for the summer  I think it's 1986 [for the unemployment objective] and 1988 [for the price objective]  How do you reach those confidence ratios? I don't really understand the process by which you get a 70 percent confidence interval  How many were above?  Yes, I think that's right The rate of inflation as measured by the CPI is reduced by the end of the year to 9-1/4 percent The Administration has more than that, doesn't it?  -24-    2/4-5/80  You want the CPI in our [forecasts] rather than the implicit deflator?  It does happen to be the same  It would have to be higher  It depends on the speed of the projector  Even though you have positive output growth, you would agree with that unemployment number?  Well, I have been concerned about defense spending as a question mark in the outlook I must say that the chart the staff has provided us, showing an alternative with $10 billion more defense spending this year and $20 billion more in 1981 and in 1982 on top of the 6 percent real growth that's already in there for nonpersonnel costs, strikes me as a good liberal estimate of the extra defense spending that might occur or that is possible in the short run And I would point out to you that it doesn't change the numbers all that much I believe they did this with the model, so it includes orders effects and that kind of thing--that is, effects that occur before the actual defense spending So, both that and the fact that it seems to me to look a little less [tenuous] than it was a month ago make me feel that it isn't such a big possible plus in the economy in the immediate future as it might have been Also, the saving rate is just very difficult [to forecast] New York has a continuation of a very low saving rate throughout 1980 and one could argue that there has been a permanent shift in the saving rate I don't think so I think it's going to come back up I agree with the staff on that There is no evidence of a permanent move from money to goods of the kind that would be indicated by that So, I come down to an expectation that real GNP will fall some this year, though probably less than the staff has [in its forecast]--maybe 1 to 2 percent The employment rate I am quite sure will rise significantly because I just don't think it is possible that services and trade will continue to add to the employment rolls without output, without a commensurate value added, much longer So a 7-1/2 percent fourth-quarter unemployment rate is probably a reasonable forecast I'd have inflation a little higher than the staff has--at 9 to 10 percent, say, for the deflator and 10 to 12 percent for the CPI in the year ahead As for fiscal policy, I think there will be a tax cut but probably not until next year That's not as early as the alternative staff projection has it, which is the middle of this year It probably will occur in early 1981, sometime in the spring, and it will improve 1981 results a little from what the staff has projected But I would point out to you that I think an absolutely binding assumption on the recovery of the economy is the monetary assumption which, of course, we have the ability to control Did I get everything on this [list]?  No, I think we ought to wait I think it will be necessitated by a high and rising unemployment rate, and I figure that will be obvious to everybody by early next year So it's a next year venture rather than this year When it occurs I agree with the comments that have been made that we ought to do what we can to make it stimulative for business investment if we have any effect But I do have to tell you that I think the full push will be to make it a consumer tax cut when it occurs  You have an improvement, John?  But you have to have a normal growth that will keep the unemployment rate at 6 percent I don't know what Mike used, but I am sure he has a figure  2-1/2  -34-    2/4-5/80  Probably in 1981  Well, Mr Chairman, last time I indicated some preliminary specifications that would have been consistent with alternative II I want to argue this morning for alternative I That's a difficult thing to do and I have always found myself unsuccessful in such arguments in the past But let me try it once more The staff projection for nominal GNP, fourth quarter-to-fourth quarter, is for a 7 percent increase The direction of thinking as we went around the table was to convert that to a somewhat higher nominal GNP increase because almost everyone thought inflation would be a bit higher than the staff has projected, and quite a few people thought that the decline might be a bit shallower than the staff has projected So I would say that the Committee view, as opposed to the staff view, is that nominal GNP will increase at least 8 percent And I believe the Administration, Jim, has a 9 percent increase in nominal GNP fourth quarter-to-fourth quarter In drawing these long-term ranges, the relationship between money growth and the nominal GNP is of central importance because it really indicates the amount of tension there's likely to be in markets as the year goes on And even 7 percent [for nominal GNP growth] with a 5 percent midpoint on M-1A and 5-1/2 percent on M-1B, which is alternative II, does imply an increase in velocity of a couple of points If, in fact, we think nominal GNP [growth] is going to be a little higher than that--let's say 8 percent instead of 7 percent--it seems to me that as a matter of  -47-    2/4-5/80  practicality and credibility in achieving the targets we set, we ought to recognize that a bit in the specifications we pick Going from alternative II, which had been my former choice, to alternative I adds 1/2 point to the midpoint It makes the midpoint for M-1A 5-1/2 percent and that for M-1B 6 percent, compared with, say, an 8 percent nominal GNP, and I think it does suggest a very considerable tension on markets throughout the year And it's [a target] that we might be able to achieve  I would point out one more thing Every private forecast that I have looked at, and I just reviewed them yesterday, suggests a federal funds rate at the end of this year of 10 percent or below The only exception might be Salomon Brothers, but they don't specify the funds rate in their projection We are suggesting something around 13 percent The difference, I think, is in the implied increase in money in the private projections, which is stronger than we have Now, if we go through a recession and hold the interest rate up throughout the recession--hold it pretty close to where it is now-- start a recovery, say, a year hence or thereabouts with a rising trend of rates and high unemployment, we will have done really quite a lot to restrain the economy [through] monetary policy compared with any past cycle that I can recall And I think that also argues for being just a bit more liberal so that we'll have something we can achieve I understand fully what Bob says about narrowing the ranges, and I do agree that there is quite a difference between, say, 4 percent and 7 percent in M-1A, [which are the limits] in alternative I But in the interest of again being able to achieve growth this year within the ranges we specify, which we managed to do for the first time in our history in 1979, I think we need to hold the width of 3 points that we have had but try to [achieve] the midpoint of the range So, I would come out with alternative I for the reasons that I have explained, and I would stay with the 3-point range  There's no drift on M2  Oh, I don't disagree with that It's a question of whether one thinks this [degree] of weakness in the economy is reasonable  With a 300 to 400 basis point increase in interest rates  It sounds complicated, but it's just two columns  The Bank of England?  Remember, you have money--  I might just point out that M2 [growth in 1979] was very close to the upper limit on alternative II, John, and for M3 [actual growth] was the same as the upper limit on alternative II The aggregate that is really low is bank credit I don't quite understand that  What about bank credit? Is that alternative III?  It is, of course, one of the figures  John wants the top of the range below last year's [actual]  Well, I can't really offer a compromise since I was for alternative I  Maybe somehow it will work out  That results in odd midpoints  We have a tremendous amount riding on our ability to be within these ranges--  SEVERAL Yes  --and to cut the range to 2-1/2 points makes it rough And the possibility of inconsistencies here, even though we are within the staff's ranges--  We would bill the 3-1/2 percent [as appropriate] on the grounds of the great uncertainty in the year ahead  What I foresee is the possibility of misses if the relationships aren't right here We may be within on M1 and out on M2 and M3  That's probably right  Of course, he won't be here to--  Well, I don't either, but it takes me a whole point [lower]  [It can] hardly be bigger than it was last year We already had a great big demand shift in the recorded figures for last year For M-1B, which I think a lot of people would support as the better redefined money, our midpoint will be 3 points below what we realized last year Three points!  I'd go for that  I'd be happy  If we go right to the top  SPEAKER(?) We also have to recognize that they're rather uncontrollable by us with money market funds and Eurodollars and Caribbean dollars and RPs in there  Well, they could  The narrower M1 range  If we expect to get it, we're going to have to raise marginal reserves  I think what we'd shade is the second quarter After all, the first quarter--  16?  Yes, I think we ought to stay where we were until we go off in a big way, which we'll do soon  It seems to me that we might very well get a bulge in money as we get into the spring, for one thing because of those [tax] refunds Isn't that the time to do the tightening if there's going to be a tightening--when we have a demonstrated increase in the money supply?  As newly defined  -78-    2/4-5/80  The only reason we don't have a considerable shortfall is because of that seasonal adjustment Otherwise, we are hanging with a policy that gives us a shortfall  I think we're better off stating them all as ""abouts""--""about 5"" and I guess ""about 6-1/2""  Because that's the way the Manager [operates]  But that still seems to me an instruction to the Manager  The last paragraph still has [unintelligible] but in the second [to last] paragraph the instruction is to run his reserve [operations] so as to be consistent with growth of about 4-1/2 percent  He's going to miss--maybe or probably  Initial borrowing is at $12 billion or about $1-1/4 billion? "
1302,1980-03-07," Well, I agree with Larry and Tom I think we ought to raise the upper limit  to 18 I wouldn't want to raise the lower limit because it seems to me that we're determined to have a  policy here that will produce the aggregates we've said we would produce Right now this seems to  call for much higher rates It has called for higher rates and could call for still somewhat higher rates  in the period to come and we ought to have room to move if that's necessary Looking a little further  ahead, as the financial panic leads to deep recession I think we'll need considerably lower rates and we  ought to keep open the room for doing that in order to get the aggregates that we've said we were  going to get  There is a little problem with M2 and M3 because I never thought we had  much control over them and I think that's now beginning to be apparent But I would hope that the  other things that were discussed before might help a little in limiting the growth of M2 and M3 so that  looking over a somewhat longer period those, too, will come down more within the ranges But I  think our main emphasis needs to be on our posture vis-a-vis the monetary aggregates And the Desk  ought to have the room to move in working toward that goal "
1323,1980-03-18," Second You saved him, Fred!  And no Managers  I take it?   Was the Treasury a party to the original agreement, Scott? That is, did they agree that those forwards ought to be sold?  This was a transaction that was initiated by the Germans and it automatically involved us to the extent of 50 percent?  I see  Forward, yes  You do have to be prepared to change your nonborrowed path frequently, I take it, as these borrowings numbers come out in ways that are unexpected  There will be a lot more of that in the future, too, Peter  Well, that certainly is true But I think we do it by looking at total reserves, too--by seeing what's happening in total reserves relative to our path What I worry about is that there may be a number of necessitous borrowers There may be a lot of nonmember borrowers who will come in once this bill passes So we could have a surge in borrowing, which is not really a reserve balancing decision but just a portfolio balancing decision on the part of those institutions, that we would need to adjust for in our nonborrowed [path]  That's where the lag comes in We have to meet the [required] reserves  I think we get an arithmetic impossibility if total reserves are set and we change nonborrowed reserves for every dollar change that occurs in borrowings to try to go along a path we have in mind for total reserves It makes it impossible for the banking system to balance, given the fact that we have a two-week lag on deposits And they would be in violation of the law  But it's not very big  We'd have to be willing to let the interest rates go anywhere  Unsuccessful  But well within the range  Well, the April growth rate is only 8 percent in alternative C  That's true of many banks, too  We're certainly not dealing in eighths anymore  If you look at page 7 [of the Bluebook], Dave, which shows the monthly profile In alternative B, for example, April has a growth rate of 86 percent for M-1A and May has two dashes, which I assume means 0, and June has 28 percent growth Something could be taken out of April and put it into May as far as the path is concerned  My point was simply that we wouldn't necessarily have to move to alternative C; we could change the profile of alternative B  Well, I don't know what's going to happen to the economy Perhaps I am associating with people who are in difficult situations and have become very pessimistic, and it may be affecting me So, I may be more pessimistic than I ought to be I would point out that the projection seems to me very, very sensitive to the saving rate The projection shows no increase in the saving rate in the second quarter and, therefore, the second quarter continues to be not a bad quarter If in fact the saving rate should increase in the second quarter, it would be a bad quarter for the economy And that could happen On the other hand, the projection has sizable increases in the saving rate in the third and fourth quarters, and those are the quarters of major recessionary movement Whether those increases occur or don't occur will affect the character of that pattern So, we still have the uncertainty that has been with us for some time, and that is What is motivating people and how might [their behavior] be changing?  I do feel that everything that has happened in the last month has increased liquidity preference The rise in rates, which was very sharp and very noticeable, and the cutting off of credit cards to certain low income groups, even before the President's program, have been played up in a major way in the local press here in Washington The feeling that one might need to rely on one's resources more and on other people's resources less in the period ahead leads to an increase in liquidity preference, which would tend to give us rather larger money numbers, generally speaking, relative to GNP than was the case before I also think that the relationship between M1, or narrow cash balances, and the real economy is changing adversely That is, it takes more and more M1 in order to get a particular real income; or we get less and less real outcome for the same M1 we had before because of [higher] cash balances, to the extent that people are buying more with cash and not using gasoline credit cards and so forth The credit lines that have been extended, many of which may call for compensating balances, and the fact that we are forecasting more and more inflation, mean either that a given M1 is going to carry with it a higher interest rate or lower real activity, or both And I think both is probably the case  -33-    3/18/80  So it seems to me that it's just the wrong time to be departing from the notion of a rather normative, reasonable increase in the monetary aggregates I would very much resist moving to a lower aggregate path like alternative C If we get the recession, Emmett, which I believe we will, I think we'll find that the demand for money in the second half of the year will be low enough so that our problem won't be so much the upper end of our range but keeping growth within the lower end of our range  That brings me to one more point, which is that I would hate to have somebody ask me what I was doing during the crash and have to remark that I was defending our credibility The people who say let's keep those interest rates up there, regardless of what happens, are really walking into a major trap for the economy and for the Federal Reserve I very much want to disassociate myself from that I would go with alternative B I would adjust that path and slice a little off April and put it into May I think that has the same effect, if there is a bulge in April, as going with alternative C I am sympathetic to the idea that we need more room in the funds rate range because there is a very good chance of a big bulge, and the Manager ought to be able to move if there is a bulge If there is no bulge, I wouldn't expect him to move Therefore, I rather like the idea of a 14 to 20 percent range on the funds rate which, with the rate now at about 16-1/2 to 17 percent, means we have some room on both the up side and the down side  A little, but that will be easy to do because there is a much lesser demand for money in a recession  That's all this is really saying--how far one is going to let interest rates decline in the second half of the year  Well, your suggestion will certainly help assure that we'll get it because if we cut the path in the immediate period to come, I would guess we're talking about 25 percent interest rates And I think that--  That's all right; it's a very hard thing to bring about It involves more in M2 and M3  It's quite a lot on the margin  Yes, because February is behind us  Where are borrowings? Where were they last week, Steve?  With quite a lot of excess reserves out there?  It does seem to me, though, Nancy, [given that] we have raised the discount rate since the last meeting, that to accept that floor, which is slightly below the 12 percent discount rate [unintelligible] Operationally, one has to figure that banks would first pay off the borrowings before the [funds rate] went lower So, logically, there is a basis for a one point increase  It's quite probable  Make it 4-1/2 percent for the half-year then  Well, the very recent experience, yesterday, was $19 billion  Except that it was the first day after the surcharge  I don't think we're capable of deciding this  Well, less than, say, minus 1/2  No, but I don't think we want [money growth] to bomb in the next few months And I can't accept more or less than--  The funds rate would not go over 20 percent, at least not without a meeting What happened to Richmond's projections? Is Richmond no longer in the projection business?  So you gave it up?  On what?  I would prefer 13 over--  You want it as high as you can get it  How many people will vote for anything?  I'd rather let it stand  It's running a little high  We can't have 6 to 9 percent in the first half It's not possible "
1345,1980-04-22," I wonder whether it wouldn't be desirable to have some downward pressure on the dollar, with the economy moving into what could prove to be a pretty sizable recession Wouldn't it be nice to have a little better export market?  Yes, I know But we don't know how long the recession is going to last either  Well, I agree with that  And, of course, the thing that would bring the inflation rate down the quickest in the short run would be lower interest rates because the CPI is being affected so greatly [by] mortgage costs and other indirect costs of higher interest rates  Gets to realize its losses!  Do we know what happened in April 1975?  I see  Well, in terms of money demand--  Don't you think, Willis, that they followed a different inventory policy this time?  They seemed to cut production very fast, too I don't know  It's consistent with the numbers you gave, which are the average over the longer run Henry mentioned M-1B also  I agree that there's a sizable decline in activity now in process It was inevitable, I think But it's probably worse because of the policies we've followed over the last six months in defense of a principle The principle was that in the absence of knowledge about how interest rates should move--because we have so little knowledge of the rate that people are willing to pay based on expected rates of return and on inflation--we would provide aggregate growth that we thought appropriate to a moderation of the inflationary course When we get into a decline, it has always seemed to me extremely difficult to forecast how far it might go because there are dynamics involved There have been shocks Chrysler, a major bank that has been referred to, silver, and the possible failure of a brokerage firm There are shocks of that kind that can affect attitudes and deepen, more than anyone anticipated, the reduction in spending that people are willing to undertake And what we have are the automatic stabilizers to guard against this becoming cumulative and self-reinforcing in its downward movement Now, the automatic stabilizer in the case of fiscal policy, of course, is the fact that we get budget swings And the automatic stabilizer we've introduced in monetary policy is the fact that we'll get interest rate swings as we hold to particular ranges of growth that we're willing to see in the monetary aggregates Not to let that automatic stabilizer work would risk a self-reinforcing cumulative decline in activity because we don't know what is happening, as we didn't on the up side, to people's willingness to pay rates of interest for the use of money I think, Henry, that one ought to distinguish between the automatic stabilizer principle and the setting that we put it on, which is the longer-run presumption We have a setting for M1 growth; I won't say M-1A or M-1B because I want to say it's approximately 5 percent Now, if the underlying rate of inflation is 10 percent, which I think it is, or if it's 15 percent, which you think it is, that's a very, very tight setting on monetary growth because it means there isn't much of anything left for real growth In fact, it would suggest that unless the inflation rate comes down significantly, there won't be any real growth in the economy And that is very much analogous to a setting in the budgetary posture of, say, a full employment budget of $100 billion It's quite similar It seems to me that we deliberately chose a tight setting and we ought to stay with a tight setting; but it also seems to that me we ought to let the automatic stabilizer work because not to do so would be very much like the actions of this group in the period from 1929 to 1933 We could get a reinforcing decline in activity that is propelled by monetary contraction And we can't stand that kind of risk for our economy or for the world  Are profits being squeezed? Is that how that works?  Does that include First Pennsylvania?  Paul, are you specifying a funds rate target? Is that what we're going to be doing?  I see I don't think there's any problem if Steve is right and we get around 7 percent money growth in May and June But what if we got zero money growth in May and June?  Or ""around""  That's what we said last time    4/22/80  We could do that, except it should be $1-1/4 billion, I think  We're also below [path] on total reserves, aren't we, Steve? That would be another reason for adjusting the borrowing down  It would be rather nice symbolically to move the upper limit down to 19 percent  Well, that gets a little tight I like 19  After all, we could get a spurt in the money supply The factthat we've had two minus months increases the odds that we're going to have plus months That's the only rule that I have and--  Of course, we don't pump reserves in unless we have a shortfall  I'm agreeable to it, too, Paul It's a nice intermediate course, and it is only four weeks to the next meeting We could get a reversal or it could get a lot worse So I would suggest, as I think you did, that we take a point off the upper end of that [funds rate] range and live with ""B"" and expect the funds rate to come down some from where it has been, maybe to the area of 16 percent or a little below It might have to go down further if we get great weakness in the aggregates; it wouldn't have to go that far if we get a good rebound  Isn't M-1B growth just about that, 5 percent?  I don't know, either, but it certainly would tend to bring the borrowing down pretty fast if we had a 16 percent--  Except at one bank  Well, I agree very much with Tony I think we have to be careful not to make this too formal because if it is formal, it ought to be in the directive  Consultation if we have low money supply  What is it? Is it non-priority loans? Is it take-over loans? That's another aspect of consultation  SPEAKER(?) Well, it will be heavily loaded with oil and gas loans, almost inevitably  SPEAKER(?) In the second respect  SPEAKER(?) Real estate loans have been very strong also  Remember, if that's a loan to an oil company, that doesn't mean that it's a loan for the purpose of drilling an oil well It might be for some entirely different purpose  SPEAKER(?) Like borrowing silver!  SPEAKER(?) That wasn't the kind I was talking about though, Chuck "
1365,1980-04-29," Well, as you might imagine, I disagree with both Tony and Henry I think the money supply figures may well be telling us something The [weakness is] in currency as well as in demand deposits, and it's associated with extraordinarily weak information on the economy In the last three weeks the initial claims for unemployment insurance have shot up to the level they reached in the spring of 1975 And they show no sign of turning I just spoke a few minutes ago to a man who operates a very large retail business, and he said that in the month of March he missed his projection of credit outstandings by $20 million That is, they were $20 million lower than he had [expected] He had never before missed it by more than $1 million He said that sales have continued extraordinarily weak in the month of April The car dealer community is on its ear and so is the automobile industry There is no building going on except for the completion of single family units that were started earlier, and even there in some cases there has been a stoppage  So I think there is a fair chance that this money supply [behavior] is telling us that we're now entering into the sharpest phase of recession we've seen any time since World War II And if that is the case, to maintain interest rates [at their current high levels] and thereby destroy the reserves necessary to support reasonable monetary growth is a grossly wrong policy for the Board or the FOMC to follow I wouldn't want to panic on this, because it does seem to me that a minus 12 percent rate is just so unbelievable that I can't believe it could continue for any length of time But I do think, since the Committee has in its [most recently] published directive to the Manager a range for the funds rate that extends down    4/29/80  to 13 percent, that we have no business looking at any [lower bound] above 13 percent in terms of limiting the Manager's activity So I would say that what we ought to do now is to use the full range that's available to us and that we specified only a week ago in the directive--and which has yet to be made public And we ought to talk in another week to see if it should be reduced further because I think we have to react to what could be a very seriously deteriorating economic situation  Our policy will have an effect on that  I do think, Paul, that we'd have to follow practice and look at the multiplier, if it holds up to be a shift But it probably would be another week before we'd have that information So for the week $900 million is all right  Let's see how the figures develop "
1408,1980-05-20," Seconded    5/20/80  They take the exchange risk, is that right?  And the interest rate is the US bill rate? And you are proposing 60 days?  Ninety days is so conventional I don't much like saying 60 days It sounds as if we have some particular problem with Sweden I would think a 90-day maturity--  Oh, no, it isn't They just had a long strike, you know  I thought it was 90 days  I think that's reasonable  It's somewhat like a freight train, you know There's the engine and the caboose And what happened is that we've now jerked forward and the borrowings have gone down  I think there is a certain amount of looseness in the relationship, and the looseness that has been used up this month--  Well, we've announced our targets to the Congress not in terms of interest rates but in terms of aggregates We've never mentioned interest rates in our targets to Congress  That's all we have anyway  I wonder if you would talk a little about your projections on the saving rate, Jim What bothers me is that you have such a small rise in the saving rate over the next year when one considers that it has been abnormally low and that we seem to see every evidence that people are trying to pay down debt and improve their financial position And, of course, if that saving rate were to come in significantly higher than you have projected, it would imply a considerably weaker economy  Well, on this question of strategy for dealing with a shortfall, I just don't know; I have a feeling of discomfort about it I suppose what it amounts to is that having suffered an unprecedented decline we ought to be prepared for an unprecedented increase to make it up, should it occur Therefore, if we had a sudden surge, restoring us closer to the trendline, that would be all right; that should be permitted without any difficulty If we don't have that, the question is How hard should we push to get [money growth] turned around? As a matter of procedure, I feel it's incorrect in May to use the whole rest of the year to try to get back within the range because we may well continue to have adversity in reaching the numbers desired And if we do, the shortfall will get worse and worse and harder and harder to adjust to So, without speaking to the policy issue, I just think that procedurally it is better to have a fairly moderate period in which we plan to recoup our losses rather than a long period Therefore, [aiming to get] back to path by September strikes me as much sounder than [getting] back to path by December, which is the alternative given  As long as I have the floor, I might just go on I think there is a fair possibility that something big--really big--is going on out there in the economy and that in fact we may not get a rebound in money supply or credit demand for some while If that is so, the decline in final demand that is occurring will destroy income; and the destruction of income will result in a further weakening in final demand And if that's the situation, that is a classic depression situation developing in the economy The worst possible thing that could happen would be to continue to see credit and money contract because that would perpetuate and deepen the decline and really get us to the point that Dave was raising Nobody ever projects what would happen if we had a wave of bankruptcies because there is no way to project it We so seldom have a wave of bankruptcies that we just can't see how bad things might be if that occurred The last real big wave was in the 1930s And, of course, it created grave effects on expectations and attitudes and the willingness to spend and so forth So, if there is something big going on, it's terribly important that we stop the decline in money and credit If there isn't something very big going on, we will get a turnaround without doing an awful lot, in which case it won't turn out to be such a big problem So it seems to me that the risks are all on the one side, and we ought to structure our operations and our policy to recognize those risks  That's precisely why I suggested September, because in fact we might continue to have a shortfall relative to our expectations, in which case having targeted on December we will have no more room I think we will be lucky if we are within the ranges at all this year But it's just a question of how quickly we try to get back [within them]  The analytic significance of L escapes me  It always happens; in every credit crunch it has happened  Certainly we'd say monetary growth is lower than ever--  You'd [take] off the special deposits too--not just the reporting but also the special deposits?  I don't know; we got some from the mutual funds  I think it will be  Following up on April!  I didn't specify [a fed funds range]  I think zero is a bit of a possibility, unless we constrain the funds rate  The question is What do we do with that $850 million shortfall in reserves? That's money in the bank, I might say Do we first permit an $850 million increase?  For the two months, for May-June?  I think it's true that in the last two or three months we've consistently thought the midpoint of the range remained about appropriate There is a question now, after the big shortfall in April--a much bigger shortfall in M1 than M2 or M3 I don't view it as a betrayal for somebody to say that under all the circumstances he'd now feel more comfortable with growth in the lower part of the range Indeed, next month we get an opportunity to change the range entirely  It's done partly so there is a chance of being within the range If we have a point target, we're going to miss it  But it's also true that we can say that it depends on circumstances where within the range we want to fall  I think we're going to hit the funds rate constraint this week  Yes, this coming week  We'll be right down on 9 percent and we'll be below the target growth and will immediately face the problem We just don't have any room, given the weakness in the economy  Paul, it seems to me that the whole idea of moving toward aggregates was to create a situation where we wouldn't have to depend on presumptions I'm not saying that Steve is wrong but the whole idea of having a wider range is to make it possible to flex as developments occur, without depending on a staff forecast  I guess what you're saying is that you don't want to flex below 9 percent  And I'm saying I do; so we're in fundamental disagreement  Well, we have had a run of minus numbers on the aggregates I'm inclined to agree with Larry Adding another week to the extreme rate of decline will make us look much more like the Open Market Committee of 1930  Come on, you mean [unintelligible] said it  I understand they also told us that we should certainly achieve our aggregates objectives They're just like the Joint Economic Committee  Well, [we stopped] at 10-1/2 percent Over the last two weeks we were way short on reserves and we stopped [supplying additional reserves] on account of the 10-1/2 percent  Well, I'd rather have the cosmetics look right and have a wider range and have an understanding that there is a touch point that we wouldn't go through without a consultation, if Murray will let us do that short of recording it in the Policy Record  SPEAKER(?) Somebody tells me this is being tape recorded  Let me retract the word checkpoint Can we say there's a zone through which we would not wish to pass without considering together the implications of such a passage?  And there was no vote on the 16 percent, as a matter of fact It was just an understanding that at 15 or 16 percent, whatever it was--  We have been doing that, haven't we?  We're going to miss it, you know, one way or the other  We could say ""seeks expansion over the next two months of M-1A, M-1B and M2 at rates high enough to promote achievement of the Committee's long-run objectives"" It implies higher growth than the long-run targets without being at all specific about it  Well, it's really not at all specific  ""Seeks growth in these aggregates over the next two months at rates high enough to promote achievement of the Committee's longer run objectives"" Then we could [cite] the monetary growth over the first nine months of the year, or something like that  I think we ought to be specific and say ""promote its longer-run objectives for the year"" or something like that  But we have to have point estimates for our growth targets for May-June in order to establish some reserve [objectives] You never specified what you wanted those to be  No, for voting purposes  What about M-1B?  So you are going the alternative A route?  If fortune should smile on us  Yes  And you want to put in a 9 percent funds rate with consultation at 9-1/2 percent, did you say?  A show of hands?  No we didn't; it was only [lowered from] 20 to 19 percent  You're taking it off of alternative A rather than alternative B  My alternative would be to raise the point [targets] for M-1A, M-1B, and M2 to make them essentially the midpoints between alternative A and alternative B for the 2-month period and to establish an 8 percent lower end on the funds rate rather than 9 percent That would be my suggestion  We would be reviewing it The Chairman could call for a telephone conference as we got down into the lower end of the funds range, yes I wouldn't want to be too specific because Murray might make us put it in the Policy Record But the Chairman  -46    5/20/80  could have a call at 9-1/2 percent, as the rate was moving from 9-1/2 to 9 percent, with an 8 percent limit on the published range  Well, I'd compromise between alternative A and alternative B I spoke in terms of alternative B I would rather have a funds rate of 7 percent; I just specified a funds rate of 8 percent I compromised compared with what I would otherwise have done He asked if there were any suggestions and that was my suggestion  I couldn't accept that  We're voting on Paul's specifications [with a] drop in [the lower limit on] the funds rate to 8-1/2 percent? "
1429,1980-06-05," I don't agree with that I think we ought to let [the rate] fall I didn't care much for the checkpoint in the first place, as you know In fact I didn't care for the 8-1/2 percent lower limit either So it's obvious that I feel we ought to continue to operate in a way to find a market level at which some borrowing occurs again and at which there is some expansion in the narrow  -4-    6/5/80  monetary aggregates I'm not at all certain that we've seen anything like the total configuration of the decline in business that's in process I haven't heard anything as yet of any stopping of the decline, of any comeback in consumer spending, or of anything other than further cutbacks in production Tomorrow morning we get an unemployment figure and employment figures in the BLS series It will be very interesting to see what they show But I wouldn't expect improvement in either employment or in the unemployment rate compared with last month's number So I think we still ought to try to find that level, which means going right through 9-1/2 percent if providing the reserves would take us through 9-1/2 percent I agree with Paul very much that there's no need to make any decision on the 8-1/2 percent at this point We'll have to wait and see whether it's tested or not "
1456,1980-07-09," Well, we must have most of the $20 billion  Is this unique to us?  Other countries don't do it?  So the path is below what was originally--  The market is doubting whether we have an objective of fighting inflation and whether we are going to let interest rates decline or push interest rates down long enough so that it will encourage these flows of funds into marks, Swiss francs, and other currencies  Whether we follow the aggregates or not is an academic point They follow the M1 numbers, which come out on Friday --or this time on Monday But the emphasis is on the thrust of policy toward inflation  -8-    7/9/80  I think, Mr Chairman, that we want to be very certain that we mop up any reserves here I can't understand why in the world the market thinks we won't, but there seems to be some view of that So if it's right on the edge, I would make it higher; I would propose $4-1/2 billion  But you said that was right on the edge  Oh, I see I misunderstood you  So moved  Yes, but there is a phrase that says ""get back on the targets for the aggregates"" I see your point There are a lot of things in it; they could change it from year to year  A shift over and above what is already assumed in M-1A and M-1B?  Look at the previous [chart], Paul  Compensation is [charted] on the previous page; that shows around 3 percent, I think  I would agree with Lyle I think you're substituting manhours for lack of gain in productivity So you don't actually get a difference in real output in the forecast period, but I think it does lead to pessimism on the price front compared to what might otherwise be the case  You'd just raise [the non-inflationary full employment rate] by 09, would you? Is that effectively what you would do?  $75 billion?  -17-    7/9/80  Is that because compensation goes up a lot less in your forecast, Bob? How do you have less inflation? That's what I'm asking  I understand that But looking at the factors of costs and prices, is it better productivity?  Well, not [until] next year, though  I'm fairly comfortable with the forecast I have a feeling that the staff might be on the optimistic side with regard to prices I noticed that food price increases are really nothing exceptional at all in this forecast and intuitively I would  -24-    7/9/80  have expected a considerable burst in food prices later this year and early next year as animal inventories are reduced and can't go any lower and we get a very substantial reaction in meat prices I also agree with Lyle that the pressures on compensation are all going to be on the up side of this forecast rather than the low side And then I'm not really sure about energy; that's a wild card [The staff has] a 16 percent increase year-end to year-end, which is fairly modest; on the other hand, one could make a case that a surplus would make even that a rather large increase I'm just not sure about that If we did have a little more in prices, we might have a little less real growth, given the policy assumptions And that would be the tendency, I think, as the year goes on In addition, there is no allowance here for shocks One can't have an allowance for shocks, but in fact many of the main features of our economy in the last few years have been conditioned by unanticipated shocks And there could be more in the future--the large country difficulties, large company difficulties, large bank difficulties, whatever they might be--that could adversely affect the outlook  As far as the money number is concerned, I think assuming that 3 percent demand shift is a very conservative stance for the staff to take Remember what that means If the demand shift were less than 3 percent, interest rates would be higher than forecast given GNP; and they're already forecast to be pretty high Back in '75 we didn't put in much demand shift, and we [forecast] very high interest rates rather early on in the recovery, [and those rates] never materialized So I think taking a sort of midpoint figure for a continued demand shift is conservative and the proper way to go If it's [more] than this, we'll have credit conditions that are a little easier than forecast But given the great uncertainty in this area-- and I don't understand the thing nor do I think the model is much good--the staff assumption seems proper and conservative And we ought to keep that in mind  And M3 will be just a little below the midpoint  After having run for a year or more above the top of the range It does suggest that we could reduce the M-1A range on technical grounds; I guess one could justify a half point reduction in the lower end  I mentioned the lower end of the range Your point about the top end is very well taken  Last gasp  -36-    7/9/80  Or let it go a little over  Chances are that M3 will be within [its range] and we could be a little over on M2 and a little under on Ml  I agree 100 percent with Nancy I would use the same ranges again, recognizing that for 1980 we expect--and to some extent plan--to come in at the bottom end of the range on M1 and maybe well up in the range on M2 I think that's probably better than making any kind of technical adjustment And I agree that we can explain bank credit by emphasizing [commercial] paper, the way Nancy did, rather than corporate debt generally because people understand that paper is a direct substitute for bank borrowing, depending on rate relationships  For 1981, I agree with both Nancy and Lyle I don't see any chance of reducing these ranges without possibly having considerable impacts on the economy Now, a number of people have said they don't  -42-    7/9/80  know what to do with M1, so let's reduce M2 But M2, as somebody pointed out earlier, is a source of housing credit in substantial part and has the money market mutual funds in it, which are still growing pretty rapidly The top end of our range now is 9 percent We can't ignore the fact that nominal GNP is going to have to go up quite a bit because, much as we dislike it, there's going to be quite a lot of inflation And [reducing the M2 range] isn't the way to stop that inflation Therefore, it seems to me that we'll be lucky if we can keep M2 within that 9 percent [upper limit] next year The strategy I would follow would be to say that 1981 is a long time off but we anticipate having something like the same kinds of ranges for 1981 that we have had this year and we would hope to reduce growth within these ranges as inflationary pressures abate--assuming they do You can make that comment We will do it as we are able to do it, as inflationary pressures are reduced  On wage-price control, I would get rid of that program as soon as possible I think it is totally discredited in the country and it is best to get rid of [that bureaucracy] and let it rest for a year or two and maybe try something better next time We can say that market forces are going to lead toward more moderate settlements in labor [contracts] later One of the difficulties in continuing the program is that we have to recognize the cost of living And if we do, that's going to lead us as it did this year to raise the Reserve Bank budgets rather than reduce them The change in the wage-price guidelines led us to increase Reserve Bank salaries and that's a very fine example of a counterproductive effect from that [program] It's our own salaries that have to be limited--not somebody else's, but everybody's in this room  I don't see any sense in arguing the tax issue There will be a reduction next year It needs to include some consumption tax reduction because consumers are too hard pressed, but I like the idea of making it a payroll rather than a general income tax reduction  Perhaps we could invent a typo for this and scramble the sentence--  That's what everybody always does when they talk about their own salary  It's going to have to  It's in the longer-term paragraph, isn't it?  I thought that's what the Humphrey-Hawkins Act called for  And of the need to keep some of our [citizens] employed  [Unintelligible] talk about ranges We might want to have somewhat [narrower] ranges but even that is too risky, I think But certainly we wouldn't want to say that in 1981 growth is going to be lower than the point estimates that we have for 1980  I think we're better off just talking about the ranges, Paul It will exacerbate Tony's problem if we have a footnote that says we may have a higher M1 and we may not  -53-    7/9/80  By ""anything extreme"" what do you mean other than to reduce interest rates?  Steve is not waffling enough for me  That's what you're likely to do!  I'm told that my subommittee, of which you were a member at the time, proposed that it be in the directive I can't remember why  If we work on this waffle, it finally will be a pancake  You made me think that this [unintelligible]  By the end of year, he said You'd have to extend [that growth rate for the period from] September to December  I don't think it means we would exceed [the 6 percent] We would target on that and if we went over it, as we did last time--I agree with you that it worked out very well even though I voted against it--    7/9/80  That's what [Henry] means--that it really does mean sort of running on the funds rate so long as the aggregate is reasonably--  That was my inclination, too; I would go along with Bob on that  -60-    7/9/80  I'd leave it at 8-1/2 to 14 percent That's what it is now, isn't it?  The funds rate is well above 8-1/2 percent now  Undoubtedly we do; it's just a question of how much  Except that we're in great jeopardy that the prime rate will be below the discount rate I think we're 2 points too high on the discount rate It ought to be 9 percent  Yes  But they're going to read on Friday that 8-1/2 percent was the lower limit [set at the May meeting] It has--  Will they think that we've raised the limit?  SPEAKER(?) They may think we've lowered it  Then we ought to lower it, shouldn't we, to get it away from where the money supply is?  We could then [let the funds rate] move up through that range of 8-1/2 to 14 percent We'd have to change the lower limit [if we ease too much in the near term]  What will look better will be the 2-1/2 year certificate Money market funds have been doing very well; they probably won't do that much better But the 2-1/2 year certificate could improve and could give us expanded--  Well, 50/50 is a lot It's not consistent with the reserve targeting process that we have  Yes, that fraction has changed some  It's only five weeks until the next meeting  It's a little lower number but it's a tolerable number, Larry  We will assert that these are consistent with the Administration's targets?  We have to do that We have to say whether they are consistent  On that we want a vote  He said some of us are  Or we have to do it longer  Also, if we do it both ways, one can subtract and see what the effect of a tax cut is  Yes, why not make it twice as big?  6 percent  These ranges are so wide that a reader would have to conclude that the Committee didn't know-- "
1503,1980-08-12," The interest rate differential as reported yesterday supports [that view] It is 400 basis points more adverse to the United States than it was at the beginning and the exchange rate is the same There is obviously a stronger undertone of confidence in the dollar than before, as you say  I would emphasize that we do have the safety valve of the discount window If something began to tighten the market, we'd automatically tend to get an increase in borrowing That's the reason why it's important to have the discount rate well in tune with money rates Fortunately it was changed just before [this situation occurred], or I suppose the funds rate would have gone above 11 percent  I guess we'll let a week occur, Lyle, before we change it  We make it move up?  The trouble is that we would need to float the differential as well as the rate in some way so that we've got moves from above to below the funds rate To put it another way--  Raw materials prices  It went pretty fast  It's based on his past record!  I am impressed by the signs of the economy catching as we've [eased our policy] I don't know to what extent we should regard that as unusual The decline in consumer spending was exceedingly rapid and took us to pretty low levels in real terms in some areas such as automobiles It may not be that unusual to have a little recovery after we've had a decline of that extent--a little catching up--particularly with money and credit conditions easing So, I guess I am not as convinced by the evidence that the recession is nicely bottoming out and that it won't be very long before we get an upturn I don't agree that this is conclusive since [the period of improvement] is so brief and since it seems any market would have a little see-sawing when big changes occur I wouldn't agree with the comment that Henry made that nobody has gone bankrupt I believe bankruptcies are at an all-time high all over the country Small businesses are going bankrupt and the automobile dealers are having a major shakeup It's just that no big companies have gone bankrupt because we didn't permit Chrysler to do so Otherwise we would have had a big bankruptcy as we've had before Also I would point out that there is a long tail on this If Bob is right, even if the staff is right in their price projections, we're going to have a period of quite restrained profit performance And when that occurs, there is a frequency distribution around it; some [firms] are going to be a lot less good than average and they might be bad enough to go bankrupt So there's still a lot to be played out What gives me most pause about being somewhat bearish about the outlook is the stock market, which has performed extraordinarily well, and sensitive industrial materials prices have moved up without fail for two months or more by a rather marked amount And there are a lot of people out there who, unlike us, are putting their money behind their forecasts They say that profits are going to go up--I presume in order to justify the stock market--and that prices are going to go up because of the demand for raw materials And that does give me a pause So, I am just uncertain But I wouldn't be quite as favorably inclined on the outlook as the discussion around the table has [suggested] so far  The staff projection for the third quarter [implies] a decline in every velocity measure  But what is [velocity in] the second quarter, except the simple result of dividing income by money supply?  Well, I wanted to talk about this very subject I wanted to indicate that I am somewhat dubious about giving much importance to M2 in the current environment for several reasons Number one, our range for M2 was developed on the basis of a relationship the staff presented to us some time ago, which might have been right or might not have been right Certainly, it is at least dealing with an instrument that has different components in it than before Number two, the top end of our range for M2, an aggregate which includes most kinds of instant liquidity that people can think of, is 9 percent That is about equal to the rate of inflation; so at the top end that means the real value of liquid assets will not change That doesn't sound all that great And we have the [prospect of] these shifts of the sort that Ed was mentioning, which do strike me as possible M3 is better than M2, I think, because of the possibility that M3 components--that is, large CDs [primarily]--are moving to identified M2 components as a result of interest rate strategies and so forth on the part of holders I don't find M-1A all that bad an indicator I think what we have to recognize about M-1A is that it has a downward bias That is, there is some shifting away from M-1A, and we can't quite quantify it, but the basis for M-1A's relationship to the economy is pretty well established over time and has been pretty well researched M-1A still does have currency in it and it still does have demand deposits in it so that we see what the relationship might be It seems to me the best thing to do is to look at M-1A principally and make an allowance--I don't care whether we make it a 2 percent allowance or what--for the understatement of the growth rate that is occurring because of shifts into other  -25-    8/12/80  instruments I think that's the safer way to go An alternative way, along our usual lines of suggestion, is why not average M-1A and [M- 1B] and say that's our goal, on the [grounds that] neither is right One has an understatement and one has an overstatement, so let's take the average It can't be all that bad But I think M2 is very dangerous to use importantly in trying to steer monetary policy, and I would certainly advise against that  The ""old standby"" of real interest rates?  Your old standby  We couldn't do it unless we didn't collect them, Bob Then we wouldn't have anything for our own use either  It doesn't have much arithmetic effect, I agree, Tony  As a well-known Washington philosopher a few years ago was fond of saying ""If the thing ain't broke, don't fix it"" I don't think the thing is broke here It seems to me [the aggregates] have been moving rather nicely along their path with an interest rate performance that was, if not pleasing, at least acceptable to almost everybody after that abysmal April break in the numbers And as you said, Mr Chairman, a continuation of our earlier statement [regarding our objectives for the quarter], particularly in terms of the profile for M-1A but to a large degree for M-1B, would be alternative A It seems to me that that's the path we have and it's working quite fine So I would certainly [support] that I do believe that there will be a tolerance in the society as a whole, though not in Washington, of higher interest rates if we can say ""Look, we've had a big rise in the aggregates so we've got to resist that rise because that will bring inflation"" But if we have higher interest rates because we're fiddling around with a path that we earlier specified with the Congress--and if we're on that path or would have been on it had we not changed it--there isn't going to be that tolerance I think that's a very dangerous game to get involved in We may have an explosion in the aggregates; some are forecasting it If we do, then we'll raise interest rates But we may not And if we don't, I don't think we have any basis for trying to bias interest rate movements upward So I would take ""A"" for sure  When you say split the difference, Tony, do you mean the July-to-September difference?  Why don't we make it 8 to 14 percent and make the width 6 points?  [The top of the range] doesn't seem operational  I would think so  Did we publish June to September last time?  For the third quarter  $25 million more  It would be associated with weak growth in the aggregates  It's such a small issue that I am prepared to go either way  ""A minus""  It's the same either way  With 8-1/2 to 14 percent Those are our two choices  Where are all these people who thought there was going to be explosive growth in the aggregates? I guess they are not represented  Do you want to try a straight ""A"" with 8 to 14 percent and $75 million?  -44-    8/12/80  Why don't you try ""can live with"" on ""A""?  Then you can state your preference  Sure  Yes, we're just lowering the lower limit on the funds range; we may not use it at all  Well, it has plenty of room to go to 14 percent  Yes, except for the M-1A figure, which we could leave [at the precise average] of 6-1/2 percent  -45-    8/12/80 "
1519,1980-08-22," As high as 11 percent  If it isn't, we're--  Well, we're positioned to move on up "
1540,1980-09-16," Seconded  It's a [long-running] characteristic I've seen it--  And then as the economy [rebounded], the demand for money increased again and we found ourselves reacting against that There is a demand side, Larry, and it has shown sharp shifts this year We've worked against them and, of course, it's a question of judgment as to how strongly to work against the demand factors in the market But by [historical] standards, we worked against them a good deal harder than we did in the past We have had both a sharper    9/16/80  decline in rates and a sharper, earlier recovery in rates than ever before in my recollection And that is because of the change in policy announced last October  It depends on what your economic objective is  That was a national comment; it wasn't a Texas comment  Is that for M-1A, Jim?  away-- We've got NOW accounts--  I would say first that I think the bottom of the recession has been reached or is very close to being reached and that the economy is probably turning up right now Secondly, I think it will be a sluggish recovery The price increases will be so large that there won't be available income to spur more than just a very gradual recovery We could get a month or two of good retail sales but then I think we will have a relapse and we won't have much of a growth rate Basically that is what the staff is forecasting Third, I do believe in the W [scenario], but it's likely to be a W that is a little more extended I believe that 1982 will be the year of recession, similar to 1958 and 1960-61 when we had two rapid recessions in a period of great concern about inflation and a period of restrained policy in the late 1950s And fourth, I think the second recession will bring the decline in income growth and, therefore, the decline in inflation We have to get through this next year, and next year we will have a lot of inflation because of food prices The years 1960 and 1964 and the 1974-76 period were affected quite a bit by a very favorable bump in agriculture This year we will not be getting a favorable bump; it's going to go the other way Therefore, the inflation rate will remain high so long as income growth remains high But in the '82 recession I think income growth will slow considerably and the rate of inflation will slow considerably So if we just sort of float along with this and try not to be too expansive or too restrictive and bring about some kind of change in the structure of the system over the next year or so, I think in time what Fred hopes for will be accomplished  That's just my own personal view  That's on average for the whole quarter, Steve?  It would be turning up as the quarter went on?  What is the borrowing level, Paul?  We have that table that shows banks about to come under administrative pressure and [the number] is virtually zero as I recall, using the normal standards There just hasn't been enough borrowing for a long enough time for anybody except the one bank in Philadelphia  One could also say, Steve, that having had a very big month, which might represent some degree of stock adjustment, the odds are for a period of relative calm the following month  Sometimes that's what it takes, prayer  The comments so far have been [for a course that is] tougher than I would like to be I did indicate that I thought the recession had bottomed out; but, of course, it's incorrect to say the recession is over It just means that the downward movement is over and we are at the low end of the range And we have seen a pretty considerable increase in interest rates, one that could begin to threaten even a moderate recovery in housing So it seems to me a little early to blithely expect to see interest rates go materially higher If one thinks of these numbers for the aggregates as being targets--and I believe that's how we should think of them--and the actual comes out differently, then we should modify our operations Interest rates go higher than the median here if the aggregates are strong, and they go lower if the aggregates are weak relative to the  -36-    9/16/80  targets If one thinks of these as target numbers for the 3-month period of October, November, and December and looks at the charts, alternative A isn't that bad It's a little high, I think, mainly because I don't like to see M-1B running as high in the range as it is there So, I would like to suggest an alternative between ""A"" and ""B"" I would say, for example, 4 percent for M-1A, 6-1/2 percent for M-1B, and 8-1/2 percent for M2; the latter would be the same as the alternative B number and is more a hope than anything that we would do, actually  I said 4, 6-1/2, and 8-1/2 percent I do think it's probably time to make a little movement in our broad funds rate range, and I would raise it a point on the bottom and top and make it 9 to 15 percent Chances are that even under the staff presumption it will be at about 11 percent and probably drifting up, so 9 to 15 percent is not so a bad as an outer limit kind of range And I would do that on the presumption that these are targets If the aggregates come in stronger than this, we will move up in that range; and if they are weaker, we will move down in that range from our current 10-3/4 to 11 percent So, that's what I would prefer As far as borrowings are concerned, I don't think we should use a figure as high as the one that Peter mentioned as the base, $11 billion or something like that But it probably needs to be quite a bit higher than we talked about last time I was thinking of something around $600 or $700 million as the base we would start from on the borrowing  I didn't support alternative A  It's very temporary, I think  Without limit? That's rather wide open; it could mean zero, -5, -10  Remember, we did say last October and throughout the next several meetings--as I recall, the number was 4-1/2 percent-- ""or somewhat less"" But it was only somewhat less; if it were significantly less, we would move against it  No, mine is September-December  The base month is August and the last month is December That means we're talking about--  Well, you thought he'd used up his turn  You're talking about M-1B, Bob?  All you're saying is that August is a big month  You still have a [unintelligible]  Well, I sort of disagree with Jerry We're trying to set a target path that we think is acceptable If the numbers come in high, then markets are going to have to tighten; and if the numbers come in low, markets are going to have to ease It's a target concept rather than a projection concept that we should think about when we're specifying these So I don't see why we can't state, as suggested in the Bluebook, the target growth rate we would like to see for the last four months of the year  I think you have to isolate the voting members  I agree with Lyle's comment, by the way, on the borrowing level I think $750 million is too high  You want preferences or can live with?  That was a wise decision, I think  I don't care It seems to me that our actual experience is usually broad enough that it looks rather funny to be putting down quarters as targets But I would accept the quarters  Larry, we're within the targets  And I would point out, Larry, that we're well within the targets that we specified in January and respecified in July for three of four aggregates M2 is a trifle [above] But I don't think the concept has been violated  I think it's worse than ""B"" because if what we've seen in the economy is a little bubble, we could be very slow to have an adjustment to it We are not out of these ranges I don't see the basis that we had last summer for doing that, when we were clearly below the ranges, or last fall when we were very concerned about being over the ranges We are within them  But we most recently had a big month, and that's the only thing you're saying That we had a really big month When we had a small April, the shoe was on the other foot and that dropped us right below our target ranges  But we were below the ranges_  Because it just means that there's a very lagged response to an unexpected weakness in market terms That's what it means And I would point out that for these last four months of the year we're talking about growth rates of 4, 6-1/2 and 8-1/2 percent; those aren't fast They are within the ranges, I think  No, and I'm not including April either August is water over the dam and April is water over the dam We're talking about the next four months  But we'll take out the reserves and that will mean that the money supply will be low And there won't be a self- correcting operation  You can bet that long before it got down to 8 percent we would be consulting  Technically, it wouldn't be [known to the public] until the policy record came out since they never test either end of this  It's really a $700 to $800 million range, or something like that  That's a better way to think of it  Well, I'm certainly glad that Governor Schultz is here!  -56-    9/16/80 -57-  What would happen if we didn't? Is it any good for a loss or a gain? "
1562,1980-10-21," But both of your comments imply that you know what the rate ought to be--that you think the rate has gotten too high and that it's going to come back down again Now, do you know that with that degree of certainty?  Well, if it's a fast movement, I will agree  I'm not so sure we do  My only point, Tony, is that I can remember sitting here not too long ago and hearing that if the rate dropped below 2, the end of the world would be at hand Well, we're not even back to 2 I agree that it slips with time and perhaps what was 2 then ought to be 190 now because of the differential in inflation rates But it requires some care, I think, not to accumulate large balances that in fact turn out to be, as on the down side, a resistance to the tide that really can't be resisted and then results in a large ultimate loss for the central bank  It's really a very complicated question, isn't it? I was impressed by the memo, which did indicate clearly that we would have been ahead if we had run it the other way But it depends on the presumption that the strong currency will have the lower interest rate Now, that's not true in the case of sterling where the interest rate is higher than elsewhere and the currency is stronger Do we know that it will always be true of the mark?  Do we know that our interest rates will always be high? It just seems to me that the relationship is complicated That's the only thing I'm saying And I don't fully understand it, because I think it probably involves a question of meshing of monetary policy worldwide, or at least among the major countries I don't think they'll agree to that  Because the inflation rate must be another--  Equal  Well, I understand  Yes, in the past we always assumed we would have a lower rate We now seem to be assuming that the Germans will always have a lower rate  How about the aggregate?    10/21/80  Make that $1-1/2 billion?  I'd be more comfortable with $1 billion myself; I feel uncertain about it  You bought $200 [million] for our own account yesterday, Scott?  Well, I don't feel too badly as long as it's on a consolidated basis, so to speak, and we're not holding a significant cash balance But I always get concerned because of the parallel, let's say, with buying [unintelligible]  We can go up and ask the Germans--  The notion is that we defend the dollar harder than we defend the mark  What is your estimate of the reserve release that we are facing in early November, Peter? How big is it?  My point was simply that your request for expanded authority is roughly related to the size of the release that you may have to be doing  Yes, we get whipsawed As long as we assume there's a lag--  It used to be five months--50 percent in five months  We ought to recognize that we could still have this whipsawing with a lot of two-month cycles  You change demand [for money] by changing the spending that it's related to  It might have been a factor  It used to be that in five months we'd get half of it  I think one has to have time periods in mind, What we are talking about is a relatively short interval of a few months and we are having great difficulty controlling the money supply in a short interval But I think the record is pretty good on the longer run  But, Jerry, your industrial production was a lot weaker in the third quarter than GNP And, therefore, there could be a rise in industrial production compared to GNP in the fourth quarter  I think the reason we said they should have equal weight, which I believe is what we have said in recent months, Larry, is precisely because we recognize a downward bias in M-1A and an upward bias in M-1B And so we said we'd give them equal weight  M-1A is well within the guidelines  And M-1B will be outside regardless of which alternative we take  SPEAKER(?) M-1B [comes out] right at the top on ""A""  SPEAKER(?) And right at the edge on ""B""  Well, look at the chart In fact, on average ""A"" and ""B"" are within the guidelines  As a matter of fact they've been reversed  Was that Reserve Bank employees?  Well, Mr Chairman, I don't know that I have anything to contribute on the economic outlook I am not surprised at the projection As I view it, we have more or less established a governor on the economy with our monetary aggregate ambitions and the credit and interest rate implications that fall out And if we have a governor that limits the speed to 55 miles per hour for spending, well, we are not going to have more than 55 miles per hour spending The question of how much head wind there is in the form of inflation is something that we all argue I think wage costs, food costs, and energy costs are pretty intractable and we'll have as much or close to as much inflation as the staff projects But one could be more optimistic on that, as Bob is However, the fact of the matter is that if we get a little more housing, then we get a little less something else in the existing environment, assuming we hold to our assertions about monetary growth rates over the period  I do have a much stronger feeling about the shorter-run specification of policy I asked Steve where alternative C was because it seemed to me that alternative A was totally out of the ball park so one really needs to choose between alternative B, which [calls for only 3-1/2 percent M-1A growth], and an alternative C which is easier The reason I say that is that I just don't think that one can say to the economy at large--not the financial people or the monetarists but to the economy at large--that we are seeking, [as in alternative A], a 1-1/4 percent rate of growth in money supply over a 3-month period in which we expect to have some continuation of economic recovery That just isn't the kind of number that one seeks, and it's way lower than anything I've seen And 4 percent on M-1B is a very low rate, too, for the next three months To get us down more comfortably within the ranges, as alternative A would do, really implies in the short run a policy which wouldn't be understood and which could very likely result in a second downturn, or at least increase its probability I think it will occur anyhow, but that will increase its probability We faced a situation similar to this a year  -33-    10/21/80  ago We were running high in our target ranges In fact, it looked as if we weren't going to be within the target ranges So what we did was to specify, as Steve suggested at the end of his briefing [today] I think, that we would accept a rather moderate number or ""somewhat less"" And I think that's the way we ought to specify our alternatives this time in terms of the 3-month [specifications]  Going off from alternative B I find tolerable The notion of seeking a 4 percent rate of growth in M-1A or somewhat less, a 6 percent rate of growth in M-1B or somewhat less, and a 7-1/2 percent rate of growth in M2 or somewhat less I think we can take a little chance on M2 because, as Lyle pointed out, we have been getting quite a lot of [slowing] in that rate of growth through the summer and early fall I do think that we need to be even-handed about this and that we need to recognize that our mistakes always occur not because we are [slightly] off from modest numbers, but because we are way off from modest numbers And, therefore, I think the funds rate range should be raised to 9 to 15 percent, which is in keeping with Ernie's thought that we should center our range around where the rate is, and the midpoint of 9 to 15 would be 12 And I think we need to recognize the possibility that if we have enough demand, we'll have to move against it and the funds rate could indeed need to move up considerably because monetary growth is above [our specification] But I just can't accept the idea of saying to the public that we seek a monetary growth rate of 1 percent over the 3-month period  It's already high relative to ""A"" Remember, M-1A is what has all the reserves on it And we already have growth in October that looks to be above the number here So, I think it just means that the borrowing level will move up from $13 billion to a significantly higher number And the result will be that [the funds rate] will have to move up in its range I agree with the 15 percent upper limit for that range; the question will soon be before us of whether 15 percent is too restrictive and whether the discount rate will need to be increased another couple of points and so forth So it really biases [the outcome]--remember that we are going to be running a path against whatever aggregates we choose--to take ""A"" It means we are talking about a very tight policy consistent with a significant degree of recession and no recovery  In terms of quarterly averages, the year is almost over  I don't disagree with that  That $60 million figure you've been using, Paul, that's for one month?  Well, he means adjusted  It'll be high in the range One way to look at it is that we'd be in the upper half of both the M-1A and the M-1B adjusted [ranges]  Well, I think we've always done that  I can't understand what has happened to M-1A I wasn't aware that Larry, for example, had shifted from M-1A to M-1B until right now I can only conclude that it's because it's a higher number and that therefore he's really not a monetarist but a deflationist  -50-    10/21/80  [Unintelligible] M-1A  And M2 has been showing some life lately  Some people think we already have  I don't think that's technically true It depends on the profile of the months Now, if you're talking about a decline in the rate of increase so that we don't have that high of a quarterly average--  I would buy it reluctantly, too  The borrowings are set  The Board would have to discuss it at its meeting  It's strictly a live-with kind of thing  You wouldn't like to see a show of hands first?  Well, $13 billion [in borrowing] is above what it has been running  You want higher interest rates I see  Henry would argue that they really don't know what pain is yet "
1589,1980-11-18," So moved  I guess I don't understand the operating rules that we use for intervention any more, Scott I thought we intervened only in disorderly markets We have had a market that has been moving    11/18/80  up; it was not particularly disorderly You said we bought as many marks as we possibly could I didn't understand that to be what people did when they intervened And my impression is that we bought far more marks than the Germans did That is, we are doing the supporting of the mark, not the Germans And you gave as a reason for it that it helps hold down interest rates abroad, which I think is a very strange reason indeed because it seems to me that if we want to hold down interest rates, we ought to hold them down here not abroad So I just don't understand what is happening You also said that we were doing this to match the Treasury's [foreign currency] debt But we have matched the Treasury's debt We have gone $100 million over the Treasury's debt and you were still buying like mad early this week So I think it's time for a discussion of the terms on which we intervene and what our strategy is other than that we just buy as many marks as we can every time the dollar goes up  Well, we bought $250 million [worth of marks] or something like that on Monday How much did the Germans do?  If we do the buying?  Well, I don't know why that is    11/18/80  As I look at the experience of other countries over the last couple of years, Paul, I observe that the countries with the smallest inflation rate have been the ones with a rising currency There's some circularity in that, of course, but it is certainly true, other things equal, that a rising currency reduces the observed inflation rate for a country We have as a major objective of policy reducing inflation I should think, therefore, that we would like to have a rising currency  When we buy $250 million in a day, we certainly have prevented some rise in the dollar that day  The dollar will go down because inflation subsides Is that what you are saying? After all, inflation is the reason that interest rates are high  It is a factor affecting the reserves  Well, that was one comment that I was going to respond to One thing I disagree with on our policy here is that we are not buying government securities Instead, we are buying German marks, and that does have a market impact in the United States  Secondly, we are taking an exchange risk that I don't think is warranted for the central bank  They are going to do that anyhow, aren't they though?  But it is downward on the markets [unintelligible] interest rate Wouldn't the same thing apply in the case of marks? [More holders will] be able to sell out of marks?    11/18/80  Except, Paul, they wouldn't have any--  Well, you think it is weak  You cannot foresee the future, Tony  That is a very reasonable possibility, isn't it?  Well, certainly, if one assumes that 180 is the right rate for the mark, we ought to buy all we can at more than 180 because when--    11/18/80  I don't know  To avoid disorderly conditions?  I believe those are the terms of the directive of the Committee  Of course, this is run by a steering committee of the FOMC, [the Foreign Currency Subcommittee] But that subcommittee has to observe the rules that the Committee has laid down I just think the subcommittee ought to read those rules and decide whether it is authorizing transactions in keeping with them or not And I would like to have a review of the subject  People in the market would do their own seasonals  A Sindlinger seasonal and so forth  Well, we would have to get successive estimates of the month we are in based on weekly information, using the monthly seasonal adjustment factors I think it could be done But I don't think it would be constructive to have ten different seasonals of the weekly numbers floating out there in market; that in itself would be a source of great confusion  The problem of [using just] that day is that it might be high and it might be low Then it would be like--  It's the sample that is used to estimate the universe, Jerry  I would think we'd adjust our targets in the light of it  There are other questions involved, too There always were [unintelligible] questions about justifying the floating quarterly base and they certainly would be stronger if we were targeting on a floating annual base  Tighter in terms of the money supply?  We seem to be all over the lot today I don't think it's so much that the situation is uncertain, Emmett In my view, it has been uncertain for some time Now I find it threatening That's the tone; my feelings echo Willis Winn's, only I haven't been to the Middle East It seems to me that the odds are now getting to be rather high that there's going to be an oil price increase of size I don't know that it will be 50 percent, but I wouldn't be surprised at a $10 a barrel increase And that's going to have a considerable impact on inflation I must say my view has always been that when an external event like this occurs it's not the right response to cut money growth targets because no other price is going to give If we cut money growth targets, all it does is compound the effect of the oil price rise on real activity by forcing it lower than it otherwise would be And activity would already tend to go lower because of the oil price rise Nevertheless, it will be adding to the inflation numbers and so will food prices Thus, it occurs to me that what we might get is considerable strength in the demand for money associated with a nominal GNP that holds up [but incorporates] a decline in real activity and an acceleration in inflation, which could keep a lot of pressure on the money numbers In that kind of environment, I think interest rates could go to 25 percent And that's something that we have to be thinking about--what it means for the economy to have rates above 20 percent--because that may occur  The second thing that troubles me is that we will be having fiscal restraint in the immediate future; that is, there's a tax increase in six weeks On the other hand, the new Administration promises tax reductions, a series of them, which would certainly add to pressures in markets over that period of time as the government deficit is increased I also agree that defense spending is going up and is going to go up sharply The new orders figures already show it The whole thrust of current thinking is that we will have to have a larger defense establishment--and I would almost say ""much larger"" defense establishment the way the talk is going So without a war, which is possible, we have all these things working against the [successful] execution of policy  I am very nervous about limiting the [governing factor]--that is, the perceived rate of growth that will be appropriate in monetary aggregates--by interest rate constraints because if we do that, we may lose sight of what is really happening But I guess I am prepared to limit the governing factor of monetary expansion because of these uncertainties I rather agree that with prospects for increases in defense, taxes, and oil prices we don't want rates to go down significantly because we're going to have an almost semi-war economy in the period to come I also think interest rates are getting pretty  -32-    11/18/80  high We are shutting off the building industry We have the thrifts back into a lot of trouble That 6-month bill rate means that they'll be paying over 14 percent for money this week, and they can't afford over 14 percent Neither can a lot of small banks So we're beginning to threaten the institutional structures of the economy again, as we did early this year  So I feel that we ought to constrain interest rate movements, at least for a time, Paul I have a fairly wide view of that, though My funds rate range would be 13 to 17 percent, centered on 15 percent which is where we are now I know it's nice to say that we have a posture that we don't want monetary growth to go up and, therefore, regardless of what is happening, we're going to hold the target right where it was But it's very unrealistic to do that If we take alternative B--assuming these November numbers are still more or less holding, though I don't know what that $700 million increase means for the projected number for November--it means that to hit our target, we have to have a 5-1/2 percent rate of decline in the money supply in December A 5-1/2 percent drop is a rapid rate of decline in the money supply If we want to go to alternative C the way Larry does, and [the projection for] November is right, we have to have a 9 percent rate of decrease That would be the second largest rate of decrease we've ever seen in the money supply in the month of December And I just don't think it's responsible to have a target that seems to want such declines to occur They might occur, but to want them to occur seems to me inappropriate  Therefore, I think we are forced to alternative A as the target for the 2-month pattern, which is an M-1A of 2 percent, an M-1B of 4-1/2 percent and an M2 of 7-3/4 percent Well, the latter could be 7-1/2 percent; we wouldn't have to have the quarter So that's what I would recommend Alternatively, we can even specify it in terms of the quarterly growth rates, which I believe the draft directive suggests Those are not high numbers 4-1/2, 6-1/4, and 8-1/4 percent I'd specify it in those terms and take a 13 to 17 percent funds rate range and be prepared to see those aggregates come in markedly lower than the target if indeed that is what develops But I am beginning to doubt that that will develop in the period immediately to come On borrowings, I don't know It's a funny thing and I hate to mess with it I think we ought to have them right about where they are because it's awfully hard to assess what our [rate increases] last Friday will do to tensions in that borrowing market, with the 2 point surcharge So I would take a neutral stance and begin where we are on borrowing and see how things develop as the period goes on  Well, I know But we had--  That's what I mean It came in high for the week, but we thought we were on a target of $16 billion, and that's where I would [start] it If the aggregates are strong, it will go up from there If they are weak, it will stay about there That's what I would do--not have an even-handed monetary target, but aim to hit  -33-    11/18/80  those numbers that I mentioned and if growth of the aggregates falls short, let the shortfall occur  That's consistent, though, with having 13 to 17 percent and then providing, as we've done previously, for consultation of the Committee if the 17 percent proves not to be reasonable  Yes The directive has that structure I wasn't criticizing [your suggestion]; I was just making a point that what you said is consistent with choosing 13 to 17 percent and emphasizing the possible need for consultation, which also goes with what Bill said, I think  They couldn't have a range--  Abstracting from that  Well, $16 billion is right in between  We could say ""in the early months of next year,"" or something like that  I do I still think it's the most important  Sure, because I can't read M-1B with all those NOW accounts being created  We could say ""A"" is what we project and ""A"" would be what we plot It means essentially zero for the rest of the year And we'd accept any shortfall; but if it rose up above that, we would react strongly against it  That's right And that's a real possibility  It might bring down the funds rate a little  We've had this discussion  That is, we would end up not adjusting the nonborrowed reserve path  Yes, we might begin to get some tightening in the market  Well, what do you want to do?  Well, I couldn't vote for ""B"" as it stands I would vote for ""B"" as you suggested it--that is, if we don't really mean the specs of ""B""  How many would accept it?  That won't hurt We've already been there  It's only four weeks away "
1611,1980-11-26," I'll go along with 18 I guess I do it less hesitantly than the others have suggested because I really don't know what is happening in the economy I don't know why bank credit demand  -4-    11/26/80  is so very strong and why we have repeatedly been unable to predict the level of rates that would be consistent with the growth in aggregates that we wish So, I would say that we should certainly go to 18 percent, and I would be prepared to go further if in fact Lyle isn't right and the performance of the numbers does not show some improvement "
1630,1980-12-05," That's above, I think  We could close a few banks  This is Chuck Partee Paul, one question I would have is about the way you put it You put it rather strictly that the Manager would go about his reserve-supplying activities along the path and see what was needed That to me almost means that there is no cap at all on the funds rate for this next week And since I have a sense of the market being in a crisis atmosphere, I have a little concern about the possibility that, in fact, the rate might go very high in this next week  I guess I share your feeling that the aggregates are in the process of coming under control Indeed, I think we are now in the range where the great danger is that we will overshoot quite a bit Therefore, since I think the process is already under way of giving us the numbers we want, I would like to avoid any sense of true crisis in the market So, I will buy your proposal, but I would buy it with the reservation that we don't mean by it that we would let the rate just escalate in these next few days to anything it wished to do  No, I agree I think there may be a very real chance that we can keep it within the 18 percent limit after a couple of days--[it seems to be] settling down--but I am not sure of it  But we do have a range, Dave, with the bottom being what--14 percent?  Greater damage [Unintelligible] as a result of it, whether or not it was merely an announcement effect that offset some of these concerns, or whether or not the realization was that unless other action was taken we would, indeed, increase the interest rate levels  It's going to catch up  I think we need to have a vote, Murray, because we had a vote on raising the limit a week ago or whenever it was So to accept [exceeding] that limit, since that limit was established by vote, I think does require a vote  Probably Thursday  I think you would need 20 percent, Henry  I mean to be logically consistent  M-1B plus savings accounts  So we put a [unintelligible] for that "
1650,1980-12-12," Chuck Partee That's fine with me  SPEAKER(?  It's fine with me, too  How much of an increase do you have now?  How much price?  What's the nominal?  SPEAKER(?) It must be about 17 percent because they had borrowed--  18 percent nominal?  Well that explains quite a bit "
1670,1980-12-18," And these appear in our assets, do they?  These are our assets But we have a forward contract?  We get the yield on them?  At the German rate rather than the US rate?  So we lose what--maybe 6 percent per annum on every one of those we have?  I certainly wish I could find a commercial bank that would let me warehouse like that!    12/18-19/80  But they can't, Tony said  And this is a well-known device that the Congress knows about?  I mean that we're not hiding anything There is no subterfuge involved here  That's the US total column, right?  And to cover the swap, I take it  I just wanted to say that I agree with John Balles about the effect, but I get there in a different way I think intervention does add to the demand for money domestically because for any given level of economic activity when we intervene to keep the rate from going up, we add to the domestic rate of inflation Therefore, there's more nominal GNP relative to real GNP than would otherwise be the case We either have a larger demand for money or higher interest rates, one of the two The result of an intervention on the up side is either to raise interest rates or inflation, or both, in the United States And I think we ought to realize that that's one of the costs Surprisingly enough, I agree with Tony and Henry to a degree, mercantilistic as their arguments are I'm also a mercantilist and I wouldn't like to see our manufacturers excluded from world markets the way Britain's are being excluded when the pound gets to five dollars When [the dollar] gets to a really high level, we certainly ought to do something about it I also agree that we probably need a small amount of [foreign currency reserves] We can't sell our gold holdings very readily; that's a very good point So, although we have $150 billion in [gold] reserves, it's not available  -16-    12/18-19/80  to us because we can't readily sell the gold because of public opinion and so forth I do not like the idea of accumulating all these marks, as I think you must know Number one, I don't know what the right exchange rate is There's always the presumption that our exchange rate somehow has gotten very high We have a staff forecast in the Greenbook this time that says the exchange rate will rise over the next two years That doesn't suggest that the rate is all that high when our own professional staff expects a substantial appreciation over the next two years More than that, though, I'm very concerned about a lack of diversification We've put all [our foreign currency reserves] in marks What if something terrible happens to Germany? We have this big stake So it seems to me that if we were to accumulate--  Well, you are talking about $4 billion That means--  Yes  Yes I have always felt comfortable because we were covered by a Treasury exposure Now I find there's no Treasury exposure and we are no longer covered But my point is--  Well, I didn't really want to comment on that [unintelligible] I don't think it's proper to have that drawing there, which I didn't realize we couldn't pay back  My point is simply that I wouldn't like to see us get a big stake If we want to accumulate something that we can buy and sell in foreign exchange markets without the difficulty of dealing in gold, why in the world don't we buy SDRs, not marks?  Aren't they always sellable?  I would have thought they would be rather quickly exchangeable  Well, I guess there is no source of generalized purchasing power, then?  You are talking about a market that doesn't exist now  Well, since I don't know much about SDRs, I would just make a few comments One, there is a cost The cost is more inflation in the United States, which we are committed to resisting, I thought And we don't know how far these exchange rates are going to drift and how much they reflect differences in competitive shifts, structural shifts in these economies Number two, I don't like to see a concentration of risk because I have confidence in no country Perhaps, that's--  Absolutely none  Well, we owe it to ourselves--  Even we were diversifying  You don't want to make it $8 billion?  It's related to the President's Economic Report isn't it? And that would be the old Administration  SPEAKER(?) I think it will become irrelevant before we've started  It's crystal clear  [Meeting recessed]    12/18-19/80  December 19, 1980--Morning Session  Because M-1A and M-1B are not good, we are going to throw out M2?  But it does blend M-1A and M-1B  That's right  People won't demand as many federal funds  Of the experience in California or the whole country?  That seems different from the figures we have  Savings and loans, he said  That's right  I've practically forgotten what I was going to say!  Let me make two points One is important-- perhaps old hat, but important And that is that we all ought to recognize that in our discussions around this table in the last couple of years we have greatly shifted [our views about] what we expect monetary policy to do Traditionally, what we want to do is to keep pressure off markets so as not to have excessive demand We were discussing as recently as a couple of years ago questions of what constituted excessive demand and what was full employment I well remember that John Balles had a rather elaborate analysis of full employment in terms of utilization rates for industry and employment and unemployment numbers And it seems to me now we have gone far, far away from that We no longer care what employment is so long as it's plenty low We now say that in addition to seeing to it that monetary policy doesn't lead to a situation in which demand presses against inflation, we are going to work to reduce inflation through monetary policy, [which] increases some costs in the economy That has to be the implication of our policy In that context, I think we need to have a view of how weak an economy we are prepared to see over this one or two or three-year period that we are talking about, as we look at the longer-run outlook We have a pretty good idea at the extreme of what the economy may be like, because we have an example in Britain There is a lot of similarity There's a lot of similarity in the posture of the new Administration and the posture of the Thatcher government when it came in And there may be a lot of similarity in terms of the budgetary results between the two And yet [see what] it has produced I think a question that we really ought to discuss seriously is how deep can we expect and how deep are we prepared to see a recession go I read in the paper this morning that a good many of the English pubs are in danger of closing because of lack of business  I was trying to think of a counterpart, Fred, for the United States Pubs aren't so important here And I decided that it was professional sports So maybe we'll be in the same position the British are when professional sports teams go out of business I say that not too lightly because I think it is an area where people get a sense of inflation in excess with the multi-million dollar contracts  As far as I'm concerned, we really ought not to plan a policy that produces less than zero growth I really don't want to follow the British [model] over a period of time And zero growth, I'm afraid, is probably associated with a pretty fair sized expansion in  -53-    12/18-19/80  the monetary aggregates We have this cosmetic, psychological problem with the aggregates, and I don't know how we can get out of the box I fully agree with Lyle that there is a great deal of uncertainty here and to have an equivalent range now means we have to go from -4 to +4 percent or something like that And as a matter of fact, I agree with Bill that there is going to be a very big competitive situation in the market for NOW accounts and that we might well miss on the other side  In thinking about all that, first, I wouldn't want to make up for the overshoots in the aggregates If we have to state this properly, perhaps the way Emmett has done it is the right way To state that last year the aggregates were a little strong in real terms, abstracting from this NOW account problem, and we certainly wouldn't want them to be any stronger than that; we would like to see a lower rate That would be one reasonable way of addressing that problem Or, we could--after all there's no particular importance to the midpoint of the ranges--extend the ranges We are not so far above the top end of the ranges and we could say that we have been at the top end of the ranges and, therefore, to the extent we can get [monetary growth] down to fall more within the ranges, we would do that That's a possibility, too, Paul; that might be looked at  This is a preliminary discussion, so I would suggest that as the staff focuses on this over the next month they take a careful look at total reserves I believe there may be some averaging advantage in total reserves After all, a good many of these NOW accounts are going to come from passbook savings, which has a 3 percent reserve requirement They are going to go into a 12 percent reserve requirement But some amounts are going to be coming out of demand deposits where the effective requirement has been higher than 12 percent, I think In any event, somebody ought to take a look to see whether the possible range of variation would be somewhat narrower by using growth rates on total reserves as an approximate target for policy It also associates well with what we say our operating procedure is, so it has that advantage The disadvantage is that it doesn't mean a damn thing to anybody except those 200 economists that Henry mentioned We ought to have a real market implication somehow that comes from this, assuming that we can't do anything more than speak in rather subjective terms about the traditional monetary aggregates I'm wondering whether we ought to take another look at what we could postulate in terms of a financial number that we would look at in judging the reserve growth along our target path, and whether it could be credit Bank credit happens to have been within the range during 1980 And maybe bank credit expanded to include the other institutions, so-called institutional credit, is a variable for which we could give a quantitative notion of what we think would be appropriate and related to our objectives  It is pretty much the same as M3 The reason I wouldn't go for M3 is that people would say we are just moving to another monetary aggregate and one that no one has ever paid any attention to I think if we talk about credit flows and limiting credit flows to a reasonable range, we would be talking about something that people could understand I don't mean that we wouldn't say something subjectively about narrow money and broader money But when it comes down to it, this is quite within the scope of the  -54-    12/18-19/80  Humphrey-Hawkins Act, which as you remember refers to the targeted rates of increase in ""monetary and credit aggregates"" So it is quite possible to do it and still be legal in connection with Humphrey- Hawkins That is one possible variant I would suggest To emphasize total institutional credit growth, which will be understandable to people generally and to associate [that with the aggregates] conceptually, as a way of approaching [policy] without following slavishly the idea of holding to the midpoints of the 1980 ranges Those were established really a year and half ago now, and I think that [approach] would be a mistake  From the midpoint, yes  Although M1 was very good  The rumor was heard in the foreign exchange market that the decline would be on the order on $10 to $15 billion It's a wild rumor; it's not necessarily something with any substance  It's a little tough, I know, Paul It says a ""modest reduction"" A modest reduction could very well be 16 percent on the funds rate It seems to me that it has to be a little more straightforward than you have it  I could accept 15 to 20 percent  No, 21 percent is too high for me  In your first case, Henry, if the economy remains strong, the money supply will be above these numbers that are mentioned And, therefore, it will immediately bring to the fore a telephone conference meeting to raise the funds rate So you needn't put the limit up to 22 percent You can just depend on that occurring if the economy is strong  I don't think we ought to face that today  This says reserves along a path consistent with growth of 4-1/4 percent in M-1A and 4-3/4 percent in M-1B I think that does allow some room for the kind of thing you are talking about; that is a bigger M-1B number because the M-1A number will be smaller As far as reserves are concerned, it allows us some room I just don't think we are prepared to decide what these numbers ought to be for the range of aggregates today We've just had a long, long discussion of it and we are all over the lot  I should say on this word change, Larry, that I'd change the 16 to 15 percent if the Chairman agreed  It's a very difficult thing to deal with A weekly average is what we have referred to in the past  Yes, that helps a lot Your point is very good  Yes, there is still some [lag]; this will be out in the market for--  We need to have a show of hands or something  We either have to depart from that base or give up M2 and not state [a number for] it  [M2] doesn't make much difference in the path  Then your reserve path wouldn't change  But if the aggregates are weak, the borrowing figure will drift down from that and eventually the funds rate would come down  SPEAKER(?) You are going to starve me to death if you keep [talking]!  Probably  Yes, we'll talk about it  I do believe that the aggregates would have to be pretty weak for the funds rate to get down in the low end of the range we are talking about And we would probably want to have a telephone conference call to talk about what is creating the weak aggregates in any event  Yes, it certainly hasn't  I agree with Nancy I think we've had more difficulty getting it reduced than getting it raised  Yes  [Maybe it should say] ""days""--taken over a period of days  Over a period of time could mean a year  SPEAKER(?) Right, the whole [intermeeting] period  We don't say how many days It could be 30 days  A billion and a half dollars  I wish we knew  It's all right with me "
1697,1981-02-02," Four or five years you said?  [Unintelligible]  I just wanted to ask a question, a point of clarification, about this business of departures from path I think we run into semantic difficulties because some people think of the path as a rate of increase in an aggregate and other people think of it as observations of the desired level over time I think it's awfully important that we all understand how the experiment was done Now, when Jerry introduced a departure from path--he's here now--that was, say, the correction in the second quarter or the third quarter or whatever his periodicity was, was the correction such that he reduced the growth rate as much below path as it had been above path before? What was done?  So that in some sense for a longer period the average amount of money was the same as it otherwise--  In the first case, you'd have a rather lasting effect on the GNP  -14-    2/2-3/81  So there could be some residual GNP effects in what our current path structure is?  We, of course, had more borrowing  Well, that's a static analysis, Paul I agree with you; it's absolutely true arithmetically But I think what happens is that you set into process dynamics that in fact [produce] required reserves that can do that  But my point is that if in period 2 we raise the discount rate in order to try to close the spread, we can get a higher funds rate pretty [quickly] A higher funds rate will bring about--  And then you'll have a narrowing in the spread, you see, in subsequent periods  [Unintelligible] savings accounts  And that will wear down over time  Well, we haven't been on it that long  Well, I don't know!  That was a good study; nobody ever did anything with it  We had a lot more hedging, too, didn't we, Peter? Didn't we see an increase in the participation in the futures markets by dealers over the last year and a half?  -28-    2/2-3/81  I think the rate swings--it was such a big [interest rate] cycle--must have had quite an influence on behavior in real markets  Inelastic did you say?  Elastic, yes  On variability, day-to-day and week-to-week  In real terms  -33-    2/2-3/81  I would stay with our present arrangement I come from where Lyle comes from, really I would like to be able to control the mechanism by specifying the funds rate And I think we could; but the trouble is we won't We won't because we won't change the funds rate as much as it ought to be changed There is an interesting piece of work done by Peter Tinsley which says in effect, if I understand it correctly, that in getting toward our targets if we change the funds rate 3 percentage points at the beginning of the period, we get about as much result as changing it 6 percent over the whole period Well, that's fine, except who today is going to say ""We are running a little low on the aggregates so let's drop the funds rate 3 points today"" Nobody will ever say that And that's the whole trouble with it; we just don't move it enough If it weren't for that, I would prefer the funds rate because there is a fuzziness to this other approach in the multiplier and in the changes of the nonborrowed targets and so forth that bothers me Of necessity we have to put more of this onto the staff than it is good for this body as a policymaking body to do; and it's because of the fuzziness and the intricacy of the arrangements we have But I would stay with it because I don't think there's anything better  As I believe Steve suggested in the summary report, given our experience of the last year, I would opt to be freer to change the nonborrowed path in order to offset what is happening in borrowed reserves more than we have done That's because I rather agree with Larry that people just can't quite understand why the aggregates were so much more volatile in the year after we changed to this experiment that was to stabilize them than they were in the year before I think that is a practical problem we have and, indeed, it probably has contributed to some of the economic instability I wouldn't agree with Henry who seems to say let's keep interest rates high or with others who say let's keep them low I wouldn't talk about an interest rate target in a longer-run sense, because what we do then is just substitute our own predilection for what the market is trying to tell us I think that in a longer-range sense we have to have [some] volatility in interest rates; they've got to go high and they've got to go low, and they have to do it in response to changes that we see developing in the economy and in the performance of the aggregates And when we are all done with it one might say--I'm sure most people around this table would say--it's too bad rates dropped that far last summer But last summer we didn't know what we now know And that's always the difficulty Some might say it's too bad that they have gone as high as they have now But we don't know Maybe it's just right that they have gone as high as they are now So, I would say that we should try to be objective and not substitute our judgmental predilections as to what the statistics are telling us  Yes, you overshoot; that's the trouble  It's tantamount to getting back to setting the funds rate  And the gap has been widest in the last eight weeks, John, when we've had shortfalls in the aggregates  May I make a comment, Paul, just on this question? I agree with the idea that we need to adjust the nonborrowed [path] It may be that it's not so much the size of the initial adjustment that we make in response to an overshoot, particularly, or perhaps an undershoot, but rather that there ought to be some concept of scheduling more and more adjustments as the duration [of the miss] extends That is, you might start with adjusting the path for half [of the deviation], but then if it persists for a second week you might take another bite out of it and in the third week you might take still another bite It's a way to get a time factor into it Now, we'd have to fool a lot with the numbers to figure out what kind of decision rule we might have, but that seems to me a possible way to go that I'd like to see explored In any event, when we do this, the chances are that borrowing is going to be bigger than it was before because there will be some lag time before the market begins to adjust; so as we do this, we'll have more borrowings I agree with you that we have to have a spread; and I agree with Nancy that we've certainly seen, when conditions were tight at least, that every time we changed the discount rate the spread re- established itself by the funds rate going up as much [as the discount rate] and sometimes a little more That does create the perception of subsidizing the [borrowing] institutions, and I guess there's no way of avoiding that level of borrowing and that differential in rates So the question really ought to be Who ought to get the subsidy? I guess if I were a thrift, I would say that I have never been permitted to get the subsidy; only the member banks have My observation is that it's the big member banks that get it and, therefore, I think that leads one to some kind of rationing system that gives the public perception of a high rate out there for somebody or other And that does make it possible to spread the subsidy around Perhaps the price of that will be a bigger differential than now exists because of the inefficiency of the market in having smaller institutions see their opportunity So, I like Tony's suggestion or some variant of Tony's suggestion as a way of spreading the subsidy around  Well, take a look at January and let's find [out in] February and we'll see who has been borrowing and how many pay the surcharge  True  That doesn't exactly work out that--  Well, Bill, when I said rationing, I didn't necessarily mean a rate control system that would be based on administration I think we can ration by having a more elaborate price schedule The price schedule might be associated with duration and there might be more than just one surcharge There might be rules of the game We could do what Fred suggests, except that would mean technically that the institution whose surplus is dropping to zero will pay the highest amount of borrowing so that--  But at any rate, we could have a price schedule It doesn't have to be--  By the way, if they send bank A in to borrow, how do they get those reserves distributed around their holding company system?  So, they may do it through the loan portfolio If they do it by interbank lending, [the Reserve Bank] is supposed to tell them they have violated our rules  We might as well accept it  But, Tony, if we're going to hold to the idea of a basic discount rate of, say, around 13 percent [as it was] through the whole fall and the CD rate runs up to 21 percent, as it did, and we tie the extended rate to 21 percent, we're not going to be able to get away with that When the institution--say, one of your savings banks in New York--borrows because it is in such difficult circumstances and we say we will lend to them at one point under the CD rate and that's 20 percent and the basic discount rate out there is 13 percent, they're going to cry bloody murder  If we have some way of showing them that some frequent borrowers are paying 20 percent also--  Or have it scheduled  -48-    2/2-3/81  The lunch is here?  Well, we could take care of that, though We could have in the directive a standard phrase that says the Manager will inform the Chairman if it appears that the cumulative movement in federal funds since the time of the meeting is likely to exceed 300 basis points, at which time the Chairman will decide whether or not to call a meeting That way we would never have a stated band that people would look at What we would have is a plus or minus 300 basis points from where the funds rate started So maybe we could improve our public posture  Then we'd have to say 200 basis points That would be something to do  We simply avoid saying what the range will be  We'd have to put it in the center  And then we could change the 300 to a different number if we wanted  I have in mind having a standard of 300 basis points But in an exceptional case, such as Nancy referred to when rates are at a very high level, we might want to constrain them  My basic position is that I think we ought to widen the range  The fed funds rate is a constraint I certainly approve of your saying this in public, but I think we need to recognize that it's a constraint  Yes, in that sense it has been a constraint, because we knew that a rapid adjustment in nonborrowed reserve paths would affect the funds rate  Yes it's minor; I think there's a little change in emphasis  How about 100 percent reserves?  What we get is a quicker change in interest rates and, therefore, it doesn't have to be as large It's a special case of the general case that has been well postulated in [unintelligible]  We've just been talking about that  In due course  Isn't somebody going to be undecided?  Yes, in principle  But, certainly, the carry-forward and carry-back would have to be a part of all that  Yes  Yes, absolutely We'd have to weigh the pinch- points I'm not arguing that we would do so much carry-forward  But it would do away with the whole effect  But we are going to have to study the question to see whether they are pinch-points  We will have to publish a [proposed] regulation  I think the Committee has had some experience with this  I wouldn't want to do anything too shocking about this, Frank, until I understood more about the British experience They have had something like a 22 percent increase in M3, about twice their guideline But M1 rose 6 percent last year, which is much more consistent with what was happening in the economy  Yes But it's very possible that there might be a tendency for people to move out of long markets and into short markets for both borrowing and holding financial assets It would have the effect, within the context of a particular increase in total credit, of being more in the form of M3 It could be the corset or anything else that would occur And that would be totally uncontrollable by us I think the only way we could control it, as Steve says, is by reducing the growth of narrow money to the point that we got interest rates high enough to have to turn them off to short markets as well  That's right [Unintelligible] we did in that committee you'll remember And there was no improvement in controllability by moving from M1 to M2  Oh, a year or two years ago maybe  I understood Frank to say he wants to target on M2 or M3  The question has to do with the lags The question is What is the lag structure from a change in monetary policy to the effect on observed money supply? I think that's what Jerry is interested in  My [memory] is that it could be four, but maybe a little more vigorously--  How fast do they do that?  Henry, the last time we published, we had a directive that specified a funds rate range of 15 to 20 percent, I think And when we did that, I've forgotten just exactly where the actual funds rate was but it was right close to 20 percent  Now, what do you suppose would have been the effect (a) on Eric Heineman and (b) on the market if that afternoon we had published in the Committee's directive a funds rate range that has 5 points of downward room in it but no upward room at all? I think you'd get the same story from Heineman in spades And I think the market would have assumed--I'd say it's like shooting fish in a barrel--that the funds rate wouldn't go over 20 percent and it could only go down That would have had an effect on all the variables Whether it would have been good or bad, I don't know But publication of that particular directive would have had an effect  I just think there are times--I've seen them periodically--when we want to put a constraint on [interest rate movements] And if we had to announce that constraint right away, I think it would hurt  How could that be?  Yes, but you do have to have two-way markets Without differences of opinion, you will have no markets I think that's what Tony was referring to  Yes, I think that makes a big difference To tell with no constraint on federal funds rates--  There would be a delay, though  Let's do away with it since it's no good  How about successive estimates of the monthly seasonally adjusted numbers?  Well, not for reporting under Humphrey-Hawkins You certainly don't want to be all that realistic, do you?  Really?  Is that all?  The Minneapolis Bank is--  You don't think they'll project an $80 billion deficit?  It's $81 billion  A safe thing to work on, Bob, [in] the deficit is the [debt] servicing [cost] That could be cut  Yes  What is that nominal GNP?  You get this problem--  Steve, the actual growth figures were 5 and 7-1/4 percent last year Those are the only ones the public has available?  Which is counted as other checking  Well, the averaging gives a nice low figure That's all one can say  We are going to have to move M2 up, Paul  I just can't agree with that  112-    2/2-3/81  May I ask Jim a question about this? The whole business is just so unclear to me If President Black's recommendation were accepted by the Committee, would that be a tighter monetary growth target than you assumed in the Greenbook? He's opting for the 1 point [reduction]--that is, alternative II, with M2 and M3 the way they are specified here Would that be tighter than your assumption in the Greenbook?  So you keyed in on alternative I, in effect Is that right?  But those shifts wouldn't do much to M2, would they?  Oh, I see  I'm reminded that many years ago, after a difficult staff presentation, Bill Martin sometimes would say to the Committee You better watch out or you may catch statisticitis! I'd say we've caught it We have it in spades today I really don't know how it will all work out I don't want to direct myself to the presentational question because we're all over the lot and I really think what to do is your choice, Paul I do think we ought to keep in mind two points One is that we have said, and it will be expected, that we want to make some further progress in reducing growth in the monetary aggregates Now, if you look at our progress, it hasn't been very rapid And I see no great reason to expect that it will be rapid this year either So, to follow up on our promise, I think what we ought to provide is minimal progress in reducing our expected growth rates  The second point that I think is terribly important is one that Ed Boehne made And that is that we are going to be judged by how we're doing relative to the targets that we've put out As the year goes on, there will be more and more emphasis on how we're doing and less and less emphasis on how we picked the targets in the first place So, I'm inclined to go pretty much with Fred Schultz I think we ought to declare that in the interest of making further progress we are going to reduce the growth ranges 1/2 point Then we would have to say that there are lots of adjustments because of all these complications that are occurring, so we are going to have to tell you what a 1/2 point is And the 1/2 point reduction ought to be restricted to the M-1A and M-1B categories Jerry's idea, or I guess it was Bob's, of averaging the two to give a sense that we haven't  -125-    2/2-3/81  really given away the ballgame on this is probably a useful concept to employ On M2 and M3, I really do think we have to raise our ranges some We can't go along with 1/2 point reductions there The reason is simply that the relationship between the narrow aggregate and the broader aggregates is going to be determined by interest rate relationships among other things and there will be higher interest rates than ever were contemplated when we first specified this relationship a year ago I would go halfway and make it 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent on M2 and 7 to 10 percent on M3 And I agree with Jerry I don't see any reason to risk being low on bank credit; nobody pays that much attention to it So, I'd make that 7 to 10 percent also because it's reasonable to think that it might be about the same as M3, which is the broadest of the institutional aggregates we have But the main point is that we ought to declare that we are reducing our objectives And we ought to do it in a way that gives us maximum opportunity not to go outside the ranges as the year goes on  Yes Well, who was that guy who said we ought to back the troop ships into Vietnam and declare we won, and leave?  So, it's really close to 9 percent  Yes, it doesn't reduce the lower end  Maybe you could go into the second stage with a shaded area added  Do you want a show of hands or something?  The thing is that we were over [our M2 range by] quite a bit this past year--by 08 percentage point if the figure is right--and we're going to be over this year because, after all, we do have within that aggregate two pretty dynamic competitive instruments the money market funds and the money market certificates And the MMCs have some potential for further development as a market tool I  -135-    2/2-3/81  might also say that we're in the hands of the DIDC because it could change rate relationships Then who knows what might occur? I rather agree with you that it may not be worthwhile to confuse things On the other hand, I think this is the one time when we can say ""Look, we have the relationships wrong between these aggregates growth rates; we had them wrong last year We can't set each growth rate independently because they have complicated relationships with each other Recognizing that and recognizing the close correspondence between M2 and GNP, and seeing that people are thinking in terms of a 9-1/2 or 10 percent increase in nominal GNP this year, we think we better have a range that would encompass what might occur That's why we have a higher range"" But I'm sympathetic with your point of view that a 1/2 point difference isn't much  No, because we've already had the rest of it, Henry You assumed in your discussion that we properly specified it a year [ago] and there's no reason to think we properly specified it We know it has a very close velocity correspondence to nominal GNP, and it tracked it pretty well last year It will track it again pretty well this year  By 02  Well, I think 5 to 10 percent is too wide Maybe we can take 6 to 10 percent, but 5 points is an awfully wide margin And we don't really expect to be below 6 percent, not with the possible accounts in that [aggregate]  It won't reduce M2  Yes, it will raise M-1B  Yes, he said half or more will be saved  -138-    2/2-3/81  It has one chance in 100 of being true  Are they going to save anything?  Well, if you think there's a really big advantage--I don't think there is--I'm prepared to vote for 6 to 9 percent and assume we'll exceed it  Equally likely  At this time of high inflation  Let me be a little picky about this We could have 6 to 9 percent now and then, assuming the tax cut takes effect about midyear--and as a matter of fact the staff has a higher personal saving rate for the second half than for the first half--we could then say that because we have had the tax cut we want to make a little allowance for that and we're going to raise the M2 range when we look at it in July It might be--  Because we're surely not going to be cutting narrow money  It's really better I'd like--  How about leaving M3 at 9-1/2 percent? Have M2 and M3 the same at 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 or 7 and 10 percent, but leave them the same on the grounds that we just don't know how they--  They can certainly try unless there is a set of questions about the solvency of the insurance corporations  No, Nancy means It went up 98 percent last year, so why will it go up only 88 percent this year?  You would prefer a higher upper limit for M2?  Well, it seems hard to resist it when the rate is 215 and I didn't vote against it when it was 190 I didn't like it at 190, but I really do think we are going to be a product of a vicious circle here, too, if we don't watch out  ""We"" because we will find that the rate just won't go back down  We have $300 million leeway, is that right?  So what we're really talking about is about a half billion dollars in operating leeway  I think ""C"" would make a difference I don't see much difference between ""A"" and ""B,"" but ""C"" would imply significantly higher interest rates in the short run  Why is it, Steve, that the aggregate targets are so [disparate]? Ordinarily when we look at alternatives ""A,"" ""B,"" and ""C,"" we see something close to an equal distance between them And in    2/2-3/81  this case the difference between ""B"" and ""C"" seems extraordinary, particularly in view of the interest rate ranges  Oh, I see  I think I'd go for ""B"" just as it is  Well, I don't really have any way of judging that, Fred After all, we are going to be providing reserves on a schedule for the market It seems pretty close to an even position right now; that is, we have a hint that there may be a decline but we don't have much evidence It could be reversed and in the meantime prices are going to go up faster, so nominal GNP could be pretty strong I think there's about as much chance that the aggregates will come in stronger than our path as that they will come in weaker, so essentially it would be a fairly neutral option With the funds rate at 17-1/2 percent now, one could argue for 15 to 20 percent, as Ed did I wouldn't constrain it, though, with a telephone call because we're only talking about a 2-1/2 percentage point move one way or the other from where we now are  Because of the profile  That rule of one-third [of the divergence] a month for three months, which we did discuss at some length yesterday, is a very reasonable point, Roger What would that mean in terms of getting back, Steve? Have you figured it out? You'd have to take a  -157-    2/2-3/81  little off February and March, I presume, on alternative B On alternative A you'd have to take a little off because ""A"" gets us back to the midpoint, right?  We wouldn't want to think of that as a regular [procedure], though  They are December-to-March, for example, but not quarterly averages  5 to 6 percent for what?  Both of them?  Oh, I see  What's the borrowing figure with ""A""?  It's $1-1/4 billion for ""A"" and $1-1/2 billion for ""B""  -164-    2/2-3/81  We adjust the total reserves That is, if borrowing goes high, we cut nonborrowed in order to keep the total--  That's what he means  There's also a 10 percent--  Was it $13 billion last week, did you say?  Oh, it was moving up again That's right It was low and--  SPEAKER(?) It was higher  I think it is  SPEAKER(?) I think so  I don't think so--not after December  You mean it would drift off so long as the aggregates aren't coming in strong  Adjustments in the nonborrowed path? We already get them now "
1722,1981-02-24," February  Paul, I too would like to temporize for a while, and I think that's what we're talking about It seems to me most likely that both of the pieces of the scissors that we're looking at are going to come together by the nominal GNP moderating and by the money numbers going up I think both will happen But now we're talking about such a very large velocity number that there is lots of room for both to move toward each other and still not be out of line You may remember that late last year we had a couple of similar conference calls in which we told the Manager that he didn't have to observe the upper limit of the funds range exactly, but that he should let the market tend to [set] the rate and it could be a little above that limit I think a similar [response] may be quite appropriate now; not changing the lower limit from 15 percent but letting the Manager let the market determine the rate And if it turns out to be somewhat lower than 15 percent, he should not resist it I do think that would likely result in quite a bit lower rate unless we move the nonborrowed reserve path down some--on the order of $100 million or so    2/24/81  from where it otherwise would have been--which as I understand it is what you're proposing I think that would be a good move at this time  Maybe that's everybody  That's the oddity of last year's--  This is Chuck Partee Paul, I didn't disagree with the first part of your language I didn't like the reference to the uncertainty with regard to M1 in it I certainly agree that there is great uncertainty as to the distribution between M1-A and M1-B But I don't really think that M1-B could be much stronger than we have it because of the way the statistics are being handled I think we could refer to the strength of M2 and M3 and to the easing in money market conditions But I wouldn't refer to a feeling that M1-A and M1-B looked at together are not reliable I can see how it affects the distribution, but I don't see how M1-B could be a great deal higher than we already have it  Yes, but we already have 75 to 80 percent, you see  Well, I don't know if I agree on the ATS I think they already have been set up  I think there is probably, shall I say, some avoidance of reserves going on there But I think it's going on by continuing to classify as ATS accounts what are really NOW accounts  And that doesn't affect the aggregates It affects the reserves, but it doesn't affect the aggregates    2/24/81  Well, that's a different kind of reason though, Jerry What you're saying is that the change in interest rate relationships has shifted demands for various kinds of financial assets That's different from saying that we're uncertain about the quality of the M1-B numbers  I don't care an awful lot, except for that one objection I have to your statement  Yes, that's all right, to put it in those terms  You are saying ""interpretation"" now "
1744,1981-03-31," [Unintelligible] market  So move    3/31/81  In a footnote  What is the open position now?  But certainly we need to have some reason I don't know why we have $8 billion, but I don't know why we would change it to $5 billion  I think it was a building up of several things  So it is whatever is needed to keep from impeding any operations we'd like to undertake It's a great limit  Sounds fine  Peter, going back to your comments on the path for nonborrowed reserves Did I understand you to say that you considered the reduction in the path that was agreed to roughly at the time of that telephone conference call to be a temporary reduction and that in the most recent 4-week period you are back to the previous path?  Well, I hadn't understood that that was going to happen I can see how that would be an interpretation, but this is  -13-    3/31/81  the first I have heard of that--that it was a temporary reduction and then the path was restored  Well, that's why I asked the question Peter seems to think so  It just shows how tricky this whole thing is; I hadn't understood it I think we have to be very clear in terms of what the understandings are Nothing happened adversely as a result of it, but I thought we had made a downward adjustment in the path that [would not be changed] until the Committee reconsidered the matter  Well, this has explained something to me In fact, I just asked yesterday Why is the market acting the way it is? Well, it's acting that way because we have reverted to the [original] path I had never understood that I might have expected the rapid growth in money of the last month or so to have brought some tightness in the market and it hasn't brought very much Now I know why  At the last meeting?  But not as amended in the telephone conference  On the down side Yes, I agree with that  That's an additional or separate conceptual adjustment  But it didn't move up much Is that right?  No, because still the question would be whether we were reducing it temporarily or reducing it for the whole period  We could do both, I think reset our path and reset a floor or a ceiling We just didn't want to reduce that floor, that's all  You thought it was very temporary  We would have had $200 million more borrowing, I guess, throughout that second four weeks than we in fact had  Well, that's just what you said yesterday when I asked precisely the same question, but we didn't focus on it this way So I was still not communicating at that time  There would be a greater problem if we didn't have a deficit We wouldn't have so many securities available to deliver them  It's a build-up for the tax payment, I guess  A longer range, sort of starting off in the beginning of '80  But you should have taken two-tenths of the decline in savings accounts and added that in, too You didn't do that  Because savings accounts are transactions balances also  So are money market funds  I don't know  Well, I have the same sense of disquiet that's being voiced around the table, because somehow everything doesn't seem to hang together We really can't explain why the economy has been as strong as it has been over the fall and winter And not being able to explain why it has been so strong, we don't have a very firm grasp on what it's going to do in the period immediately to come I think we have to be pretty flexible and await developments I have a sense of trepidation that Fred's expectation is going to work out That the rest of the year will be stronger than we are now anticipating and that there will be a tendency toward very rapid money growth I hate to talk about these neat little adjustments of what ought and what ought not to be counted, but just in plain old M-1B terms, as velocity turns around, I think we're going to have very fast growth to contend with And the tax cut will [create] some stimulus to the economy and, therefore, a difficult situation for us to contend with as the year goes on from the standpoint of our target ranges  Now, I don't think interest rates are so low, as Henry does Looking at the Bluebook [appendix], you find that the long-term government bond yield is 13 percent, the long-term corporate bond yield is 14 percent, and the long-term mortgage rate is 15-1/2 percent It seems to me that those must all be positive real interest rates by some margin, but they are not, except in the case of mortgages, having that much effect on behavior That troubles me because I think they will come to have an effect on behavior And when attitudes shift, then we could find a rather sharp [deterioration] in the [economy] So, I wouldn't urge deliberately going about raising interest rates, but I think we ought to stick with the course we've set I didn't mean to offend Jerry on his money  -34-    3/31/81  market fund calculation, but the fact of the matter is that the turnover of savings accounts is greater than the turnover of money funds So, if you add some portion of money funds in, you ought to add some portion of the decline in savings accounts into the calculation You'll never reach an end on this because of the great difficulty of dealing with these problems  I come out, Mr Chairman, somehow right where Nancy did I think we just ought to follow alternative B, which is somewhat of a middle course, and have plenty of room to adjust as we go along in the spring I like ""B"" because it doesn't use up our room too rapidly Our previous experience, you'll recall, is always that things go along pretty well until we get to a double-digit month--and one will be coming before very long--and then perhaps we'll have to cope with a very low one I think [""B""] is the way to go I am troubled by the seasonal adjustment problem If the April number has something like a 3-1/2 percent overstatement, it's not going to be good psychologically because it will probably give us a pretty high April number and will look bad as it develops I don't know what to do about it, but we ought to think about that  Well, we might get a very high April figure How would you handle 15 percent for April?  Yes, there's tremendous volatility in that month  It's the statistical--  You are talking about several billion a month  March to June is shown on the next page here; it's 6 percent  Yes, that's 7-1/2 percent on ""C""  Well, you're talking adjusted  He always goes that way  So long as it isn't short of ""C,"" I think I would agree with that  Where are we--around 15 percent or plus a little?  Probably 18 percent, given--  I don't think we'd have to be as specific as that language that you just read, Paul I don't know why we don't  -50-    3/31/81  just say ""growth in M-1B from March to June at an annual rate of 6 percent or somewhat less""  Yes, I think so too  I was thinking March to June After all, tomorrow is April 1  And it seems to me, even though we don't quite know March, we ought to--  I know But people think we know it  Speaking for those who like a wide funds rate range, I could accept 12 to 18 percent I think we ought to have a 6-point range rather than go back down to a narrower range  Well, if you think it's 15 percent now, 12 to 18 is even-handed But if Paul is sensitive to high rates, as he seems to be, we're going to have a telephone conference call if the rate gets up there  That is to adjust the nonborrowed path?  I don't think making it 13 is going to capture [Henry's vote]  [Unintelligible] market rates  [The money market mutual funds] are very sensitive to market rates If market rates go above what the funds pay, the money that is in the funds will move back into the market  And it's falling  Somewhat lower  Yes, it's about 10 percent if you--  ""Or lower"" is infinite  You want voting members only, don't you?  13 to 18 percent for the funds range and $1150 billion on borrowings  Is anyone unable to accept it?  Let's get it over with; somehow I'm able to accept it  The funds rate is not a signal  Holding it for a while?  No, we have to have a number for targeting purposes  [The path would be drawn on] 5-3/4 percent if we said 5-1/2 to 6 percent  I have a feeling it's the Chairman's preference "
1767,1981-04-28," For M-1B    4/28/81  Communications  Well, that's just for within the Board  That doesn't take care of outside; in fact, we can't call outside  I thought we had dedicated lines I didn't think that could happen  What is our range for M-1B adjusted?  So 6 to 9 is distinctly high?  Naturally, we get a funny first quarter because--  We'll only have one M-1  Right  This is Chuck Partee I don't think it's so much a question of undershooting, Tony I think our problem may now be that we're beginning to move into a surge that will give us an overshoot right now, regardless of what happens in the second half of the year I realize all these seasonal changes are very complicated and confusing, but whether we say that March was 82 percent and April looks like 18 percent or that March was 73 percent and April looks like 136 percent, they both have the smell of a surge in growth that is awfully difficult to control and awfully difficult to know how far it might go So, I would agree with the thrust of your remarks, and those of others, too, in that I think we have to resist this and we have to resist it strongly--not so much to save our pennies for the second half, but to keep within a reasonable range right now  Do you have a feeling for how much, Paul? A couple hundred million?  It's tight, though; there's no question about it  Real estate "
1810,1981-05-18," How is housing out there, John?  I know, but you don't get any feeling of uplift?  Yes  Well, I don't think there's much downside risk either, except if there should be some unexpected financial difficulty that would lead to it And that's always hard, indeed impossible, to predict or to time I would agree with Lyle that the governor on the    5/18/81  economy is monetary policy And with emphasis on the aggregates, what we're really talking about is how high interest rates will go But, of course, as they go higher, if they should go higher, the small business problem and the problem with housing and with automobiles and so forth will get greater and greater Indeed, that's the disturbing factor about the economy There doesn't seem to be too much effect in the soft goods sectors and certainly no effect in the defense area There is a strength that could end up in a bad crash, I think, in nonresidential construction I agree with Willis that there are a lot of problems that could develop there because there's an expectation that prices will go higher and that the properties will appreciate If they don't, then there is no basis for the financing being done on them So, the concern that I'm beginning to have is that to achieve the 9 percent nominal GNP that Lyle speaks of, we will have no activity to speak of in some sectors and hardly reduced activity in other sectors The differential impacts are going to be very difficult to deal with Henry made a good point a month or so ago, in a speech that I guess he didn't deliver, which is that there are two tiers in terms of interest rate effects Those who don't pay 46 percent tax rates are hurt a lot more than those who do pay 46 percent That's very consistent with the notion that small business is complaining, because they [don't] pay 46 percent tax rates And it would be very consistent for any firm that is in a loss position to be badly hurt It reminds me of the [adage] that the worst thing a bank can have is money--that the bank should get so that it doesn't have taxable income The same thing is getting to be true of debt burden The worst thing you could have, if you have any taxable income, is not to have a debt burden because then you don't have any tax write-off So, I agree that we're in a fairly narrow range with very little chance of a sizable decline in the immediate picture and a good control over the expansion because monetary policy is well along the road toward being restraining But as to the effect that this will have in the longer run, I'm certainly not prepared to say at this point  Yes, we could get a sharp change in expectations The people who are expecting prices such as real estate values to rise will stop expecting them to rise And then suddenly what didn't seem to be such a high interest rate before will seem extraordinarily high, and that could happen very quickly But one just can't predict when it will happen By the way, though, Tony, I do think that [our policy] is having a restraining effect on the economy It's clear that housing starts are not going to stay at 12 million; they're going to drop below it And that's very restraining That's one of the biggest industries in the economy, and it's largely due to interest rates that housing activity is as low as it is On inventories, I agree with Frank He said inventories are very, very lean Why are they lean? It's because interest rates are so high that everybody pays great attention to keeping inventories down The automobile business, which in the last two or three 10-day periods has been below 6 million in domestic sales, is 4 million off what the industry has been accustomed to That's a big cut in output in GNP    5/18/81  So, interest rates are restraining the economy; and the higher they go, the more they will restrain  It's the other way around  They're not facing bankruptcy  That's what I was wondering  I don't think the savings banks are really quite that close It's 1982 and 1983 for the savings banks It's 1981 and 1982 for the savings and loans  Yes, that's about what the FDIC feels  By '83, if rates stay up as our forecast has them, there are going to be quite a few And they go beyond New York and Boston  Well, we would, of course, finance them  At the window  I don't think we have very good information because the category is $100,000 and over And the $100,000 notes are pretty secure We don't know how much is in jumbo CDs  You would let disorderly conditions develop? As you see it, you just wouldn't move until Washington said yes?  The way we would get rid of the foreign currency, I assume, is on a declining dollar market That is, it would seem usual, wouldn't it, if the dollar were dropping to sell marks to support the dollar? And in the process we would get rid of balances and just wouldn't rebuild them That would be a practical strategy, if we didn't want to--  Well, it's awfully high I would think exports will fade  It will drop back to $300 million  Have there been any transactions?  I think we have to have it Otherwise, how do we know what the checkpoint is? We could say that that's what it is, although technically that's what the paragraph says  Why is that?  -19-    5/18/81  I have a question, too  I'd ask the question more historically than Henry did We had a 139 percent increase in M-1B shift-adjusted in April We had evidence fairly early on that the month would be strong because one of those early weeks came in strong What would it have taken to have achieved, say, a 10 percent rate of M-1B growth for the month of April? Is it within the realm of possibility?  Before we knew that there was an increase  Right away?  I have one other question Paul, if I might, before we do that We did have a large increase in rates in the month [The increase in] short rates was historically very large and long rates [went up] quite a bit One assumes that there must have  -21-    5/18/81  been losers and well as gainers in that market shift In fact, the arithmetic suggests it, so it must be so In that last comment in your statement, Peter, you said the big dealers are in no trouble that you can see  Yes, the one that was in the paper  Right  Right  Well, the question I have in my mind is that the dealers hedge in the futures market and the futures market protects the dealers, then, against a very sharp rise in rates Who is on the other side of those futures transactions and why don't we hear from them? They must have lost as much as the dealers were able not to lose  It may be that it's just very widely distributed  You haven't heard of any problems?  So move  Any of those outcomes is acceptable in terms of what might happen  It's the [tack] of the Administration  Well, I agree that we have to be restrictive But I would say in response to Tony that what we should do is to set our money growth course the way we would like to have it If it deviates from that, then we'll automatically become more restrictive in terms of interest rates if we need to be tighter, or less restrictive if we need to be easier So, I don't really see moving all the way down to alternative C in terms of the specifications What would we like to have develop in terms of the aggregates? That's really the question we are being asked And in my view ""A"" holds us right along the mid-section of the M-1B range It's a little ample on M2 and M3 and, therefore, there might be a case for alternative B in order to adjust for having been over on the broader aggregates As for the numbers for the aggregates, expansion of 3 percent in M-1B for April to June is quite reasonable; it's a very modest expansion and would be a quite acceptable outcome Now, we don't know what interest rates might be associated with the 3 percent increase And if I understand the meaning of the funds rate range now as the points at which we're to have a consultation rather than points within which the Manager operates, I think we might want to raise that range in ""B"" to 16 to 22 percent I can certainly imagine the rate going to 22 percent with no trouble at all, and I don't know that it would be  -26-    5/18/81  fruitful to have an exchange [of views] until it gets to about 22 percent But that's just a test point, or guidepost, or whatever you said earlier, Peter, rather than a specification to the Manager  There is one other point that I want to make now I think we will be in as much difficulty politically if there is weakness in the aggregates as if there is strength We could quickly get quite a reaction from very weak growth in the monetary aggregates, and that is not unprecedented Starting in the spring of both '75 and '76, there was a surge in the aggregates that was subsequently reversed The fact that the last couple of occasions haven't [produced that result] doesn't mean it won't occur again April is still an odd month; it has a lot of tax transactions in it So it seems to me that we ought to be in a posture where we can give a little if the numbers come in weak as well as tighten up a little if the numbers come in strong, and we ought to do it from a neutral position So, I could accept the specifications of alternative A, but I lean rather strongly to ""B"" as a conservative posture  Well, $2-1/2 billion seems a little strong I wanted to ask Steve why he [raised] that I would say $2 billion is about where we are now, isn't it?  I would say $2 billion, Tony, and then if M-1B comes in strong, that would soon develop additional tension and additional borrowings, as it did in this last episode I'd favor more of a neutral start  Casual?  -33-    5/18/81  Due-on-sale doesn't help them this month or next month, that's for sure  It might next year or the year after  No, no  That's a $400 million adjustment right off  Yes, me too  We haven't heard from you  Yes  There's some advantage to that  Maybe the problem is the [wording] ""as may be consistent"" Perhaps we should indicate the direction of the move not ""as may be consistent"" but ""in order to be more consistent"" or something like that  As I read this construction, Paul, I would have said that the Committee would strongly resist growth above 3 percent and that it would be more or less indifferent between, say, 3 percent and zero That's the way I look at it  And that's why I said that Well, any positive number would be all right  That moves us toward consistency, but it doesn't really make it consistent That's the point  Yes If we raise that initial level of borrowing by anything like what the staff has proposed, that absolutely swamps the difference in the reserve path between, say, 2 and 3 percent, doesn't it, Steve?  You must be talking about a lot more money over the two months with a $500 million adjustment of the initial borrowing than you are with the difference between 2 and 3 percent  We could make it a range We haven't used a range  It really ought to be zero to 3 percent or something like that  ""3 percent or lower"" is what it says?  I see  Which is right at the very top of the range that we have specified here  Would accept or would make one happy?  I could accept it But try $2 billion  I think you hit the right number, but it's whether it's preferred or acceptable  SPEAKER(?) $21 billion is acceptable  -44-    5/18/81  That's a good point This construction with ""advisable"" would be better  Also, it seems to me that there ought to be a professional judgment on the part of the Manager that it's going to run well outside the range rather than that the Chairman is making this decision If we want it to be a technical question, it seems to me it ought to be a Manager's question  It says ""may,"" but it certainly implies that he's going to do it  I think that version is considerably better than this one  Yes  That certainly puts the reserve issues first; there's no question about it  I must say that I think that's incorrect, Roger I wasn't at that telephone conference call and I read with some amusement the paragraph that was just [quoted] I think it is stretching things to say that the earlier instruction could be interpreted in the way it was interpreted in that meeting And I think what is now being proposed is consistent with the interpretation in the telephone conference call It was a stretched interpretation, which now needs a different instruction, I think, if we're going to stay with it and use it So, I do believe a change is necessary  Always? At every meeting refer to that policy record interpretation?  That's the way to do it  Well, you don't mean to put it in the directive You mean to have in the policy record entry for today's meeting a reference to the previous policy record saying that the Committee adopted this language in furtherance of its determination in the earlier meeting  Oh, I see  We could reference it again in the record for today's meeting  Yes  Then that becomes an explanation for why we changed this wording, so that people don't think there's something more that we did, because after all it will come out [later] They will know about this wording and then they'll have the explanation of the wording at the very same time  But he had it before, didn't he?  Yes, those are the first words  5 to 50 percent!  We don't want to have--  I said I would accept 16 to 22--  Yes, we've backed away from--  Do you want hands?  How about 2-1/2 percent?  All but Tony  Yes  Six percent looks about right, doesn't it?  Than 8-1/2 percent or something like that  I think that's the first unanimous vote-- "
1826,1981-06-17," And the multiplier is standard, so that--  There are no further adjustments This is Chuck Partee I might just say, Paul, that I think your proposal is very sensible If I understand it, we now are looking at M-1B for April to June of 3-1/2 percent, did you say? And that is assuming that there is no more shortfall  Yes, March to June, the three-month period in our original directive, which we keyed back to last time and for which the objective was 5-1/2 percent or somewhat less Well, 3-1/2 percent is certainly somewhat less than 5-1/2 percent and may be a little more than somewhat less So, it seems to me that we are at the lower end of the agreed upon path that we talked about and, therefore, that the growth in nonborrowed reserves should be permitted to show through in lower borrowings, to the extent that that occurs I would note that my sense of the [situation] is that we've had a period of several weeks--it's not just this week--in which we have had downward revisions in the expected money supply numbers As I recall, at the meeting we were talking about May growth that was considerably higher than -43 percent and June growth that was considerably higher than +1 percent So, we are beginning to develop this somewhat ominous pattern of shortfalls from staff expectations that has run for a period of weeks And I agree with the point that you've often made that those revisions often indicate something as to what is happening So, our problem as we look into the next month or two, may in fact be rather low-looking money numbers, lower than the staff is now expecting I don't think this has any of the dynamic characteristics of last year when [money growth] went off so very sharply in April, but it does seem to be pretty pervasive and it's a fairly ex ended period of weakness in the money behavior Of course, the market rates are reflecting that by coming down, although we resisted or didn't pay much attention to that market development in March and early April because we sensed that there was considerable strength in the business picture Now it seems to me that the market is probably right because there is developing weakness in the business picture So, I think we ought to do what you say But we ought to be rather sensitive now to significant shortfalls in the monetary aggregates because they're probably going to be reflecting shortfalls in the economy    6/17/81 -5-  To this point I'm not bothered, but I'm worried about what the next couple of months may show  But, of course, M2 is fairly weak for May and June, too, isn't it?  Was there anybody there in the first place? "
1847,1981-07-06," What fraction do they have in the discount notes? Is that a pretty big figure, Paul?  That comes next year!  Well, I don't know The report that Paul gave sounded to me like very tight money in the old fashioned sense of the term  I don't think we asked that  No, that was the decision in the conference call    7/6-7/81  I was surprised, Larry, by what you said It seems to me that this could be a miscalculation on the part of the banks But it could be an unfortunate exercise We have been spending quite a lot of effort, if I understand it, trying to say to the market that we don't watch the funds rate and that what we do is to operate on aggregates So, looking at a weakening in the aggregates, I think an intelligent banker might say Well, that means there are going to be more reserves around and the market is going to ease So [the banker] operated on that presumption and then, in fact, found that the market didn't ease Why? Because we were reducing our nonborrowed reserve target in the early part of the first four weeks or so in order to keep the funds rate from declining  Well, no My point was simply that on Wednesday they either come into the window or they don't come into the window; [that has been their practice] for a long time My further point was that they could look at what they regarded as being pretty weak money numbers and they could look at our statements to the press that we were going to provide the reserves and let the funds rate go where it would, and they might conclude that the funds rate ought to ease if the money numbers are weak Now, Steve's point, I think, is the most relevant one, which is that it has only been in the last few days that the numbers have been all that weak So, it's the hazard of not following the regime that we said we would  It could be revised quite a bit couldn't it, Steve?  So moved  SEVERAL Second  Are you hearing reports of noncompetitiveness of US manufacturers?  What kinds of industries? Chemical?  Of course, a higher dollar would be having a very favorable effect on our own inflation rate in the meantime We'd  -11-    7/6-7/81  be getting the benefit that the foreigners were getting a couple years ago  I don't feel it I think it's working pretty well  You mean in what the value [of the dollar] would be?  We bought quite a few  I think the question can be left to developing a strategy as the dollar drops It's too late now to rescue anything on the up side I think We did, of course, have a very active intervention policy right up until January 20 or thereabouts  Just demand rules of the gold standard, that's all, right?  But the question is Do [rates] come down because the GNP weakens or for some independent reason? What Jim says is driving them is [the assumption of] a relatively small money supply expansion and [the staff forecast] has to force that on an economy with quite a lot of nominal GNP The staff could be making a mistake in velocity; turnover could be faster than has been predicted But otherwise, it either has to be a faster increase in money or a smaller increase in nominal GNP  The [problem] may be that what this forecast doesn't show is the collapse that you said would develop  For this nominal GNP  And will continue  So, you're not that far from Bill  Well, I think M-1B is quite a bit better than Frank has said What we really have to do is to talk about first differences We need something to steer by Now, the fact that there are some idle balances in a transactions total of M1 doesn't mean a thing There have always been a lot of idle balances in there, and what we need to do--  And that, of course, one allows for in the velocity estimate You can take any number and modify it to take account of other things that you think are happening in the economy I don't see that M2 is that much better [than M1] If I understand what the DIDC did, in another 25 days we're going to have 4-year certificates in M2 that are probably going to sell like wildfire Are  -24-    7/6-7/81  you going to consider those transactions balances? They're going to be in M2  That is what led the Board many years ago to promote the development of the flow of funds accounts  You wouldn't?  Yes, I was just going to say the same thing  Well, I didn't submit estimates so perhaps it's unfair to say anything But I come out a lot closer to Tony than anybody else who has commented I think we have a heroic staff forecast here in saying that inflation is going to drop this much I'm inclined not to believe it because I don't think we've had the confrontation with costs that is going to be required to call for a permanently lower increase in costs than we've been seeing I don't think that's easily handled by people just saying that they will settle for a lower pay increase or take lower corporate profits without fighting back I think they will fight back, and it's going to be a very difficult period I have the feeling--and have had it for the last year or so--that the way we're running monetary policy now, and it's a way that's probably appropriate, is as a governor on the economy Essentially what we have here is a governor-type operation in the way the staff has run their forecast through '82 Any time those latent demands begin to perk up and we get an overrun in money, we will tighten up and interest rates will go higher That will then force the economy down [to] the point where the money demand will be [less] strong and interest rates will fall And we'll get a  -28-    7/6-7/81  little better [economic performance] coming up to that limit again and then tend to go through it while interest rates will be high until the inflation rate is significantly reduced  I guess I would be rather in agreement with the staff projection except that I would have put inflation a little higher than they have it, for next year certainly I think there's going to be a big food price increase next year Also, I can't really buy the recovery they have in the second half of '82 because by then we'll be faced with financial distress on all sides And I think that will have enough of an expectational influence that the economy won't, in fact, recover That's all  Yes  I didn't think we were talking about the short run  Well, I don't know You say it's fast Let me remind you that a year ago we were sitting here talking about how in the world we could get back up into the ranges In fact that was the key note of your July presentation So, who knows? I think we ought to choose these numbers with respect to what we think the longer-run effect will be and then struggle with the question of whether we come in low or go above or anything like that in the short run But we ought to try to keep in mind what the economy requires  Quickly, Paul, I happen to agree Alternative 2 looks all right to me  -38-    7/6-7/81  Page 8 That's the--  They're high rates  But I think the point is that we can, in fact, accept the strategy of alternative 2 and not change the long-range targets for this year  I wouldn't go with the Roman II; I would say Roman I, possibly with a 3-point range  Until the economy collapses!  No for this year  On your question, I think it's really a matter of taste We could say, as we often have with these ranges, that they are there for a purpose That is, things change, and we change [our view of where we want to be] within the ranges It looks as if there was a change in the demand function for money and, therefore, we are going to come in low on M-1B and we're going to come in high on M2 and M3 Or, if you prefer, we could say there has been an apparent change in the relationships here and, therefore, we are going to reduce the M-1B range 1/2 point and increase the M2 and M3 ranges 1/2 point It's just a matter of taste as to the cosmetics of how we go about it, Paul  Would you just cut the range? Is that the idea, Bob?  3 to 4-1/2?  The trouble with going toward leaning on M2 is that we still haven't had a presentation of information that would indicate that it's a more reliable guide One has an instinctive sense of that because it's more stable and closer to GNP, but we haven't had that analysis  May I ask What does 3 percent imply for the rest of the year? If [M-1B growth] were to come in at 3 percent, Steve, what would June to December be then?  Well, all of those ranges on page 14 lower the targets a bit, Nancy Alternative I lowers the target ranges by 1/2 point  -47-    7/6-7/81  Oh, I thought you said you'd take alternative I  I see  They all raise it  You ought to be a debater, Frank  That's the problem  I think it's alternative I  Well, you might ask what the staff had in mind  Possibilities  Because it dropped out of bed in April  Wait until we get to the third quarter  I would opt for alternative B And I would point out that in a way we're getting a deceptive look because we're taking a snapshot as of June, which is the very low point, we hope, of the [downward] movement After all, as a result of the cumulative effects of a minus 5 and a minus 10, alternative B gets us a third- quarter growth rate of 28 percent Now, 28 percent is not a high monetary growth number, so it seems to me quite a reasonable thing to shoot at  We'll have to decide on the fourth quarter a little later But, you know, it's a long time to the fourth quarter We may well have a double-digit plus or a double-digit minus between now and then so we will be talking in an entirely different arena when we get to discussing the fourth-quarter average, which I wouldn't want to see go up as fast as that 82 percent or whatever Steve has on that I also disagree with Lyle that we should not pay any attention to shortfalls below the number because I can't tell whether there's a demand shift or not That is, when we're experiencing it, it can be either a demand shift or it can be a weakening in the economy; and the money supply numbers can very well predate the weakening in the economy somewhat so that we're not all that aware of it But we're not talking about a very strong economy when the auto companies report an annual sales rate of 54 million and wonder whether they can survive to the end of the year That's not a strong economy It's also obvious in housing that we're not talking about a strong economy Builders are going out of business every day So, I don't want to take a lot of risk of a cumulative shortfall Remember, if we put May and June together we have as much of a drop as the April drop last year, which really galvanized us, perhaps improperly, into action So, I think we shouldn't accept a substantial shortfall from the numbers that would be occasioned by alternative 2 I guess the funds range could be 15 to 21 percent Interestingly, I had great difficulty finding what the funds rate range had been over the last  -67-    7/6-7/81  period when I read the Bluebook; it wasn't in the usual place We've deemphasized it to the point that we don't even report it now! Assuming it was 16 to 22 percent, which is in the crossed out section of the directive, 15 to 21 percent seems all right I wouldn't want to see the borrowing target above $14 billion, which as I understand it is where we are currently in this period I don't think we ought to raise the borrowing target above what it now is  I don't think your numbers are terribly inconsistent [with the staff's numbers], Tony  It's rough on amount and timing  I don't think we ought to operate on a quarterly average, but it would be very reasonable to talk about 8 percent, or whatever we have in mind, for June to September and to say that would mean a second-to-third quarter increase of about 2-3/4 percent  Right away I'd expect  This is the old principle of aggregates on the high side and interest rates on the low side  Especially with the wild card [certificate] coming at the end of this month, we could almost--  Or it could come out of the securities markets  With any kind of target number for the period?  For M2 I mean  Restrain it if it's over 9 percent?  No, he means for the period ahead  We could conceivably have a very weak M-1B that we would encourage getting weaker because our M2 constraint is at the upper end--  You don't mind minus numbers in M-1B?  It's not halfway; it's closer to ""C""  I can't even [unintelligible] accept what we've got  You know, M2 growth in the second quarter was 108 percent  Why wouldn't we hold off making that change?  We could do that in January, if it still seemed to be relevant  Yes  That's what I said  -82-    7/6-7/81  Because we'll have it so low this year--  On an unadjusted basis wouldn't 3 to 6 percent be sufficient?  In addition, we have the shift adjustment question, Fred Since we're going to give them a plain figure, that adds something  I would very much like to do it  Remember, though, that we have to say whether or not this is consistent with the Administration's 12 percent nominal GNP growth [forecast]  Yes, they [assume] rising velocity, too Well, maybe it will go up  -85-    7/6-7/81  Top and bottom  Next year  Well, what does M2 mean?  And if it's higher than that?  We don't need to do that  Given what we voted for on the short run, I think we really ought to reduce the lower end Growth is going to come out awfully low  On the top half  Lower both ends [of the M-1B range] by a half point?  Sometimes that happens "
1866,1981-07-17," The leak was this week  And June was a decline of about that same magnitude?  Might I ask Steve or Paul about the July M2 Do you have any updated figures for the thrifts? There could be a run- off from the thrifts that is contributing to that increase in money market funds  For the combined banks and thrifts?  For thrifts alone I see  I would agree with that, Mr Chairman  Yes, I think that's right It's above the short-run path that you constructed  But it's below the cone  Yes  No, it has to be next Wednesday; we can't know anything more 'til Wednesday  That's probably right We're talking about the next reserve week  Did you want to [reaffirm] the long-run range? "
1884,1981-08-18," Sam, you spoke of the possibility of a free fall I don't know exactly what you mean by that, but suppose there's a 10 or 15 percent drop in the value of the dollar in the next month, say, which I guess might be a free fall--  There has been a great deal of speculation in the dollar Just making an analogy with domestic markets, when there is a great deal of speculation in one direction, naturally the end of it comes and when it does there is a stock adjustment So, I would think you're quite right that there could be a 10 or 15 percent drop--    8/18/81  using my figure But what harm would it do if there were a 10 or 15 percent drop in the dollar?  The market mechanism itself could be harmed, you think?  Well, at an annual rate that's a very high rate of decline  The last verity I can remember us discussing at length was the question of the viability of the dollar/mark rate when it was 200  Well, we thought it was very low when it was 170, but as it got back to 200 we thought that was about right And as it got above 200, as I recall, we were doing quite a lot of intervening So, maybe 200 is the right rate rather than 247  That's why I asked the question, Tony It seems to me that most analysts would say that the dollar is way too high And it has been bid up there by speculation in these markets Therefore, why not get the adjustment over with and have a free fall? Wouldn't it be better perhaps to get the rate down to a more credible level quickly rather than very gradually? That's why I raised the question  Well, it was a very brief period and an awful lot was going on I don't know that there has been any great change  Peter, you mentioned that the premium for agency issues, particularly those of FNMA and the Home Loan Banks, has been going up Has it gone notably higher in the last six weeks or so?  There has been some further widening?  So it's very much more than it has been traditionally  And it also has gone up some [more recently]    8/18/81  The Federal Reserve does not have the authority to borrow, is that right?  From the public Issue its notes in the market  Well, I didn't mean that  I don't want to interrupt this ideological discussion because I don't want to participate in it except to say that the work I have seen doesn't indicate that much additional information is gained as we move from M1, or in this case M-1B, to M2 So, I'm inclined to be sympathetic with Larry's point of view The Committee has had very good political reasons for not wanting to be tied to one aggregate, and that's another element that would have to be discussed if we were to go just to M-1B But I am concerned about M2, and particularly the Committee's decision last time to make it a constraint, because I think there is very substantial exposure here to missing by a fairly large margin even what the staff now says the M2 prospects may be It's true that we didn't get the wild card [certificate], although we may I don't know how long it will be until there's another court test of that We did get the small saver certificate, and the early information is that it's selling quite well Now, not every dollar of that money has come from other bank deposits It just can't be so It's a good instrument--a 2-1/2-year term yielding a high rate of return--and will tend, without any economic meaning, to raise M2 somewhat But much more important now is the all saver certificate, which will be sold for three full months [at the end] of this year, October, November, and December We had some off-the-wall staff estimates that I saw that assumed sales of a hundred billion dollars of those certificates I would think most of those would be sold early in the period because of the tax exemption feature; one would want to have the full tax exemption period So we're exposed to the possibility of one [M2] element going up like gangbusters in the fourth quarter True, quite a bit of it will come from passbook savings, quite a bit will come from MMCs, and some may come from money market funds But, again, I would argue that not all of it will And that will be another factor tending to raise the nontransactions component of M2 in the remainder of this year My concern last time, and even more so this time, is that if we have a constraint of that kind, we may find that it is running the ball game because it's going up at 13, 14, 15 percent in the latter part of the year, yet it doesn't really mean anything in terms of the economy We used to cite both aggregates and give more or less equal weight to both aggregates, and I think that was the better position for the Committee to be in That's sort of a policy comment, and I'm sorry about that, but I was responding directly to the content of Steve's talk  I think we could abandon it and explain it  -12-    8/18/81  Why would lower market rates bring a reduction in M2 growth when it has so many interest-sensitive components?  They would spend instead of save?  I see There'd be more M1 relative to M2  For the shift adjusted M-1B?  The employees having the new ones?  The funds raised by nonfinancial sectors in the third quarter are estimated at 12 percent of GNP That was 15-1/2 percent in the fourth quarter of last year and it was 18 percent in 1979; it's really quite a low number  I don't have it written down I don't know how long it will be  Well, I just wanted to agree with Lyle, in that I don't think there's evidence of a cumulative decline in business now setting in It's very difficult to tell whether we are in a recession or not because we have had zero growth for ages, and we have it projected for ages to come Of course, that is made up of stronger sectors and weaker sectors; if you happen to be in a weaker sector you surely think there's a recession But the fact is that I don't see a cumulative decline taking place, barring a financial catastrophe of the kind Bob Forrestal mentioned That is, assuming we can hold the financial system together, I don't think there's a major recession at hand The big thing is this fiscal change, which I just want to emphasize again There's a tremendous amount of fiscal stimulus in prospect; it starts right now and grows and grows and grows over time And people will come to recognize that, as Willis says, and will take it into account in their spending plans So, what we get is a difference in the fiscal/monetary policy mix, as we used to refer to it, which is quite a bit wider than anything I can recall I think it means that the areas that are affected by monetary policy are going to be in a permanent depression and the areas that benefit by tax cuts-- and they are a little harder to tell than just the specific spending things--will be supported by that But I think the staff's view of about a zero rate of gain in real activity for some considerable while in the future is a pretty good basis for the Committee to operate on in deciding its policy  Do you suppose things are ever bad in Aspen?  The problem is interpreting that directive It has an absolute proviso on M2  That's the trouble I think it's an automatic instruction to the Manager You could intervene and say we better have a conference But it is an instruction The Manager is to provide nonborrowed reserves below the path he otherwise would if M2 is at the point where the proviso takes hold  Not in the directive  It doesn't get us to the low point of the range  By the end of the year  Let me remind you that the directive has a bracketed phrase, which says ""resulting in a quarterly average of less than 2 percent"" or something like that So, it's already there  A one percentage point increase in interest rates  It's a traditional New York view; I agree with it  After taxes they are more than they were a month ago because the tax bill reduced the tax rate  For M-1B we only have the first part of August What is given for the whole quarter is--  Yes, I thought that's what you were talking about You're talking about the other side of the transaction  That, of course, is a reason for trying to follow a middle course, Paul I continue to be impressed by the potential for monetary growth to fall below our specified ranges And I think that could be very harmful, particularly if in the course of this the economy begins to weaken  -42-    8/18/81  Well, we may get 11 percent right here in August What do we do with that? That will come out before the policy record is [made public]  No, I think we tightened  And then in the fourth quarter we have the tax exempt certificates, which could blow this aggregate out of the water  Well, we're getting awfully close to having a cooked directive It doesn't really mean that [in] the directive That's a bothersome fact, Paul  Well, if you read the directive it says one thing, but there's some side agreement that we'll do it a different way I just think that's a very bad procedure  And what's the upper limit?  It says ""remains around or moves within"" You want to leave that phrase in there Now, I suggest that 94 percent is certainly right on the very border of violating, if it doesn't already violate, the directive  Well, I had the impression that one would read the whole phrase, ""moves within or remains around the upper limit"" And I think that gives less tolerance to being above the upper limit than it does being below  It's difficult There has been over the years a tendency for the Committee to want to have things [in the decision] that we don't say in the directive I think that needs to be resisted because the directive is our only record of what we've done We don't have minutes of the meeting that go through all this discussion and--  Just to clarify, we didn't know that the all savers certificates would become law  I just wanted to repeat that position so that you can change it next time  Well, I know the passbook savings at least are going up  No, we're not talking about that part We're talking about the longer run It's page 2, around lines numbered 39 to 40 Is that where you are, Paul?  No, I haven't changed my mind I think more than I did the last time that it's the wrong thing to do "
1912,1981-10-05," Of course!  I agree with Tony I think it opens up a can of worms I don't know how we could turn down the countries that are bigger trading partners and bigger countries and everything else-- --if we let in  They could get a closer tie with sterling and then have--  Would this affect their inventory attitude, though?  The reason I asked is that Jim had the conclusion that inventories weren't a sensitive sector But it does seem to me that if a firm's cash flow is poor and if the costs of carry are very high, it could liquidate inventory We have different circumstances than in the past for judging these stock/sales ratios and so forth  Of course, that was in effect last year, too  No, it [became effective] in late '79  You're talking about thrifts?  Not banks  Scattered here and there  It comes from different parts  They're still building houses in Denver, Roger?  Steve, didn't you say 12 percent growth from September to December does not get us back to the range? That is, December is back to the track, but people will still be able to read the fourth-quarter-to-fourth-quarter growth even then, as I read the Bluebook, as 3 percent rather than 3-1/2 percent  But in September M-1B went up not at all  I think it was 6  We do tend to forget that  A technical point on M2 that I would make, Paul, is that we have to remember that we are factoring in new elements of market-related rates as time goes on That can give a first difference in M2 that we are coming to a steady state  They tend to because we have more [components of M2] that are at a market rate, and the staff didn't take that into account when they gave us their ranges at the beginning of the year And, by the way, the Committee didn't take those ranges; we reduced the ranges, as Nancy often points out  Which was a big recession  I think that's right  Well, I just have a quick comment I agree with Tony that what we have to do is run our strategy for the long pull because it's going to take the long pull to get inflation down I think it would be a very serious indictment of the Federal Reserve if it encourages a recession of size in this environment I read the history of the Federal Reserve as indicating it was set up to provide an elastic currency, not that it was set up to stop inflation and pay no attention to the economy, Fred Indeed, I think that's the thrust of the whole first 50 years of the System and its origins What we have to do is to avoid seeming to add to a strong recessionary thrust, because I think we will lose the ball game if we do that Now, I believe that serious protracted shortfalls from the lower end of our targets will give us exactly that image I would not be so worried if M-1B in the next three months goes up 7 or 8 percent That would be all right; we'll be below the target, but that's all right What I'm worried about is that we'll have another 5-point shortfall from what we expect in the fourth quarter as we did in the third And I think we have to guard greatly against that problem  Just reduce all those numbers for the aggregates  Yes  That's ""B""  Well, M2 could still be pretty strong, but M-1B could fall well short  -39-    10/5-6/81  Lags kill you every time!  Not that that makes a difference  You mean no matter how weak M-1B is? You'd put a floor on borrowing?  It is a bad day, isn't it?  A beginning [borrowing] level of what?  And a funds rate [lower limit] of 12 or 13?  [I prefer] 12 to 17 percent Do you really want a target of as low as 10 percent on M2 and 6 percent on M-1B?  We could say ""7 percent or somewhat more,"" or something like that  After having missed 7 percent so clearly  Well, I was thinking of accepting a higher number That's why I asked  At or somewhat above the range for the year? That's 9 percent  Well, as I said last time, technically a proviso is much more limiting than giving equal weight A proviso means you give total weight when the proviso is in effect Now, that may not be the understanding that everybody has But reading the English, that's what one would conclude it means  But we had decided last time, you remember, that even though it was a proviso, we were going to regard it as not a proviso  But we don't have any idea how many all savers certificates have been sold, or where they're coming from We're buying a ""pig in a poke"" if we constrain ourselves with M2  Take out half the all savers  We can say ""about"" or ""around,"" and fuzz the actual numbers  But, as was pointed out, it doesn't include retail RPs  A lot of those are going to go into all savers  Well, if there has been a shortfall, Paul, we already have had it; and therefore if it comes in high, we shouldn't respond to it My point is this Let's say we had $6 billion in retail RPs and we accepted them; now we shouldn't react if the $6 billion in retail RPs goes into all savers  Sure, why not say ""10 percent or somewhat more""? And then we have a proviso later about taking account of all savers certificates That seems all right  Oh, come on, Paul, you know it's going to be a big number  -49-    10/5-6/81  October will probably be a good-sized month, and then growth may fall off But October will be a good-sized month-- maybe 13, 14, 15 percent  Yes, and that [unintelligible] forecast of interest rates  Yes, I do too  Depending on the behavior of the pattern  For the aggregates?  But the staff has to construct a path, you see We choose the number and then they construct the path  So what?  But maybe the 20 percent was way too high We shouldn't have let it go to 20 percent If we're going to control interest rates rather than aggregates, maybe we shouldn't have let it go to 20 percent  I would rather post it at 12 to 17 percent and just agree [on when to consult] I don't like the idea of narrowing this range to 4 points We really are not supposed to be paying that much attention to it, although I know we are  Because it would be approaching it--moving down to 12 percent--and before it got there we would have a consultation  I would prefer 8 percent on the growth, but I'll buy 7 percent "
1937,1981-11-17," It certainly isn't  Well, that's what interest rates do They get you closer to your monetary target if you move--  Yes  That's because we got [growth] early in the year; so far it has been high  Yes  It's having very little effect now  Well, I just wanted to point something out--not on this subject--[though] I agree that the velocity of M1-B has increased because of the money market funds After all, we'll probably have a 9 percent increase in nominal GNP this year with growth of only a couple percent on M1-B, which is unprecedented That has to mean a considerable shift has occurred  But what I wanted to point out was that when Steve speaks about the trajectory--plotting a course that would take us through the winter and into the spring--he has been very careful every time he has referred to it in a statement to say ""assuming the economic projection"" And I would argue that this begs the question, because I have a certain amount of sympathy with Larry's first question I held my hand up when he asked it, though it has been some time since Larry made his comment There could be a circularity here that in effect has a trajectory to no place, or as we say in regard to the discount rate ""a bridge to nowhere"" That's because, in fact, we may find that the nominal GNP numbers fade as we move ahead We've had a little of that, certainly, in the fourth quarter [with GNP] being quite a bit  -13-    11/17/81  weaker than we were anticipating all year I have a sense of a little shortfall from our projections as we've gone through the year We've certainly had big shortfalls in relation to our expectations on M1-B I looked at it and we have been below our expectations of M1-B at these meetings for six consecutive months, and the average shortfall has been 7 percent over that 6-month period We've even been short on M2 compared to our expectations, the paths that we selected when we went into the period In the case of M1-B, that's partly because of this velocity problem But I think it's partly because of shortfalls in economic performance, too  It's hard for me to believe that there will not be an economic recovery commencing in the second half of next year, given the size of the deficit that we'll have and the further cut in taxes that will occur as of July 1st But it's a fair piece until the middle of next year, and I'm not at all sure that we can say with great confidence that the economy might not decline a good deal further below the projection, [say, by] the end of the first quarter, which could give us quite a serious problem as it occurs If that is true, and if we hold up interest rates, then we will get the contraction in transactions balances that will make possible a continuation of poor business So, I just wanted to point out that Steve has been very careful every time he referred to the longer-run planning always to assume as a caveat that the economic assumption was right  Three buildings?  Well, I didn't say anything about my preferences on the alternatives before I agree almost totally with what Frank Morris had to say I would choose alternative B I don't know that it's all that important to get a 7 percent increase in M1-B in November and December, but I certainly would like to have an appreciable increase As you know, we've chosen 7 percent since July And we've only had 7 percent in one month of the months that have gone by So, I'm not really sure what it means when I say I'd like the 7 percent alternative because it may not be that at all But I guess what I'm saying is that if M-1B growth turns out to be significantly below 7 percent--and significantly below I would define as being below 5 percent--I would assume that we would not regard the federal funds rate range as being a [constraint] that would stop [us from] trying to get more growth So, I'm prepared to accept 10 to 15 percent on the federal funds rate range, as stated in the directive But if the aggregates continue as weak as they have been--not what the staff is projecting, but what they have been--I would want us to break below 10 percent on the funds rate  It creates a very poor economy  That's ""B""  Oh, for the two months, October--  In nominal terms  [Unintelligible] is 7 years  Well, I buy the $350 million and I buy the ""B"" [specifications] but I would want the funds rate at 10 to 15 percent I certainly can't imagine it over 15 percent, and I would want us to  -35-    11/17/81  consult very promptly if 10 percent is going to hold us up and we would not have a good growth in the money supply  No  What if you're not happy with a shortfall?  That's my reaction  We will have a lot of shortfall to make up, though, when we get into next year  But it's open [ended] It could get to zero with interest rates declining It still seems to me a test of the directive  What is ""some shortfall""?  Well, we better have it in the directive because it sounds as if it could be zero or minus 10 percent as long as interest rates were declining  It's not ridiculous because we're 7 percentage points off our expectations on average for the last six months  Well, I thought M2 was below--  Well, I would prefer alternative B just as it is written I don't know how many others feel that way  $200 million is awfully low as a start for borrowing  I think Tony is absolutely right We've now separated the interest rate people from the aggregates people And it's very hard to bring them together  That's what you've said all along  You have practically no room for discretionary upward adjustments in nonborrowed reserves because even under the circumstances you have cited--and remember we set a monthly average-- if we're 3 points off, we're down to the frictional level of borrowing by the end of the period So there is no room to have an upward--  It has worked extremely well Well, I think maybe your point is a good one Maybe we ought to start the initial borrowing a little higher for safety  That is something I want to guard against It might not fall out of bed, but then it might fall out of bed  But I do believe that it's probably when the funds rate breaks that we will really get the system to generate money Because then the banks can't nicely lend their federal funds; they've got to get out there and do something else  It would come with a break in the money supply, which would force these rates down  I don't want a top of 16 percent I think that just looks absolutely ridiculous  I think then it would be a question of whether we want to narrow it to 11 to 15 percent I might accept that There are others who wouldn't I think the biggest thing is--  Because we don't want it to seem constraining  I think maybe that's what we ought to settle on  With ""A"" than with ""C""?  And how about December?  We stay on the nonborrowed path if growth comes in short, so borrowings go down  It has been two months or 6 weeks; it's come up  Yes, I think the question is Should we have serious downward pressure on rates, if we have shortfalls--not only, as Lyle says, from 8-1/2 percent down to 5 percent, but below 5 percent or whatever it is? Shouldn't we be having serious downward pressure on rates because of the weakness that that implies for the economy?  If you look at cyclical declines, it's not a very fast drop  -50-    11/17/81  The faster we get it down, the less distance it's going to have to travel  But I think Paul is right that we'd hit the funds rate constraint if we go through this frictional borrowing level, and we'd have a conference call as to what to do  That's ignoring our policy responsibility not to have a consultation if we have great developing weakness in the economy We don't want to avoid the problem; we want to precipitate it so we can talk about it  That's true  He means September to December, doesn't he?  Well, that's not the same as we had the last time ""A"" is what we had last time  Well, communicate  It couldn't be  -53-    11/17/81  Do you mean just take out the funds rate reference?  What is it, 75 percent of--  Well, we have the very real question of what to do about this year's shortfall--whether to add it to next year's range or not We haven't discussed that  Or somewhat higher  That makes it seem quite consistent  Well, it could happen  I don't know; it depends on how much lower  That's surely high; that's the borrowing associated with ""C"" in the Bluebook  I think that means we'd make up for it  Well, we could do it by saying ""forgetting the shortfall in October""  Yes, I think that's what we're doing We're accepting the shortfall and saying Let's get it back on 7 percent from now on, if we reasonably can  How about something like ""While taking note of the moderate shortfall in growth of the aggregates during October""-- and it was only a moderate shortfall--""the Committee continues to seek  -61-    11/17/81  expansion at the rate of about 7 percent in M1-B and 10-1/2 percent in M2 in the period ahead"" And that says we gave up October  Yes, taking note, we continue to seek--  I didn't have the Bluebook open right there I think 10-1/2 percent is about--  I really don't think this is a good month to try to reform the way we state the directive It's in the middle of a quarter, as you said before; it's at the end of a year; and it's in a period where we're going to fall short of our growth for the year as a whole And we just shouldn't be doing fancy things with the directive right now If we want to do it, we can do it in January and start out a new year with a--  I don't think so either  We could be more specific as to the time period by saying ""for the remainder of the year"" instead of ""in the period ahead""  SPEAKER(?) That is five weeks?  It's essentially November and December  Oh, I didn't specify that We were just talking about directive language The specs the Chairman will recommend to us, I'm sure  16 percent, ha, ha, ha  A lot has happened in a month  That centers it on 13 percent  That's what I have 7 percent for M1-B and 11 percent for M2 for the remainder of the year  How am I going to [contend] with having a consultation at 11 percent? Usually I'm against that kind of thing  I would prefer it  Acceptable is what you want?  The moderate shortfall It's the only month when we had just a moderate shortfall  Say ""for the remainder of the year"" so that we don't have to say November to December  We don't specify M3  No, we didn't We expected 129 percent  I just said ""about""  Yes, I said ""about"" 7 and 11 percent ""Around"" is all right  We were expecting apparently a higher October number than we got by a couple of points  It was surprising, considering all savers certificates  How about ""eliminated it in two stages""  Except to the extent that they're in that paragraph that indicates the preliminary specifications "
1966,1981-12-21,"  It wasn't that much       That is what I was thinking  He thought he  delivered a strong message and we didn't even hear it!       I can hardly remember [what was said]      Eastern Pennsylvania you mean?  I have a few butterflies about it myself  There was a holdback on big companies that extended to the spring of 1974  Employers with 5,000 or more--  Well, I guess the tone of the conversation is getting a little too gloomy for me I would remind you that we are having the largest tax cut in the postwar history of the country That will be taking effect in stages over a period of time Henry referred to the 10 percent cut next June 30 In addition, there is a sizable relaxation that occurs as of January 1, just a few days away, for a wide range of activities that well could have a little more oomph in them as a result of the change in tax treatment I would point out that housing is very low I suppose [starts] could drop from 800,000 to zero--well, to 500,000 or something like that--but the downside risk can't be very large at this level Nor can domestic car sales go very much below the [recent pace of] 5 million for very long, given the fact that people still need cars in order to drive And inventories of cars on the road are depreciating and the stock, as somebody said, is declining Fred, I think you mentioned that a decline in the stock of cars is occurring So, some of the areas that are customarily sources of weakness can't be that much of a source of weakness from this point on, in my view  I'd rather agree with Lyle that there is some exposure in plant and equipment We were talking about that this morning, and I would be inclined to think that there might be a little larger decline and perhaps a good deal larger decline than the staff has in its forecast But again, for every inch that you give there, the less  -16-    12/21-22/81  pressure there is on financial markets and money markets And it seems to me that we can almost, with a little lag, get a substitution of housing for plant and equipment if in fact we get that much weakness in the system Also, this Christmas of 1981 is not good but, on the other hand, it is not just abysmal Let us not be too gloomy; we ought to get a recovery, I think, sometime in 1982  Yes, something like that  There is hardly any increase, is there Jim?  Well, I don't think we are either We had such a series of extremely gloomy comments that I thought I ought to say something on the other side  No  One of my problems with talking about money demand is, as you say, that we don't know what it will be beforehand I never know what it was afterwards! It seems to me that what we say was a change of money demand is just the residual that one can't explain So I am a little reluctant to do a lot of changing on the basis of that, although I suppose one could say that this year there seems to have been a better economy until recently than one would have expected, given the very low money growth that we had in M1-B I assume you are talking about M1-B  When you are talking about money demand, you are not talking about the [broader measures]?  On the technical side, I don't really understand M2 either, but one thing that has disturbed me about it is that it seems to me to be subject to the possibility of coming in higher as a result of the structural changes Steve mentioned it We have IRA and Keogh accounts, and nobody really knows how they are going to go over the next year They involve a very long-term commitment of funds, but there is a very desirable tax effect from [getting into them] I just don't know how it will go In addition, we have the fact that people who are uncertain about the future at least now have the option of going to money market funds from the market itself We have seen continued rapid growth in recent months in the money market funds, partly because of the uncertainty, and that could continue in the period ahead But even more broadly, all of the efforts on the part of the government and the administration to stimulate savings could be successful That is, we have IRA/Keoghs, the tax [cut], the all savers certificate, and the reduction in the maximum rate on earned income from 70 to 50 percent And if [such saving] were to materialize, it seems to me it would tend to show up in the M2 number Now, you have projected an increase in the personal saving rate for next year You mentioned the decline in the increase in nominal GNP-- there is an increase of 1/2 percentage point, I think--but there is also a 1/2 point increase in the saving rate projected from 1981 to 1982 So I wonder whether, in fact, we don't need in that broader aggregate to allow for the possibility at least that there is going to be a larger gross flow that makes up the picture of the new economy Now, I don't think what I say applies to M1-B There may be some downward drift in the demand function But it is associated mainly with transactions except for very, very temporary periods such as  -24-    12/21-22/81  right now when maybe NOW accounts have some extra money in them as a parking place I am not saying anything about numbers because I think it is too early to do that, but as we look ahead I think we should take into account not only what Nancy said about a tendency to miss on the M1 versus M2 and M3, but also what the effect of a changing structure of the economy would be on the comparison between M1 and M2 and M3  Weather permitting  [Meeting recessed]  -28-    12/21-22/81  December 22, 1981--Morning Session  Maybe it's currency  Well, he certainly wrote an analysis I am sure  From the fourth quarter of 1979 to the fourth quarter of 1981?  Two years?  I just figured 10 million accounts at $2,000 is $20 billion  Or [it could] raise the saving rate  It could  I don't think so  I wonder where the thrift plan is in these Ms?  Never?  It certainly is the most active    12/21-22/81  I couldn't agree more, Paul It is very analogous to our difficulty in dealing with savings accounts over time Savings accounts have more turnover than money market funds and  -44-    12/21-22/81  yet we never put any portion of savings accounts in M1 Indeed, we didn't even blink an eye when [depository institutions] went from interest figured on the minimum balance to interest from day of deposit to day of withdrawal, which was a big change in savings accounts We never did a thing about it I don't think we have ever handled the notion of savings accounts at all well in research that I can recall, extending back into the 1950s, in terms of what to do with savings accounts and how to treat their ""moneyness"" in looking at monetary expansion So, I think it is not really the turnover but [their use as a] backup that's terribly important The difference between a money market fund which you can have immediate access to and an IRA account which you can't draw on until you're 59-1/2 years old is really phenomenal, and yet they are both in M2  Well, just so we have everything in front of us, I also would like to point out that there is the problem of choosing the base in doing next year's targeting We've rather easily slipped over the fact that there was a considerable shortfall in M1-B this year In fact, Jerry had an interesting explanation for it--and I think it's something we ought to work on--that involves a 2-year look at the expansion of M1-B But there are a good many people who have been greatly afflicted by high interest rates and poor business and bankruptcy who won't quite understand why it is that we just disregard the shortfall entirely and go on and assign the same old lower growth rate to M1 in the year to come I think it is a very serious problem that we have to deal with in explaining, if that is what we want to do, why it is what we want to do Most people would say we ought to add our shortfall in 1981 into the 1982 expectations  Yes, but it didn't involve bankruptcy the way it does now I am talking about builders and realtors and people like that who just aren't going to understand it and quite a few Congressmen who already have begun to focus on this issue in looking at 1982  Well, I think most people would regard M2 as a very much lesser target of policy That hasn't been the emphasis at all, for a very good reason in my view Of course, we differ on that, but it is a problem we have to take into account now It happens to be most pointed in this particular Bluebook because in this Bluebook we have the sense--and it was referred to earlier, I think, by Frank in a somewhat negative way--that we have a year in which we've fallen progressively short in M1-B and we finally got 2 or 3 months that are up October was a normative or maybe a slightly more than normative month; November was a little strong; and December is another sort of normative month But choosing the fourth quarter as the base means that December is above the fourth-quarter average so that when we ask ""How are we going to be on track for the first quarter?"" we get very  -46-    12/21-22/81  low money rate objectives, and everyone notices that [Growth] is only 1/2 or 2 percent, depending on which alternative one takes; the fact is that it is very hard to explain We are still below target and now we are talking about getting down to the new target in this very meeting, in the second part of this meeting that we are going to have It seems to me that's a very [unintelligible] representation of the problem we have  No, the law doesn't say that It says the year  Well, if we wanted to take that 4-1/2 percent [year-over-year growth] for '81 and have, say, 4 percent for '82 for the annual average, I think we'd find that the quarterly growth rate would have to be quite a bit more than that  I see  Tony, the 4 percent is the quarterly average? Is that what you're explaining?  What was your M2 number?  He doesn't want interest rates to go up  Well, I have no difficulty with the funds range that you specified Tony, of 10 to 14 percent We're right about at the midpoint of it now and that assumes that it might drift a little lower but not very much, at least initially I don't know but I think either $350 or $400 million on borrowing would be all right I'd certainly accept the $350 million I do think that your objectives for M1 and M2 are pretty stingy Page 2 of the Bluebook shows a September-to-Deceber increase in M1-B shift-adjusted of 63 percent Now, that has benefitted some from the shift adjustment; that is, I don't have an M1 figure here But if it weren't shift-adjusted, it would be somewhat higher than that--7-1/2 percent or something like that  I am looking at page 2; I can't work with these alternatives which don't have the correct figures on that So I am trying to look at what experience has been recently as against what we're plotting for the period ahead It shows an increase from September to December--but if anything December is raising it just a little--and that goes into our numbers that we're calculating looking ahead as maybe something like 7-1/2 percent in M1 as newly defined and 12-1/2 percent in M2 You are cutting those to 4 and 9 percent That's a pretty sharp cut in the growth rate compared with what we have been experiencing recently And I think that's too abrupt I would prefer an M1 of 5 percent and an M2 of 10 percent as a center point for November to March I don't think anybody would be surprised at that or regard it as being unduly expansive; in fact they might regard it as being pretty restrictive compared with recent experience and [given] the shortfall we've had  Five I am just picking it almost out of the air but a 5 percent M1 seems to me like a normative M1; and if we took 5 percent and 10 percent for the two numbers, that's really quite a bit less [growth] than we've had recently in both M1 and M2  That will mean even less in the course [of the 4-month period]; and we'll review it again in early February The other thing I'd just comment on is that I don't know what to make of those NOW accounts I'm inclined to think it is an error in the seasonal adjustment but I am not sure It could be that there is a big build-up in precautionary balances in NOW accounts, as the staff says, and that might well continue right on through the winter if that is the case  Well, that's right And that is why I think [the explanation] may be the seasonal The seasonal doesn't have the advantage of knowing what those household accounts have done in past years  Or just temporary parking because people are scared they may lose their jobs  You know, it makes a difference I think Lyle is right that we want to watch that carefully to see whether [NOW accounts] continue to be the source of strength in M1 and regard that a little differently than if it is in corporate balances or in traditional demand accounts where one might think that a build-up would be a predecessor, as Larry likes to say, to an expansion in activity, which also could be the case We might be right on the edge of a recovery in the economy and not know it But it is just not  -56    12/21-22/81  clear to me which is the case Nevertheless, my basic point is that 4 and 9 percent are so far below what we recently have had that they are too low to shoot for, and I would rather have 5 and 10 percent but with your parameters on the funds rate and initial borrowings, Tony  If you look specifically at the staff's numbers on page 12 for M1 under alternative B, which is about what Tony had in mind, that calls for a December of 8 percent and then a January and February of 22 percent in each month  Well, it is very hard to know what December will be There is some exposure here to having to seek quite low numbers  It seldom happens!  I want to be associated with those remarks and I'd like to join Governor Wallich, too  We have been carrying 7 percent for months as our objective on Ml-B  Yes, there's some room to bring it down  It made a three point difference in November  From the perception of whom? From the financial markets or the people who are unemployed?  But what is going to bring down M2 growth in the period?  Won't that shift into another component of M2?  You have a December estimate of 126 percent in the Bluebook?  You have it dropping to 73 percent in January I don't quite see what is going to bring about that slowing from 12 to 7 percent, if we don't really care what the figures are  That's the trouble, you see; that really pinches it  Yes, it's really M1 that's 8 percent  And then it has to drop to 2 percent  I know  How about both ""about 4 to 5 percent"" and ""about 9 to 10 percent""?  Well, I am going to vote to raise [the target  for] M2 at the next meeting We are starting in 1982  Get it down  That's a very bad principle but I thought we had gotten away from that  I would be happier with 5 and 9  Yes, put it at 4-1/2 That is a way of doing 4-1/2 percent  NOW and similar accounts?  This would be published when, Murray, February 5th?  And when do you [testify], do you know?  You haven't asked about who would prefer 5 and 10  And I thought you were going to say ""prefer"" and ""live with""  Yes, I am pretty sure we did  Well, we are talking about the short term here The M2 growth rate was 16 percent for the month of November And how are we going to bring it down?  We have to start someplace, though, Henry  -75-    12/21-22/81  That is all we are talking about  There will be a longer projection [horizon], too, won't there? You will have to give us some look at 1983?  Did you ever see that draft with the segregable facts?  Well, I was there, too, and-- "
1992,1982-02-01," To pick up on your comment, Mr Chairman, I did get the impression as we went through the chart show and discussed the outlook [at the Board briefing] this morning that this is not a forecast that emphasizes the negative Everything's possible, but you have a really remarkable decline, as the Chairman said, in compensation per hour It could occur But, as you know, it's toward the extreme of what one might think could happen I must say that your output per hour forecast strikes me as being pretty strong, given the fact that there won't be much recovery in the economy under your projection As a matter of fact, for the period from the latter half of 1982 to 1983 you have the longest sustained increase in output per hour that we've had since 1977 When you look at prices relative to unit labor costs on the next page, the price index goes down nicely, mirroring the decline in unit labor costs There apparently isn't anything that occurs in food or anything else that tends to [push] prices up  On the real side of the economy, it seems to me that you have an extraordinarily optimistic projection for plant and equipment [spending] given the capacity utilization chart shown and also the financial factors that are on the page previous to that And finally, you have consumption really doing pretty well Apparently, none of    2/1-2/82  the alleged effects of cuts in tax rates is working in terms of stimulating savings So, therefore, consumption remains high relative to after-tax income The general impression I get is that this is a pretty upbeat forecast that you're giving us, under the circumstances Would you like to comment on that?  Well, as a matter of personal preference, would you say that there are more downside risks or upside risks in your projections?  That's my impression too  Yes, but that was just a few days ago  Is that really true? It wouldn't equilibrate?  I'm struck by the fact that your chart show has real GNP relative to potential dropping to the lowest level since 1960 That is a fairly long time period If you were to raise that level relative to potential by a point or two--from 91 to 92 or 93--I wouldn't think it would do an awful lot for inflation or interest    2/1-2/82  rates because that would only produce a somewhat [higher] lowest level since 1960 in the GNP relative to potential  You're talking about real rates building to 10 percent or thereabouts, aren't you?  Just a little on the economy--  In the short run  I guess what you're saying is that that big hunk of 42 percent of the demand for funds is not interest sensitive at all Therefore, you have to force the real rate up on the residual in order to keep the total down to the point that it fits within your monetary assumption  Well, the first effect would be lower GNP because you have the reduced federal spending; but the second effect would be the impact lower interest rates would have on expanding total demands  What kind of seasonal do you have on the NOW accounts? Are you using your own seasonal because you have this--?  Unadjusted data, I see  The only trouble is that we don't know if it's temporary or permanent  It's April 1  One of their last chances to get a free one!    2/1-2/82  This is a different Auerbach  Only a half point over  Well, I would support John Balles and his proposals I would prefer not to fiddle with the base because that's going to be so hard to explain and so difficult to deal with I would rather consider the possibility that M1 growth is going to be high in the range because we had a shortfall of size last year that was just being made up toward the very end of the year and into January I do think, though, that the fact that we have had a shortfall and that we obviously have a very weak economy is a pretty good reason for saying that on reconsideration we think a number as low as 2-1/2 percent for 1982 would be too low, and therefore we're going to nudge the lower end up to 3 percent and make the range 3 to 5-1/2 percent, which is our typical 2-1/2 point range [for M1]  On M2, I do believe that there are things that have tended to add to its growth relative to the economy over time They keep happening We had a number of them last year Some, like the all savers certificates, didn't really work out, though it could come back this year if interest rates at some point rose to a high enough level Others involve considerable lead times and change gradually, such as the IRAs and the Keoghs, some considerable part of which is going to be showing up Maybe we can make some kind of adjustment for it but I really don't think we're going to have the figures to adjust M2 by taking out all IRA and Keogh accounts, which tend to be spread through the deposit instruments in the banks; they are not just in one deposit instrument That's the terrible problem, I believe Then we have things like the Treasury's proposal to start charging a fee [for noncompetitive tenders] or to shut off altogether the lines of people at the Federal Reserve Banks and at the main Treasury [building] The effect of that will tend to be--and it is intended--to push money into deposits that are in M2 form rather than to open market instruments So, there is a whole series of these things It's not totally without reflection in the numbers If you look back, you'll find that in 1980 nominal GNP rose 94 percent with a 91 percent growth in M2 Then in 1981, GNP rose 93 percent with 94 percent M2 growth There is 01 less GNP with a 03 larger increase in M2 Most people are looking at something in the area of 8-1/2 to 9 percent for nominal GNP growth    2/1-2/82  this year That certainly is where the whole focus of the range of expectations for both voting presidents and nonvoting presidents and Board members is And that suggests to me very strongly that we're going to have an M2 growth of 9 percent or above, maybe 9-1/2 percent Therefore, I see no great reason for starting out with a range, which is supposed to give us some flexibility, in which we expect to come in at the very top right from the word go So, I think it would be best to recognize that there has been a tendency for the kinds of instruments included in M2 to increase in popularity and also a tendency for the number to be high relative to our ranges and, therefore, to say that we're raising the range And I think 7 to 10 percent is about right So, I guess for somewhat different reasons, I'd come down with John  I would be inclined to be sympathetic to that, except that as I understand it we were targeting in terms of M1-B shift adjusted  I read that footnote on page 12 and that's what led me not to want to do that  Yes  We said at midyear that we would look at it seriously in January  47 percent  Do you mean we ought to reduce the funds rate range in order to choke off the money supply?  Yes, but I think--  Go to contemporaneous [reserve accounting] and close the window  Page 10 has November to March  Because it has already occurred  By ""where we are"" do you mean the level of the money supply?  Not the rate of increase, but the level?    2/1-2/82  We would let borrowings go up  What were we seeking? I lost track  It got up from $12 billion to $15 billion  It's hard to imagine a negative between now and the next meeting that would be so large that we would think it was an excessive washout of the bulge I guess there is such a number--25 or 30 percent--but it has to be awfully big because it was a 22 percent increase  By the end of three months some of us were getting concerned  I just might point out, Larry, that when we moved in April, we moved in the context of the strongest quarter in GNP that we had seen for a long time--the first quarter Now we would be moving in a context of the weakest quarter in GNP that we've seen since the spring of 1980 The economic circumstances are quite a lot different than they were then  I think we ought to do away with the funds rate range I think this is the perfect meeting just to do away with it  It's the first meeting of the year We're totally at sea We have a very simple suggestion from the Chairman, which is that we target for zero [M1] growth and we accept any shortfall And we take the rate that comes up  So we throw out zero and we come up--  Sure We opt to take it out; we don't want it  Well, I have great faith in the conservatism of our management  It was in the Bluebook  Well, M2 growth in January anyway was 112 percent, or that's the estimate  Well, do you believe that the parked money is going to move entirely out of the Ms? I think a lot of it will shift from M1-B or M1 into M2 components and, therefore, if we set an 8 percent limit, we would have a pretty tough policy  Well, I think the only question Nancy is asking is Will you let the usual arithmetic relationship show through in lower borrowings if in fact there is weakness below zero in the money supply?  I think we might well have an adjustment  [The leeway] is only $12 million  The saving rate could be more influential because presumably this would be money that otherwise would have been going into consumption I don't know what a 1 percentage point increase in the saving rate would be--  Most of it I should think  Well, you said more equity in housing That seems to me extremely unlikely this year  Housing is nonexistent  But housing is not a personal consumption expenditure Housing investment is an investment expenditure, not a consumption expenditure  I think that's true As Jerry said, if one takes cash income and pays off mortgage debt, then obviously that cash income isn't used to consume and, therefore, it raises the saving rate  We didn't have any  That's right  I would emphasize the incremental possibilities more than Lyle would I think M2 has about an even velocity, which would suggest 8-1/2 percent But then there probably is a bias on the side of getting a little larger increase So, I think it's very possible that we will be over 9 percent this year Now, if you say to me that you don't care if it's over by a few tenths, because it was over by a few tenths last year and the year before, then you're telling me that it's not a binding range And then I don't care where we put it; we can put it at 3 to 5 percent or whatever!  I agree with that  SPEAKER(?) I agree  Shift in [demand]  Who, Meese?  I agree with that  You would add the 12 percent that rebases it?  Visually  Yes  Well, it is a question of how many we want to save I think then--  I think we may lose another few hundred as a result of policy, but we would not lose them all On the other hand, I cannot think of any way we could save them  I would say they are one of the many casualties of monetary policy, but we did not intend it  Well, I do not think the key to the thrifts is long rates; I think it is short rates But in general I agree with what you have said  But we are talking about liberalizing the M2 range  Because we were above the range  Well, at least change the conditions [for access to the discount window] We do not let them close it altogether  I do not think we are saying that the range would be subject to change, John What we would do is rebase the range In a way we would consider January a part of last year to a degree  Well, we are only talking about rebasing M1, I believe  Well, I think Larry is right It will be worse in the spring  What are the options?  Or whether we rebase now?  Our record shows that  You want to be pretty specific about it, because the way you just stated it, it sounds as if we have flinched  Yes, that is the analytic argument  That is one view There is a minority--  I don't know; there were quite a number on M2, I think I did not distinguish between voting members and other presidents  That we are not going to change anything?  I fourth it I think we could [present] this, Paul, as being consistent with the President's program The President is after more savings and more investment, and we have major changes in tax policy that are designed to bring that about Therefore, we anticipate that we might have a somewhat higher M2 because that is the form in which it would show up In addition, we have been high on M2 anyway because it is so closely related to the nominal [GNP] increase and expenditures in the economy and, therefore, we are raising it  Well, that is going to be very hard to do I'm afraid They are in a bunch of different deposit forms They are not just in--  I anticipate real difficulty  A lot of them are in small saver certificates and--  That probably would not be in M2 If you were prepared to say that we would take account of growth in IRAs and Keogh accounts and any change in the saving rate that occurred in response  -103-    2/1-2/82  to the President's program, then I guess I could live with 6 to 9 percent, because I think that would be saying that we would accept something higher than that  Just take account of it All we do is conclude that it would be higher if we say--  It is very fuzzy  Then we almost have to raise the range for bank credit, don't we?  -106    2/1-2/82  Why don't we say ""no further growth""?    2/1-2/82  Would it be acceptable without declining interest rates? It would be acceptable period, wouldn't it?  It struck me as being an inconsistency  I think we probably do, but [we can] have conferences [by telephone]  March 2nd then "
2020,1982-03-29," I'll second that  I'll second that  So moved  Second  Second  To make what permanent?  I thought we had to make a determination on this, Mr Chairman, as to whether it is necessary [for the effective functioning of] the market Isn't that right, Peter?  I take it anyone who wanted to question it could put it on the agenda?  So moved  [Unintelligible] markets seem to be right  It's interesting Are they aware of the fact that we've made these adjustments to our procedure? It seems these adjustments to procedure would lead one to expect a larger rise in April because of what has happened [in the] seasonal  That's the reason I asked if the market knew we were doing all this [If] not, they might conclude there's going to be a large seasonally adjusted rise in April  What about that June 30th reduction? That's worth about $35 billion, at an annual rate, which would be $9 billion a [quarter], or close to that That would be a good deal of it right there  Jim, as I understand it, essentially what you have in the forecast is a generalized shot of purchasing power coming from the tax cut being offset by continued very stringent conditions in financial markets and, therefore, in credit-using sectors of the economy, such as housing and plant and equipment and, to a lesser extent, consumer durable goods I can't fault the arithmetic of that because it is a big shot that comes from the tax cut But the effect of this is to extend, and maybe even further aggravate, the extreme frequency distribution of situations that industries find themselves in [We have] what is generally a flat economy, with housing remaining very low, with automobile sales really still quite low, and with a considerable threat of a decline in capital spending and [that would have] an effect on those industries It's awfully difficult to state this, but I'm wondering what the psychological impact could be    3/29-30/82  of seeing these industries and these parts of the country continue to deteriorate or at least not improve, looking on through the year Could it have a psychological effect or something like that on capital spending or consumption that would make this forecast not work out?  Well, that's along the lines of what I'm thinking We have had a tremendous increase in business bankruptcies and they could go tremendously higher in the period to come There are people in towns in the Midwest who have run through almost every avenue of income maintenance available to them and they're about to be dropped off, with no income to speak of, in a situation where they still have to maintain somehow those communities and families All that gets reported very, very actively in the media, so that it can have a psychological effect on the whole country even though it might be happening mainly in Michigan, Indiana, and Ohio, and a few places like that And I am concerned about what the--  Yes, they're going to have volume declines in size, I would think  The banks have the bottom bid in the auction-- the take-out  Yes  Returning to this question of credit flows, which goes a little with your question, Tony I was interested in that, too, because here we have rising interest rates and we're talking about crowding out So, I wondered what the figures would show on credit raised by the economy I find that in the last three quarters--that is, since [the start of] the period of downturn--the total funds raised in the third quarter, fourth quarter, and the first quarter this year as estimated amount to only 118 percent of the GNP To give you an idea, that's almost exactly the same as in the 1974-75 recession in relation to the GNP And that compares with 16 percent in 1979, 18-1/2 percent in 1978, and 17-1/2 percent in 1977 So, it's a very much smaller flow of funds to credit users than is typical It's typical of a deep recession and continues to be typical of a deep recession in the first quarter even though interest rates turned up And by the way, those figures include the government If it weren't for the government, indeed, the figures would be close to recent historical lows of only 7 percent of GNP being now represented by credit to private sectors If you look ahead, the interesting thing is that the staff's flow of funds forecast--they have a flow of funds forecast that's consistent with their Greenbook forecast--doesn't show any improvement at all in private credit flows compared with the GNP What happens is that the government credit flows go up because of the deficit, but the private credit flows stay around the very low 7 percent area in relation to GNP That says to me, really, that what is being forecast is whatever interest rate is necessary to keep private credit from getting going again And that's the crowding out hypothesis, I think But we should not say that there's a tremendous flow of credit in these markets As a matter of fact the flow of credit is unusually small and it will remain unusually small relative to recent years even with these large government deficits  I think he said that you were responsible!  That's not M2 but its nontransactions component?  Well, I want to come back to NOW accounts I have basically the same concern that you expressed, Paul If you look at the behavior of the narrow aggregate as it used to be defined, it looks as if there's some squeeze on it If you look at it with NOW accounts in it, it looks rather substantial As a matter of fact, to put an exact point on it, if you use the old definition of M1-- currency and demand deposits--you will find that in the seven months since the cyclical peak it has increased at an annual rate of only 1-1/2 percent, which is the lowest growth rate of the last four recessions  On the other hand, if you include NOW accounts, you will find that it has increased 7 percent at an annual rate in the seven months since the cyclical peak, which is the fastest rate of the last four recessions So the way one looks at this NOW account surge makes all the difference in the world It may be that Frank is right I think we probably don't have a very good handle on how many NOW accounts are being opened And I rather despair, this far into the exercise, of finding out much really useful information on the number of new accounts If he is right, it's not going to come out again because those are new accounts and the funds won't come out Or it may be that Steve is right that [the bulge reflects] precautionary balances but we don't know whether those precautionary balances are going to come out or not But the fact of the matter is that over the last several months we've had very large growth rates in the NOW account component What they call OCDs now was still 20 percent or thereabouts in March, Steve I think that ought to affect the way that we look at this target rate simply because we don't know what is going to happen to that component We can't continue to squeeze what amounts to corporate balances in order to accommodate the rise of NOW accounts if they continue to rise at a very rapid rate in the period ahead  As I look at those paths, there's nothing at all exceptional about ""A"" It has 4-1/2 percent growth [in M1] in the 3 months from March to June That 4-1/2 percent growth doesn't sound like a large growth rate to me for M1 and that includes whatever disproportionate increase was occurring in NOW accounts over that time It didn't seem large in March; it was about 2 percent February was, of course, minus but that was an unwinding of the demand deposit explosion in January which did in fact, as you expected, totally unwind in the month of February Therefore, my view is that we ought to be prepared  -38-    3/29-30/82  to accept modest continuing growth in M1, and 4-1/2 percent in my view is modest And if, in fact, these NOW accounts don't come out--that is, if we don't get some correction of this very large increase that we had over the fall and winter--I don't think that will impact on the second half of the year because my view of the matter is that we ought to change our targets We ought to accept a higher growth rate for the year as a whole, which would have been entirely because of the increase early in the year associated with this explosion in NOW accounts That's if those balances don't come out If they do come out, then we can make room for it I must say I see no reason to squeeze the economy harder and harder at this point in time, given the conditions that we've been talking about and given the fact that we are looking at something that has the cosmetic oddity of an explosion in NOW accounts accounting for virtually all of the strength that we have seen  Do you mean M1 or M2?  But M2 contains all these things  It's a mixed account, Larry It has elements of a savings account in it, too  Well, the money would have been there before but it would have been in savings accounts  Well, yes Larry, I don't regard that target for this year as set in stone I think there are circumstances under which we would be prepared to shift the target What I said was that if the NOW account dominance continues and we find ourselves, let's say when we next meet, looking at a sustained 30 percent rate of increase in NOW accounts or something like that, I think then would be the time to consider whether or not to make an adjustment in the targets for the year, based on an unexpected strength in NOW accounts --not in M1 generally, but in the NOW account performance--because of some kind of precautionary development Now, I'm inclined to think that [the bulge] is going to come out I can't understand why people would keep so much money in their NOW accounts at 5 percent interest when they can get substantially more in almost any alternative they could go into Or, Paul may be right; the seasonal may be bad, but that would bring it out too That is, if the seasonal has been wrong in the first part of the year, by definition it will be wrong later on and we'll see a weakness in NOW accounts Or it could be that the sweep accounts will develop so that we'll get an observed slowing in Ml because sweeps are taking money out of the accounts I don't want to prejudge at this point but I'd just say that if in fact NOW accounts continue to perform as they have so far this year I, for one, certainly would be prepared to change the targets And I think the Chairman could very readily state why we changed the targets It would not be because we eased but because of this unexpected development with regard to NOW accounts We have to have that kind of freedom or we're slavishly stuck with numbers whose contents we don't know  One other comment I would like to make is that I rather agree with the thought that we ought to use M2 more as an information device But I'm still very concerned that I don't have a good handle on what information M2 is giving us It looks as if we are going to have to pay more attention to M2 in the period ahead than in the period past, and I would like to have the staff begin to develop a rationale, which so far is totally lacking, for using an M2 guide [We need information on] what kind of cyclical attributes or interest rates or elasticity attributes M2 would have I think we need that before we can really rely on it, because we don't know what the behavior of that number [means] in the short run  Well, of course, there are people who maintain just the opposite that M2 is a better predictor I think the last    3/29-30/82  study I was associated with showed that we got very little additional information when we added the M2 components to M1 And I don't know that that has changed much But M1 is deteriorating, I think, and it may be that we'll have to have a rationale for using M2 There's no reason that can't be developed After all, until he found that he didn't have so much to hit the Federal Reserve over the head with, Milton Friedman was for M2; it's only recently that he has changed to M1  Except for you  Well, we wouldn't have to [change the ranges] in fact until the July meeting  Well, as you say, as a practical matter, it's almost entirely where we set April ""B"" has April at 91 percent and ""A"" has it at 99 percent I don't care whether it is put at 9 or--  Then why don't we widen that range again to where we like it and make it 11 to 16 percent?  A lot of Committee members would like a wider fed funds range and this seems an ideal time to do it, consistent with those desires, Mr Chairman  As you suggest this, would you visualize that we would say in the directive that we're seeking growth in M1 at a 3 percent rate from March to June? No, it can't be; that's too low  It's well below, I tell you As we say, we are prepared to take 5 percent or so when we are running in a current state well below what we say our target ranges are I'm prepared to give up I'm prepared to concede the winter as being a NOW account surge if it doesn't go away  But if it goes away, we ought to be running a steady state that is closer to our target ranges  But M2 has very little effect on the path  Yes, I would buy that  Yes, I agree But I thought we were wavering on what we were going to build into the path  Then we'd have a quite weak May and June  That's right  That's right  I can't really imagine, Bob, whether we choose $11 or $12 or $1-1/4 billion for the initial borrowing level, that it is going to affect long-term interest rates  They won't even know what we have decided here until the middle of May and then it will all be history  What are the borrowing numbers? Now I'm totally confused What has been the recent record of borrowing that we are associating this beginning number with?  Well, that $1-1/4 billion sounds fine  Yes, it's probably about 1-1/4 percent, I think  I would have thought that we would want to look more at what NOW accounts were doing  Higher than what?  Which is probably what it will be doing  SPEAKER(?) Yes  Operationally, you are going to put in 9 percent for April?  And we are going to start with what initial borrowing level?  Make it $1150 billion    3/29-30/82  Well, it's never entirely wrong, either!  That, however, probably increases the odds that we'll be wrong in the future "
2045,1982-05-18," It was bound to happen one day or another  This is the interest payment?  A fly-by-night concern with $4-1/2 billion in [longs]!  We have a disorderly market clause, don't we?  We used to have one fairly customarily I didn't realize it had dropped away  And the threat, as you see it, is that they may have to dump the government [securities]?  Well, a little caution in financing is not an unhappy development  We've known of these fly-by-night operators; I don't think this one fits your description I don't think it's the one we've been tracking but another one But, you know, it's one of those things There are very bad practices in the market  We did very little for Brown  [Prices in] the long market have been inching up over the last six weeks These people must have been pretty deep under water  Do you mean because people won't lend on governments? But they would lend at some margin, wouldn't they?  It's the risk of the game  They usually do  Well, if some positions are frozen, we may have to do some lending at the window, depending on what happens But I agree with you that we ought to be prepared to cushion the decline and that we should pay not a whit of attention to the position of the guy who is in trouble And we shouldn't be in a position of seeming to assist the banks in avoiding losses in this case  He's not the first  And lawyers!  So moved  I read the report as indicating you had no reservations whatsoever, Dave Is that right?  Fine, thanks  The Mexican borrowing was a window-dressing thing until the end of April, as I recall That is, they had to have a certain amount of cover as of the last day of April We are more than halfway through May Does it repeat at the end of May or do they have something that they are doing that will improve their situation?    5/18/82  Two weeks to go  No  What did they need? Was it $600 million that we [extended]?  So, they are $600 million under water already  One month!  You don't feel that the demand for housing might fade as rates come down? There has been a lot of talk to the effect that when rates come down, housing demand will explode again or at least come back very nicely and quickly turn  But the question is Are people no longer looking at houses as a source of profits? Are they looking at job instability or income prospects that would make them less willing than they would have been a year ago to pay, say, 13 percent on mortgages?  I read that Chicago report, Si, as indicating also a giving up in terms of expectations, not just for the next few months, but for the next several years--along the lines of Ed's comment Was that the sense of the--?  You could rent one of those planes!  I don't know that I have very much to add to what was said before the break I'm not optimistic on the business outlook It seems to me that the new factor is the possibility of a distinctly deeper drop in capital spending than we have been looking at I would point out to you that the surveys have been progressively less good The McGraw-Hill survey now shows a sizable decline in real capital spending for the year And when you talk to businessmen and look at the Redbook and things like that, one gets a sense that there is a very substantial conservatism that is now being introduced into the management of companies and that cash positions are a little strained But I also have to admit that I have some sympathy with Larry Roos' point This is a painful, difficult period that we're going through We expected that, I think; at least I certainly did It is necessary to squeeze profits unmercifully, Henry, in order to get businesses to cut their costs and become more efficient and to resist wage increases of size And in the process, we're going to have some business failures--quite a few failures We have a whole regime of business enterprises that had heavy debt ratios and were banking on inflation Now that we're not going to have inflation because that's our official posture, they are going to have to fail It may be a sizable proportion of the business community and it may include quite a few government securities dealers and people who speculate in securities of various kinds We just have to take these kinds of things as they come because what we want to do, if I understand it--and what we've put the economy through hell for over the last 2-1/2 years--is to reduce inflation So, let's get the inflation reduced and let the people suffer who are going to suffer as a result At least that's my view  One caveat that I think is important was expressed at the last Academic Consultants meeting that we had Somebody said that the recession in 1929 didn't look too bad for the first 9 or 10 months; one might reasonably have thought after that period that the economy was going to recover and would be all right But there was a second- tier decline And that was much sharper and it occurred because of financial collapse So, if we really do have a crisis here with this  -23-    5/18/82  firm, or if a crisis developed that tested the very financial fabric of the economy, I think we would have to deal with that But short of that it seems to me that all we're hearing--and there's a considerable amount of it--is the pain that occurs when we have more than just a temporary little recession within a secular upward movement [in the economy] and instead have something that is going to affect a much broader number of people, businesses, profits, etcetera So, I'm alarmed, but I'm not yet panicked  Peter, was the currency shipment to Argentina a noticeable factor?  Well, I think we do need to review the long- range targets A very, very large proportion of the increase in M1 since the beginning of the year has been in NOW accounts I think it's 85 percent I had that number someplace but I can't find it now; but it's a very large proportion That is suggestive of the possibility of a change in precautionary balances that might not continue, but at least we shouldn't try to offset the lower growth rates for something that occurred in the early part of the year and is already water over the dam I also didn't know that Argentina accounted for million of the money supply increase in April That takes off a good deal of the strength in currency this year I thought that April bulge indicated that people were spending All that increase in currency indicates is that the Argentineans are afraid they might have their money taken away from them We should make allowance for that kind of thing, and that's going to continue for some time into the future  As far as this meeting is concerned, I'm also attracted to continuing on the target path that we set at the beginning of the quarter, which is alternative B It calls for an increase in the money supply in June--May is largely over and seems to be minus--of 43 percent or thereabouts and continued expansion in M2 throughout the quarter I'd be most concerned if we didn't get that June increase Last year we didn't, if you recall; money growth in June was very weak And we ought to be prepared to move in case weakness develops as we go through the period So, I would take ""B"" for this time but reserve [my options] on the question of respecifying the aggregates for the year, which we'll be doing at our early July meeting I rather like Mr Ford's idea of widening the [funds rate] range I wouldn't look forward to a 16 percent funds rate; on the other hand, I do think it could drop as low as 10 percent So, I would widen it just on the lower end and make it 10 to 15 percent; and I'd choose a beginning borrowing number that is somewhat skewed in the direction of encouraging lower rates, which is probably around $700 million I would agree with you on that, Tom In sum, I would take $700 million as my initial borrowing figure, 10 to 15 percent for the funds rate range, and the aggregates as specified in alternative B  Oh, is that right? It's almost 100 percent I see  -35-    5/18/82  I'd be very much impressed by a resolution After all, this is not just any Congressman; this is the Chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, the ex-chairman of a Banking Committee, and a Congressman who has announced he is not going to run for reelection If he can get the whole Congress behind him to support a particular path for monetary policy, as long as it's not too specific, I would take it extremely seriously and be inclined to vote with it  How would you like 10 percent for the bottom of the funds range? There was some expression around the table for that  You might ask for a show of hands or something "
2072,1982-06-30," We could try that too!  It's $60 billion more  Yes  Well, I want to pick up on Ed Boehne's comments too It's extremely hard to believe that we wouldn't get some recovery out of a $40 billion tax cut--$30 billion in taxes and $10 billion in social security--starting tomorrow And the inventory numbers in the aggregate, though there are some exceptions, seem favorable to a slowing at least in inventory liquidation That ought to be enough to give us some increase in the period immediately ahead  But I, too, am concerned about a relapse as time goes on and as we get into 1983 I note in particular that the staff's forecast for this period presumes a flattening out, relatively quickly in terms of the cycles that one goes through, in real business fixed investment They have it dropping rather sharply through midyear and then stabilizing I wonder what the basis is for expecting that there would be such a sudden stabilization of that number considering that it consists essentially of business plant and equipment Almost everything I've heard--and it's in the Redbook too--about what is happening in machinery orders and equipment suggests continued deterioration there as well as in commercial construction of shopping centers and office buildings Again, almost everything one hears suggests substantially growing problems with overbuilding in the office area And then, finally, oil and gas well drilling, which I guess is a fair size item in the [business fixed investment] figure, has been affected by the outlook for a sharp drop in oil prices The effect that has on drilling activity has been reported at our last several meetings Considering that it's an item with a long lead time and considering these things and the financial state of many businesses, one wonders how [corporate] budgets could be considered and approved that would call for rises in capital spending, how the funds could be raised, and how the contracts could be let and all this would result in a stabilization of real business spending by the middle of next year It just seems to me that instead there might be a very, very protracted and sizable continuing decline in capital spending as we go through next year And that would greatly change the first half of the outlook  Similarly, the residential construction industry is demoralized They're concerned not only about the price of money,    6/30-7/1/82  which you forecast to be remaining at 16-1/2 percent, but about the availability of funds because the savings and loans are going bankrupt, and also about the possibility that people will be pulling back from making commitments of that kind in an environment where housing prices are no longer rising appreciably and in many cases are falling It's also an environment in which balloon payment loans will be maturing next year, and many more bankruptcies and foreclosures and takeovers of property will result from that So, one wonders whether there would be the basis for what is, in terms of percentage rates of increase, a pretty sizable rise in residential building  My final concern has to do with net exports Although those charts that Ted Truman presented are very calm, I think there is a very real possibility that there won't be very much recovery abroad or, if there is much recovery abroad, that there won't be the financial capacity to hold up exports to some countries like Mexico and Canada that are important to the United States Indeed, given the price of the dollar, the price of equipment purchased in this country is now so high that it seems unlikely that we would do very well in that area  So, if we did have greater weakness in plant and equipment continuing in 1983, a failure of residential construction to recover, and a further deterioration in net exports, or more than forecast, I think that constitutes sufficient basis for thinking that the recovery may falter before too many months have gone by If it does, and does so in an environment where interest rates have stayed high, I'm sure that the financial distress that the bankers are worried about will be with us in spades It's very difficult to forecast So, as I see it, that's our hazard The question that I have is how we should plan a posture for monetary policy that will minimize the very real risk of a true shock to the economy later on--probably not until 1983 I'm not sure; I'd rather hear other peoples' reports  You would say that very clearly to the market?  Yes, so that people wouldn't keep saying that the Fed has to get money down into the range and therefore will tighten  An overshoot?  Mr Chairman, there is a fourth possibility that wasn't mentioned and that is to rebase using the second quarter as the base That is to say, in effect, we overshot but now we're going to--  Well, I was thinking of the same range for the remainder of the year as earlier specified  But we did discuss it at length  What is that? Is that L?  And above the targets We would be above with 7 percent for the first half  Well, I mean the base is the fourth quarter  Yes, I agree with you I was looking at the fourth quarter to the second quarter  That would certainly get a--  How about a national usury ceiling?  A surcharge on the state income tax?  The Treasury gives an endorsement?  He takes office the first of the year?  First of December  That will do the reserves--  And this is the credit limit, is that right?  $700 million is the [swap line] limit?  That's what I was wondering about--whether that would be the next request  Oh, no  It's capturing recent information  I don't know that Steve was done  Do [the new sseasonals] have an effect on M2?  You're using the weekly reserve accounting now?  Well, assuming it's a lower June number--  Well, I come closer to Pres than to Bob I didn't say anything about the longer-run ranges yesterday because I'm so concerned about how we will confront the very great problems that the economy is probably going to be facing My view of the short run is probably no different from my view of the long run That view is    6/30-7/1/82  that we don't know what is going to happen to velocity and we have to be flexible enough to recognize changes in velocity when they occur The thing that we do know, though, is that the economy can't stand higher interest rates because the financial fabric of the country just won't tolerate higher rates in this environment or the environment one can see in the reasonably foreseeable future So, what I would like to do is to have a sort of normative number for setting the path a specification for M1 of 5 or 6 percent--we might even say of about 5 to 6 percent--and for M2 of about 9 percent [M2] has run consistently high and there's every reason to believe that it may tend to run high if precautionary demands remain as they have and if we get any saving effect out of the tax cut So I would say around 9 percent [for M2] And then it seems to me that we ought to reestablish 15 percent as the upper limit on the funds rate--not as an indication to consult or anything like that I'd say we would seek growth in the area of about 5 to 6 percent for M1 and about 9 percent for M2 provided that does not drive the funds rate above 15 percent That's a really radical change compared to what we've done before, but it seems to me that the threat of higher interest rates is so great now that we can't tolerate it and we have to put that in as a limit  I guess what I'm saying is that I will accept any aggregate growth to keep the funds rate below 15 percent  On that upper end of the funds rate range for the time being  I would want to say so long as the funds rate does not move rather consistently above 15 percent I don't mean daily; I'm not even sure I mean weekly, Bill--maybe biweekly or something like that But I don't think we can tolerate the effect on the market of a funds rate higher than 15 percent, which is a little higher than where it has been It gives us some [upward leeway], but I just think we need to draw the line now  Well, one way to do it is to crash the economy  [Unintelligible] get down to the upper end  And you think your strategy would keep the rates from going up?  I seem to have shocked quite a number of people with my suggestion that we ought to put a cap on the funds rate First of all, I don't think that is as extraordinary a suggestion as was suggested by some subsequent speakers We often have conditioned monetary policy on some notion of limits We used to condition money market conditions on the basis of ""so long as bank credit doesn't exceed a certain amount"" and then ""so long as the money supply is within a particular range"" This is just simply conditioning the money supply target on a maximum funds rate expectation In fact, it seems to me that my proposal isn't that much different from what we had prior to the fall of '79 My concern is that the market is very sensitive and nervous and that events that could lead to fright in the market may well push up the funds rate Now, we can stop it from going up, but in the end we'll provide a lot more reserves trying to stop it from going up [as a result of] a Comark or a Drysdale or an Oklahoma City bank failure or whatever may occur in the period ahead And it seems to me that it would be better to say that we would not expect the funds rate to exceed 15 percent in any event It won't exceed 15 percent if we say that And I think that would give us an upper limit that is not unreasonable People say it's like a peg again Well, the peg was at 2-1/2 percent, Henry, not at 15 percent You say it's like the debt limit We're not talking in terms of a permanent thing; we're just saying that for the time being, given the rate of inflation, given the balance of credit demands in the economy and the needs of the economy, we would not expect the funds rate to exceed 15 percent in any event I don't think it's as radical a suggestion as other members seem to feel  Yes Because I agree there is going to be a recovery, but my concern is much, much deeper than that I believe the recovery may be very wishy-washy and that it may be followed by a collapse And I think we ought to have a point at which we say This is it for the time being and we're not going to tolerate--tolerate is too strong--but we would not expect the funds rate to trade consistently above 15 percent  Yes, and I would make it in Paul's statement if I were--  It's similar on the top side  I'm just saying that we have plenty of precedents for constraints on policy  We've had various constraints since '79 and we had some then also  Under the pressure of the monetarists, I think we changed it about a year later  No, from now on he says  Both could surge here because of the tax cut  You have a lot more room  No, I agree with Paul It would be very hard to indicate the extent of the overshoot we'd tolerate, particularly since aside from this precautionary [demand for money], which could become greater actually in the next few months, we have the natural workings of a tax cut, the first effect of which is to add to household balances And that gets to be a big number when it is annualized    6/30-7/1/82  [Unintelligible] target on 11 percent  My feeling, Lyle, is that this will turn right around  I think we have to allow for a bigger July because I suspect that this change in late June is just temporary and that we will get a bigger July surge  I'd say we will have a larger surge than we expect for [July] and that it will be because this is just a temporary development  It's just [a different] pattern, that's all  -63-    6/30-7/1/82  Well, I was going to say ""about 5 to 6 percent""  I think 10 percent is reasonable  Yes, let's put that in Mexico is in the news  I think we ought to tilt that down; make it $700 million  Also, we haven't had the financial fallout yet from the recession  My position, Paul, is that 5 percent is pretty tight unless we take Lyle's construction and make it May to September Then 5 percent seems all right That's the way of getting the number, if you want the number at 5 percent  My position is that I'd rather raise the upper limit But if it is decided for policy or for strategy reasons that we ought to hold the limit, then I'd want to overshoot I'm quite prepared to overshoot  Well, could we say ""about 5 to 6 percent""?  What does it imply for the target path?  I like the idea of [the language] being consistent with the testimony When we say ""5 percent or something more, if liquidity preferences remain high,"" that is very much the theory of the testimony, or of the Humphrey-Hawkins report if not the testimony  -69-    6/30-7/1/82  But I would hope that the path will be drawn fairly liberally--certainly for the month of July at 11 percent or thereabouts, and then less in--  I don't either That's hard to do, of course, because it depends on what happens to the aggregates  It sounds good I don't know how to put it in words for the directive  Or pretty low  Yes; we'd react by letting them go down  Yes, I pretty much agree--  That's right  I'm not even too certain about that  Well, in any event, we have an agreement with the SEC that we won't release it until 410 pm  Well, I would oppose Mr Ford I think 15 percent is plenty high And the rate is below 15 percent now--I think it is 14 percent or a little below--so there is a little upside room In any event, I would say what I did before I don't care what the short-run implications for the aggregates are, we can't stand to have higher rates at this moment in time So, I agree thoroughly with what the Chairman said I still think it might be better to say it    6/30-7/1/82  [publicly], but I'll withhold that until a later date when it becomes more extreme as a need than now  15-1/8 won't do?  Why don't you ask for just a show of hands before we get into a vote?  Well, as you said, we have a selection on the federal funds range and we have a selection on whether to say ""5 percent or somewhat more"" or just ""about 5 percent"" and then whether to put in another sentence Those are two things at least And we    6/30-7/1/82  have the M2 question People might be constrained to vote against it just for some little reason  It's a different understanding, isn't it?  Preferable  Well, I'm not prepared to have that kind of proviso  Well, I would prefer 9 percent for M2 M2 has been running strong relative to expectations almost persistently for the last year or more And, with the tax cut, I certainly think it's likely to run strong in the period to come  Household money  Maybe 11 or 12 percent?  Not M2  I would like your sentence on some exception to refer not only to precautionary demands for liquidity but to temporary tax cut effects  Well, of course, the tax cut effect also could be in August because some people are not going to get it until the end of July  Okay  Well, of course, we have a revised June I would have some preference for tilting a little to the side of ease by making it $700 million I don't feel strongly on the $800 million It may not make so much difference  Yes  Yes, I wouldn't want to limit it to NOW accounts I think it should be broader than that  I would certainly mention NOW accounts  The 2-1/2 percent scares people I think they use it more for rhetoric than anything else, but if we were to use 2-1/2 percent as a real possibility for the lower end of the range this year, it would mean zero essentially for the rest of the year If we use it for next year, growth would be dropping from the very upper point of the range or even above the 5-1/2 percent [upper limit] down to 2-1/2 percent, which seems like a very low number I just throw that out  Well, I don't know We could keep the target range equally broad by raising both the lower and the upper ends  But we never looked at the midpoint that seriously this year  Except for the tolerance  Paul, I lost track of the Comark situation Did I understand you to say that the firm has now been liquidated?  No market bad news coming from that yet? Nothing?  I see  They're expecting to get more capital out of technically limited partners?  But there could be a loss to some more key lenders?  That's a dangerous gamble!  -88-    6/30-7/1/82  Well, I think we can--  It might require an easier policy simply to keep the structure from collapsing  Well, definitely you have to key into your thinking the fact that we're so much below an optimal utilization rate It might well be that a perfectly respectable economist who is a Nobel prize winner might take the view that there could be room for more expansive monetary policy [as] we are reestablishing a basis for a higher level of operations And once we have established those operations in the market and are getting that kind of effect, then I think people would say we do have to pull back But we might be talking about a period of several years duration to bring us back Nancy has pointed out how low the utilization rates are and how high the unemployment rate is Those things are not necessary When people talk about monetary neutrality they are talking about a steady state economy also, which we don't have  There has to be a current crowding out, Lyle After all, I think anyone would agree that there would be more housing demand if interest rates were significantly lower and that, therefore, interest rates are crowding out some housing demand  Of course, the budget resolution gives as a condition, as I understand it, obtaining substantially lower or permanently smaller deficits We don't have the crowding out problem, Jerry, if that part of the resolution comes about  I would--  It seems to me that we could risk trying to get a fuller utilization if there wasn't so much fear and concern and crowding out and everything that comes from very large budget deficits That would be another way of putting it  The chart we had yesterday shows us not getting back at all in the forecast period As a matter of fact, it looked to me as if utilization rates were drifting off a little  If the Chairman has to say that if Congress reduces the deficit we'll certainly have a less good economy than otherwise, he might as well stop making the comment because that's a kiss of death in terms of trying to bring about more discipline on the  -96-    6/30-7/1/82  fiscal side So, at the very least, we would want to have a monetary effect from the combination of interest rates and targets that would equal the loss of stimulus that would come from a reduction in the deficit  No, I think--  Henry, you're getting to the point of exceeding Larry Roos in the rigidity of your position!  That's awfully vague  Well, it is a long time between meetings "
2094,1982-07-15," Paul is now here  Tony, I prefer the second phrase of that sentence, which you didn't read, as the reason for our being tentative That's a pretty good phrase--that we'll be watching carefully and we certainly will feel free to reserve on those ranges after we have looked at the second half of the year  We certainly did in the first half, Bill In fact it was negative I'm led now, on the basis of the comments of the last several speakers, to support Tony in changing that word to ""continue"" rather than ""adopt"" I have two reasons for it One is that, substantively, I'd be opposed to narrowing the range Remember that the midpoint of the present range is 4-1/4 percent There is lots of room for reduction if we want to specify that we're going to be more toward the middle or that we [look at the full] range rather than that we are shooting for the upper part of it as we have this year But more importantly, in order to maintain our options, I think it would be significant to say that we'll continue with the current ranges until we see some reason for varying them on the basis of the second-half experience If, as Karen suggests, we reduce the top by a half point and, as Bob suggests, we increase the bottom by a half point, we will be giving a sense of specificity to the plan that then becomes extremely difficult to get out of I'm very much opposed to that kind of doodling with the numbers at this point  But the point is, Bill, that we have plenty of room to make the policy more restrictive within the present ranges And by saying we're going to continue the present ranges, we retain the option to review the information from the second half I certainly agree with Paul that if we're not going to have any increase in velocity, I'm going to support a sizable increase in the money supply next year And I don't know whether that will be the case or not  I think that we have to leave them where they are, although I certainly believe that we ought to err on the high side in our actual performance because it would be too much of a shock to the market--not the city of Washington but the market--to change    7/15/82  them So I would support, as we discussed at the meeting, leaving them where they are and erring on the high side  Well, it also calls into question the notification process to Congress if we have evaluated and decided That is, if a reevaluation indicates that the range should be different, we're supposed to tell the Congress that The way it's written here we are giving ourselves a little cap over the range that is specified I would associate myself with those who want to say ""somewhat above"" I think ""modest"" has the wrong ring to it because it's not modest if it's above and it might need to be, before a little time, a considerable figure I also would like to suggest just a little notching up in the nomenclature here Rather than saying that growth toward the top end of the range would be ""acceptable,"" I would like to say that it would be ""appropriate, given the low base"" and then I would say with regard to the second phrase that growth somewhat above the upper end of the range would be ""acceptable"" not ""tolerable,"" if this unusual liquidity demand persists  My problem, Paul, is that I think this is too grudging  Acceptable if this condition persists  Well, I don't know You seem to be mixing the discount window with aggregate monetary policy, Bob, in a way that is tricky I would assume that if we made [available] extraordinary use of the window in the period to come, we would at that level of analysis also attempt to offset that in the open market Are you suggesting that we wouldn't offset it in the open market?  And there is, of course, the effect on the public or the general populace of the perception of these problems The public may run to more liquidity and it's not an institution It may be the public, which in response to its perception of problems in the institutions, goes into cash or goes out of market securities into M2 forms and that kind of thing And we have to allow for that, it seems to me As far as the first half of this year is concerned, I've no doubt, given the level of economic activity, that there was a change in the demand for money There was an increase in precautionary demands Virtually all of the increase in M1 was in NOW accounts That, I think, is very, very strong evidence  As reflected in all the credit that's flowing and the sharp drop in interest rates and the ease in markets!  Thank you, Mr Patman!  Let's make it ""appropriate to be in the upper half of the range"" "
2113,1982-08-24," Paul, I just want to raise a difficult issue and that is the question of quality of credit The Federal Reserve is traditionally concerned about the quality of the credit that it extends At the discount window we require collateral and we take haircuts on bonds and that kind of thing to be sure that we have collateral We have sometimes said that we would not lend to an institution that was no longer solvent, although that's a very iffy matter and I'm not sure that that has much point But I do make the point that we have been very careful in the administration of the discount window as a traditional matter to see that we were well secured In cases where we were approached for lending in special circumstances, such as in the case of Lockheed or New York City, we've been reluctant and we have said that it had to be bridge financing In the case of New York City in particular, I recall that we said we couldn't see the other end of the bridge, but it was bridge financing without much, really, in the way of meaningful collateral that New York City could ever put up In the case of the other swaps in which we were engaging, I guess we have always felt--although we never really tested it--that the countries were solvent In the case of Mexico, one of the things that disturbed the Committee when it considered [establishing] the Mexican swap was the question of whether    8/24/82  at some time or other Mexico would get to be in financial difficulty and there would be some question about the quality of the swap We seem to be in exactly the same--  That's right We are precisely in the situation the Committee was somewhat concerned we might be in when that swap was first approved some 15 years ago So, from my point of view in trying to sort through all this, the parallel becomes the bridge I would feel as strongly as a private banker that I'd want to be convinced that something would be worked out to make the country okay  This is on future oil deliveries?  We are fully covered?  If the oil was delivered  Would this be classified just as an addition to the swap or is it a special--?  It's a special thing  Is the $600 million from the Treasury solid?  It just occurs to me that they have not done this; they have not had the benefit of a Congressional appropriation and they must be trying to get the money in some other place  I didn't think they had any money left  That August 24 date that Sam mentioned--I believe that's today  August 24 is today, isn't it?  Are they really? I just have not kept track of it, Tony  Well, of course, there's likely to be enough economic hardship in Mexico that there will be flight across the border anyhow  And their own circumstances could improve There could be an increase in oil prices, for example  Of course, if oil prices decline--  Yes, we do want it recorded  Peter, the classification of borrowings gets a little tricky when it's a large bank  The way we do it by convention is that we consider it borrowings if it's adjustment and we consider it the equivalent of nonborrowed reserves if it's extended I presume borrowing by a big bank would be adjustment borrowing for a long time even if it were borrowing a billion dollars or two [Total] borrowings would shoot up Would [the large bank portion in that total] be classified as adjustment borrowings?  Yes, that's the question I was raising, because I inferred that while there was a [large] bank that was borrowing--I don't know whether it was strictly technical overnight financing problems--it was something that could be of longer duration  Yes, that's right; it was only for one day  I guess I was asking the question of how you would regard your path for nonborrowed reserves if you were to have a significantly higher average borrowing level than you expected because of identified problem cases  Significant is, say, several hundred million dollars on a weekly average basis?  That's right  But market people looking at this rise in borrowings--  But the average would be up, of course, for the System Well, there is some ambiguity  One terribly important question is how weak is capital spending The staff has reduced its estimates quite a bit, but the forecast is for equipment spending still to be rising by the middle of next year I believe and for the decline in nonresidential construction to be moderating by the second half of next year The question is, if there's a major cycle there, whether it will go deeper or whether it will turn around that rapidly And the Redbook seems very pessimistic on capital spending to me I don't know if that represents your views or not In Atlanta you are looking at one set of exceptions; you saw a little strength recently  I get the impression that orders are falling in Chicago I don't know    8/24/82  That's going to create total silence!  Well, I agree with Frank that there probably is some money moving from the market into M2 forms, although it may cease because, after all, these stocks that have been bought recently have to be paid for But in addition, of course, the staff makes the point that consumption is weak relative to income And that is going to show up somewhere Is it more likely to show up in M2 forms than anywhere else, given the fact that we're talking about a broad base of the consuming public and so forth? I agree with Tony that the fact that we hold to 5 percent as the M1 target doesn't mean we are going to get it Indeed, we really thought last time that it would be hard to keep M1 growth down to 5 percent Now we think it might be hard to have it up to 5 percent We don't know what is going to happen Let's face it But it would seem very strange, given the economic circumstances in the past six or seven weeks since the last meeting, to cut our target growth rate for the third quarter because the economy appears weaker than it was perceived as having been seven weeks ago I think that was said by everyone who spoke and certainly was the thrust of the Redbook and also the Greenbook and your comment, Tony, on the New York projection Why in the world would we cut the growth rate in those circumstances? So, I agree with you I think it's best to hold [to our current targets]  You're not proposing that we narrow this [fed funds rate] band?  We used the whole 5 point range last time, by the way  Well, I didn't say anything much about rates and I do think this rate question is very fundamental and important Certainly, one could be sympathetic with the view that Bob just expressed, or Tony, in light of the fact that the staff projection is that rates are going to be quite high over the next year Therefore, if one really believes that the funds rate is going to be well above 10 percent throughout 1983, the farther it drops now, the more it is going to have to snap back later But the question is Is that right? I don't know if it is or not The fact of the matter is that long rates are still plenty high in terms of having a restraint on the economy and, indeed, if they dropped another point or two, they would still be high relative to projected rates of inflation And short rates are behaving very unusually because liquidity preference is so strong Now, if we try to keep those short rates from declining by holding the funds rate up and liquidity preference is there, we can only do it by destroying reserves and having a larger reduction in the money supply than would otherwise occur And it seems to me that that's the wrong policy to follow I also don't know about the similarities with past experiences, Bob I sense right now that there has been one really big change in the behavioral characteristics of the economy, namely, that banks aren't lending They are very reluctant to lend at any rate to a great many customers And if that's so, I'm not so sure that we'll get a surge in loans and the reliquification that would occur with the surge in loans, given bankers' attitudes and concern about their own balance sheet positions So, I wouldn't go--  I feel that way I feel that the banks are pretty scared  I wouldn't go as far as John Balles has suggested to a really major shift I have some sympathy with his view, but I wouldn't go that far I do believe that we ought to be prepared to see rates go lower because we can't see what the future is going to hold And we ought to see to it that we continue to have some money supply growth; in that respect I agree totally with Larry Roos To have very weak money supply growth or a decline at this time would risk a second decline in the economy and we wouldn't survive that as an institution  So, I think we ought to have a range and we ought to be sensitive to changes, but we ought to use the range if we need it  Yes, the 7 to 12 percent  And we said, of course, the top of the range in the testimony  It's giving the Chairman all the authority; that is what it amounts to It gives the Chairman all the authority; I think the Committee renounces its responsibility if it accepts such a thing Given the two choices, I would much prefer 7 to 10 percent [on the funds rate range]  We would have gone through it  Yes  Well, the wording you have there, Paul, just suggests that we have in mind these monetary aggregates but that what we will do is run the market according to what you think credit conditions ought to be like That's what it says, I think, or it's very close to it  I just don't think the Committee ought to do that  This says consultation These [ranges provide] test points for consultation, as indicated in the very first part [of the sentence] ""The Chairman may call for Committee consultation""  Yes So, I don't see quite how we can say 7 to 12 percent except that if it's over 10 percent there should be extra consultation  Well, I think we'd get a lot of comment on it  It's just a question of the definition of ""unusual volatility""  It might be a self-fulfilling forecast  It's ""is likely to be associated"" too, not ""because of unusually volatile conditions""  You meant the substance of what you thought the policy ought to be rather than what is stated here, right?  If we have a shortfall in money growth, interest rates go down  If we don't [have a shortfall in money growth] maybe they won't  Bill, I think you're still talking about the wording in that suggested alternative The trouble with ""volatile"" is that it means different things to different people  But the substance of the idea is that rates probably will go on down if we have weakness in money supply growth but they probably wouldn't go down, and they might even go up some, if M1 growth is at or right close to the 5 percent growth rate for the quarter That's the substance, as I understand it And I don't really see what we disagree about But ""volatile"" is a funny word  I don't know about that    8/24/82  If we're going to do that, I would rather have the funds rate limitation and then add another proviso saying that this is for consultation Remember, Emmett, what we are talking about is consulting with the Committee If unusual instability develops in the credit markets, which is an obvious reference to bank problems--I prefer ""instability"" to ""volatility,"" I think--  For a change we are going to look at credit conditions ""Giving due regard to unusual credit conditions"" or something like that  Well, we could make it more neutral and have ""or if such consultation is indicated by credit market conditions"" That's very neutral But, then, why would we put it in?  The rate is around 9 percent now, isn't it? How about 7 to 11 percent? It's neutral  And we had a 400 basis point range not too long [ago]  For a couple of years we had a 400 basis point range, as I recall Do you remember, Normand? Do you have a record? We had 400 basis points quite a lot "
2151,1982-10-05," Did you say you have 17 Brazilian agencies, Tony? Is that right?  Did they say that?  Being a consumer, Paul, [I recall that] the price rose as the last heating seasonal went off and it hasn't declined except by two or three cents So, this season will start out with prices materially higher than at the beginning of last season    10/5/82  Well, I was one who believed that there would be a recovery in the second half But I must say that over the years the two indicators that I have watched and thought most consistently indicated the future were new orders for durable goods and initial claims for [unemployment] insurance And they both have [tended] to vary significantly We had a 4 percent decline in durable goods orders in the latest month and we had a very substantial increase in    10/5/82  initial claims for insurance So I see no reason that we shouldn't predict a decline in activity in the period to come  Run on the funds rate!  But, Tony, a ceiling-free reserveable deposit has a lot of different implications for M1 than one on which the maximum [rate] paid is 5-1/4 percent  You can't go into it, but of course there could be a lot of outstandings for quite a while  A little more subtle, I think  Other things equal, it ought to increase the value of M2-type instruments compared with market instruments Therefore, M2 ought to be larger relative to total credit flows than before And by the way, I think the real world effect will be fantastic shifts of funds  They don't have to pay a market rate or tie it to a market rate; they could pay the CPI plus 4 percent  1931  Say ""I have another appointment""  We're going to get prices going down  One might say the same thing domestically  There is a sense of pull-backs, though Do you, Si and Frank, get the sense that they are pulling back on their spending plans in order to generate this cash?  That strike might run a long time  Well, if they're not doing it in Boston, the insurance business will shift to Boston from New York  He's talking about the first several paragraphs in the directive  It's probably on the calm side; it's bland  Well, even in terms of the facts, there is no reference here to the deterioration in employment, to the rise in insurance claims, or to any of the indicators of weakness It is covered by ""The unemployment rate was unchanged at 98 percent""  Nonfarm payroll employment dropped a couple hundred thousand  And it's not going to be 98 percent  Yes, something like that  We know that employment went down in the nonfarm series  It does, however, involve the question of market interpretation of numbers that are going to be running quite high  It won't be until Christmas time when it is revealed to the public  But even so, I think you have to recognize, Larry, that the staff hasn't factored in the possibility--  To a 10 percent top?  You know, Bill, I would put the emphasis a little differently here Maybe the wording needs to be changed some; I wouldn't put it in terms of moving interest rates down I think the problem is that M1 could do almost anything in the period to come In fact, it already has done almost anything In August and September we had a 35 percent rate of increase in NOW accounts And that's not associated with the--    10/5/82  Our problem, though, is not just that the number might be 1/2 percent too high; it might be way too high  So, I support the idea of getting off M1 at this particular time Perhaps there is more emphasis on it than there ought to be here It really doesn't come through as strongly when one reads this [draft directive language] that we're trying to move interest rates down as when the Chairman talks  We're not inflating it I think you misunderstand These are structural shifts that are occurring that possibly are going to produce a much higher M1 for a time And the question is Should we resist it, which inevitably would mean higher rates, or should we recognize that there has been a structural shift? Would we be better off not looking at it so much for a little while?  Well, I think NOW accounts are causing us an awful lot of trouble  It is certainly true that velocity has been increasing for M2 but not as much as for M1  No, as M1 used to be  Steve, in setting the path now, wouldn't you regard a change or a shift in the relationship between M1 and M2 that you could identify as coming in a week or two or three sort of as a multiplier adjustment?  Yes  So, it would depend on the setting of the initial borrowing level, but it might not in fact result in a big decline in borrowing It would depend on their relationship as to how many nonborrowed reserves you provide  I think the last sentence particularly raises questions  Then in 60 days we will have a new instrument  I also would support a change in the directive language this time I'm perhaps a little less enthusiastic than some of you about specifying a desire for interest rates to move in a particular way because I don't really think we know that much Every indication that we have does seem to suggest that interest rates are too high, but we just don't know that much about what determines interest rates and what they need to be to equilibrate markets I would remind you all that we are in a situation with a deficit running at $160 billion or thereabouts And that really substitutes a cash flow financed by the government for a cash flow financed by the private sector And since the government is interest-insensitive, one has to presume that higher interest rates will be needed in the private sector than would otherwise occur That's just one of many, many analytic comments made  But I am convinced that M1 for several months looking ahead is going to be a very poor and implausible indicator of what is going on in terms of monetary expansion As I've said, we did have a 38 or 39 percent rate of increase in NOW accounts in July and August and we certainly are going to have an all savers certificate bulge in NOW accounts in the period right ahead If I could think of some way to keep the M1 range, I would; but it's so implausible that we would have any idea what the number will be that I just don't know how to keep it and retain our credibility It may well be that when the new instrument comes out we will get a low M1, depending on how we classify the new instrument, as M1 or M2 For the moment, though, we're just in total disarray and we need to recognize that fact And I would say that we need to recognize it publicly and soon because otherwise the market will react in the way Larry says They will see a high number and will say that the Federal Reserve is going to have to screw down on their number and therefore rates will go higher, and they will work them higher in anticipation of that event So, there has to be some kind of communication, if we go ahead with this, soon  I'm not a great supporter of M2, as you all know, because I think it does have very important problems of interpretation in the longer run But for this immediate period ahead I'm not so disturbed about an M2 number of the kind suggested, 8-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent I really can't imagine a liquidity change that is going to get us very far off that as an upper limit of what is likely to occur The early indications are that [M2 in] October is going to be pretty low, so I think it's a fairly safe thing to go on And mainly because we're contemplating so many things that will make our critics suspicious-- and I agree that they will be very suspicious--I would drop the last sentence of the proposed directive I understand that something could happen that would lead us off [track], but if we say here [that M2 is] expected to be in a range of around 8-1/4 to 9-1/2 percent for the September-to-December period, with the expectation that October is going to be fairly low, I think it gives us enough room without raising this additional question in people's minds    10/5/82  As I think about what is bothering a lot of you, in particular this rate setting issue--and I think Bill Ford spoke out most strongly on that--it may be this phrase at the beginning of the second paragraph, ""taking account of the desirability of somewhat reduced pressures in private credit markets in the light of current economic conditions"" That would seem to me to be a signal that the Federal Reserve is following rates rather than a more objective measure So, I think it may be desirable to drop that phrase and substitute instead something like ""consistent with the early resumption of economic growth,"" which doesn't necessarily imply lower rates and easier conditions but does imply the need for an orderly and sustained flow of money and credit That might help a little with that problem On the suggestion that Jerry Corrigan made that we again repeat our insistence that we're going to be conservative over a long period of time, I don't know Jerry, there's a whole paragraph that would be picked up from the past directive that talks about the long-run plans of the Committee and so forth; to force it into this paragraph seems to me so apologetic that it would backfire on us  It's difficult to handle here just in a phrase without sounding apologetic The notion that we want to be constraining and that we are going to continue to run monetary policy pretty carefully is good, but the yardsticks have changed We are having trouble measuring in this period using the conventional yardsticks  Not really, no  SPEAKER(?) I agree  On the other hand, I'm not sure I would be prepared to support much more than that for the year to come  One last comment You spoke a little about the level of borrowings I don't see any reason to reduce the initial borrowings so much from where they have been If I understand it, what we have done is to allow almost all of the expansion that occurred in the monetary aggregates to show through in larger nonborrowed reserves So, borrowings really are where they are in good part because of the need to deal with these special situation borrowings We might reduce  -46-    10/5/82  it to $400 to $500 million, but I wouldn't take it way down to the kinds of numbers that people have mentioned, $200 million or less, as a starting position That's all  He hasn't said a word!  I can think of several names!  But I also would drop the operative sentence  We're targeting on 8-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent on M2  $400 million, I thought What has it been running?  But in drawing the path you allowed for about $500 million?  And that was after having made the adjustment to provide the nonborrowed reserves consistent with the observed overshoot in M1?  7 to 10 percent is worse than nothing  Well, obviously, take $300 million with--  SPEAKER(?) From among the others  Yes  Yes, it really should only be the people who are going to vote yes [on the directive] who are allowed to vote [on this] We've run into that problem with contemporaneous reserve accounting  When you say other operational questions, are you talking about the question of the federal funds range specified?  Oh, I see But other operating considerations?  That next to last sentence I think has some meaning  SPEAKER(?) Right  I presume that was put in, Paul, because we are over the target ranges rather--  Yes  I think its composition matters Suppose we have very strong NOW accounts and very weak demand deposits?  I think that ""no substantial weight"" is probably better than ""substantial weight not""  It must be ""much less,"" though  That leaves it in as a factor to look at  ""Much less"" and ""much lesser""!  I think Lyle is right; it should be ""these developments"" instead of ""these uncertainties""  ""In these circumstances, therefore""  We have sometimes used a phrase like that, but it goes back some years  Then ""in the light of"" is not quite right, is it? We mean ""resulting from"" or ""flowing from"" or something like that I thought ""in the light of"" meant we were doing this because of the poor economy  But you are saying credit conditions are affected by--  Now we have more doubt about it  Well, I agree with Henry I think it's less clearly a move to a money market conditions target  How would we get a great big increase in M2?  That's not going to affect the [fourth] quarter that much  Yes, but those are institutional accounts  That's right  SPEAKER(?) That's a possibility  We could have a sudden drop in consumption relative to income  SPEAKER(?) That's possible  It would seem about as low as it can be  Relatively, yes [Unintelligible] without destroying income [unintelligible]    10/5/82  If there should be evidence of something  Well, if there is, we should have taken that into account in setting our M2 target  -63-    10/5/82  We won't let it tighten the [market] up  Well, I really think ""in the light of"" also is very ambiguous It ought to be ""if, in the presence of evidence"" or that kind of thing We used ""in the light of"" up above in a way that I didn't quite understand and we're using it again here  Or ""should economic and financial uncertainties lead to exceptional liquidity demands""  I guess nobody else shares my preference that this sentence be dropped None of those who plan to vote for the directive shares my preference  Yes, I think so  And that, of course, has to be interpreted  Well, I think it says that if we could do it without a lot of effort, we'd prefer to meet our targets  Yes, we have a target  I'd prefer not to have it It's enough of a change that it's difficult to know what the funds range should be Our tradition on the funds range has been to make it above and below the present rate; apparently that's not acceptable And the range that was suggested was a 3-point spread; we dropped it from 5 points to 4 points last time and to go on to 3 points seems to me would destroy more than it would accomplish  We don't need to have a trigger for a conference call There could be another understanding  Well, I'm against it  I still fail to follow the logic In the past we've said to the Manager, in effect, if in following the reserve path consistent with these aggregates, the funds rate moves enough so that it gets to the ends of these bounds, then the Chairman will decide whether to have a conference Now you are suggesting that we set everything so that it won't get beyond those bounds  It says now ""somewhat reduced pressures in private markets"" It seems to me that ""somewhat reduced pressures"" could convey [our meaning] just as well as a range would Indeed, 7 percent might seem surprisingly low  They will look at the way the Manager operates, as they always have, and try to conclude where the limits are  That's where the rate is "
2177,1982-11-16," So moved  It looked like a clean [bill of health]  The steering mechanism?  How would you slow down M2?  Or a personal visit  Paul, I think we are going to have to look at the control mechanism definitely by the time we choose targets for monetary policy for next year We probably will never be able to steer on M1 again But M2 or any other aggregate we might choose, such as bank credit, has to have some concept for translating undesired behavior in an aggregate to action And this 2 percent rule is a minimal response and couldn't be expected to have any effect in steering the aggregates if that is what we really want to do now We might want to take as our aggregate nominal GNP, but even then we need a control mechanism That is the vital part to be studied, because what we have now really doesn't have any tie to aggregate targeting or aggregate control--not with a 2 percent presumption on running above or below on the reserve effect of the aggregate  Sure, we need an [amplification]  We don't look at M1, but of course we are going to affect M1 by what we do  I want to put it that way, though Even if we never published the figure on M1 or looked at it or anything else, in trying to steer M2 we could have a process that would have big effects on actual M1 or the availability of Ml  Peter, did you have in mind longer coupons?  And you would do it in some volume today?  Do you think the market would make anything of the fact that this sizable and unusual operation is occurring while we are meeting?  They are looking apparently for some sign that we are going to move interest rates down The only concern would be--  Well, it's not really a neutral movement that is being proposed  Are they in the market right now, Peter?  And of this size that must really--  Yes  The motion I think is to add a billion dollars to the [intermeeting] limit  We didn't have a rise in personal savings, particularly, as a result of the tax cut, which suggests that income growth was so much poorer that it used up the benefits of the tax cut  The velocity numbers have been very unusual, haven't they? We've had pretty good monetary growth throughout but velocity has been negative instead of positive  believe Oh, sure  You don't think the public will buy a variable rate mortgage?  The lots?    11/16/82  I wonder whether the type of people you all talk to might not be considerably influenced by the 250 point increase in the DOW It seems to me that that is one of those things that color attitudes It may not add that much to consumer spending or anything, but most business leaders and most people who would buy a million dollar house have a considerable stake in the equity market one way or another, and they probably are feeling quite a bit better  He's talking about the bulge  One can see that; it's on the chart here  I agree with that  I noticed that  That's a good argument  Well, I'm pretty sympathetic to what Bill Ford had to say I don't think we have allowed enough time to see the    11/16/82  effects of what is obviously a considerably more expansive monetary policy that was developing increasing momentum as we went through the summer and into the fall It is very much like 1980 as a matter of fact And the fiscal policy setting is certainly on the expansive side I don't know that I would characterize it as expansive as you do, Bill, because I think we do need to look at the 6-1/2 percent full employment setting It is negative but it's not so terribly negative at this point, though probably it will drift up rather than down because I think all the Congressional sentiment will be to raise the deficit rather than reduce it, in pursuit of particular job creating policies  On the business situation, I agree most with Lyle I think it is quite poor And I'm very worried about the marginal indicators Jerry Corrigan mentioned that employment may not do at all well, and I think that's quite right I know of a plant that has reduced its office force from 1300 to 500 They are not doing much out in the yard, but they are going to have to do a lot more in the yard before they add back to that 500 they have in the office That plant happens to be in a deeply depressed industry, but its [action to reduce office staff] is a mark of what a lot of business people are thinking about because they are very squeezed on cash flows and very scared about their financial condition So, I don't think business is very good and it isn't going to get very good in the immediate future, but I do think we need to have some time to see what the effect of these policies may prove to be  Over the years the Committee frequently has made serious errors by not allowing for the lag in [policy] effects because we always expect to see instantaneous results and we never get them in economics I think we ought to wait a little while I don't know whether interest rates are too high or not I agree that one sympathetically thinks they ought to be lower because the real rates are so high; on the other hand, we have this structural problem in that they have to be disproportionately higher because of the government's financing needs That is, the government is interest- insensitive in its demand for funds and it is going to take a substantial share off the top, so real rates have to be higher than in past settings in order to have a balanced economy with that kind of deficit So, Paul, I come out for ""B;"" I think ""C"" is perhaps a little draconian And I feel rather strongly that we shouldn't be posting in the directive expectations for the aggregates that are as far out of our expectational range of just 6 weeks ago as those in ""A"" would be Even if we shade the funds rate range in ""B,"" I think we ought to keep the specifications for the aggregates that are in ""B"" and wait until we see this staff paper and have a little more experience in order to see whether we have to shift our focus entirely in terms of aggregates The 1930s do suggest that we might have some kind of change in the function here and that we might be back to that because we certainly are going to have many more failures in this economy and many more failures abroad in the year to come Maybe that means that we have to have more liquidity relative to economic activity But I don't feel prepared to commit myself to that at this point So, I would go for ""B,"" and I feel pretty strongly that I wouldn't want to see aggregate growth ranges above those specified in ""B"" by the staff  Take about 1/2 point off  Four quarters  Including the fourth quarter?  And the fourth quarter this year?  Could we ask where it is? What is the case?  Yes, abstracting from that--  Well, $200 million or $150 million would certainly be lower  Well, of course, we're virtually unaffected anyway by overshoots  SPEAKER(?) Why not?  The 2 percent rule  You say muted and I say virtually unaffected    11/16/82  Yes, I thought so, too  Yes, I could imagine 10 percent, but 10-1/2  percent would be a shock to the market  Very little  I think Paul is probably right that when it starts to run, it's going to run pretty fast  Well, it does have some demonstrable meaning; I think 6 to 10 percent is okay  Yes  And we may need to do that, but it's premature  We'll think of you though, Larry  We aren't using a range, though, [for M2]?  [This draft] doesn't have ""about"" or ""around"" 9-1/2 percent  I would be inclined to take it out because we moved to the 9-1/2 percent on the M2 from 8-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent We have already taken account of it  -46-    11/16/82  Well, I think we would have to explain why we haven't specified it That is, the earlier paragraph [on the Committee's long-run objectives], which isn't here in the Bluebook, talks about the Committee's expectations for M1 and M2 and so forth So we have to continue to say why it is that M1 is not figuring in this instruction to the Manager  This talks about M1, John It seems to me that you were talking about M2  20 percent!  Well, of course in January we have to specify aggregates ranges, and--  We'd get some phenomenal annual growth rates--a thousand percent!  After circumstances     11/16/82  ""Considerable"" seems rather [unintelligible] compared with ""unusual""  And then drop the last sentence  That's fine  It may be time to do it  A blackout of the press is a little difficult  Very little trading below 8 percent  He said 8 to 13 percent  I didn't think you'd ever say that, Lyle  If we got back to an interest rate target and we couldn't put the target in the directive, we wouldn't be saying much But that's a big if It seems to me very likely that we'll always have some proviso on interest rate movements I certainly am totally disenchanted about interest rate forecasting and I don't think I'll ever return to it But I think we'd have some proviso And it would  -60-    11/16/82  be measured relative to some objective performance indicator--maybe not money or maybe not even credit, Frank, but some objective indicator  You have the--  Starting at 3 pm in the afternoon  No, that was Thursday  The very next day, we had an afternoon rally In fact, I went around to Joe Coyne and said ""What's up?""  Our theory on the [release date], though, Bill, is that the directive is no longer current We don't release it until after the next meeting has occurred and there is another directive  So that's an old directive  Very occasionally It has been very rare  No, there have been--  I did the same thing for the Board, Peter, and I have the same feeling I couldn't support it now "
2204,1982-12-20," Remember, there's an extra shopping day, too That makes a lot of difference at the daily rate they're going  How are things down in the Sun Belt? Do you sense some pickup?  They are going to buy mortgages with that hot money, eh?  Nothing looks any good!  Even credit  In the discussion of M2 and to some extent M3 in both the paper and the Bluebook, Steve, the numbers that you are using seem to suggest that you're looking almost immediately for the downward movement in velocity to end, except perhaps for the shift adjustment I note that in the third and fourth quarters we had a decline in V-2 at an annual rate of around 5 percent If that were to continue into the first half of next year and we added that to the GNP number we wanted and added another 3 points for the shift adjustment from market instruments into M2, we could have a very large number indeed, like 15 percent Is there some reason, other than hope, that you think [the adjustment in V2] is about to end?  Very little  Yes, but [velocity is projected to be] a lot less than it has been We were getting a decline of 5 percent and now you have just a very little decline  You mean we have to deal with that too?  It was at least a dozen years ago It was so volatile we couldn't--  Flexibly  Well, I actually agreed with a good deal of what Frank Morris had to say First of all, I think it's clear that we have to have in mind the nominal GNP under the conditions of whatever time period we're looking at And I guess that has a little something to do with what Bill Ford said We don't want a really low nominal GNP because it might just take us right on down the hill On the other hand, of course, we can't have too much monetary expansion over a period of time or it will affect the inflation rate over the longer run Today, given 4 to 5 percent inflation, I suppose we ought to look for nominal GNP of about 9 percent, which would be 5 to 4 percent real growth Now, I don't mean that we should target it, but we have to have it in mind; that really is what we're trying to get at any point in time We have to have some linkage to the nominal GNP Well, one linkage is transaction balances And that, of course, is the old M1 I supported that [aggregate] for quite a while But I really think it is badly damaged and is going to be badly damaged for quite a while Even if, as Steve suggests, after the stock adjustment we get back to a place where two-thirds of M1 is transactions money, one-third of it won't be And that one-third will always have a considerable potential for movement that will muddy what is happening in the transaction relationship between what we're doing with money and the nominal GNP that we really would like to see over a period of time ahead The other connective that I can see is credit It seems    12/20-21/82  to me that credit flows are very closely related to the performance of GNP some time out I agree with Frank in that I don't see this causality argument running any more against credit than it does against money It's just the way people look at things that makes them say it in the one case and not in the other My problem is that I just don't think we are prepared to go to credit We don't have the background work done We don't have the figures and we don't know what the behavioral characteristics are; and, therefore, we can't do it now But I hope we will do it in the period to come ""L"" adjusted actually is the best figure in the set of tables, Paul That's an interesting thing Adjusted ""L"" is the best result  The [Divisia] adjusted ""L,"" which is--  I just point out that it has the best record; it's better than the rest But it does suggest that it may be a fairly complicated relationship The thing that bothers me about M2 and always has bothered me about M2 is that I really don't see how we can affect it very much other than through affecting the economy If M2 were running high, would you raise interest rates or lower interest rates to get it down? I'm not really quite sure what direction we would want to move unless one says M1 is running too high and that means the economy is going to be too strong and, therefore, we want to raise interest rates in order to reduce income flows and that will lower M2 One might say that, but that's a different thing to say than that we are targeting on M2 It's obviously reflective of the economy Well, I agree that we have to use M2, which I think instinctively is the wrong thing, but it's the only thing available to us now And I would agree with Lyle that we certainly want to be very flexible in the way we do it because we have very little way of knowing what the number is likely to be; and then seeing what it is, we have very little capability of influencing it So, we better have a wide range  We don't have a monthly series now  It would take at least that on M2  It could be temporary; it's hard to say  It could wash out in the period right ahead  But Tony is right The discount rate and the funds rate have been closely linked  -45-    12/20-21/82  Paul, do I understand that we have been asked to give more of a Committee forecast with the GNP and associated numbers like real GNP and--  Well, which was it Committee or Board?  Well, it does tend in the direction of suggesting that in order to make the forecast we need to know what policy is going to be And yet if I understand it, the way it has worked before is that we have made a forecast before the meeting I see a procedural problem with that  That would probably be the way to go  But in the end we're going to be stating a Committee stance on monetary policy And they naturally will expect even as individual forecasts that they will be associated with the Committee's stance on monetary policy, I think  All right Well, that's why I said stance We have to avoid the word target  It may be more stable, but I don't think it's more controllable  I don't think we can control Eurodollar deposits  Well, I mean on a net basis Isn't it true, for example, that M3 growth has greatly exceeded bank credit expansion recently and that's because banks have been financing their foreign branches? If that reverses, M3 growth would be much smaller than bank credit expansion because banks would be bringing money back from the branches That kind of thing would be a new dimension and it is of some importance  Yes, if we get a high nominal, then we really have trouble However it adds up, 11 or 12 percent is a problem  That's what we are supposed to be doing  There are a lot of guesses in there; final sales too They don't have December retail sales figures; they don't have exports for two months at least  Yes, and we've managed that in the past  Taking out the shifts?  That amounts to some unknown amount over and above that  But we are also getting the distinction between personal and nonpersonal We must be because of the different reserve requirement  I'm sure  When is our meeting?  The standard error is $25 billion?  It will be more an '84 effect than an '83 effect  I certainly think they will need to have some flexibility and this is supposed to provide it I think it's the right thing to do, so I would be favorably inclined  It just seems too uncertain, though, doesn't it, Tony? We just don't know That bank credit might be [$4] billion instead of $5 billion or something like that I don't know what a little shortfall like that does to their arithmetic  That will really be serious  Well,  Well, we're the banker  It sounds to me as if there's distinctly less exposure there than there would be on another $300 million to Mexico  Is that the end of your list? You don't have any others on your list?  It depends on the terms If the loans are at commercial terms, they would not be nonperforming But if they are at concessional terms, they would be nonperforming  They try another way  Alternative one?  You have absolutely no current information that I can see, including the flash report on the GNP, that indicates that velocity is turning around It is still going down fast for M2  -76-    12/20-21/82  But we haven't got a recovery  No, I don't think that's true now  Those you think are pretty good?  For the M3 numbers  For alternative two  I think so, too; 9-1/2 percent doesn't sound high enough  Shouldn't that say ""greater growth in M2 would be acceptable""?  It doesn't say that  Where's table 4?  We carried 9-1/2 percent this last time  ""From market instruments"" We're not talking from M1 up to M2  Except that as a bank funding device it seems to me that it will tend to offset  [Unintelligible] unexpected bank influence on M2 because they aren't going to have any credit demand and they're not going to want to extend credit anyhow  Well, they don't have any credit demand either  That's down some  -85-    12/20-21/82  We have a number of pretty sick banks If we were to have some unexpected borrowing at the window by those sick banks, you would not count that as adjustment borrowing?  Of course, they tend to be at the end of the queue because they are generally regarded as weak banks  I was thinking more of, say, some of these banks who at least partially lost their access to the Euro-markets They might have to come back in for a rather substantial loan  Yes I see  It's pretty much a status quo  I'm a little nervous about M2 I don't think M2 bears any relationship to anything I don't think it's off the wall any more--a number that somebody conceived of But it doesn't seem very [unintelligible] by itself I guess I would accept this  And that's what this is doing  It's hard to imagine that for M2 in particular How could it be that weak?  -89-    12/20-21/82  They can use the money to pay down their CDs  Yes, large CDs That sounds fine  Well, I don't know  To delete the sentence tends to delete the reference to 1983  There was a very small percentage increase "
2224,1983-01-14," Cleveland is missing  Well, Steve, we could have a big decline in CDs That is, I would think that a well funded bank would simply let its large CDs run off Now, maybe you need to include Federal Home Loan Bank borrowing in the adjustment there too, because some of it has gone to savings and loans And they may be letting their own Home Loan Bank borrowings go down pretty fast  But usually the maturity schedules have shown quite a concentration in short maturities  What, on the compensating balance?  I think that's certainly the right course, Paul We can't make heads or tails out of these figures There's a big shift adjustment occurring because the institutions have chosen to get back their rightful share of the market It's impossible to see what the stock adjustment is and it's certainly incorrect to annualize it, whatever it is "
2235,1983-01-21," I think there's a real problem as to whether we shouldn't indicate that in the present instance, with all this uncertainty, we're temporarily running on borrowings or on net borrowed reserves; it doesn't make any difference We are doing that in fact and there's nothing else we can do as I see it  ""To maintain reserve conditions about unchanged""  He wanted more options  That's fine with me "
2255,1983-02-08," So moved  I don't know  In support of more productivity I would also argue that we've got to get a considerable rise in productivity in finance That earnings squeeze that you expect for the banks, which is only the tip of the iceberg now that we have money market deposit accounts and so forth, is going to force economization there But it hasn't occurred importantly up to now When you talk to bankers, by and large they're distressed by the rise in their operating expenses last year but they haven't done much about it; they say they're going to I think that they will be forced to by events, so that might help In addition to the industrial area, we might have some productivity improvement as a result of layoffs in finance also  You can have after--  I wondered if I might just ask a question about the chart showing comparisons of postwar cycles on real GNP As you commented, Jerry, this is a distinctly less rapid recovery, by a substantial factor, than the typical postwar recovery You haven't gone back to look at the staff projections of previous recoveries, but I wonder whether there isn't a tendency to understate the recovery that actually occurs because of the obvious fact that there are dynamics in the situation that aren't foreseen at the time we start out on it Do you have any idea?  What have you lagged it--two quarters did you say?    2/8-9/83  Shouldn't you have had a recovery at midyear last year then?  I think anyone with a stronger forecast, Paul, probably would have more consumption It looks as if the personal saving rate was a limiting factor there, but we have to remember with dynamic properties that if you have more output, you have more income and then you can have more consumption and maybe not change the saving rate very much And that's how you get a bigger--  A little, but nothing like a one-for-one comparison if we got the growth in consumption with output to accommodate it  You're looking at the range there  What you meant to say was that you didn't really think the profits would go up 40 percent  He didn't say that, but he meant to say it  And if you make them, say, 30, that gives you--  We could also get it if wage rates went up more than the marginal [increase in the] staff projection, which I would assume underlies, say, Bob's higher number You would have a bigger wage rate, [Bob]?  More than 12  You do hear this interesting comment that we had the other day That a lot of these prices are being discounted substantially and that businesses don't want to raise prices, they just want to get rid of the discount  There was tax stimulus  The other side of this is Nancy's fiscal stimulus Don't forget that That's the counterpart of this  Yes, it would affect the Ml target  Well, I find myself in substantial agreement with Henry I think we do need to continue to target the aggregates I believe it is an opportunity--and also there's plenty of basis for it--for widening the ranges In addition the tone of the Council [of Economic Advisors] report is that you have to be flexible They didn't exactly say target nominal [GNP] I just read that before I came into the meeting  They didn't exactly say target, but they said steer by nominal GNP and to the extent that we seem to be achieving a result that is not consistent with what we wanted in nominal GNP, be  -21-    2/8-9/83  prepared to change our targets Well, some notion of uncertainty and of that kind of flexibility could very well [be read] into it The only thing I disagreed with [Henry on] is that although I wouldn't target primarily on Ml, as previously we did, I do believe that M1 so far has stood up a little better than the other aggregates And, therefore, I see no reason, as he commented, for benching it for the time being or sidelining it I see no reason for doing that so long as we leave in the caveat that if the DIDC does something big, that target, of course, will have to be changed  But I don't see that there's an awful lot to choose from  Even the credit aggregate is way off  Yes, I wouldn't target primarily on Ml  Which we can't achieve  But it sounds like we would take the one that we're within [the range]    2/8-9/83  How do you answer Bob's point that we don't have any reserve targeting at all? We just target on net borrowed reserves--that is, the funds rate  I do not see the evidence that we have a restrictive policy I think credit is beginning to flow and flow in very large quantities  Yes  It's sustained upward bias  A little [plus]  Well, Roger's going to take them out, Paul, as I understand it He will show a figure that is like the 8 percent from the fourth quarter to the first quarter  And then you've got to [unintelligible]  We'd break that series too That's what we're doing, really--not so much shifting bases as breaking the series and starting out with [a different] M2  I'm not sure whether you addressed this question, but I don't know that I agreed with the point that Steve was making about cutting the range on M3 because there was no reason to think that the institutions will want a larger market share And, therefore, I think we ought to be careful about that  Yes  [Unintelligible] M2 very stable, yes  No, it's--  And you've allowed about 1 point for continued shifts?  Well, I don't know about the 1 point; it could be a lot more than that  Steve, if I read that footnote connected with alternative II correctly, [the consistent range] would be 7 to 10 percent The footnote says that [the ranges for the three alternatives] would be from 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent through 7-1/2 to 10-1/2 percent  I assume that the middle one, alternative II, is 7 to 10 percent  I just wanted to make clear that we weren't really talking about liberalizing what had been proposed in--  I think that's right  Of course, we've never been any place close to the lower end of the range in the last several years for M2 And to leave it at 6 percent when we have a new instrument seems funny to me  I'd rather have [unintelligible]  When we start to get some expansion in the [unintelligible]  I would prefer the higher number, Paul The banks have been adding a lot of securities and I think they'll continue to do so And I think the S&Ls will be aggressive They will pay down some debt but they're going to be looking for places to put their money So, I'd hate to see that reduced  Thrifts were really squeezed  We haven't done it  What was the midpoint?  May I ask a question? Steve, your own [Ml] projection for the first quarter is an increase of 87 percent, isn't it? So, you must be projecting substantially lower growth rates as the year goes on  I rather like 4 to 8 percent, though, because it's less than we had last year We had 8-1/2 percent last year?  It's a little less at the upper end I think if we went above 4 to 8 percent, we might as well forget it Already it seems to be quite a liberalization of our previous targeting  I realize you feel that way and probably Tony does too But I think there are others who would like to keep it, including myself  Well, except that I think their [unintelligible] figure is too tight  And we do have to remember that we have a higher forecast than the staff for the GNP So, I would move 4 to 8 percent, Paul  Seven is too low  The height of the number is accounted for by government  But even the aggregate number in Appendix IV in the Bluebook is 139 percent, which is not up much from last year and is well below what it was running earlier  Appendix IV gives this I'm looking at the far right hand set of numbers in the middle column  The last set of numbers is the ratio of the flow of credit to GNP The middle column--these abbreviations are such that it's hard to make it out--is the private debt, isn't it?  That is the domestic, right  That includes government, yes  And we certainly ought to include government  To 17 percent  I know; but they have to relate  -54-    2/8-9/83  Yes I wouldn't have put it that way, though, Bill I think Lyle is the one who made the point about the private sector I'd look at the total, including the government, and say it ought to be in reasonable relation to the kind of growth in GNP that we hope to achieve  And I think Lyle is right that the number is a little too low  That is to say that the debt number is pretty low  You certainly don't want it to be 16 or 17 percent  A decrease, yes That's the same thing  One does see the same effect running through all these numbers  If the aggregates run off [track], we may use this to look to see whether we--  It's more a monitoring device; I think that's right  We want to have the right setting if we're going to use it as a monitor  That's total [debt] You want to look at domestic, which is the second column  Yes, I think it is fourth quarter-to-fourth quarter  I would like to make it 9 to 11 percent, Paul I think that would take care of all our problems That range is awfully wide; a 3-point range in a number as large as this is awfully big I think 9 to 11 percent would take care of the problem of the very low number; Lyle looks to the bottom end of the range The high number wouldn't be as high and wouldn't bother [other] people And for my purpose, the midpoint would be 1/2 point more and I think that is about what it ought to be  -60-    2/8-9/83  That is too serious  The difference between the high and the low ends must be around $100 billion when it's 9 to 11 percent  The number we're talking about is around $500 billion  It adds up to [real] money after a while!  Well, I'm talking about the dollars because a lot of people look at those flow of funds numbers  It's around $500 billion  When you have a 2-point range that's a hundred billion dollars  We haven't had a figure as low as 9 percent--  We're talking about all this financing by the government, which is a part of it, and we have a low end that's below anything we've had  1970 was the last time it was below 9 percent and that was a recession year  The chart looks pretty good until the last couple of years  Maybe because a dollar government bond doesn't have the kick that a dollar Carter bond does  You can't reach that conclusion, Bill, because one of the biggest sectors in here is the consumer--mortgage debt and consumer debt  I would buy 8-1/2 to 11-1/2 percent  It really ought to be depository credit, but we don't have a number for that  So are the other numbers  That's all right  It never changes  We never did  ""Subsided"" is a lot better word  Is not adopted?  Not marketing It's the possibility of them  We have to be a little careful, I think, with the phrase we have about Super NOWs too Of course, they're being marketed now to households  Yes, some institutions would say they're pushing them pretty heavily  Or ""extended to corporations and other businesses"" or something like that  [Unintelligible]  I do believe the comment [on the DIDC proposal] has run pretty much close to this, hasn't it?  It's not a specified target  But, Jerry, that's a pretty good sentence there at the top of page 4  I think that's right  I guess I'm somewhat sympathetic with that too I think this is tending rapidly to become an argument between those who like M1 and those who like money market conditions  Well, this doesn't say; it just says it will be monitored  Some weight, with the amount depending on the extent to which it resumes a predictable velocity relationship That way, you see, we'd be in a position as velocity comes up to give it more weight We would have positioned ourselves for it  It's the kind of thing we can more easily change and give more weight to it as time goes on  Just in the interest of being clear with my suggestion--since you didn't adopt it, maybe you didn't understand it  Well, that's possible I assume this is a democratic matter and, therefore, let me be clear I would say ""Some weight will be given to the behavior of M1 also, with the degree of emphasis dependent on the extent to which that aggregate over time shows velocity characteristics resuming more predictable patterns""    2/8-9/83  If we don't put it in, it sounds as if we're paying about the same amount of attention to M1 as we are to the total credit flow We are also saying that we are monitoring that  Carefully, as opposed to our usual sloppy--?  You would like to use the same title  Yes, it's closer  Bring in borrowings  What was the alternative you suggested? I understood the first thing and then you suggested something else that I didn't quite understand  Your first sentence was ""[existing degree of] reserve restraint expecting that this will""  What is soft?  It'll drop from 30 percent to some lower number  We certainly do want to be concerned about the possibility of a relapse That was mentioned a couple of times yesterday, by Lyle and I think by you, Paul And I agreed that it's conceivable that after this goes on for a month or two there could be a relapse in the economy And we want to guard against that  Well, we've left it open in Paul's language-- that is, if we get weak aggregates  I would want to communicate my position as not agreeing with that  For the next seven weeks, yes, I would  Without being quite that strong, I would remind you that we just had a chart show that gave us a reasonably respectable performance for the economy I believe it was said that almost everybody here had [projected] growth rates somewhat above what the chart show indicated January certainly is a strong month It doesn't seem to me obvious at all that rates need to be lower to bring    2/8-9/83  on a recovery It may be that they will have to be lower but it doesn't seem obvious that they have to be In the meantime, I agree with Ted that the market is becoming pretty apprehensive about these aggregates And for us just to abandon them altogether I think will be certainly a featured comment in the market and could give a counterproductive result  ""Restraint in reserves""  I think that's better Then ""expecting that would be consistent with--  See if there's agreement on that  That's a word we've used--appreciable  I just can't recall a directive that had a reference to the economy directly in it Steve, do you remember any? Peter?  [I can't recall] in the operating paragraph where weakness in the economy would bring a change in policy  I must say the velocity reference strikes me as ludicrous because we can't really say what velocity is until more time passes  That just sounds so wide open  We certainly could always have a conference call  But for somebody who is voting he asked for a vote on whether you wanted that phrase in or not  Oh, I see, Paul  I'm actively opposed to it  But not in the operating instructions to the Desk  Well, it says we expect [monetary growth] to be lower If it's appreciably lower, we might ease some    2/8-9/83  Yes, but you can't even do the M2 in relation to the longer term because we're establishing the base for the longer- term in February and March  We could do that; it makes sense  It's a question of under what conditions would we ease  SPEAKER(?) I'm not sure  That does take care of it, technically That would take care of it  Yes, I think this is a substitute for that proviso that we were talking about I think the way you put it is acceptable, Paul  As a matter of fact, it says we won't tighten  Yes it is  It is  When you refer to ""aggregates"" I would make that ""monetary aggregates""  The actual figures on reserves are showing very little expansion  -99-    2/8-9/83 "
2280,1983-03-28," Would you refresh my memory, Sam? What kind of authority does this gives us on the foreign currency operations?  What restrictions exist on our authority to deal in foreign currencies?  And which currencies we can deal in  We have 14 currencies listed, some of which we've never dealt in, I believe Is that an exhaustive list of the currencies that we can deal in without Committee action?  It would take Committee approval to add a currency to that list? Is that right?  The Authorization would have to be changed And likewise the aggregate limit?  I was questioned recently by a Congressional Committee on this, in the environment of discussing the possibilities of bailouts of foreign countries And I reassured them that we weren't going to bail out any foreign countries through the operations of the Federal Open Market Committee So, I wanted to be sure that there wasn't anything here that really would permit us suddenly to move in and buy the Yugoslavian currency or the Chilean currency or even the Brazilian currency--currencies that are not named on our list  And the only Latin American currency we have on the list is the Mexican peso?  I'm talking about Desk operations in foreign currencies  Although the two happen to be the same list right now, I think It's not exactly coincidental, but it's accidental in the sense that there could be a different list  I just wanted to probe a little for the record to see whether I got general agreement from people here that there's nothing to worry about I think it's true also, Roger, that among the problem countries the only one we have a swap line with is Mexico    3/28-29/83  Well, the only reason these would be working up is because of earnings  I must say that in reviewing the material this came to my attention and I don't recall it ever being discussed by the Committee One could have presumed that when we received the earnings on our foreign investments we would liquidate the earnings--that is, convert them into dollars But instead, apparently we have never converted any of these earnings to dollars; we leave them in the foreign currencies Is there some reason for that, Sam?  [I suppose] that's the only reason, because I see no reason in principle that we wouldn't want to convert the earnings to dollar form  [That has] come way down  I want further discussion before I'm prepared to vote  All right, I second  What happens here with the earnings?  In foreign currency form?  I think we pay--  As marks?  And we then perhaps pay them off in dollars?  It accumulates in marks on their side too, so we're neutral so far as the foreign exchange risk is concerned on the earnings  So much [unintelligible] exchange is coming-  We're not talking about weak currencies here?  Even for the Treasury?  We take the interest in foreign currency form and it then flows through to the earnings of the Federal Reserve System  We then pay the earnings of the Federal Reserve System in dollars to the Treasury  As I see it, in some sense the quality of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet deteriorates  It seems strange that this [legal authority] ended in [1981]  I want to agree with the Chairman We have had just a massive increase in the issuance of acceptances relative to the capital of the banks, which would be an occasion for saying All right, if this is going to be such a big market, it can operate on its own without our doing RPs in it In addition, we have the problem, which is not quite yet disposed of, of the risk participation acceptance Now, that'll depend on the Board's definitions of terms, if I understand the matter correctly, and the Board has not yet defined the terms on risk participation But it makes it at least possible, depending on what the Board does, that we can have an awful lot of acceptances out with a bank's name with the indirect guarantee of secondary banks And I think we might get in a situation where, although we wouldn't ordinarily have any problem with the bank--let's just take for example Chase Manhattan--that if there were three times that many acceptances circulating with Chase's name because they have participated out with banks like that one in Oklahoma City and others, the risk might indeed begin to cause us trouble So, I can see the possibility of an embarrassment, looking ahead, particularly with this risk participation question  That might well be, but in that case we have the administrative possibilities of counseling with them that we don't have when they do an acceptance in the RP market  I think you're right, Paul, that we ought to review the matter maybe in 90 days or 4 months or so The Board is now positioned to make this definitional determination because I sent a letter out on that a few days ago So, I'd favor a temporary extension and a review of the matter  Yes  Intervene to hold it up? Is that the idea?  Don't we want a weaker yen? Isn't that our national objective?  We want a stronger yen All right I got it reversed  We don't know in advance what kind of news would have brought that about We wouldn't know what the news is  This is all within the $8 billion  That would be enough for quite a few months' interest, wouldn't it?  But what we are talking about is disorderly conditions, isn't that right? We're not talking about trying to set a yen/dollar relationship; we're talking about smoothing a movement in the market so that we could--  Am I right in thinking that we have $500 million leeway now?  How do we get times two?  SEVERAL Treasury  That's a lot of intervention  I would prefer not to until we can review the whole question of intervention at the international level, which I think is going on, if I understand it Am I right in thinking that there is still such a study?    3/28-29/83  Well, my thought was that I didn't get a clear answer to [my question on] this disorderly market test It sounds as if maybe we're changing the test some on why we would intervene, in which case it seems to me we really ought to consider what the issues are and to what extent it ought to be the Federal Reserve and to what extent the government ought to be directly the intervener [under] a different policy I just don't feel very comfortable with it  We haven't discussed this at all It hasn't come up in months and now it suddenly is coming up and I'm just not prepared to support it  $5 million  We've been doing an awful lot of $5 and $10 million amounts with a $500 million leeway  Except I was uncomfortable about it before, and now we've not done anything for a couple of years to speak of and I'm still uncomfortable about it I am just not prepared to support it today, that's all  Well, that seems to be because of the interest that came in Although, again, I have some doubts about it  -20-    3/28-29/83  I think we ought to have an issue paper and have a discussion here in the Committee  Well, I didn't even think I had the latitude to suggest that because there's $500 million of leeway  Yes, there's not very much--  If we're going to be talking about doing something considerably larger here, which seems to be in the wind, I'm interested in the question of how much we could reasonably do without using these foreign currencies to collateralize Federal Reserve notes That's an ancillary issue that I'd like to have investigated because there must be some limit We've collateralized, as it happens, our currency with foreign currency something like 138 times And that needs to be examined too so that we know what we're getting into if we considerably expand our effort in this sphere  It's above 9 percent really, Peter, that you would be concerned that the pressures could be [strong]?  So moved    3/28-29/83  Mass transit takes some of it  -26-    3/28-29/83  There's nothing mild, Ed, about the increase in residential construction and the turnover of used properties, both of which have increased much more sharply than we would have expected-- [more than in] previous recoveries, I think the staff has said It might be that that would be shut off by a point rise in interest rates I don't know But that has been a very strong recovery to this point  It's a rather large sample, as a matter of fact  That's the trouble  I want to make a case for the staff forecast as a good working premise for the Committee I think it's possible, as    3/28-29/83  Lyle suggests, that we could have a little stronger recovery, probably led by housing That could give us maybe a half point or even a point more in the real GNP increase, but it's still certainly well within manageable territory But I also am impressed that it could be a little weaker than the staff forecast because the financial fragility is really pretty deep and it could affect our export numbers if in fact the Latin Americans buy very little from us in the course of this next year It also could affect, more adversely than the staff has forecast, the commercial construction projection because I do think there's a very serious overbuilding problem occurring, particularly in office buildings, but to some extent in shopping center and hotel/motel complexes and things of that sort too Now, the thing about office buildings and big commercial centers that they share in common with foreign situations is that they involve an awful lot of debt; and in both cases an awful lot of the debt is held by banks It seems to me that we may have a very conservative lending attitude on the part of financial institutions for more forthcoming deals for the next year or so and that could hold back the recovery some So, I could see the outcome being below the staff projection by as much as a point and I can see it being above the staff projection by as much as a point Therefore, I think the staff projection is a good working document  That's a lot  I even wonder about them sometimes  You really do have a different pattern, Bill  You have a pretty aggressive recovery and then a turn  Have no boom  Lumber or some [wood] products?  How about doing half of it?  SPEAKER(?) Can't do it  Well, I think you put the right slant on it just now, Paul It's a situation where the broader the aggregate the less egregious the situation looks; that's the result But apparently total bank credit is well within--in fact, slightly below--the range we've specified and well within expectations or even on the weak side so far, if the figures are at all right Growth of M3 shown here on page 2 of the Bluebook for the fourth to the first quarter is 98 percent; for the fourth quarter to March it is 97 percent And [that's about] the way it has been running for some considerable period of time M2 is very large because of the shifts to MMDAs principally, I think, but there could be a little more underlying strength in there M1 is impossible to explain Ml is just extraordinarily strong and has been for a considerable amount of time And rather than trailing off, it got stronger in February and March That's the one, of course, that the market is beginning to look at, even though we haven't targeted it as one of our principal variables And that's the one that gives us all kinds of difficulty I don't know; it may be that one component after all now pays 5-1/4 percent-- the NOW accounts That's about 3 points below the market but 3 points on an after-tax basis is not much and might lead people to keep excess liquidity in NOW accounts The other component, Super NOWs, is presumably right on the market if one allows for the cost of handling the transactions activity in an account And there is no reason at all, assuming that you have a reasonable deal and need some money for transactions, not to keep your money there rather than in the market Perhaps that's much of the explanation I might remind the Committee that this is also a very volatile series and that we sometimes have periods of very large increases and then we have periods of small increases or declines It may be that we're getting here some kind of a bump in this and that it subsequently will have a low rate of growth In fact, I'm inclined to think that's what is going to happen So, I guess I agree with Emmett I don't see anything in the economy nor in the credit picture nor in the inflation picture to lead one to say that we need to react with great alarm because of these aggregates And, therefore, we should not do so I don't think it's a time to return [to the old operating technique] I don't quite understand this discussion of money market versus aggregates After all, we do target the aggregates If we stop targeting them, we've got to tell Congress we are going to stop targeting them  Yes, but we specified target rates of growth for M2 and M3, bank credit and--  I don't think we should say we're going to stop targeting these things On the other hand, I don't agree with Henry that we ought to run our policy on the basis of a presumed path relative to targets I think we ought to continue to do about what we've been doing because I don't think, Henry, that we should change back to proximate targeting on the aggregates when we still have this inexplicable decline in velocity It seems to me that as soon as we can see something in terms of a move to a more normative relationship, then we ought to return strictly to monetary targeting, but not now We have no more reason now than we had last time or in the fourth    3/28-29/83  quarter, since we're still getting sizable declines in velocity by all evidence I don't think that we have to go back to the nonborrowed reserve path targeting that we had before; rather we ought to stay with the presumption of a net reserve--  No, I got a little confused there  Well, I misunderstood Henry I wanted to argue against returning to the operating technique  I see Well, I come out that we ought to hold about where we are again for a period, until we can get some of Frank's new numbers and get some sense of what is occurring and perhaps understand the aggregates a little better than we do now So, I don't feel that because of market sensitivity we are justified in pushing rates down I think that would cause considerable alarm at this point Nor do I think we ought to return to the old operating technique I guess that's about alternative B  I meant new monthly numbers He said we didn't have enough information yet to know where the economy is  The trade people?  You mean they charge it still?  I thought I was a little closer to Tony, actually, than to Henry  They are all banks too, aren't they?  You're looking for something around 7 percent?  I'm not sure that does it, but that's March to June at 7-1/2 percent  Back in the good old days!  Do you want a show of hands, or what?  What you've described sounds a lot more like alternative A than it does alternative B  Yes, that's right  Now, that's better I like it It's more accurate  To me alternative B sounds as if it's being driven by growth of M2 and M3 and alternative A sounds as if it's going on regardless of Ml, M2 or M3 This says that we have an expectation It means we start off with the existing reserve conditions and have an expectation--which may be wrong--that there will be this performance in M2 and M3 And then if we're wrong about the expectation, it seems to me there would be a basis for reconsidering  So, I think the blending is literally a more accurate representation of what is being proposed here  Committed in the sense that we let it drive the reserves  They'd be 9, 8, and 6 percent, I guess, for ""B""  It's still there  Why don't you make that ""expecting"" so we don't repeat ""anticipating""?  It's in the next sentence on Ml ""The Committee anticipates"" is in the next sentence  Oh yes, we could do it either way  The whole thing is a guess  I would make it 6 to 7 percent  5-1/2 to 7-1/2  Are you going to leave ""about"" in? I think I would make it ""about 6 to 7 percent""  And that gives you 5-1/2 to 7-1/2 percent easily They're all ""about""    3/28-29/83  It says ""a more pronounced slowing""  You're reading from ""A,"" aren't you?  A narrative sentence  We're not going to have much evidence It will be mixed, and depending on which figure one likes to emphasize--  Of course, the first thing we're doing, Roger, is specifying the degree of reserve restraint That's the basic  -70    3/28-29/83  instruction, as I see it, to the Desk Then it says we expect that that's going to be consistent with those M2 and M3 numbers But our expectations could wrong They could be wrong in part because we still haven't allowed for the distortions So it seems to me that at that point we could say we haven't allowed for the distortions; even though they are high, we're not going to change this direction to the Manager  I think that's right if there is no explanation  Or appreciably below  Yes, I think that's right Less consultation if we had some news that it's lower and that the economy is suddenly weakening or something    3/28-29/83  I find $250 million acceptable "
2296,1983-04-29," Tony, this is Chuck Partee I think you're a little premature in your conclusion that the growth rate in the aggregates has dropped off very markedly We only have April I would be more inclined to think that if May does not show a sharp rebound, as Steve apparently is projecting, but continues at a moderate rate, then there would be a basis for what you say But at this point it seems to me we only have one month and it very well may be a sport It's too early to take the kinds of actions you're suggesting  Well, as I recall, the projection for the quarter was on the order of 8 percent for M2 and I've forgotten what the M1 projection was So, remembering that we've had very strong [growth] over an extended number of months in the case of M1 and over several months in the case of M2, it seems to me that people would think it pretty fast to be reacting [now]  Or several weeks  That's on the presumption that we are going to be moving in an easing direction If that's incorrect, we're not losing an important period of time, we're avoiding an error "
2317,1983-05-24," Sam, I didn't quite follow on the swaps Are you talking about the special swaps with the extension to August 23? This is not our regular swap  Our maturity date is supposed to be the 23rd of August?  Those monthly figures, you remember Jerry, were plotted against a shaded area We were more or less in the middle  It's really a question, isn't it, Ted, of how easy it is to finance the deficit from abroad? There can't be much question that there's going to be a large trade deficit and the longer the dollar stays high the larger the trade deficit will be But what we don't know is how forthcoming the funds from abroad will be to finance this deficit If they are very, very eager to come here, maybe we don't need a lower price  I would agree more with Ed Boehne than anybody else who has spoken up to now On inventories, Ted, I think we can't say precisely what path the inventory change is going to follow quarter-by-quarter, but it seems extremely likely that it's going to    5/24/83  move up from a large negative number to zero or a small plus, and that's a big algebraic change in the GNP when it occurs It might occur this quarter or it might occur next quarter; it's hard to know what the pattern will be, but it's ahead of us for sure And it seems to me that consumer spending just has to be pretty strong, with the increase in the value of financial assets that consumers hold--it's hundreds of billions of dollars in improvement there--with the change in sentiment, which is one of the biggest that we've seen in years in the surveys, and with the tax cut coming on in another five weeks, which adds another $30 billion to the hopper It seems to me all that has to mean a pretty strong consumer sector I'm surprised the retail sales data are as poor as they are Indeed, when you read the Redbook, where almost all of [the Reserve Banks] commented on retail sales, things don't look anywhere near as weak as the national statistics That is, the year-over-year increases range from a low of 6 percent, as I recall, to up in the 13 to 14 percent area I don't know quite what's wrong, but in any event I think there's bound to be that increase in consumer spending and the inventory improvement And with those I think some capital spending will come along That comes late in cycles anyway, Roger; it isn't one of the things that appears early And by the end of the year I think we may be looking at a much improved capital spending situation Maybe it won't help the Midwest so much because it seems to be in high tech and automated equipment and so forth Nevertheless, if anything, I think our staff has been surprised by the strength in capital spending this early on But it hasn't been a [heavy capital] goods kind; it has been computers and the like So, I think the outlook is really quite good and I agree with Ed that whereas I might have been inclined to say the risks were on the low side of the staff forecast last time, I think they're probably now on the high side of the staff forecast  I didn't exactly say that  I think so too  You have a couple of big ones coming up  I assume the new withholding schedules have gone out to corporations  The comment has to do with both the range and the weight  That is, there is no need to change the range right now and no need for a [predisposition] to change the weight That's what you're saying That seems to be the staff's view  -18-    5/24/83  The staff doesn't say that with regard to Ml And Ml growth in Germany is 147 percent; in Switzerland it's 149 percent; and in the United Kingdom it's 12-1/2 percent  At least nominal GNP ought to go up very sharply around the world  Well, to give my conclusions first, I would lean toward snugging up a bit now I also think that we are going to have a couple of good quarters in GNP; the dynamics are such that I don't know what might come from that in terms of later on and, therefore, I think a little precautionary snugging would be in order I would also point out that Ml is very much a fact, whether we want to look at it  -25-    5/24/83  or not The only way that we can really deal with this would be to stop publishing Ml--suppress the numbers on the basis that Ml has no information content--and I don't think anybody would propose doing that It is something that people look at I am also impressed by this world-wide increase in M1 that has occurred over the last six months and it may be telling us something after all, as Ml was telling us something three or four months ago about a recovery that was stronger than almost anybody expected Now, it didn't come in anything like as strong as normal relationships would have predicted, but in fact the economy acted more like Ml would have suggested than most judgmental forecasters would have expected three, four, or five months ago And this may be now a world-wide event  I also have a problem because I don't trust any of the other aggregates M2, I think, is very much affected by the IRA/Keogh accounts, which are a direct substitution in the short run for tax- exempt savings balances M3 reflects the pattern of demand on the markets, and I think it is a simple reflection of the fact that corporations are trying to do some restructuring I have always been more comfortable with total credit but what I am not comfortable with about total credit is our estimates Just a couple of months ago we were told that, by golly, total credit is running very low--well below the lower end of our range Now, somehow, in the last six weeks, we learn that no it isn't; it is 9-1/2 percent, which is up in the range And by the time we get another iteration of that, when the July national income numbers come out, we may find that it is at the top of the range It is a very unstable figure from the standpoint of estimation even though it is a pretty stable figure from the point of view of its relationship to the economy So, I don't think we can disregard Ml and I don't think we can disregard the fact that the economy seems to be pretty strong under foot Therefore, I would snug up without changing operating procedures--which I think is what Ted Roberts was really proposing in taking Ml [into account] as a driver on providing reserves again I'd snug up to maybe $300 million [on borrowings] and try to come in on the low side of alternative B on the aggregates  Peter, what kind of funds rate do you expect to be associated with a persistent $350 million of borrowing--if the borrowings were put up to $350 million and kept there rather than just accidentally being there?  Well, I don't know that Wachovia--  SEVERAL [Unintelligible]  I really think we ought to look at alternative II, Paul It has more promise  I like it  SPEAKER(?) I do too  Well, how could we fail to--  Then we really will have to deal with it, which will mean significantly higher rates  Well, I agree with Lyle when he says the problem with Brazil, Mexico, and so forth is going to be with us a year from now just like it is now  I do too  It makes April look like the aberration Before we were thinking that maybe April was establishing a new course, and now it doesn't look that way  We snugged up in the spring of '75  I think the ""increase slightly"" is what the majority of the Committee is inclined to do In fact, some would favor a little more than slightly, I gather It sounds reasonable to me I like your whole paragraph, Paul  Yes, I think it's time to recognize them  Yes  And he has the stronger business--  The second sentence?  -42-    5/24/83  ""Some acceleration"" seems to me a little weak, a bit of the wrong tone  ""Evidence of a strengthening in the rate of business recovery""  ""Narrow money stock""  Yes  -43-    5/24/83  SPEAKER(?) Right  SPEAKER(?) Do I have a notion that the--  Yes  SPEAKER(?) It's also offered in the spirit of compromise  And it doesn't have the strength in the economy  String them altogether  I can accept it  But you would add the sentence on business?  That's a lot of words for $100 million  It's a suggestion that we're not oblivious to what is going on  Well, I think it read all right  No, I don't think so, because to snug only slightly in the short run suggests that a little later you're going to do more ""In the short run we will increase only slightly"" seems to have a little trend  You'd have to take out ""in the short run""  -51-    5/24/83  We're going to take a little precautionary snugging  We're going to try for it this time, though  We usually don't say it that boldly  ""And the economy, which we pay no attention to, was strengthening""!  To seek ""marginally"" instead of ""slightly""?  ""Increase only marginally the degree of reserve restraint""  I don't think so  I'll buy $350 million  SPEAKER(?) It's $392 million  [Unintelligible] I'm not sure we're going to have six votes for anything  $400 million?  No  Well, in some ways $350 million is the weighted average  $350 million again?  Are you counting yourself?  No  It's one of the disadvantages of attending! "
2331,1983-06-23," Si, this is Chuck Partee I agree with you I think that everything that has occurred has been a little stronger than we anticipated at the last meeting and that the third quarter is developing as a very, very good quarter indeed in terms of final sales prospectively Although Jim didn't put a figure on it, I think it's going to be much stronger The aggregates are all a little on the high side Ml is very much on the high side So, I don't think we ought to back down a bit from where we are My only question is whether we ought to move further I would agree with the Chairman, though, that we would want to be gradualist about this and that we have a meeting coming up not too long from now, so $400 to $500 million is acceptable to me  Yes, I think we have to indicate that there was a [consultation] "
2354,1983-07-12," That could be a result of government borrowing not being as stimulative as private borrowing That could be because it's mainly receipts reduction And it could have a flow-through effect on savings, although the saving rate is awfully low in your forecast, which was the point I was going to make It seems to me    7/12-13/83  that you have a rather low saving rate for the next 6 quarters compared to historical experience There is no evidence whatsoever of savings being stimulated by tax incentives and so forth, from what I can see  Well, the GNP increase is not all that large in 1984, if you look at it They have 4-1/4 percent real and around 8 percent nominal If, in the abstract, somebody said there was going to be an 8 percent increase in nominal GNP, I don't think you'd be talking about higher rates  I didn't provide an annual average because I didn't have the resources to figure it out  It depends so much on the quarterly pattern one has  Well, of course, we have the tax cut  I would say that I think this is a reasonable working hypothesis To me, the most important feature of the projection is the slowing rate of increase that you are speaking of that sets in by the fourth quarter I think that's terribly important to us from the standpoint of conducting monetary policy because it could be argued that this is an explosive and self-building recovery that will accelerate longer than that and create real pressures But this doesn't have it I would have been inclined to slow the rate of increase a little more, just along the lines you have been discussing, Paul Also, the export market is an awfully important variable here, and there is an important and so far incorrect expectation of a sharply declining dollar That's important to getting that second half of 1984 still to show a good increase, and I'm not at all sure that will occur So, I would have put that a little lower But I agree with the basic premise that what we are seeing right now is a second-quarter inventory upsurge and a third-quarter carrying through of the income effects on spending of that and of the tax cut and that there will be a slowing in the rate of increase later on The levels of the markets that have been mentioned, I would point out, are not notably high Housing starts are up nicely but they are a half  -13-    7/12-13/83  million below what they were in previous booms Car sales are up nicely but we used to talk about 11 million cars a year and this is well below 11 million cars at its best point I guess that's an expression of the high real interest rate, which is offset in the aggregate statistics by the effect of the stimulus of the government deficit I think it's pretty reasonable  One other comment I might make, just to be complete about it, is that on balance I would be inclined to feel a little less optimistic about the price outlook in 1984 than the staff I think something could break here in agriculture; with all these efforts to raise farm prices, they might actually manage to do it and we might get more inflation in that area I also am concerned, if we do get a decline in the dollar, about the effects on domestic pricing that a decline in the dollar would make possible; that is, higher import prices would make it possible, in terms of retaliation efforts, for businesses here to restore margins So, I would come in with a little higher price increase than the staff has But the general profile, I think, is really quite reasonable And I can't detect whether the major risk is that we might have more expansion or less expansion than shown here  An ""accelerating recovery""  Twelve percent drops to seven, say, with the rate of inflation at 635 percent or whatever we have for the ten years You get very little positive--  That sounds the opposite of a runaway boom to me  Compared to a cyclical [average] of 5 or 6 percent?  There was a decline of 5 to 6 percent last year, as I recall, in M2 velocity  But they were constrained week-by-week by Regulation Q This capital ratio is going to be imposed periodically The first thing I think I would do if I were a big bank would be to be over until the time of the calculation of the ratio and I could adapt and bring it down I think it would take a while to catch up with that I agree with you as to the direction, but I think it will be much less marked than the Regulation Q ceiling was  Nancy is right; we have never increased them  I agree with Paul that it ought to be a point  He wasn't quite sure if you wanted to lower it a half or a full point  I agree with Paul that it ought to be a point because I think we want a smaller growth in nominal GNP  Well, my point was simply that the staff's forecast from fourth quarter-to-fourth quarter for nominal GNP is 96 percent this year and 83 percent next year That seems like a pretty favorable outcome In any event, that's a drop of more than a point in nominal GNP and I think there ought to be a similar reduction in the credit aggregate itself So, I think a point [reduction] is the proper amount rather than a half point  Well, if you thought inflation was going to be [higher], would you want to be easier or tighter?  Well, I have a little less favorable forecast and it still works out with a point reduction in the credit growth  Well, a point would change it from cosmetics to real policy  Lower them  That's a pretty good idea  -34-    7/12-13/83  Or [it suggests that] we're more worried about a rapid expansion so we show our interest by cutting the top end In case we get a very rapid expansion, we indicate resistance I think that's reasonable I'll go with that  Do we want to raise the bottom and leave the top the same?  Well, you were making the point earlier, Frank, that we had a different M2 than we did before And, therefore, the velocity of M2 won't do what it did before  Well, if you don't have any strong preference, Paul, why don't you get a show of hands?  I think the analysis is that we get less kick for the debt than we ordinarily do That is, the relation between debt and GNP is off  The 8 percent on M1 seems to me a little high, I must say Didn't we add to that range in order to allow for special adjustments this year?  I think we did, for Super NOWs and [unintelligible] Well, we certainly didn't add enough Now, we could say the relationship has changed and, therefore, we have an entirely different ball game  No, it's an unusually low increase in velocity  -38-    7/12-13/83  It seems to me that there has been some fear in the market about the need to come [down] toward the target range Therefore, people are saying well, even if it were one or two [unintelligible] for the year So, doing away with the notion that we're going to make up the overshoot, if that's our decision, would be a constructive thing for the market  Well, I must say that I think there's something a little unfortunate about the numbers 7 to 11 Also, it sounds awfully high My instinct would be to rebase  I have a problem with your suggestion, Tony It's Bob's suggestion too, but I'll address this comment to you because I think Bob might like what I would see as the difficulty What if we get a very, very low rate of money growth? It could happen And in the context of having the 4 to 8 percent range, people would say, fine, we are getting [Ml growth] back down into the range, and yet it might be indicative of a problem developing in the economy and we might want to try to encourage a little more money growth If we rebase, we have an opportunity to do that; if we don't rebase, people will think we're happy to see M1 growth come down into the old range  Oh, I understand that, but I think--  When we forecast I think we are slow to recognize a change in the inflection of the economy We were slow to recognize the rate of increase that is now occurring and that we all see We will be slow to recognize the slowing, I think, and I would like to guard against that  That's true That's quite true  I would rebase and use 4 to 8 percent, but I would say to the market that we are still uncertain about velocity, though it looks as if it might be stabilizing and we're going to give [M1] some more weight  Probably I agree with that very much  I absolutely agree with that; I think that's just what Paul said  Well, there are all kinds of opinions I think you are both overstating it You have looked at the extremes My view of the matter is that history shows that it's dangerous in an expansion to rely on setting the federal funds rate We are now moving into expansion We're talking about the next year and a half by which time we will be pretty well along in the expansion The indication is--certainly over the 20 years that I've seen it--that the Committee is slow to change the funds rate if the funds rate is what the Committee is setting So, I think there's a basic danger in not having something else Now, something else might be nominal GNP; I don't think it's real GNP Or it might be one of the Ms And if it's one of the Ms, I think Ml still shows itself as better than any of the other Ms It could be total credit, but on total credit our problem is that it's too hard to estimate the current numbers We might use it for confirmation, but--  So, what we have in mind is a 9 percent nominal GNP, right?  I like that the real target is the nominal GNP  It seems to me that the principle is the one you state and then, of course, it's subject to review as more evidence comes in on what velocity is in fact doing  I agree with Jerry I think we ought to rebase, but then I'm scared of the 5 to 9 percent so I'd fuzz a little on the velocity but say we are keeping it open  Sure I think the concept here is that what has happened has been unusual And now we're going to be following Ml in the expectation that there will be some small rise in velocity  But I said I'd base it on June  But it's basing it on where we are, which I would define as June  That argues for 5 to 9 percent, analytically--no question about it  I don't see that  SPEAKER(?) I don't think so  Of course, if it's slow in the second quarter--  Lyle's helping you  Alternative A on Ml would be consistent with what for the last two quarters [of 1983]?  Net borrowed?  Yes I think we've been doing exactly the same thing here in the last 6 to 9 months  $600 million on borrowing?  We've just had a concerted move in the market, which is the point that Pres made Now, maybe we haven't fully confirmed that move But I would be happy to see the private rate structure stay where it is for a while because I think it will have some effect on the very credit sensitive industries and we ought to wait and see what that is before we let this get away from us on the tightening side But I think that's probably consistent with a little tightening  Well, the prime rate probably ought to go up a notch  Yes, and it probably ought to Everything else has moved and the prime has not  That could be An awful lot will be determined by [events in] the next few days--the testimony and so forth  They're below prime  Well, I think Pres is right that very few people in the construction industry pay prime They'll be paying prime plus 2 probably  A smaller quarter in GNP  Well, those specs aren't bad I'd be close [to that] I'm not sure I agree with the last point, although I certainly lean away from automaticity But I feel that we would need to rebase Ml in order to show the market that we're not going to be trying to get it down in the range  Our forecasts?  They're going to be watching  Well, I think it's a tad of tightening, but just a tad  We have a third-quarter projection as I recall I read it someplace  It's rather low because the government borrowed so much in the second quarter  Yes, it's very difficult to have any number there until the very end  That is true, isn't it?  Yes, this is the instruction to the Manager  -76-    7/12-13/83  It's not so much the world economic recovery as it is international debt It's really the international financial conditions  Would you read the sentence again the way you now have it?  We will instruct the Manager as to the economic conditions and--  I have a feeling the Chairman will have a view on these matters  Are you talking about everybody?  It's certainly within the range  How about one point on the top and a half point on the bottom?  Do I take it that you mean that you don't think we ought to attempt to restrain GNP at 10 percent? That's an acceptable growth in the economy?  Whereas 5 to 9 percent is pretty neutral  Well, I think it's a very big growth I must say I had 9 percent and I guess I'd be inclined to raise it, hearing what I've heard around the table  We're not talking about any restraint at all  I didn't give annual averages  There still is quite a range, according to this chart that was passed out yesterday, for the year from the fourth quarter The low I see is 7 percent and the high is 10-1/2 percent No, there's 11-1/4 percent from somebody  Well, that's arithmetic  I think what you want is 5 to 9 percent  Is June [adding] about 1 percent in the second quarter?  Really, it's for this period out ahead--the next 18 months We don't have much distinction between the second half of 1983 and the year 1984  Yes, and I'd say we don't have a distinction in the GNP forecast either So, I think it makes sense to talk about the period ahead  We're talking about a block of time and we are not distinguishing one part of it from another  Of course, we're not really using the Ml number as a range with a midpoint We're talking about a true range of 5 to 9 percent and we're expressing hope, I would presume, that it could be more toward 5 percent, but that depends on the rate of increase in velocity  Or we could have another paragraph--associated with the particular increase in bank credit and Ml  I certainly don't want to do that  That has to be 5 to 9 percent  Either [unintelligible] or we're going to rebase  Yes, that's it  Well, the whole period could be spoken of as 5 to 9 percent I wouldn't make that much of a distinction between the second half and next year  I hadn't even thought of a cone No, I was thinking that I did not want to distinguish The reason I didn't vote with Lyle on reducing it to 4 to 8 percent is that it seems to me to be fine-tuning because we can't make any distinction between the rate of progress on the economy now for the second half of this year and for next year And our forecast is very close to assuming that So, it seems to me we ought to talk about a 5 to 9 percent rate of increase as being consistent, depending on what is going to develop in velocity, for this period ahead I see your point because the Humphrey-Hawkins Act asks us what our targets are for [the next year, which is] 1984  And ""tentatively for next year as well""  It is not set  Well, it certainly would set a precedent  We already have the difficulty of inconsistency  I thought we were cutting them a half point  The degree of weight on both placed on the velocity characteristics of Ml?  We haven't got velocity on total credit  It's a just an expression of what we did without any real analysis We will have to rely on the statement for that analysis But it's so complicated that I think that's the way to go  Well, it seems awfully fine  SPEAKER(?) Yes  [Unintelligible] compensating with regard to--  Yes, I think that would influence their thinking  -91-    7/12-13/83  I thought we took--  Well, it didn't blow up "
2380,1983-08-23," We have some book losses, though, don't we, Tony? That's my impression  But you would still sterilize it  Yes Of course, the dollar was weak  Of course, we're talking about a very large financing I guess it's true of the particular set of financing that occurred, but my recollection of the statistics is that both the month of July and the third quarter show substantially reduced federal financing compared to the second quarter  It was $65 billion or something like that in the second quarter And as a matter of fact, total credit expansion in July, for which the Bluebook reports a number, is down considerably  Well, that may be because they also had all that tax-exempt financing that went into governments  Now short rates are down too?  [Unintelligible] starting it; there's no question about it  Does Ml look better?  They are spending their money on a new car  You have prices and he has real growth  Seed the clouds  Is there some increase in orders?  Then people will stop liquidating their meat animals and that will really push meat prices up  I sort of agree with Nancy but for different reasons And that is--though I realize Jim has put the saving rate back [up] some--that I just think the projected saving rate is too low For the projection period it's around 4-1/2 percent as we go through 1984 I think that's an extraordinarily low rate And it's not consistent with all the incentives to save that the government has provided with IRAs and deferred compensation I'm not sure whether the problem is that income is being understated--it could be--in the forecast But that means stronger plant and equipment or something to provide the income that will make for a higher saving rate Or maybe consumption is too high I realize that people, because of pent up demand, can go in and use credit actively and draw down their financial assets in order to take care of their needs; [but] as soon as that's over, I should think that the saving rate would be around 6 percent Therefore, I would come in with a little lower forecast for the year from the fourth quarter of '83 to the fourth quarter of '84-- certainly lower than John Balles has, and lower I think than Lyle has  That's not in this period, I think  And there you're talking about 14 percent interest rates  Did I understand, Steve, that you were expressing the view that foreign demand for US investments affects US interest rates rather than US exchange rates?  I'd understood this as a circularity question I'd really dismissed foreign demands ebbing and flowing as having an effect on US interest rates because of the circularity of flow  Let's vote on alternative B and go home!  SEVERAL I'll second that  You're objecting to the Ml number, isn't that right? You would rather have the old Ml range That's all he's talking about  Well, the rates did go up a half point, Ted  We deserve anything we can get!  It's $100 million higher? Is that because you think that the demand for borrowing is a little higher?  I think it's an ordinary six-week interval  But our main aggregates are M2 and M3, which are within their ranges  Well, since you're the one who has that forecast --Steve doesn't have the same forecast--it's putting our trust in your forecast as against Steve's forecast  Consider that confirmation!  I guess, though, that I can understand Roger's point Another way to put it, precisely, is that you think $700 to $900 million is closer to giving us a 9-1/2 percent funds rate than $600 to $800 million was So, Roger's point is Well, why not just specify a 9-1/2 percent funds rate and forget about the borrowing number? There's some logic to that, I think  It depends on what rates did in the last few days "
2390,1983-09-08," By ""some move,"" Paul, do you mean just a little easing within that boundary on borrowings that we were talking about?  Beyond that?  How much beyond that? "
2408,1983-10-04," What, they wanted more?  I didn't figure they wanted less! [Laughter]  And the aggregate wage figures are not going anywhere    10/4/83  I thought the indication was that that was non- union people  MR, FORRESTAL No, the flight attendants are unionized And they have been mounting a petition in both those cities, Atlanta and Miami, to accept some form of wage concession They are saying Frank Bowman ought to be believed that the losses are going to be extensive, and it's better to have a 15 percent pay cut than no job Where the pilots and the others in that company are, I'm not sure Obviously, the effect of anything happening to Eastern would be devastating in our part of the country because Eastern and Delta account for about 90 percent of all traffic out of Atlanta's airport So, we're watching that situation pretty carefully  We vary quite a bit from Wojnilower and Kaufman  But again, Steve, I want to emphasize Ted's point about nominal income I think there could be a very marked effect on nominal income mostly through higher prices, and interest rates could move quite a bit if we have a 30 percent drop, say, in the value of the dollar I think it is a hazard, but it's more indirect than it is verifiable  Yes  Well, I agree with the staff forecast I think it's very plausible I usually have something to point out but now that they have the saving rate up some I don't have any complaint at all with it And it has even occurred to me that the forecast could be right, Lyle I really don't see anything in the domestic economy that would be terribly upsetting Possibly something could come out of this Eastern [Airlines] situation and we could get a lot of labor distress and a lot of stoppages in transportation But that's a long reach The really different thing about this projection compared to earlier ones is the big trade deficit I would take it that the trade deficit is our maximum contribution to increasing the prosperity of the world economy because we're importing a lot and not exporting much And I guess that's what we would want if we see a very weak growth economy And we certainly do seem to see one I've been amazed as I read both the New York reports and our own on country developments that there really hasn't been a strengthening around the world as I thought there would be as the summer went on Indeed, [the world economy] is beginning to look a little weaker  -16-    10/4/83  Well, Japan doesn't look particularly strong And, of course, Canada still has 12-1/2 percent unemployment So, I just don't see too much there But I think if something is wrong with the forecast, it's in that area--some result of the very, very unusual trade deficit and the very unusual potential for a drop in the dollar And that's going to upset the apple cart I can't say what it is, but that's the area I would refer to as the most problematic  Italy, France, and England are often mentioned  Maybe we need a larger trade deficit  That's an unusual hazard  Yes, I've heard it too The foreign--  Well, I don't know How would they get bridge financing for it? And if they move the cash to the United States, wouldn't the banks take it? It would be a very difficult period  Satisfied?  I think that's probably the question isn't it, Paul--whether they are going to snap back in the way projected?  The fundamental borrowing level  A little less  That sounds fine to me  The trouble with that is the undershoots end sometime  I don't agree with that I would be evenhanded and I would react to an appreciable change in the aggregates in either direction  And may become so  He neglected the fact that the Desk checks with the Chairman  How about ""maintain a slightly easier posture with respect""  -31-    10/4/83  Well, the staff projects pretty strong growth in the money supply; I wouldn't think it likely that the funds rate would drop by much In both the market and the net borrowings, it seems to me to--  That's even another combination--high money and a low economy  I like the word ""maintain"" and I like the words ""slightly easier"" Any connective that makes it possible--  Yes, because it's consistent with weak aggregates in the light of business conditions  Sure  You know, Paul, I think this language in the next sentence is just perfect  The language, you notice, does not qualify less restraint but it does qualify more restraint by saying ""somewhat"" more restraint And I think maybe that's a reasonable compromise  I don't either  That was my understanding too  You had 6-1/2 percent  It gives you a little movement around the mean I might remind you that we're talking about a number that is not even in the directive So what difference does it make whether it's a point or if we think of it as being a range of $100 million?  I don't think they did  But if you literally look at this language, I think it's not too bad  Well, the language is more permissive on the down side than on the up side  Oh yes, there's a modifier ""somewhat"" on the up side  Well, it's just that little [nuance]  I said it originally in order to solicit Pres's support but now I've said it to elicit your support on the other side  Well, that's clearly true  Well, that's a new thought  To zero, I thought "
2435,1983-11-14," Did I understand you to say that if productivity growth is 1 percent higher--that is, 2 percent rather than 1 percent-- that the unemployment rate associated with this long-term projection would be about a point lower?  Would that mean that total output would be quite a bit higher?  Because you have lower unemployment and more output per worker?  I see  You've taken a fairly restrictive definition of price stability How sensitive is this last table to that? If you said price stability was 1-1/2 percent or something like that instead of essentially [zero]--  In that case you should get [price stability] by 1987  Gradually?  Is it something like 5,5,4,3, and 2 percent?    11/14-15/83  May I just tack on to Tony's question? I was bothered by that too You just threw out a number on interest rates in 1988 and I'm not sure I heard it correctly I thought you said 9 percent or so for the funds rate Is that with a $120 billion improvement in the budget situation?  Yes, it's a $120 billion better budget deficit than otherwise--that is, without a change in policy occurring And there's still a 9 percent funds rate with a 1 percent rate of inflation? That sounds extraordinarily tough  You're getting close to the long run now, corresponding between money and prices--  Between [unintelligible] and 42 percent increase in velocity in '84 and a lower increase in velocity in '85  Yes, it does  This package is 33 percent next year and 15 percent the year after  And the strength of the dollar  That would be in the summer--the third quarter of '81 You only plotted M1 through the third quarter of '81, so there's another spike in here  Is this to make it more parallel with the other agreements?  A lot more  Well, if they are more than 90 days past due, I think they are statutory bad debts and they have to be [so reported] The accountants would certainly be negligent not to require that they be counted as nonperforming  I guess that's right, if they are past 90 days I don't know that anybody is [past due] 90 days  In our case, Paul, I think we ought to recognize that that will be a segregated reserve and will not be counted as capital For these $300 million--  It's mandated  The lending limit is on the bank  You have a positive financing gap of $8 billion in the second half of '83, according to Monday's [staff] presentation  -38-    11/14-15/83  May I just note, Jim, that you have brought the saving rate back now, but it's still not a high saving rate  -39-    11/14-15/83  To hold that up?  Yes That's freight cars  That might lead to larger inventories?  It has to be set up in advance  That's better than $200,000 an acre!  Listening to the reports from around the Districts, by and large they certainly do show a change in attitudes as against two or three months ago, probably just because we've moved  -51-    11/14-15/83  to a later stage of the business cycle We're now clearly in the expansion phase of the business cycle and that's reflecting itself very broadly across the economy There are structural differences, and I don't think we ought to be misled by them The policy mix in particular creates different circumstances than in previous recoveries John is concerned about his agricultural industry and his lumber products, but that's a direct result of the change in policy mix; we have higher interest rates and a higher dollar than we would have otherwise And the counterpart of it is generalized purchasing power, reflecting more [after] tax [income] that people are earning That just goes throughout the spectrum and brings us these reports of better retail sales and consumer optimism and so forth; that's just the other side of our picture So, taking that into account, I don't think there's anything that unusual, after adjusting for the policy [mix] change, in the recovery  The difficulty there is that we don't know how much the tax incentives are It may be that the tax incentives are offset by the [higher] interest rates in the aggregate Although I must say, speaking to Governor Gramley's comments, that I'm inclined not to think that there is much strength in the business fixed investment area I don't think it has that thrust and momentum; and I don't believe it's going to be that strong looking out ahead On the other hand, I'm impressed by what Karen Horn says about inventories I've noticed that in the last several months we've had very [sizable] accumulation but the ratio of inventories to sales has not improved at all; it's right at the bottom And if business should have a view that in order to take advantage of opportunities it needs a little thicker stocks, we could get quite an inventory accumulation, particularly if it should follow a Christmas season with very strong consumption because people feel good this year Therefore, there may be a little more [upside] hazard in the combined inventory-consumption area for the expansion But I don't agree that plant and equipment is all that strong Maybe I'm just too much of a Midwesterner and I'm impressed by the continued weakness in the basic industries which seems to me to be still, as Si says, very, very marked In sum, I rather agree with Pres Martin that we're having a good expansion There is some danger that it may run too strong as time goes on, but we don't have any indication of that at this point And we don't have any indication of a heating up of inflationary pressures And, therefore, perhaps what we ought to do for the moment is to sit back and enjoy it  Fourth  John, I think technically that's a reasonable proposal But I must say that you're making an awful lot of small differences in Ml growth The projection is for pretty good growth If it doesn't occur, of course, then we have a situation that needs to be confronted But the projection is 7-1/2 percent [for November-to- December] and 5-1/2 percent for the September-to-December period And it seems sort of strange to be reducing interest rates significantly with the background of the economic discussion that we had before the coffee break It almost requires, it seems to me, a confidence in the technical relationships that exceeds what I'm able to have in them So, I just can't agree with your particular proposal, but I do agree with your general comment that Ml is a lot better than it has been cracked up to be and quite a bit better than M2 and M3 And we ought to review this in connection with the posture we take for next year, which I guess would be at the next meeting and the January meeting  That could be true and Frank's point could still be right But I think it is true that we have a very responsive mortgage rate  We won't have Christmas sales yet  Yes, I'm for staying right where we are  I thought I rebutted John  I do  How about May of 1975?  We tightened because the aggregates went up  Very high!  And then pick up the--  Yes, because we might well have continued slow growth in the aggregates That [bounceback] is something that has been projected; we don't see it  But the rate of increase is decreasing  We just received the production number today and that is a half point less than last month  Yes, that's acceptable to me  The market might notice that  -65-    11/14-15/83  It's 5-1/2 percent  I think I prefer September to December, Paul We [generally] follow this policy and I'd keep it And I think 5 to 6 percent sounds like a quite respectful growth rate  Or almost down to ""C""  It's just an indicator We're not even running on this  -66-    11/14-15/83  5 to 6 percent or less  Zero is a lot less than ""C""  Well, 5 to 6 percent, Ted would give you what you would require--quite a lot of expansion  I'm worried about the open-end nature of the ""or less"" If we say ""or somewhat less,"" that perhaps is sending it too high, so I prefer 5 to 6 percent  Are we looking at the long-term aggregates or the credit numbers?  It's in there somewhere--that they are within the [long-term] range or something  Plus or minus 300! "
2466,1983-12-19," Second  That's as clean as a whistle  Mr Chairman, with such a clean letter as this, it makes me wonder about the auditors!  It seemed to be absolutely clean, though Would you say that's right, Clyde?    12/19-20/83  No reservations whatsoever?  Move to accept the report  No  Am I right, Steve, that this doesn't begin until the first of February?  So, we're talking about something that could receive attention again at the next meeting, I think  That was going to be my comment, too This gives us the opportunity for paying more attention to nonborrowed reserves and letting shortfalls and excesses show through But that does seem to me to require some determination by the Committee as to the amount of emphasis it wants to put on M1 That's why I asked about the timing It could be deferred somewhat Also, the figures may be suspect for a while, given the [new] procedures and all that Peter said we will be setting nonborrowed reserves just as we do now, but my impression is that what we set now is borrowings, not nonborrowed reserves And if we really did set nonborrowed reserves again, and then contemporaneously it ran off, that would put pressure on the discount window, as was our typical mode of operation when we voted to put in contemporaneous reserves So, I think it all needs to be considered in that context I guess I'm doing this as much as anything to remind the Committee that one of the decisions we need to make is the attention to be paid to Ml  I think the proposal, if I understood it from the staff, was that we might start off letting 25 percent of the overshoots and undershoots show through automatically and that might not be too inconsistent with something like equal attention to the set of the aggregates But perhaps Steve ought to answer that  Well, I guess I was reading between the lines  That's why I thought you suggested 25 percent-- to give some weight but not overwhelming weight to Ml behavior  When you say $50 million, where do you start off--where you were before? I don't quite understand  I guess I would have thought if we had let borrowing drift down from $650 to $600 million because of a weakness in Ml one week, that if Ml were then strong the next week, thus offsetting the [previous weakness], we'd drift back to $650 million from $600 million It seems we might get a progressive movement if we always went back to where we thought we should have been  We can plant them; we don't have to water them  Their sales to retailers?  Well, you asked for a different hypothesis on what is going on A surprise this afternoon is the amount of ebullience reported in Minnesota, which I would think would be in a cold deep freeze, and in Pennsylvania, which has not been a boisterous state over the years My only comment in response to that would be that businessmen are inclined to look at their performance compared with a year ago; that still is the way that 90 percent of the businessmen look at their activity We have now completed a year of recovery and, therefore, the November-to-November increases are as large as any they've seen--in fact the largest they've seen for the whole period of the recovery And they probably are the largest they  -25-    12/19-20/83  are going to see anytime in the expansion; [the increases] will go down from here rather than up So, I'm wondering whether we're not picking up a degree of false optimism in the business community and whether in fact it doesn't lay us open to the possibility that high expectations will be frustrated in the months to come I see that at least as a possibility  Now, as I look at the projection, the greatest problem I have with it--I've had it before--is that the saving rate is too low I think it ought to be higher; I would expect it to be higher given income performance, given incentives to save that we have in the economy now, and given the general notion of maintaining some kind of reasonable ratio of financial saving stocks to total income The way we would get the saving rate higher is either by having higher income or lower expenditures than are being forecast by the staff  Well, I can't even understand what is involved in that argument since we haven't been briefed on it, so I can't do that We could have higher income to the extent that there is more demand in the economy outside the consumer sector, principally perhaps inventory demand That's a possibility; we could have more inventory demand and more income generation as a result of that and, therefore, higher savings can result from higher income than is being projected On the other hand, we could have lower income if productivity gains in the short run are going to be considerably stronger than the staff has projected, which certainly seems possible, or if the wage rate environment stays placid There are a lot of indications that it is pretty placid and, therefore, it seems to me that is possible Now, if we have a reduction in consumer spending relative to income in the months ahead and if businessmen are expecting very good gains--gains that are too large for them really to anticipate getting--they will be disappointed in the months ahead That would provide a basis for an even smaller rise in business activity than is being forecast by the staff and that's consistent with the Ml numbers Therefore, slow growth in Ml--to bring in the monetarists in the crowd--is consistent with this last hypothesis  I don't know  No I think that the staff projection would be an almost ideal outcome, if we could get the staff projection  I don't think so I wouldn't want 33 percent rather than 43 percent growth for the next year I think something on the order of 4 percent is fine I would like to have maybe a little more real growth and a little less inflation than in the staff projection, but I think it's a very good projection I think we probably would find that we can't live with a number a good deal lower than that for very long, particularly in the environment we'll have next year But I think it is a very good [outcome] If I were asked  -26-    12/19-20/83  to state what my objective is for the economy in the next year, I would not be far off the staff projection Anyway, I was trying to make a case for a smaller rise [in business activity] You asked for something far out; there is a far-out scenario  Yes, that it would be lower because a rise in the saving rate would cut consumption, and consumption would have a feedback effect on business attitudes--considering that they're overly optimistic now  I know, but their saving rate continues very low  That's been done and they did [unintelligible]  I'm fairly optimistic As I said yesterday, I think 1984 will be okay as a year I don't really think that it's going to be as vigorous as Lyle, for example, has suggested I also  -45-    12/19-20/83  don't think it's going to be as weak as I suggested it could be yesterday--  --in the particular configuration that I was working out I'm not greatly concerned about 9 percent as a nominal GNP number fourth quarter-to-fourth quarter I think it's one we can key on So far as I can see, the figures that the staff has given us are pretty consistent with about a 9 percent GNP number So, I think the target growth rates as specified for 1984 are in the ballpark But we ought to do this in terms of what we think would produce or would be consistent with about a 9 percent GNP growth  Regardless of what happens next year, though, I really do think 1985 is going to be more of a problem It will be the third year of a recovery--if the recovery lasts all year And that's a recovery that is getting pretty old; it's getting to the time when the inflationary pressures get greater It certainly is going to be a time when pressures in credit markets ought to grow because of the increasing private demand And I would agree with Lyle that the role of the deficit in that really is to affect credit market conditions more than it is to affect the economy as a whole, which has pluses and minuses from fiscal policy but may in the short run at least be about offsetting So, if we see the year of 1985 developing as one in which we may have credit-crunch type conditions--and that is generally now being forecast in the market--do we want to say that we're going to reduce our growth rates for the aggregates because we have some concept of a long-run non-inflationary environment, and thus ensure that there will be a credit crunch in 1985? I doubt that we want to say that So, I would avoid a specific number for 1985 for that reason, because we do want to give as much encouragement as possible to the hope that there might be some fiscal action before 1985 is over Again, it seems extremely unlikely that there will be any big fiscal move taking effect in the first part of '85; it might take effect in the spring or the summer of '85 When we don't know what the timing would be, even if there is any fiscal policy action--except that it seems unlikely that it would be at the very beginning of the year--that makes it extremely difficult to state any kind of policy tradeoff So, I wouldn't specify anything for '85  I think Ml has done quite a lot better than some people around the table give it credit for But in this period it's certainly true that it doesn't look [consistent with] the GNP number, but that's because it doesn't have the stability characteristics that M2 or M3 or total credit have and that make them glide along at a more normative number that isn't too far, usually, from the GNP number But I think that the performance of Ml has not been that bad and has been more indicative of what is going to happen in the economy than anything that M2 has shown over the last couple of years I was going to say, Nancy, that M2 is 9 percent every year, good or bad, but you already said M3 is 9-1/2 percent regardless So, I can't say that except that it seems to me also true M2, by the way, I think shouldn't show the decline in velocity characteristic of earlier periods when we've had disintermediation because, after all, 80 to 90 percent of the total is now interest sensitive And I think the [depository] institutions will be very competitive in the rates they offer as credit demands increase They certainly will try to keep the  -46-    12/19-20/83  flows coming in and, therefore, I think we could expect that M2 will show even more stability than it has shown in the past as the institutions operate on M2 as they have operated on M3 in the past-- and that is to be a source of funding So, I would give more status to Ml I would adopt the staff's proposals, which I guess are pretty much the same as we had set in a preliminary way last July And I would be quiet about specific numbers for 1985  One other point I want to agree with Ed Boehne in that I don't think we can expect to make progress every year on the rate of inflation anyhow I think we have to look at it as a full cycle process And if we can keep the inflation rate from accelerating much beyond 5 percent, or certainly keep it from accelerating beyond 6 percent in the course of this cycle, then we can go down to zero in the next recession And we'll have a much better posture for having a much less inflationary cycle the next time around But I don't think it's reasonable to say we have a 4-1/2 percent inflation forecast for next year and in 1985 we'll bring it down to 4 percent and in 1986 to 3-1/2 percent and in 1987 to 3 percent We just can't do that The dynamics of the economy won't permit it  So moved  SPEAKER(?) Second  I think it's premature to tighten today I agree with Pres and Nancy that the economy still has quite a lot of room in it--that we don't really have any signs of inflation except in the hype that the market is putting on the question And it would be wrong to move in response to that If we were closer to full utilization, we would have a little less tolerance to a mistake on the up side I thought Ed Boehne was going to conclude that since our forecast is reasonable we shouldn't change policy But he surprised me by saying that since the forecast is reasonable we ought to tighten up I guess I don't agree with that unless unusual strength develops in the period ahead That is, we can't really stand more surprises on the up side of our expectations; we could stand some surprises on the moderately lower side So, I think your original proposal is a quite good one I don't see why we ought to bias the result by starting out with a higher borrowed reserve figure than we have currently I think we ought to put it in at $650 million or thereabouts and then if, in fact, things strengthen quite a bit in the weeks to come, we ought to let the borrowing run up with the strengthening that occurs I would feel a good deal more willing to see some snugging if we could get some strength from Ml We haven't had it--except for last week--and I guess if we did get now a rather meaningful expansion in Ml, that would be another signal that perhaps the economy was stronger and thus we ought to snug So, I would do just as you suggested in the beginning, Paul, but with $650 million--I don't know that you spoke to the borrowing number--as the beginning borrowing number  It's rather hard to think that we'll get much news except for unemployment Obviously, there's going to be continuing strength in the economy The question is Is it going to be surprising strength?  We're not going to raise borrowings--are we?-- unless we decide to snug up, which is getting along into the period Then the funds rate may go up and then we'll change the range That's the order in which it ought to occur  It used to be that in Chicago department store sales were negative the week after Christmas; returns exceeded sales  If that should be picked up by the newspapers-- negative sales--  Yes  Accelerate "
2491,1984-01-30," Second  It's hard to say where equilibrium might be  We've been predicting it for a year and a half  Would you explain the Jamaican--?  Let me ask the staff who look at the domestic side of the economy whether they were aware that the implication of the international projection is for the residual rate of price increase to go down as 1984 and 1985 transpire It seems rather inconsistent with what you have for unit labor costs, which don't go down, and GDBP prices, which don't go down Yet the working through of this I take it by Ted's people on the international side is that once you take the international effect out, you must have a decline in the rate of inflation Do you want to comment on that, Jim?  Is that the CPI?  The other thought I had as I looked at this particular chart is that I don't see much delay in the price effect of the alternative projection--that is, the one where you have the dollar falling to a hundred by the fourth quarter of 1984 It seems as if the maximum first difference price effect appears almost at the same time I thought there was supposed to be a lag of 6 months or so  So we're looking at the increment, and the increment is at its maximum in the early quarters; then the increment falls off but the total effect continues to accumulate  That's 2 percent!  That's assuming that the current account would be zero in the absence of the federal deficit I'm not so sure  Well, it could be even larger, it seems to me As I've said, in addition to consumer demand, which is fueling imports now, we have the probability of a speed-up in inventory accumulation It may well be stronger, as Lyle thinks, and that's going to feed disproportionately into imports I must say that I sense a certain fragility in the forecast, the same as Lyle does I'm not so sure I would say the first half will be that much stronger, but I think the odds would favor a gradually accelerating price rise, particularly in 1985 And with a sharp drop in the value of the dollar--say, perhaps 25 percent in the latter part of '84 or early '85--why, we would have more of a price rise Because of that, we also would have problems financing the deficit, higher interest rates, and reduced domestic demand So, as I see it, the odds are that 1985 will have more inflation, less real growth, and higher interest rates than the staff is forecasting  If I might, I would like to ask Governor Wallich something You have a declining domestic stimulus, don't you? That is, using your terms of reference, you have $60 billion of financing abroad and $140 billion stimulus [last] year and in 1984 you have $100 billion financing abroad and $100 billion stimulus Doesn't it decline, and wouldn't that give you a reduced stimulus?  -18-    1/30-31/84  Yes, it's hard to do the arithmetic  Frank, those subsidiary banks had to finance that loan purchase didn't they?  I think Frank's second point was much better that they will tend to put this out in the market  Well, that's the same way we started off before  Let's assume, Steve, that Frank is partly right and the velocity wants to go [down] rather than [up] So you would have a situation where M2 is 10 percent relative to the same nominal GNP we're expecting and we have a 9 percent limit on our range How do we go about getting M2 down in the range?  What if we have elasticity of rate setting by the institutions? Can't they just meet that--  Well, the GNP will go up less rapidly  Well, it would, certainly  Are you talking about the long run?  You're talking about the short run  I think you meant between I and II  Well, I want to agree with Lyle and Henry, if that's possible In agreement with Lyle, I think that a 9 percent nominal GNP increase for the year would be about right, and I break it down roughly as half price and half real If it runs substantially above that in either real or price or both, it ought to be stepped on; and if it runs substantially below that, it ought to be given a little care and feeding So the question is What aggregates would be consistent with that kind of an economic performance? Now, I want to agree with Henry in the sense that I do believe that M1 has had a pretty reasonable record recently and I can't see anything superior about M2 So, I think M1 should be reestablished as one of our targets but not given primacy I wouldn't agree with Ted on that, but I'd have it as one of our targets But we ought to avoid the automaticity that we used from the fourth quarter of '79 to some time in '82 I think that experience indicated that, because of the lags in adjustments in the demand for money and changes in conditions, we really did overshoot on the up side and the down side in that experiment We need to treat it more gently, along the lines that Tony was talking about [rather than] along the lines that we did in 1979 So, I would put it back very much as it has been done in the alternative directive language the staff proposed  Now, what targets? I don't think we really have a clear view as to what kind of velocity performance to expect in M1 in the coming period I'm inclined to agree with Henry that it probably will be less of a rise than in the past because of the inclusion of Super NOWs in that category So I would be reluctant to see us narrow that range of 4 to 8 percent that we have in alternative II Chances are that growth for the year probably will come in at 6 or 6-1/2 percent, if  -30-    1/30-31/84  what I expect to occur in velocity does occur But there's just too much risk that velocity won't show that much strength as the year goes on I wouldn't reduce the M2 range from 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent because I'm somewhat sensitive to Frank's comment that velocity may not go down for M2 in the year to come Now, it may be that it was a statistical error that led us to adopt 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent before; but having made that statistical error publicly, and having had it accepted, I see no reason not to take the benefit of it and leave it as we did when we talked about ranges for this period initially last July It gives us just a little more room For M3 I think 6 to 9 percent is probably okay because in addition to M3 financing there will be borrowing abroad that will give us a little more lift in total institutional credit than the 6 to 9 percent seems to imply So, I would urge that we reestablish M1 as a co-equal in targeting; that we think in terms of supporting something like a 9 percent nominal GNP increase fourth quarter to fourth quarter; and that we use the ranges specified on page 5 for alternative II as an indication of what we think will be consistent with that  We don't want to clash with Humphrey-Hawkins on this  He's taking it all the way back  I think we're rather tight on M2, so we will go over on that one  Yes, for sure  I'd like to take Frank's suggestion and monitor all three  She was typing something The Xerox machine has been--  Certainly [unintelligible]  ""Move back toward a more sustainable""?  That was put in several years ago, Tony, and we've never been able to change it since then  -41-    1/30-31/84  Well, to the extent necessary--  ""And contribute to a more sustainable""?  Yes, but it implies it now, just barely  No, I don't either  Well, I would go with Si's suggestion, too, but I think we're quite split on this question Did you count half [unintelligible]?  I think the first phrase does capture it  SPEAKER(?) That's a good sentence  10 percent  Actually, it seems to me that we are assuming putting normative velocity in the range  About 3 percent  ""Its velocity as [well as that] for M2 and M3 would remain unpredictable""  Volatility  That will certainly change things  I think maybe the word ""more"" should be taken out  Substantial weight  Well, that's true In that case, then, in the next paragraph I guess we'd have to drop--  We've already captured part of the next paragraph in the phrase that Paul put in there about interpreting M1 But I think that would be a sensible way of doing it  M2 and M3 and M1  Yes, I think they will  That's not clear  It says M1 would receive more substantial weight  I thought it was pretty evenhanded What do you mean? Did you do that by putting in ""somewhat greater restraint""?  We'll release it before you actually present it?  Which is first this time Senate or House?  Do you mean that you wouldn't send the wire there?  It's a procedural requirements thing  How was there a free ride? I don't understand this at all  Now I see  So we ought to have more vault cash for two weeks?  There's another point, which we began to discuss We were expecting last time that there would be a strengthening in the aggregates and in the economy, and we were probably right on the edge of tightening up The question is Should that stance be more neutral now because, after all, we didn't get that strengthening?  It all dropped off one side of the--  The leading indicator was up 06? And was the previous month revised?  Yes  Well, forgetting these more abstract issues that [unintelligible] in the GNP, the production index is up less and the employment is up less than it was before I would point out that the stock market has declined significantly And, therefore, although Lyle could be right, I think we have to wait for evidence to confirm  -57-    1/30-31/84  that there will be more strength than the 4 to 4-1/2 percent kind of normative number that people have in mind  That is [unintelligible]  Everybody's going to move to Dallas!  Oh yes, I think that's desirable  It ought to be more evenhanded  I don't know where you're reading from either  Page 6?    1/30-31/84  I think that's all right  Shouldn't we have a show of hands on who wants to put M1 back in and give it more equal weight? I don't have a count on that; maybe you do  Yes, and it comes up every time we have any kind of discussion  Everyone is quite predictable as to what they will say  I've been putting it back in for quite a while  Well, we could do M2, M3, and M1 We could say ""M2 and M3 at annual rates of about blank percent and blank percent respectively, and M1 at about blank percent""  We don't need it at all, I guess, because it's the same number [for M2 and M3]  Maybe we ought to say ""M2 and M3 each at annual rates of about 8 percent""  Well, I sort of miss the ""respectively,"" too But ""each"" becomes a substitute for ""respectively"" Then the next sentence is nonfinancial debt  That should be ""would""  Well, it's going to be a moderated response in any event in either direction  I don't read it that way I read that whole first phrase as applying to both parts, the lesser or greater restraint We're taking into account the economy  You think that modifies ""greater restraint""?  That's what I was reading  Oh, I see Okay  That's why I said it seemed to apply equally on either side  Page 18?  SPEAKER(?) In the Bluebook  I think we ought to be pretty evenhanded  What if the opposite should occur? What if the aggregates come in strong--and, after all, for January they are projected to be strong--and the economic news were to continue to be soft? What would you do then?  So it's the economic indicators that are moving you rather than the aggregates?  We could leave it at the end, Paul, but put in another comma and, using your draft, say ""both viewed in the context of continued strength in business expansion""  After all, we would always do that anyway, wouldn't we? We wouldn't set policy without looking at the economy  He doesn't particularly want to see the other hands!  No, I don't think so  It's a very good possibility, but I don't think there's clear evidence  You're talking about $200 or $300 million more than that?  So, it's about even on the marginal reserve measure with borrowing of $650 million and excess reserves of $600 to $700 million? "
2520,1984-03-26," So move  Time to move that around, isn't it?  SPEAKER(?) Let's bid!  That isn't being used currently Isn't that right?  And, of course, the Greenbook  In connection with the reclassification it would be a convenient thing to do I do believe that there [has been no] difficulty, Nancy, except for a few times when the Secretary said something We can hardly stop that There have been occasions when it looked as if it had been circulated pretty widely on the staff But with a redoubling of emphasis on security of the document we might be able to take care of that problem, though not the problem of the Secretary saying something  It recognizes something that we have been doing since the middle '60s, I think, or certainly since the late '60s  It probably is generally sent out on Thursday now isn't it, Jim?  That's right away, so they get it very early Then the following Monday--  SPEAKER(?) The Bluebook is--  No, not the Bluebook  It might be better to send the Greenbook to them the following Monday or something like that    3/26-27/84  We were not thinking of the first vice president  You can, of course, if he's going to substitute for you at a meeting You can clear him for that purpose    3/26-27/84  That's right  This would be on a strict need-to-know basis You would keep a record of when you let the first vice president have access, I take it So, if we had to follow down a leak, he would be caught up in it But it wouldn't be a continuous matter; it would just be for specific occasions  Well, I think we'd want them to be on the payroll of the Federal Reserve Banks!  You said ""three other individuals"" That could be anybody Let's see, Jack Anderson and--  They're not ready on Thursday night  We've discussed that too at other times  There's a really good suggestion We could say at 200 pm Friday afternoon or something like that  It seems to me that we once went through all the days of the week and it turned out that Tuesday was the only possible day  Yes, it had to do with directors' meetings  Mr Chairman, did we take up item 7 on the agenda?  Yes There was a Manager's recommendation very different from [the recommendation in the memo], and I thought we ought to have some discussion of that  You were on number 8 Somehow item 7 got lost  RPs on bankers acceptances  Peter, am I right in thinking that if you knew some very, very compellingly bad information about a large bank that you wouldn't want to make RPs on their bankers acceptances?  And that would also include a foreign agency or branch?  Well, of course, we got out of buying and selling them some time ago Isn't that right, Peter?  Well, we say we have plenty of government securities and no probability of any shortage any time soon We say we don't need it for open market operations and we say the market is strong on its own and therefore--  I do too  It is conceivable that we might have some embarrassments looking ahead We don't have any now We can get out gracefully now And it won't present a possible issue later on  I think all it takes is Committee acceptance of the manager's recommendation, which is to stop in practice doing RPs on bankers acceptances over the next several months in a graceful way  Executive Committee on what?  No, I think it would have to be a wire by the Chairman or a notification vote  But it's our analysis of the statistics, of course, which may differ from other analyses from time to time  If I were sitting down in Mr Kichline's chair, I would object strenuously because I think it would affect the way it is written I think the Redbook has been greatly affected by becoming the Beigebook and I think the Greenbook would be affected by becoming a public document One is just much more careful--much more stylistic and formalistic--in the way things are said For example, the staff wouldn't point out that there's something wrong with the GNP figures because of the treatment of PIK or they would say it in such a subtle way that no one could understand what they were saying And I think there would be a loss of capability to communicate with the Committee  Well, I suppose so You remember, there didn't used to be a Part I; there was just a Part II Part I came about because we thought we would do those projections and that they ought to be more confidential than Part II  It had no projections at all when I came here But I must say, I think it is a way of communicating What you'll probably have to do is develop a Part I supplement or something that has more of the material that used to be in Part II  [The Governors] don't have the personal staffs that the Presidents have to give us all that information We have to read Part II  -23-    3/26-27/84  It's close to a six month give-up of interest for them I think the last payment was October 12th  I see  They would deduct it from their reserve for bad debts, wouldn't they?  That's the way they are supposed to do it according to the Call Report  Yes You might have to later on  Banks are supposed to have some outside accountants that tell them  I think it was stated quite a bit more broadly than that in the article in The Wall Street Journal that you probably are referring to  I don't know As a matter of fact, I called to find out if anybody knew whether you had been doing this or not after I read that article and I couldn't find anybody who did I think it was more broadly stated in terms of a considerable interest rate give- up It reminded me of the days when they used to say that the Fed told the banks they ought to continue with those REIT loans We never said it, but that was what all the bankers said we said  Always a disturbing thought  Unless we are prepared to guarantee the loans  What did happen with the dollar this morning, Gretchen? You seemed to allude to a decline  Just somewhat?  There could be a debt limit problem couldn't there?  I move it  You never said it was Mesquite  Less sophisticated!  Your investment sector has done quite a bit better?  Well, the question, of course, is whether in the future [those growth rates] are going to be that low I agree with your concerns and I agree with Lyle's Clearly, the economy has been too darn strong for several months now and if it continues very much longer, we will have used up any slack we have and will be backed into a period of a substantial inflationary pressure We're at 81 percent capacity utilization, I think Bob said Even using the staff projection, we get up to 85 percent in a not very long time The only time that level exceeded 85 percent in recent years was around the end of 1977 and early 1978 And, of course, that was a period when high inflation conditions were developing So, we have used a lot of our capacity and unless we do get this slowing growth in the economy that the staff has forecast, before we know it we will be into a period of growing inflationary pressures And that's the thing we haven't faced Now, certainly, fiscal stimulus has been a problem with the economy But I have some feeling that another problem has been that there is too much credit If you look at the credit ratios, they are high compared with earlier cycles For consumer credit and even for business credit they are showing sharp increases and are getting up to the upper end of previous ranges Somebody who is well positioned in the home building industry said to me not long ago that he hated to tell me this but the difficulty in the home building industry was that the lenders were throwing money at the builders They were calling them up and saying ""Come on, why don't you use my money? Why not have some more starts?"" And that wasn't in Dallas either, Bob It's an indication, I think, of conditions that are just too accommodative-- given the backlog of demand that we perhaps have developed for houses and durables and things like that and certainly given the optimism of consumers, which is just too strong to have that kind of money availability around So, I see the danger much more clearly than I have at previous Committee meetings over the last year as being the danger of expansion over the staff projection rather than below the staff projection And I think the danger of that is much greater than before because of having used up the unused resources that we previously had available  Do the data you have indicate that they are going up faster this year than last year?  It's more or less that  You're talking about the rates, not the aggregates?  I don't see how this changes the aggregates  Do you mean a penalty rate above the funds rate?  Did you say ""strongly resist""?  If retail sales fell below your projection in the second quarter--I'm talking right ahead--wouldn't the result be just a larger increase in inventories? It would seem to me, especially with the inventory/sales ratio so low, that it wouldn't affect production  Yes  ""A minus""  Raise the discount rate to 10 percent?  All right  As I said yesterday, I think that there is now a danger of an overheating of the economy in the foreseeable future And that, of course, will materialize rather quickly if the staff projection of a moderation in economic growth does not come about It may well come about, but it's a risky business I also am impressed by the extent to which debt expansion has played a role in this more rapid growth in activity When we had to use a variant of Frank's favorite number--private domestic nonfinancial debt--at the meeting of this Committee on January 26 we were estimating for the fourth quarter that it would increase at a 92 percent annual rate The quarter was already over by 26 days The revised estimate that we have this time is 109 percent--an increase of 17 percentage points for the fourth quarter For the first quarter, the estimate we were looking at last time was 84 percent Now we are looking at 111 percent--an increase  -68-    3/26-27/84  of 27 percentage points from the [previous estimate], some of which is due to these oil company takeovers but not more than a point, I think Clearly, it seems to me, there is an excessive rate of expansion in domestic debt that can't be attributed in a first effect sense at least to the deficit but to private borrowing I have the sense--and I only look at the Washington papers and maybe to some extent New York--of a tremendous amount of momentum in the drive to extend consumer credit to the public on the part of the banks and of the drive to put out mortgage credit There are radio ads and all kinds of ads--a lot of them deceptive--about the terms and conditions of borrowing, and people are responding to those ads Businesses are too They have variable rate loans and whether people know what that means I have no idea But there has been too much debt expansion, I think  I wouldn't be as aggressive as Lyle in saying that it's time not only to pull the punch bowl a little distance away but to turn it partly over because I'm not that certain of the future And I do think there are some structural weaknesses of the kind that the Chairman mentioned I'm worried about the thrifts The thrifts are going into a deficit situation very shortly now with this level of rates And the higher the rates, the greater the deficit It may turn out, as I told some of them, that 1980-81 was just a dress rehearsal to what is going to happen to them in future, in which case we have a whole industry that will be very, very shaky in the economy I'm worried about housing Those are housing starts, not housing sales, and it's not customary for builders to line up their buyers before they start a house I'm worried about the change in psychology in the consumer market that would turn people off housing so that the housing inventories would be sitting on the market as unsalable items the way they are in Dallas And I'm worried about the LDCs who I think will react quite adversely to a major increase in interest rates in the United States economy and will be very, very sorely impacted So, I just don't have the courage to move as aggressively as an aggressive fellow like Lyle Gramley would at this stage Therefore, I come down to alternative B as not being unreasonable If we take that in terms of the aggregates, that's not a modest ambition for the second quarter The reason that M1 is as low as it is in alternative B for the second quarter is that there's one relatively low month, and that may or may not materialize It's not a slow rate of expansion as you look over the quarter as a whole; it's going to be a rather hard thing to accomplish I'm particularly impressed by Steve's comment, which I happen to believe, that after a quarter where velocity increases sharply it's more likely that in the next quarter velocity won't increase so sharply because the money supply increases a lot more than it did before I think the danger is going to be that whatever of these alternatives we set, money is going to run higher That's why I questioned Jerry on ""strongly resist"" because to resist strongly, if we really mean that, could mean very high interest rates by the end of the second quarter I think we need to lean and lean pretty hard and look at the aggregates more seriously than we have before, but I don't want to lean all that hard  In sum, I would buy alternative B; I certainly wouldn't buy anything tighter than alternative B for the period to come Considering what I think may happen, 11 percent on the funds rate seems to me too much of a near-term constraint that will require a telephone call and I would use the full funds rate range On  -69-    3/26-27/84  borrowings, $1 billion seems okay to me; $12 billion seems awfully high We're starting to move up toward the levels of borrowing that are associated with fairly tight money periods as we get well above $1 billion And, what's that rate, Henry? I don't know what to do about the hippopotamus rate!  That's not a decision that can be made here or that can be made readily There are lots of strategy questions involved in [the discount rate decision], so we shouldn't really talk about it  This is really reserve restraint It isn't an algorithm of the amount of overage  Yes, I didn't want to--  I think it ought to be higher  I think [we should use] 7-1/2 to 11-1/2 percent Somehow 12 percent does sound awfully rich--doesn't it?--although it may not be It's just a culture shock  Yes  A rate of 11-1/2 percent, though, Lyle, is a reasonable amount above where we are at about 10-1/4 percent And as the Chairman points out, we never have let that stop us if in fact something were going on that called for more restraint  -75-    3/26-27/84  I think they look pretty good  If we could actually come out there, I'd be pretty happy  It's symmetrical  It wouldn't load it, though, toward a higher rate I understood Jerry to say he was more concerned about getting indications of a significant overshoot of these targets than he is about a significant undershoot And I think I agree with him on that  We've often used it before I don't know why we would throw it out now  I agree with that  You may well have to do that We can't really--  If that were the case, then I think we should have moved But you could have a stronger money quarter, a stronger GNP quarter, and everything, but--  These are educated guesses of the staff?  You were asking a technical question, weren't you? I don't know The funds rate has gone up a bit relative to the discount rate Technically, there would be room for it to move a half point and not have a much different funds rate, I should think But of course, there is the expectational [element] We have an 8-1/2 percent discount rate as against a 10-1/4 to 10-1/2 percent funds rate I would submit that a 9 percent discount rate would not--  It would not have to, except the expectational--  Let's get some views  Do you agree with that, Steve?  How about a quarter point?  I would agree with Pres I think this is tending to go too far Who is it that we are trying to satisfy? The gnomes of Zurich? There are a lot of people who don't want to see a tightening As a matter of fact if you went out and took a poll, you would find that a vast majority of the American public would be opposed to a tightening  We heard a lot of expressions like that as we went around the table  Are we back to talking about the funds rate? I thought we had decided that  I'd be inclined to vote against this 7 to 11 percent I just don't think there's enough room from where we are  Well, I understood all that conversation to be only the initial word  And the question is What do we do if the aggregates come in stronger? I think we have to have some room to move the rates and ought to have enough room to move the funds rate up above 11--in the 11-1/4 to 11-1/2 percent range  It depends on what the rates are  Well, this seems to me an entirely different matter than the December meeting vote, as I interpreted that The market was surprised to read that we would have been prepared to tighten if business had been strong And, of course, they were reading this at a time when business was strengthening Therefore, it's not so unreasonable to assume that if we were prepared then, we must be prepared now That's quite different from a technical top to a range before we have a consultation  At 11-1/2 percent  If we were to have a discussion, I don't think you'd get an immediate decision  Why don't we leave it suspended?  7-1/2 to 11-1/2  Let's try again  Paul's saying no salami goes with it!  Variant II on page 4 of the draft directive?  It goes from 0 to $400 million, so we have to say that we're going to tighten  That's the problem  Well, we certainly ought not to keep M1 at the end of the list, as M2, M3, and then M1 I would buy your proposal that we can make it M1, M2, and M3 as just a more logical way to express it  Because we've tightened We say here ""to retain""  Everybody so far has taken a predictable point of view--100 percent predictable I was wondering whether we could fuzz this up a little  In the first place, we could make it ""broadly consistent"" as a way to fuzz the annual rates of growth in M1, M2, and M3 That's what has to be done--make it broadly consistent--because we don't know what those multiplier changes are or what excess reserves are going to be and all that  I was thinking we could say annual rates of ""around"" That would be one other way  The trouble with that is that it makes the edge points of the ranges pretty sensitive  I don't know, Henry I think the range makes it somewhat more difficult  Yes There's a pretty fair chance that M1 is going to be at 10 percent or something like that And if we set a range of 5 to 7 percent, 10 percent is way above the range  I know, but the range makes it--  It even has the great word ""maintain"" in it  I really think ""seeks a degree of"" is better than ""maintain""  Yes, because we have to test, to probe  And ""over time""  ""At annual rates of around""  I have trouble understanding just what that means when I read it  Yes It's just that when we say we're seeking the degree that allows for changing that pressure--  I don't know either  Once we had it in there like that  You could make it a little more by making the second one ""might"" instead of ""would""  You really don't want this last sentence in here, do you?  I think it is fairly highlighted where it is We could use the technical term for it, ""the rate of growth of domestic nonfinancial debt"" to show that we're really looking at that  The directive That's true  SPEAKER(?) The written directive  Do you want to do that? "
2546,1984-05-21," So moved  The additional 30 days would put it right up to June 30 and the question of the treatment of the income arises again And I suppose there's more of it by now  Sam, I'm surprised that the weakness of the dollar on the basis of the Continental Illinois situation wasn't greater than what we observed I'd view that as saying that they were prepared to shift funds among US banks--that is, they didn't regard US banks as a group as questionable  A movement back into some foreign banks  You said no  I don't either It's a government guaranteed bank  It doesn't say that  Yet the futures market has functioned okay?  There must have been some realized losses taken that haven't shown up, as yet anyhow [Do you know of] any particular situation?  I was thinking of the nondealers  My thought, Tony, has been that the dealers were losing on spot transactions and gaining on the futures, which means that somebody other than the dealers was losing on the futures  For the most sensitive ones, the ones that are most on the line, I think that is probably right But after that there will be another batch behind them  They give a special discount I guess that's what happens They have a list price and say If you buy, we'll give you a discount  Also, if you have to rebuild the whole roof you worry about how long it's going to be before it rains again  Nobody is hearing that it's the Federal Reserve!  We can inquire, of course, about PCAs But I must say I've been hearing for years that the typical situation, say, out in Roger's area or in the middle West was that the banks kept the good loans and the PCA made the bad loans If the banks are now complaining about their portfolios being poor, can you imagine what the PCA portfolios must be? They must be rotten  I think the staff projection is quite appropriate to use for planning purposes by the FOMC It does tend to make the future look a lot more favorable than the recent past, but maybe in fact that's how it will work out I've been impressed in the last six weeks by the growing number of uncertainties, however, about what is occurring on the inflationary side I would say my gravest concern, which, of course, we can't really evaluate, is the Persian Gulf If oil shipments from there are closed out, as they might well be, that is going to have major repercussions that are very hard to see but that might well turn out to be of an inflationary character Incidentally, Tony, I think the main reason that we're not getting these projections of double-digit inflation is that people aren't factoring in a big increase in oil prices such as occurred in 1979 and which had a major effect on the rate of inflation that most countries experienced in the 1980-81 period If you were to add a 50 percent increase in oil prices, say, I think you might get a much higher inflationary expectation from the surveys In any event, there's just no way of evaluating that except to recognize it as a problem and a problem on the inflationary side, if it occurs  -24-    5/21-22/84  I get a little worried when Bob starts to talk about dust bowls Of course, the other thing that has given us some inflationary trouble in the past was a major crop failure On the other hand, if it's only half of Texas, I think we're probably all right It takes a much wider dust bowl than that to give us major difficulty On the other side, I think the major negative--and it's awfully hard for me to evaluate--is the uncertainty of financial markets Karen talks about the leveraged buyouts Those leveraged buyouts, as I understand it, are usually leveraged 4 or 5 to 1 They depend on an interest rate assumption and are very sensitive to the interest rate assumption If you put interest rates up 2 points on the 4 or 5 parts that are financed, it raises great questions about those leveraged buyouts I noticed that Lyle mentioned the stock market has declined I just looked it up in the Greenbook and the NASDAQ index is off 25 percent Did you realize that? Those are the kinds of stocks that are in leveraged buyouts And a major decline in that market has occurred since the late 1983 high I'm inclined to agree with Jerry that for these deals to work out there has to be more inflation And if there isn't more inflation, they're not going to work out The question is Which is going to occur? Will there be more inflation or will the deals begin to fail and the people begin to pull back? On that point I would make the observation that I don't know that we have had much restraint on the part of lenders for a long time I don't know if that was true during the last cycle either There was very little restraint on the part of lenders  I think there's a good chance, Tony, that that's what is going to happen--that they are going to pull back I think they are counting on good value there; that's why I made the point about the 25 percent drop in NASDAQ prices on average They are talking about selling and the value is dropping in the market for those [companies] I think they may well pull back In fact, I'm inclined to think that we're now reading the views of the recent past rather than the current period I believe that the Columbus offer was withdrawn yesterday I read in the paper this morning that that was  -25-    5/21-22/84  cancelled A lot of those deals are capable of being cancelled and certainly new ones may not be generated at the rate they were before, if people are quite uncertain about the future  That brings me to my second point about the financial markets and that is that although lenders may not be so conservative and restrictive, I think maybe borrowers could be more sensitive because everybody is on floating rate loans, including the farmers We've had quite a rise in rates quickly and that reminds people that rates can go up pretty high They have had experience with 20 percent rates in the past So, there isn't any kind of limit that one mentally puts on how high rates could go I think people are likely, in an effort of self-preservation, to be more conservative about the credits that they demand in the future In summary, I would say that the negative here is the possibility that the financial market will be much less buoyant than it has been for credit and that that may give us less spending than we're anticipating I'm not predicting a financial collapse or anything like that, but I just think that people will pull back because rates have gone up so much and so fast--not so much, really, as so fast And we just haven't seen the effects of that on planning and on expectations where we have past data and past decisions So, I think there's both an inflationary threat to the forecast mainly from the Persian Gulf and there is also a prospect that we could come in below the forecast mainly associated with the financial markets For our own purposes, I think we can use the forecast  I think ""B"" is all right I would point out that ""B"" has specifications for a number of aggregates and that if the aggregates run stronger--which they might well do in the case of M1 particularly and are already doing in the case of M3--then the question arises as to what to do if they are strong or well above the path There is language in the directive left over from last time that deals with that and speaks of greater reserve restraint if there is more substantial growth in the monetary aggregates  -35-    5/21-22/84  Now, I think we are all talking about financial market conditions in one way or another as a paramount feature of our discussion this time I wouldn't support the prominent and extreme billing given to any unusual financial strains in the very first part of the operating paragraph in the directive On the other hand, I think we could put in a more general phrase about financial market conditions late in the paragraph That is, it could go down where we are saying that in either case--if we decide to ease or to move higher in terms of rates because of the behavior of the aggregates--such a change would be considered in the context of appraisals of the continuing strength of the expansion, inflationary pressures, financial market conditions, and the rate of credit growth That also has a desirable attribute in that it includes things other than the Continental problem We have had a very bad couple of months in financial markets and, indeed, a repetition of that could well give us trouble in an unknown way It could be a futures market that breaks or something like that And financial market conditions is a term that could encompass all of that  I don't think we ought to bias the borrowing number toward tightening, as Lyle suggests I would buy Pres's $900 to $1100 million I guess I would have assumed that $1 billion means $900 to $1100 million and that there's not much difference from what we now have I also wouldn't want to prejudge long rates Lyle made the point that long rates shouldn't be permitted to come down Well, I think they have gone up quite a bit more than one would have expected as a result of a run toward short instruments in a time of great uncertainty Should the uncertainty unwind in the weeks to come-- which is a possibility, I think, as Steve pointed out--that could mean that people who ordinarily would be in the longer market would commit themselves and we could get a decline in long rates And I wouldn't resist that I think it would be a natural market process that ought to be accommodated  I didn't speak on the topic of the funds rate If we were in a normal situation, I think the top ought to go up too But I think it would be taken as a bad signal And, in fact, [the range] doesn't restrain us If the aggregates run strong, all it does is suggest that we have a telephone conference call So, I don't think it's worth the risk to raise the funds rate range at this time  That's probably the practical thing  If you wanted to sharpen it just a little, you could say the sensitivity of financial market conditions  And somehow or other they have broken it into three sentences  Yes, I see your point Those are caveats having to do with a further tightening or an easing  I think that's correct  We could also do something with that last sentence, Paul ""The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if unusual strains develop or--""  Sometimes we've even said ""international and domestic credit market conditions"" I think it can last for a while If we put it in as we've been talking about, it's a soft reference and so it can remain  If we had several Continentals, the operational reference here to maintaining existing pressures on bank reserves would be modified  All that's in there now?  That sounds right to me It goes in the financial paragraph?  Aggregates  Well, I think it supports what would be your position, Tony  I think it's implied We have a list of things we're going to look at before we let the aggregates move us It already says that To add the word ""only"" doesn't add much; on the other hand, it may not be necessary  -43-    5/21-22/84  It doesn't quite say that It says we would consider all these other things before we responded  But I think one can read it to include that alertness  That's what I say It's not inconsistent with--  It would be considered in the context--  I have a marginal preference for leaving it out  Or ""such a change, of course, would be considered only in the context of""?  -45-    5/21-22/84 "
2573,1984-07-16," I think he has a point  A difference in objectives  If the dollar is held steady?  Well, I was going to ask how come 15 percent? Last time you told us that it needed to drop 45 percent  With no drop in the dollar?  If mortgage rates rise  He said it was a difficult question  I've been reflecting on Jerry's comment about financial fragility, which contrasts so sharply with the strong economy And I suppose that the link is what Henry is talking about the next recession There are probably many roads to recession But one that seems quite certain to me is to get into an environment in which interest rates have to increase substantially, because I think a substantial increase in interest rates, in fact, would turn the financial system on its ear--certainly the thrifts, probably the LDCs, and very possibly some of these people who have signed up for variable rate mortgages and that kind of thing And, of course, the thing that bothers me is that if you look at past recoveries, we've always gotten into a period in which interest rates went up substantially toward the end of the recovery So, I suppose the best and safest insurance that we could buy would be to try to insure that the economy does not grow so rapidly as to bring the inflationary consequences that will lead to substantially higher interest rates and bring the next recession Now, the reason I haven't commented along those lines is that the staff forecast, I think, does that That is, the staff forecast gives us a [slowing of] real growth in time to keep off some of these touch points that Lyle was talking about It gives us a 3 percent rate of real GNP growth, roughly, in the four quarters of 1985 I have to admit that I forecast the same thing, but I'm darned if I know why I did because, taking it right up to where we are today, everything is stronger--and quite a lot stronger--than that Maybe it's just a hope that the real growth will recede to a point where we can live with it over an extended period rather than a true forecast that all of us are expressing here As I said, there is nothing in the consumption figures or certainly in business and plant and equipment spending or even in housing so far that would give one the strong assurance that the 3 percent rate of growth would be established by the latter part of this year And I think we need to try to guard against the possibility that for the quarters ahead, as in the quarters past, we will find real results to be substantially greater than what had been forecast beforehand That is very important because, otherwise, I do think the financial system is going to tumble  -17-    7/16-17/84  You can make money on that!  Prices of some sensitive industrial commodities --for example, the price of gold--have been moving down They are probably the source of much of this, but it's hard for me to see how that could become general  Certainly, M3 ought to be on probation  [Unintelligible] false signal  A target is the desired number  -22-    7/16-17/84  Roger, wouldn't we have to raise M3 too?  Because that's how they finance the credit numbers  I agree with Jerry on this  Well, if I understand it, we're over them even without the leveraged buyouts, but not so much And it seems to me that we might just say we are running over and to a considerable extent it is due to the leveraged buyouts and the mergers and so forth We expect this damn fool nonsense to stop and, therefore, we haven't raised the ranges  -24-    7/16-17/84  That's not how I understand it  -25-    7/16-17/84 -26-  [Unintelligible]  -29-    7/16-17/84  Not enough to affect my numbers  That's consistent with--  Well, the question is whether we want to have 11 percent  It seems to me that we ought to be thinking of nominal GNP of 8 percent as about right next year And we ought to have money numbers more consistent with GNP around 8 percent  Yes Let's say 3 percent real and 5 percent on prices or 3-1/2 percent real and 4-1/2 percent prices  I hope we are right That's an indicator of possible difficulty if the forecast is higher than that because it means higher rates and all that  Or let [interest] rates go up because we don't want that much GNP  I think I would agree with that But I also agree with the other thing you said I don't know if it's possible to preserve any freedom, but if we can preserve any freedom, we ought to try to do it for early next year  Instead of saying alternative II at this point  It's been all right for a couple of quarters  Mine too  He means in terms of cutting [inflation]  Well, I don't think we ought to reduce the lower end of any of the ranges Regardless of whether or not they have been an issue, they would become an issue if there should be a flagging in the economy and [monetary growth] should drop down toward them And it seems to me that at this stage of the recovery there's no reason we should want to have very low rates of increase in any of the aggregates So, that leads me to alternative II Leaving M3 and debt as they are this year is certainly reasonable and appropriate when one considers that growth is going to be over on both of them this year So, I think that's right I would cut the top on M2 to 8-1/2 percent as alternative II does I'm sympathetic with Lyle's point We don't really know what has been going on there, but my view is that we ought to show some progress and if, in fact, something has been odd about it, we'll just have to run over a bit On M1, I'm sympathetic to the idea of narrowing the range and I would make it 4 to 7 percent-- choosing from alternative III in that case--accepting not the midpoint as our target but someplace within the range, and very possibly toward the upper end of that 4 to 7 percent range  We would do that, I think, in a situation of considerable upward pressure on interest rates and then say, ""Well, we just can't hold the money""  It might be pretty hard to make that second half-point reduction  Well, there would be a new Administration setting out on a new term and all that I can see that there might be some political problems  I know it would be over And whichever party wins, there would be the new plans for the next four years  Well, it just seems to me, Roger, that we wouldn't want 5-1/2 percent growth in M2  No, I can live with four percent, but I couldn't live with a lower M1  That's possible, Frank, but I think we would have to say that at the time We're not even going to know that on the first of February or whenever it is we have to set the ranges; that [Super NOW change] takes effect, I believe, January 1 It might be that the way [the banks] would market this is to say that people could give up the MMDA and put all the funds in a Super NOW and the bank will pay the [MMDA] interest rate But we've got to see that happen before [we change the range] That's an institutional change and, therefore, we would say that there has been an institutional change  I have a slight preference for the 6 to 8-1/2  Only Karen wanted a lower range  No, I don't  It is true, isn't it, that we've had a couple of bad bank reports? certainly couldn't have been much worse than it was and looks like a continuing problem, and it doesn't seem to have shaken the market any more  I would accept alternative B also I'm considerably affected by the moderate numbers projected in alternative B and would remind you that they are projections If, in fact, the economy doesn't begin to slow as everybody is hoping, the numbers may well be higher than that And if they're higher than that, then I think we'll have to take some action I'm as concerned about the financial situation as anybody but, as I said yesterday, I feel that the real problem would come from having an excessive expansion that leads to inflation that [in turn] leads to significantly higher interest rates, which would not just take [down] the Financial Corporation of America but about 100 other savings and loans with it I guess I wouldn't do anything to try to save Financial Corporation or Bowery or somebody like that if what I were doing was risking losing a great many more further on  So, I would pay a lot of attention to the performance of the aggregates in this period I don't like to fine- tune the funds rate I'm shocked that Henry is fine-tuning it to 1/2 of a point, because I always thought he believed that we ought to run on more basic things than just the funds rate But I guess maybe it's because he doesn't want it to go down and that's why he would fine- tune it But I would say that if it flexed down, I wouldn't have any problem with that In that sense, I guess I join Pres I don't want to bias the result I'd take $1 billion [on borrowing] and the specs of alternative B, and if the funds rate happens to move down 1/4 or even 1/2 point to where it was just a few weeks ago, I wouldn't have any great problem with that  I couldn't support asymmetrical No, I think that's the wrong thing to do And I think it was very widely misinterpreted in December when it finally came out  Well, I don't think we can see the future clearly enough to bias this I think we could get both some very good news on inflation and a marked slowing in the economy I don't think we ought to seem to want to raise rates at every opportunity and notch them upward over time And that's what that suggests to me  I wouldn't--not with an M1 projection of 5-1/2 percent I would not be tightening unless M1 comes in above 5-1/2 percent  And if it comes in below, I think the funds rate ought to flex down  Well, I don't really think so either, but I think it could  Quite strongly, I think  No great easing this time for the period It seems pretty unlikely  What sentence are you talking about?  Tie  Now how about a ""try to live with""?  He's not talking about publicly saying it Are you?  Who can live with it?  Everybody could live with it!    7/16-17/84 "
2599,1984-08-21," It's very straightforward  Peter, I too am sort of mystified by this up- creep in the funds rate relative to borrowings It's really quite obvious and seems to be rather enduring You mentioned Continental's borrowing in a negative way--as not being a factor--but I'm inclined to wonder whether in fact it isn't a factor I seem to recall that we observed the same kind of phenomenon when Franklin borrowed sizable amounts in the summer of 1974, and I'm wondering whether there isn't something about the channels of distribution that could have some marginal impact on the rate relationship  You seem to have the same view that I do I feel that there might be something there too but, of course, one can't prove it and the arithmetic doesn't support it But, still, there are quite different channels The reason I mention it is that it doesn't look as if Continental is going to be out of the [discount] window anytime soon; in fact, they may borrow substantially more over the weeks and months to come So, if there is a tendency for that [to occur], it could be exacerbated And if we had to [unintelligible], I don't know what to do about it But I wonder whether it isn't a factor  Well, of course, one thing that happens when we count it as nonborrowed is that what used to be Continental's borrowing from time to time automatically gets excluded Now, that can't be quantitatively very big That would be one factor  I think the answer is that Paul has [noted] something that is going to hit before the limit on open market operations hits  Yes That hits early Hardly anybody knows about it, but we have to collateralize those notes and it's a criminal offense to issue them without proper collateral So, it would come up with another ten billion in borrowing  Well, that's what we would have to do--just withdraw currency from circulation  I'm sure it can be done That's a paragraph 3 loan  No  That's hard to explain, though Can you imagine saying that on account of the financial crisis, we're raising reserve requirements?  He's in a better position than we are  And this will be in reserve absorbing--  Yes  How do they get it?  Do you think they would tend to hold their dollar prices and eat the change in the exchange rate profit?  For a while This is part of the lag that Ted is talking about  Unexplainable!  And, of course, real interest rates are much higher  -12-    8/21/84 -13-  I really don't understand how you can say that, Ed We're 2-1/2 years into the recovery At 2-1/2 years into the middle 1970s recovery, we didn't have much inflation Bob was giving those figures  It took quite a while for that inflation to heat up in the middle 1970s  Well,--  Yes The oil increase was about early 1979, wasn't it?  I'm talking about the second oil shock  Yes  I'm talking about the second half of the '70s It took some while for the inflation to really accelerate Then once it accelerated, it accelerated fast  Of course, we do have the New York Savings Banks yet to deal with Following FCA, we will have to go East and there will be something in New York City with two or three of them  That, by the way, could have an effect on the asset side too They have an awful lot of commitments to buy mortgages and if they don't deliver on those commitments, there is going to be quite a scramble among builders to find alternative funds I don't know if it will have an effect or not all over the country  I don't think it's quite full  A strike followed by higher wages  We have a tradition of not changing much, too    8/21/84  It makes it hard to communicate  I looked at that yesterday afternoon It makes some difference, but not a great deal What happened really is that there was less GNP rise last year relative to credit growth than you would have expected and this year it's more normal  -23-    8/21/84  I had a thought, in the nature of a question for Steve If one did feel that there had been some change in the demand for free reserves--as you say in the technical jargon--that was going to persist for a while, the way to deal with that technically would be to change the initial borrowing Is that the way that one would deal with it?  Well, I was asking this as a technical matter If you thought that there had been a shift in the demand, the way to address it would be to change the borrowing level  But if you thought it was going to endure for a while-- And we do have now the possibility that FCA and Continental are not done borrowing They are going to be with us for some months to come--maybe years--with, I think, a steadily larger number So, it could be that it will persist  Is all of that special credit washed out now?  Yes And then did they pay back the other Latin American countries?  Well, the rate had drifted up by 1/2 or 3/4 of a point or something like that  There's nothing in the aggregates that would have warranted that, and the economy has been moving broadly in the direction we expected it to--although maybe not as far--and the price numbers are even better So, I don't see any reason why the rate should have drifted up  Well, all right I would like to retain the specifications we had last time and view them somewhat broadly We don't have to be slavish about it That's none of these alternatives, is that right?  Yes, I think that's right  I would reduce the borrowing number by $200 million to [a level of] $800 million [unintelligible] Although I don't like to talk too much about the funds rate, I would expect [it to decline] but I would want to manage its decline That is, I would want it to drift down only [gradually], the way that it drifted up, rather than suddenly adjust it down by 3/4 of a point the day after tomorrow  [Henry is] trying to bring it about by his  -28-    8/21/84  Since I'm guilty of throwing in the $800 million dollar figure on borrowing, let me just say that I must have picked  -32-    8/21/84  that off the wall I don't know whether that's the figure or not The point that I wanted to make is that if there has been a shift in the demand for excess reserves, I think we ought to recognize that and make some adjustment And in my view if that results in a downward drift in the funds rate, we were certainly all content to see it drift up, so why shouldn't we be prepared to see it drift down? After all, the aggregates are on the weak side and there's nothing inconsistent in that But I don't know whether $800 million is the right figure for what I'm talking about  Well, that's a very horseback kind of thing I would rather have somebody who is technically proficient with the numbers indicate what they think  I think it was that you would make it asymmetrical in the other direction If you put [M1] at four percent, then you wouldn't tighten if it came in higher but you would ease if it came in lower  We can't use ""around"" because it's already there  Well, that's always the case Of course, [earlier] everybody accepted a minus 2 percent for July, which was really a very unusually low number I presume we would accept a 10 or 12 percent for September, which is very well what it might be if the economy is reasonably strong I think we would want to put them all together and say the average was not bad    8/21/84  You're talking about the difference between accepting and seeking  I think that is an important difference I guess my feeling is that the market determines what the money number is going to be in the short run a lot more than we do And, as you know, it's a highly volatile number  Yes, I do too  Well, then it gets into ambiguities, Bob Slow significantly further than minus 2? I think it is stated in terms of the quarterly numbers And the ""slow significantly"" means relative to whatever number is in there  Yes  I'm attracted to try it with the 5, 7, and 9 percent; maybe it has been more on our minds than anybody else's that we [typically] don't change these rates  We had 7-1/2 percent for M2  It's hard to [quantify]  I'm unclear as to what would happen to the funds rate I could certainly see a widening spread--CD rates going up and bill rates going down--as an indication of a flight to quality I'm unclear about what would happen to the funds rate  -38-    8/21/84  I guess that could happen, if they really became sensitive Otherwise, it's a very liquid instrument to put your money into  Yes  It's a directive to the Manager  I don't think there's any evidence that we're providing reserves more generously  And the reserve numbers are on the weak side rather than strong So, it's something that we're doing here that is not ginning up the numbers but ginning them down In other words, if there's something we're doing-- "
2624,1984-10-02," We haven't done much with this for a long time,    10/2/84  I must say, and I am sure everybody's mind is very fuzzy on it--at least mine is Why is it, Sam, that we take the interest in marks rather than converting it to dollars?  But it would be a very regularized small thing that would permit us to get [the interest earnings] back into our own currency  Well, that is true It's not even as much as the Continental loan Nevertheless, a lot of people might consider $4 billion in marks to be quite a holding, particularly when you recall that we got most of it at under 2  I don't know what the periodic receipts are, but they certainly can't exceed $100 million I guess I would have argued that it would not have had any appreciable effect on the dollar had we done this periodically when we get them as a convention And I don't know why it is--  I don't know why it shouldn't be I consider the home currency to be the dollar rather than the mark!  Well, I don't remember the basis for doing it this way  Well, I really don't know why we have [an informal limit] I would move to do away with it altogether After all, at the rate at which interest is accumulating we will double our money every six or seven years anyhow  We intervened in a rising market? Is that right?  We don't attempt to create disorderly conditions the way the Germans did  I wouldn't want to be a party to it I would like to have the opportunity to register myself against such an operation  It is sensitive to interest rates? Is that right?  I mean the seasonal  We could very well be having that statement-date effect, couldn't we, Paul? As I recall, looking back, we've had that rather regularly now over the last couple of years  I think there is less anxiety about the banking system I think what Pres was talking about is more anxiety by the bankers about their own situations  What do you say?  I should remark that the revisions are an insider's leading indicator If revisions are downward, that indicates weakness    10/2/84  It's what?  Well, that's one thing about retailers You can always find a retailer to support your position!  I want to agree strongly with Ed Boehne In fact, I would underline his comments by saying ""Thank goodness we have had a slowdown,"" because throughout 1983 the expansion was more rapid than we expected We certainly didn't have in mind anything like that 10 percent increase for the first quarter; that was several percentage points above what we expected The second quarter was also considerably stronger than originally forecast and than what we thought appropriate Finally we have gotten a quarter on the low side It's the first quarter I can remember in the recovery that's on the low side of the projection and it's about time that we start to see some balance Somebody earlier was talking about putting some risks back into the situation Well, I think that's necessary for the business situation as well as the foreign exchange value of the dollar --that there be a two-sided view as to what may be occurring I'm inclined to think that this is temporary Despite Emmett's comments that consumer spending is variable in the short run, I would say that there tends to be an equating of spending with income streams, and income streams are still good So, the chances are very, very strong that there will be a recovery in consumer spending in the fourth quarter Whether it will be as strong as the staff has projected, I don't know, but I would say the chances are good that there will be a larger increase in GNP in the fourth quarter than in the third  I'm a little more concerned about 1985 I noticed particularly the tremendous rate of increase in imports, and I think that is beginning to sap the economy If that continues in 1985-- which, incidentally, the projection doesn't forecast--we could get a considerably weaker year than has been forecast from the standpoint of domestic activity But that's some time in the future and a lot will depend on the value of the dollar And who knows what that may be? Just to take a figure, it may be 40 percent lower by the first of the year Who can say where the dollar will be? I do think that our greatest threat, looking ahead over the next couple of years, is the possibility that we may find ourselves in a position where interest rates have to be substantially higher than they are now And that's  -17-    10/2/84  because of the thrifts, Martha, and the farmers, Jerry, and the small businessmen who have been referred to, and the LDCs, and the condition of financial institutions generally A repetition of the 18 percent rate level that we saw before would be very, very destructive on the economy As I see it, that need may still develop in the course of this cycle as we get farther out, and it's very important to try to keep the pressure off so that won't occur That's the big thing we have to watch out for, and that's why I say ""Thank goodness for the slowdown!""  At this time? Did you have that run?  One in 20?  That is, growth from June to September would be 2 percent instead of 2-1/2 percent?  I see  Well, assuming that the aggregates come in that way  -24-    10/2/84  I like the specifications of alternative B I would neither want to raise the M1 number above 6 percent, which I think is a good center number to have in mind, nor to reduce it, especially following on the shortfalls that we already have had, which I think would signal a more restrictive stance I like the specifications and I would leave the funds rate at 8 to 12 percent It comes as somewhat of a shock to me that anybody would consider the 8 percent a relevant number I see the point about not going to 8 percent in the short run, but I think the public relations effect of raising it from 8 percent to 10 percent would be too difficult for us to deal with, so I wouldn't do that Now, I must say that I don't think there has been anything very aggressive about monetary policy in  -26-    10/2/84  the last 6 weeks when you remember that we are significantly-- significantly by several points--short of the targets we set just 6 weeks ago for the third quarter We are three points short in the case of M1, 2-1/2 points or more short in the case of M2, and 2 points short in the case of M3 I'm surprised that policy didn't flex more toward an easier money market stance than it did over this period So, far from wondering why there wasn't a conference call to see whether we should go that far, I'm wondering why there wasn't a conference call to see if we should have gone further in this period than we did As I said, there's nothing wrong with these targets, but the trouble is that our most recent record is that we don't meet the targets It may be that we will meet them readily or it may be that we won't meet them readily in the quarter to come, since we have just received this news about M1 perhaps falling even further short  Well, I know That's why you're proposing Wednesday meetings, which is a very good reason for Wednesday meetings But I am remembering that it looks as if we are going to have a shortfall [in M1] and it might carry through into M2 also; I don't know I've been a little unhappy about an initial borrowing level as high as $750 million and it strengthens my view that we ought to cut it to $650 million to start with I see nothing wrong with a 10 percent funds rate, although I guess I would have to agree that if it goes significantly below 10 percent for a period of time, that signals something new and I would want to talk about it before it got below 10 percent But if reducing the initial borrowing number to $650 million happened to give us [a funds rate] moving down toward 10 percent, I wouldn't be at all concerned about it Maybe that's the problem we're going to have, Mr Chairman that we all will choose alternative B but we all will have different ideas as to where [that may lead]  Would you change ""would"" to ""might"" to have an asymmetrical directive?  And they were talking about 10 percent [on the funds rate] by the end of this year, weren't they?  Prices  That's traditional  Is this the first week of a two-week period?  [Unintelligible] uncertainty  I don't think we are talking about very much, Lyle  But the 11-1/2 percent was an aberration to a considerable degree  But we have these guides in the directive for the money supply growth, if it is strong  Or they might be telling us something  I agree with you, Tony, but I do think that as the evidence accumulates we have to begin to recognize it We had the weak July and then the staff said that August would snap back Then August was low and they said that September would be good Now September seems to be revising down, and in this case they don't seem to have much hope that October is going to be strong Maybe, to complete the whole circle, October will be very strong Right now it doesn't seem to look it So, we're starting to develop [a pattern of] some months  Well, the $8 billion increase that's--  So that becomes four months of low growth Four months is not as long as a year, but it's approaching six months and  -37-    10/2/84  one starts to take it into account a little At least that's the way I look at it  There were shortfalls in all of them  Well, as I suggested, we could just change the ""might"" and ""would""  Or we could change the order of the two parts of the sentence  It said ""only""  Yes, or leave the next sentence and drop the last phrase  My point, Paul, was that we could drop that whole phrase starting with ""particularly"" and instead make it a phrase such as ""evaluated in relation not only to indicators of the strength of"" and just continue right on Now, that makes it a one-sided directive, but I think it would solve Tony's problem that we would only look at easing in the context of weak money numbers and the confirming business and inflationary and credit situations  Well, if we want to tilt it, we could say ""well above"" instead of ""high growth""  Yes  If you really want to change the structure, I would go back to my proposal that we use your first sentence and then say ""evaluated in relation not only"" and so forth Then we could have  -43-    10/2/84  another sentence that says ""Conversely, if the monetary aggregates are strong and there is associated strength showing in the economy""--  Well, it is It really does change it somewhat, I think, but not a great deal  No, I'm combining them and dropping that  ""Might,"" I think  ""Monetary growth well above the numbers expected"" Is that what we call it?  That would be all right  ""New strength"" or something like that  ""Indications of stronger expansion in economic and financial developments""  -44-    10/2/84  Or ""stronger economic and credit market""--  It's hard to imagine we'll have evidence of all this in five weeks  That's right The current range is up to 12 percent That's just as well, isn't it, Steve? "
2648,1984-11-07," Well, a lot of that increase in employment in October was in nonmanufacturing  To get them off the docks? Well, that could be  He does recognize that he had a very soft October?  Well, it's still above the runway  Jim, the last time you talked some about the probabilities May I ask whether you have anything new to say about that? That is, have you increased the probability of something around zero compared with six weeks ago or whenever we met last?    11/7/84  That means double trailers  Nor by the comments around here  I think somebody else wrote the Beigebook!  One thing that worries a person who looks at the business statistics all the time is a situation that can't very well be explained on the basis of past experience And I can't very well explain why business is as weak as it has been in the last few months That makes for considerable discomfort in a professional economist I am very nervous at the present time I felt confident that there would be a resurgence in the economy this fall because, like Lyle, I thought that we had just a temporary spell of reduced consumption I thought the economy would come along in the fall because incomes and expectations and confidence and the real financial value of assets were all there to support strong consumer spending I guess I still feel that I am closer in view to the guy from than I am to the guy from in thinking that we're going to have a good Christmas Nevertheless, there is no real indication of such a resurgence in attitudes of manufacturers and business people generally The one thing that I have never dealt with is the problem of a steadily rising proportion of total markets being taken up with imports Because we haven't had that in the 35 years that I have been an economist, it does occur to me that it's possible that retail sales can look good and strong and that plant and equipment spending can look good and strong and it won't do anything for the domestic economy if an important increment of that demand is going into imported goods Therefore, it is quite possible that we could have strength in the indicators of the kind that Bob Forrestal talked about--retail sales and so forth--but weakness in the underlying performance of the economy I think that's a big change from the past, and it seems to be a trend that is still persisting  -14-    11/7/84  The other thing that may have occurred--and it's very, very hard to know--is that, in fact, inflation expectations may have subsided over the last six months We are getting some indications of that from these horseback surveys that people do on inflation But I don't think they are much good; they really just reflect what has happened most recently But it may be that we've had a period of low increases in wages and low increases in profit margins for a long enough time that people are now beginning to believe that by golly inflation isn't going to go back to 7 or 8 or 9 percent! You may remember in the spring that it wasn't hard to find outliers like Milton Friedman who thought that inflation would be at double digits by the end of this year That has disappeared entirely That also is something that could affect attitudes and the speed with which plans are put in place in order to beat price increases, because now people don't expect the price to increase whereas before they did  I would point out that the staff forecast is nothing to write home about in terms of great strength The forecast is for a little over 3 percent real growth over the next five quarters That's not a high number I would also point out to you that there is an important presumption in that forecast and that is that real imports go no higher than they are now--that the whole import thrust is behind us In the Greenbook, if you look at constant dollar net imports on a GNP basis, there has been a deterioration of $35 billion over the past four quarters Over the next four quarters there will be none whatsoever, if that forecast is accurate And that goes into the GNP forecast If you don't believe that the import surge has ended, then you can't really believe a forecast as strong as the one the staff has shown I don't know what you think, but I think that imports are still rising pretty darn rapidly and that the growth in imports will not be over until we can change the terms of trade in which the United States deals So, the forecast of a little over 3 percent assumes that net imports stopped growing as of the third quarter, which is already behind us That's not such a very strong forecast  Henry speaks about inflation He says a base rate of 5 percent; I would say 4 percent It is [not] zero But unemployment isn't zero either As a matter of fact, we have 7-1/2 percent unemployment; it has been hanging at that number, Henry, and I would argue that a 7-1/2 percent unemployment rate gives us room for further growth in the economy in the sense of looking at the performance compared with some kind of norm--what we would like to see ideally The unemployment rate is about as distressingly above where it ought to be as the inflation rate is above what it ought to be As I see it, it's a situation in which one can say inflation has done better than one would expect based on recent track performance Unemployment is worse than it ought to be at this stage of a cyclical recovery Therefore, although I'm not sure what is going to happen in the immediate future, I think that the economy is not going to go into a great resurgence in terms of output and employment and I think there is room for some more growth than seems in prospect in the numbers that we have  Well, am I looking at this table correctly?  A year ago you had a plus $12 billion; in the third quarter of this year it's a minus $226 billion That's a change of $34-35 billion  And now, with this little $2 billion difference, you have essentially stability from now on out?  The only one they have in constant dollars is goods and services I am looking at page 1-21  And that is in the GNP forecast Am I right, Jim?  Well, we could easily afford more  It keeps them from going up I see the point  What if November-December were less than 7 percent? If, say, November and December were at 4 percent rather than 7 percent, would that have changed the seasonal distribution and in which direction?  Textiles too  Then it has been coming down?  We did this past time; it was within 5  You have a 7 percent projection for November?  It's not going to happen  If we can distinguish  And the GNP revision is likely to be downward So the first possible good-size plus number we could get would be on durable goods That's hanging an awful lot on durable goods orders  We need to have several seasonals and we can use the one that fits best!  Well, no one can take first place away from me in recognizing the volatility of the M1 numbers And I agree, Jerry, that the best thing to expect when we get a decline is a rise in the next month But we have been sitting here looking at surprisingly weak numbers for quite a while and I think there is a cumulative effect that most people do feel has a significance I think enough of M1 as an indicator that I am inclined to be considerably impressed by that or I presume that I am going to be impressed by it unless someone gives me very good evidence as to why I shouldn't be As I review it, M1 has been surprisingly weak over a period of time and probably erratically weak in October I just don't see how we could have such an economy that would produce a 7-1/2 percent decline in money as an indication of the future But when you put it all together, it does amount to quite a bit Because of that and the great damage that that's going to do us, as well as what I said earlier about the economy falling short and having room for further growth, I would not be opposed to alternative A as the way to go I think it's time for a fairly pronounced further adjustment And it won't hurt us; I agree with Paul that if it turns out to be wrong, we can tighten up a little later on  -33-    11/7/84  But right now it seems to me that the risks are such that we ought to be guided to a degree by this weakness in the M1 numbers One advantage of a Wednesday meeting--maybe it isn't an advantage--is that at least we get the most recent figures that way And I would point out that Steve has indicated that with these most recent figures it seems very improbable that we could get the M1 specs of alternative A So, we ought to use something like the specs of alternative B since we already have fallen well short of what was put in the Bluebook for us last Friday I also think that means we have to go to a different kind of description of our policy than just a repetition of the past one--focusing on what we would hope to see and would be prepared to tolerate in November-December following the surprising October weakness I guess the Roman numeral II [draft] directive is a reasonable thing to be talking about I would reduce the federal funds rate range from 8 to 12 percent to 7 to 11 percent, as Tony suggested; and I would regard the midpoint of that range, 9 percent, as entirely acceptable for the funds rate [On borrowing], $400 million seems a rather marked change in operational targeting I would put it at $500 million but I would not be prepared to accept a figure as high as $600 million, as I think Tony suggested It is time for a little ""oomph"" to get into monetary policy One final point If in fact it is true that it is becoming the very general view out there that the inflation rate is going to be much calmer than was previously expected, that, of course means that nominal rates have to drop at least as much as the expected inflation rate--maybe a little more--in order to offset the deflating effect of that change in expectations So, I don't know that we have gone too far at all in terms of the indicative real rates that would be associated with the declines we have had in nominal rates  You can get whipsawed There's no question about that  I would assume that we are dealing with a time when seasonal borrowing would drop  I interrupted Lyle I really was just thinking that we are at the time of the year when we ought to get a drop in the seasonal That is all  That's as far as you would go?  May I just ask Roger a question?  Roger, I've never looked all that closely at these seasonal borrowing arrangements Do they have a terminal date?  And you said it started in April?  That was why I asked that question I just wondered whether there would come a point where you would want to clean up and call them off and say the year is over  Then it will be adjustment credit at that point  We are going to have to put in a lower Ml  My objection to leaving it the way it is is this It seems to me that either we make a mockery of having had targets or we have to ease an awfully lot more to get growth up to 6 percent How can you reduce it from 6 percent to 2-1/2 percent just because you have had a bad month? Paul's way of dealing with that at least makes it understandable, I think  It will be pretty small  Yes, it's 2-1/2 or 3-1/2 percent, depending on--  So we can't really put in more than 3 percent  Yes, that's right; you need 8-1/4 percent for November-December to get 3 percent for the three months  Except we're changing the specifications, though So, ""continue to be consistent""--  The whole thing starts out with ""decrease somewhat"" I wonder whether we want the ""somewhat""  I thought we had a staff projection that $400 million would be consistent with 9 percent  They probably won't cut it much below the discount rate  It would be pretty eccentric to have the funds rate much below the discount rate  Maybe we just ought to provide some reserves and forget about this borrowing number  We don't know what will happen then  Yes    11/7/84  That second reserve period, if I am reading it correctly from the calendar, starts with Thanksgiving Is that a problem?  That second period may be eccentric because of the holiday  Yes, particularly--  I could accept $550 million as a first step  Well, it would depend on whether we had to go further We would have to go down toward $400  If everything is still weak, probably  Maybe both  We also ought to take a look at this seasonal question I don't know whether we'll get all that much detail but I have a feeling that we may get the decline mainly from the seasonal dropping off I'd forgotten about it until it came up today that this seasonal borrowing must be running toward the end of its period and that, therefore, there will be a drop in seasonal borrowing  Oh, I don't think they can; it's not really done that way They have to have a time when they're out of debt, I believe  How about $500 to $550 million?  I would like to think that we're doing this within the context of alternative A, but we're--  I just say that to give a sense of--  I have no problem with 3  It gives you one more chance to adjust the portfolio if you're an FCA or something like that  And then ""More generally""  I think the second step is to go down to $400 million  I'll retract it "
2674,1984-12-17," So you want a $6 billion [leeway], Peter?  So moved  Well, of course, whatever the money growth was, it was associated with a GNP result And we would have to be saying also that we found the GNP result to be inadequate, I think, to rebase The other comment I had is that this is putting a lot of emphasis on the midpoint My recollection is that we have not emphasized the midpoint of the ranges We have said that it's a range because we don't know where in the range would be the appropriate number Of all years, this one we came closer to being within our    12/17-18/84  ranges for everything than any other year I can recall So, this burning issue is not really much of an issue this year, is it?  What are those parallel lines? I wasn't clear as to what they were They're upward sloping  Oh, I see You get the end point and then draw them back  Yes, you might have to do--  Yes, we discussed that at a meeting and decided to let it roll  The pattern within the year?  Well, I think the word ""automatic"" ought to be banned from this discussion because I don't think there's anything automatic really being proposed What we're talking about is some procedural rules that would be followed unless there is some reason for not following them, as is always the case with the Federal Open Market Committee Before, we had a rule that we would provide the nonborrowed reserves consistent with the money growth we wanted to get and then borrowings automatically fell out Now we set the level of borrowing and the reserves automatically fall out--the reserves associated with whatever the demand for money does and what occurs What Steve is proposing is simply that one other way of dealing with this as a rule for operating procedure would be to go between these two extremes and split the difference I think that makes a lot of sense And the reason that I think it makes a lot of sense is that I've never known the time when in the first instance anyone could be certain enough that they ought to do something and, in fact, did it We always have an ambiguous situation It's always ambiguous You could say in looking back as well as forward that maybe we ought to let M1 growth fall off [its path] because, after all, the economy has been strong and there are a lot of inflationary expectations out there And it could turn out to be wrong The economy isn't strong and there isn't the inflation expectation But by the time you've learned that, a couple of months have gone by It seems to me that some adjustment in the borrowing level to take account of the fact that M1 is falling off path is a reasonable thing to do Now, as you all know, I've practically given up on having any view that anyone can look forward with a degree of certainty and, therefore, I'm always looking for the safer course It would have been safer this summer, certainly, had we done it that way--and it might well be safer in the other direction looking forward in the next year--because we would have had quicker adjustments The funds rate would have dropped faster had we followed the rule and it may go up faster if we follow the different procedural rule in the year ahead And I think it's a better way to go But, again, it's nothing but a procedure And if the Chairman or Steve or Peter or anybody else feels that there is something odd that has accounted for this, there is no reason we can't get together and say ""Well, there's an oddity here; I think we ought not follow this rule""  In the first instance  I do think that one's attitude toward this is strongly shaped by how much one believes in M1 In fact, I've kept a tally so far and that exactly identifies the positions  No, I don't think it's that much  $35 million  Of the aggregates?  No, no [Unintelligible] among the aggregates  The economy, inflation--?  Certainly in the past we've found that we had to adjust by more than the change in required reserves in order to get the desired change in the aggregates  This is just a portion of the change in required reserves  Because September was the way it was?  They survived  Go right down the middle  I wonder if Jim has any comments about the risks  7 percent in the--  Well, there are a lot of things out there in '85 that are going to happen that we don't have any notion of today It's looking pretty far ahead and I think all we can do is go on the basis of central tendencies and realize that there will be many surprises to which we'll have to react as the year goes on I would say that as we go through the third year of expansion, I would have a presumption that the risks are on the side of falling short rather than going over the rate of growth As the expansion gets older it gets a little more dubious, a little more treacherous to continue to project that we will follow along those lines In particular, there are two things that bother me about the outlook The first--and I somewhat tentatively submit it to you--is that there has been a considerable income redistribution in the country both because of the tax changes and because of interest rates As a result, I'm not sure that we can count on the personal saving rate dropping as it does in the projection The staff didn't know why it went up, so they are putting it back down again But if I look around for a reason why it might not go down, it would be that this is becoming a society that is very divided in terms of income results and wealth effects and that kind of thing, and I would expect a higher saving rate because of the fact that a lot of people are prosperous Now, that doesn't necessarily mean more consumer credit because I would submit that the people who borrow are usually not the ones who have the wealth They are the ones who need to do the spending And that makes me somewhat sympathetic to Preston's point that maybe housing won't do so well and maybe automobiles won't do so well as the year goes on  The second and even more disturbing thing to me is the effect of net imports on the economy that we've seen this past year It really has sapped the strength of the economic expansion as this year has progressed The projection says net imports aren't going to go up much more and it could be right, but I really can't see that the situation has changed It seems to me that the rising tide of imports is just not in the process [of stopping] unless something happens to stop it; it's going to grow and grow more and that's going to sap the strength of the economy as the year goes on So my inclination, without having a specific forecast, would be to say that the chances are, if anything, that we'll end up on the low side rather than on the high side of an inadequate forecast The growth rate specified for the year is inadequate It's inadequate in terms of capacity utilization, which doesn't do a thing as the year goes on; it stays at  -39-    12/17-18/84  82 or a little below 82, as I recall And it's inadequate in terms of the kinds of stimuli we need in order to get increasing capital spending Profits aren't going to be doing much according to the forecast; markets aren't going to be improving We're almost certain to have a gradual shutting off in the business investment expansion with this kind of forecast So, I think we ought to have in mind 4 percent I would have said 4-1/2 percent real growth from the fourth quarter to the fourth quarter I think this kind of forecast is too poor to come forward with, especially when we recognize that we may fall short  I don't know about interest rates I've given up forecasting interest rates or even saying what they ought to be because there are so many variables in the equations For example, someone commented--I think it was Jerry--that maybe inflationary expectations have changed If they have, these interest rates aren't going to stimulate anything We are going to [need] lower interest rates because [the current rates] just won't bring forth the demand for credit to spend if people have a lower expectation for inflation and, therefore, a lower anticipation of what they will realize in terms of profit payoffs or appreciation payoffs on the investments they have made Therefore, I just don't know where interest rates ought to be I've had that feeling now for some while and it has grown as the years go on That reinforces my view that we really have to look at the monetary aggregates, not interest rates, as what we hope to control I'm trying to remember to answer the Chairman's questions, although he's left the room My view is that M1 ought to have primary importance among the monetary aggregates That has been my view and there is no change in it I must say it was strengthened a little by Steve's analysis yesterday but I have felt that for some time and I continue to feel it I don't know, but I suppose we have selective memories Lyle can remember the times when M1 didn't tell us anything I can remember the times when it did--  --and somehow the latter times strike me as being more important But we always have to be very careful in using M1 because there can be--as there was, I think, in 1982--shifts in the demand for money and we have to be sensitive to that We don't want to ride our money supply target without regard to what is happening in other elements of the economy or in other aggregates or credit or in market conditions But among the aggregates I think it is the most reliable and the one that we ought to put the most confidence in I agree with Pres that we ought to reconsider the long-range targets for 1985 I'm inclined to think that we ought to put M1 growth back to 4 to 8 percent as it was for this year both because we have room for 4 to 4-1/2 percent real growth in the economy and because we've fallen a little short One way to make the adjustment for the base drift would be to say ""All right, we had growth a little lower than we expected this year and we'll take a little higher growth next year if necessary to bring about this 4 to 4-1/2 percent real expansion in the economy I think that makes a lot of sense And I don't think in that context that it would be taken as a backing away from our inflation fighting attitude; I think it would be quite acceptable  I also agree, and I've never said this before in a meeting, that we ought to pay considerable attention to the exchange rate and    12/17-18/84  we ought to do what we can to bring the exchange rate down That also would suggest, other things equal, that when we can we ought to do things in the money sector that are apt to produce somewhat lower interest rates By ""other things equal"" I mean if lowering rates isn't producing some kind of a calamitous result internally I don't know whether it's going to bring the dollar down; certainly, it hasn't so far But I suppose the weight of the evidence over time is that lower interest rates in this country might tend to do that I wouldn't say we should make the exchange rate the target of policy [unintelligible] or something like that, but I'm very disturbed about this import situation I think it's just going to have to be dealt with If the exchange rate does come down--remembering also that a characteristic later on in periods of expansion is that we start to get more inflationary pressures--with lower exchange rates going through the third year of expansion, it seems to me that prices might be on the high side of the staff forecast I guess I'd be prepared to make some price concession for getting the exchange rate down because I think it's that important a problem I think I've answered all the questions, so I'll end at that point  Or less  They're exactly the same for the upper end of both ranges  Would you round alternative B down on Ml?  It will be tough [to achieve], though We now have indications that December [M1 growth] is sub-par I think it would be safer, in terms of reaching it, to make it 6-1/2 percent  And includes December as the first month  And the money market specs of ""A""  Yes  I think it's true that the forecast has consistently been marked down, too, for the near-term quarters I don't know where we had the fourth quarter last June, but it certainly wasn't at 13 percent  Except for growth in reserves  I'm prepared to support your proposal, Paul It's getting so that this period of poor business news is extending too long and I think we now have to probe I don't, as I said, have much confidence in saying what kind of interest rates are appropriate or not I think what we need is monetary expansion and we're not getting it If, in fact, that December 17th number holds up to be a decline, we're going to have a hard time [getting] any decent number at all in the month of December That will make another month in this long string and I think we now ought to be more aggressive in seeking monetary expansion I'm not shocked at the idea of a frictional level of borrowing at all, nor with a further significant drop in short-term interest rates And it may be that the discount rate would have to move I don't want to prejudge that, but it may be that it will have to go [down] So, I think it's a reasonable suggestion  Well, except that I think the money is coming into MMDAs and money market funds from the open market because of the stickiness in those rate levels  It was reported--I've forgotten whether it was here at the Open Market Committee meeting or at the Board briefing-- that Commerce is not giving much weight to that November retail sales figure  I would like to argue for 6-1/2 percent, Pres, because I do think that [7 percent] implies too much for January and February Unless something really happens here, we're going to have 4 or 5 percent [M1 growth] in December, and if we say 7 percent for the 3-month period, that implies something in the very high single digits for January and February and I think that's pressing too hard  It's a 4-month span  Of course, it's a wild number between Christmas and New Year's anyway because of the statement date  Not in that particular sentence  It's in there  Just in the interest of clarity, I would think going for the brass ring, Jerry, would be to say we want an 8 percent increase in reserves in general, regardless That's going for the brass ring  We'll see what happens  As a matter of fact, the staff projection is for a good increase in money and we'll have a good increase in reserves if that occurs But we have had a period of shortfalls that has been going on for quite a while That's why I said ""regardless""  Did anybody else go today?  The increase in outlays went down quite a bit  It's the ""spending plans"" that's really confusing  That's the whole problem  That's the disagreement It's really more fundamental, I think  Maybe we ought to let you fellows handle the discount rate and we'll do the open market policy here!  Say ""reduce somewhat existing pressures"" or we could take out the word ""existing""  That makes it pretty vague  I do like these whole numbers  -74-    12/17-18/84  Well, that's the only one that's falling well short  Yes, that's why it was put that way  ""Particularly if business continues weak and the dollar strong""  I think that's exactly what we ought to have  That's okay  This suggests that the sentence relates to growth over the target numbers in the Ms, particularly M1 I guess it is M1  Down to 7 percent growth in M1--that's the context in which we're discussing this  We had an overshoot in M1  I think it's the word ""evidence"" that louses it up It doesn't carry through to the dollar I think if we didn't have those qualifiers, which are only now a reference to acceptance of a larger M1 growth, then there would be a basis for continuing the two parallel sentences afterwards Maybe something could be done, then, on the foreign exchange value of the dollar there Otherwise, if we have those qualifiers, it makes the next two sentences seem redundant,  I'd hate to put that ahead of the strength of the business expansion and inflationary pressures, Tony I think that really is still our first objective  I think ""particularly"" is better than ""provided"" Provided is absolute  Well, you can use ""particularly"" in the same wording  ""Particularly if the economy remains sluggish and the dollar remains strong""  It could be interpreted, though--  Are you suggesting $300 million rather than $250 million?  Like $275 million  How about the range of $250 to $300 million?  -79-    12/17-18/84  I don't think any of the people who have indicated that position here are going to be persuaded by your giving a few paltry million on reserves  That's going to be particularly hard if it's not too--  Why don't you take a show of hands for preference?  We haven't done a show of hands for a long time  I know you are That's why I think you might need a show of hands as well  That's what I assumed too "
2692,1985-01-18," Paul, was there any view about the pound? Was that looked at separately?  It does not apply?  Well, I suppose it's conceivable that we might want to do intervention in sterling rather than in marks We haven't for a long time  So that's the context in which Sam says that $167 million leeway in sterling seems sufficient  That's the understanding that we and they will share?  Well, I'm no great supporter of intervention as you know, but I do think the situation has become extreme enough that it is called for I think it's a good move "
2715,1985-02-12," But it inevitably runs out of steam, doesn't it? Where was the mark then? What was the mark/dollar rate when they did all that intervention?  And where is it today?  We [unintelligible] the central bank  Is this episode about over, Paul? As I recall, on the [FOMC telephone conference] call you said it was [to last] for a few weeks A few weeks have gone by Has it terminated?  Not at all, recently That's why I asked the question  How likely would it be that we would put ours down 4 points?  Do you mean on the [leeway] recommendation [or on his report]?  Well, I wanted to ask a question of Peter Perhaps everybody else in the room knows this, but I don't Early on you were talking about how you were running compared with the nonborrowed reserve path and you said that at year-end you were $300 million above it  But then later you came closer to the nonborrowed reserve path  Now, does that mean that the path called for a 35% increase? We've had a very large increase in nonborrowed reserves Or does it mean that you adjust that path week by week?  So, unless we know what the adjustments are, we don't really know what [unintelligible] an operation  So, if you have strong monetary growth, you'll raise the path?  Okay Thank you  Well, I understood him to say that it will raise the path  Well, I just thought somebody might misinterpret it when you said you came so close to path One needs to understand that you're constantly revising that for the larger growth [in required reserves], because otherwise one would think you were shooting for a very large rise in nonborrowed reserves  Whatever is called for  On the [leeway] recommendation I have no problem with it  Well, it's very little I have a 4 percent projection and I guess I would say it's a much better projection than I had at midyear for this year There's only so far you can go!  Well, I also would be inclined to think that this rise in unit labor costs will have more effect on GDBP--pushing it up a little--than is shown in this chart I don't think I would have allowed for that kind of compression in the difference between unit labor costs and GDBP and I did have in mind some kind of a decline in the dollar  Tell them that it usually goes up quite a bit more in the third year of an expansion  Wouldn't help things too much around Chicago, Si  Well, I'm inclined to agree with the optimists too I think the short-term outlook is pretty good and the staff forecast is probably on the low end of what might occur in the next year It has been shown pretty clearly now that what we had in the fall was a temporary stoppage in the growth and that growth has now resumed at a pretty good rate I have this view that the outlook is good but the underlying situation is terrible And the question is Do we live in the short run or do we live in the long run when the underlying situation may reveal itself? I suppose the greatest problem that might occur would be a substantial increase in interest rates  Well, maybe that's what I'm affected by I agree with Jerry that a sizable rise in interest rates would be quite difficult for these burdened sectors to take on I don't agree with him that a 100 basis points is a sizable rise After all, rates are down several hundred points over the last several months, but I guess I would agree that a 200 basis point increase would be a very difficult thing From my vantage point right now, I'm beginning to think our greatest problem may be an excessive increase in activity here that in fact will bring a 200 basis point increase in interest rates looking out 6 months from now Therefore, I'm more on the side of those who are now becoming somewhat fearful of too much of a rise in activity rather than on the side of those who think it's going to be too small in the period to come In the end all these problems and more that have been listed by Jim and others are going to come out in some way or other, but I think probably not in 1985  I'd be opposed to rebasing  Growth has been pretty fast, if that's what you're asking  Paul, when we use the parallel line, I think we ought to be clear what the meaning is If we are well above where the cone would be in the early part of it but below the top parallel line, I believe that means that the growth rate from there on until the end of the area covered by the parallel line has to be less than the midpoint of the cone Isn't that right?  So, it's really just cosmetic It means that we have to get a lower growth rate if we're above that  That's a precipitous drop  Just fill in the top of those lines?  Oh, I see  [Unintelligible] look at it in these terms  -28-    2/12-13/85  It would be a little higher at the beginning  Yes  No, it's not really rebasing  It makes a lot of sense, actually  Are you talking about that for all the Ms or only for M1?  They're definitely pretty close  Joined at the top of last year's range is the top position  The end of the year  It just hasn't in the last few years  And 2 points less in the GNP growth  Was the November revision significant too, Jim?  I see  So, it really has drifted quite a lot lower  I think there's a lot to be said for the 4 to 8 percent range on M1 My particular point estimate is 8 percent on nominal GNP, and if we have the 1 percent increase in velocity that the staff is predicting, that will result in a 7 percent [Ml] growth rate, which would be consistent with that That's at the very upper end of our 4 to 7 percent range and a 4 to 8 percent range gives us a little room And it seems to me that it's more likely to fit suitably in a year which--if it comes out as we are projecting it--produces suitable results of 4 percent or thereabouts on real growth and 4 percent or maybe a little less than that on inflation I don't see why in advance we should show some inclination to try to screw down on the economy with this kind of a prospect I also think it would look good from the standpoint of the public because we're saying ""Look, inflation has developed quite a bit better than we expected"" Although it's not zero, as Henry keeps pointing out, it looks like it's going to be a quiet period and we don't want to stop the economy from having reasonable growth Therefore, since the problems haven't materialized that we were beginning to anticipate when we cut that range back in July, I think there's a lot to be said for putting it back where it was before, at 4 to 8 percent It could be played very well Therefore, I think that's what we ought to do  I don't think we ought to get into some kind of a box on these other Ms because we're trying to be tight about everything So, taking 4 to 8 percent for an M1 range, I also would take the rest of alternative I for M2 and M3 Maybe total credit ought to be 9 to 12 percent rather than 9-1/2 to 12-1/2 percent, but I see nothing wrong with that in the context we're talking about Now, if our forecast turns out to be seriously in error, that upper limit will give us a constraint If more inflation begins to develop, we'll start to pop over the upper limit and that will be the basis for snugging up in the market On the other hand, if the staff is wrong on velocity and it goes up 2 percent or 3 percent rather than 1 percent, there's no reason we can't fall below the 7 percent normative number that I have now in my forecast and take 6 or 5-1/2 percent That's within the range we're talking about So, I think the 4 to 8 percent range fits very nicely with the economic circumstances that we're talking about for this particular year, and I would support that  I have a strong preference for the second  -44-    2/12-13/85  I think it's a recognition of the unexpected size of the inflow of capital from abroad  Pardon?  To 9 to 12 percent  I said that seemed a little steep But I was not speaking of the numbers; I was speaking of the reason why we would recognize that they were high numbers  Above 9 to 12 percent?  Well, I think we're going to have trouble with that at 6 to 8-1/2 percent I would prefer 6 to 9 percent  It provides for a little more room for real growth  I don't see anything wrong with that myself  Well, to me 4 percent is desirable and 4-1/2 percent is acceptable We're starting off with an unemployment rate  -46-    2/12-13/85  of 74 percent There was talk about that being the full employment level; I certainly don't agree with that I think we have room to go down; I don't think we know; we have to probe and see I think we probably could have 4-1/2 percent growth for this year without difficulty  But if they break on the up side, we're going to go right through the upper ends of these ranges  A very unusual year I don't think it will be repeated  I would agree with ""B"" also; I would agree with what Henry said--that the current situation is adequate It looks as if we're getting a pretty good recovery, somewhat shaded by that retail sales report this morning But the rate of growth still seems adequate I would point out that we've been bordering on the high side of monetary growth and, when I say ""remain unchanged,"" I have in mind a moving down in the rates of monetary growth of the sort that the staff is projecting for the quarter If that didn't occur, I think it would give us trouble  ""Increase slightly"" for pressure on reserve positions?  What is seasonal borrowing now--$60 or $70 million?  Well, I think we need to develop fairly promptly a view as to the kind of weight we give to seasonal borrowing It's not zero and it's not a hundred; it's something in between Of course, we could have an unusual increase in seasonal borrowing-- maybe not between now and the next meeting but between now and midyear --and we need to know how to evaluate that if it occurs  Yes Well, this just reminds me that it's something we ought to be looking at  Above on the aggregates?  I think Lyle's point was good about those modifiers on the business situation  ""The same reserve posture""  [Unintelligible] number of models you look at  Wouldn't it require quite a substantial slowing of M2 growth to get 10 percent, Steve?  January was pretty high?  14-1/2 percent  I do too Maybe ""some"" And then for the easing sentence [rather than] ""might be acceptable,"" I think we ought to say ""would be acceptable"" under those conditions you have specified  Yes, I thought ""substantially""--  Well, I didn't mind the ""substantially slower growth"" but then might ""be acceptable in the event of substantially slower growth in the monetary aggregates, sluggish growth in economic activity, and continued strength of the dollar""? I thought ""might"" was perhaps a little reserved Lyle, I think that does take care of your problem  10 to 11 percent is okay I think that is reasonably stated We're going to get a slowing in M2 growth; there's no doubt about that But I think it will be hard to get it within the quarter when one month is 14-1/2 percent  ""Some increase"" is pretty indefinite  It says ""pressures"" We could change it to ""conditions"" as it has previously been  Well, I was going to add--you may not care for this--that we could say ""some snugging up""  Actually, the suggestion ""some limited"" is rather better with respect to that ""Some limited increase in reserve pressures"" doesn't have the precision  I think we have to leave the cone  But I would like to point out to you, Paul, that the staff's M1 projection under alternative B is for growth for the first quarter over the fourth quarter of 92 percent If that's at all right, the 7 percent is a considerable constraint for the remainder of the year  Well, for three more quarters it means about 6 percent  Yes, right  It could happen  And they have to slow down later  A little flatter  Probably 1 percent flatter  Target  It creates lots of room, all right  Yes, and we're well within it  Well, if I understand the way you're going to draw it, we're a good deal more within it than with parallel lines  Well, that is just connecting the points here When I look at the--  M1 is right after the full page of tables  Say we've had a couple of quarters of 9 percent growth; the arithmetic implication is that it is going to have to drop to 5 percent  Now, there might lie the basis for some compromise We can go with the 4 to 7 percent on the understanding that we're going to increase it later  I don't recall that we ever have, but I may be wrong about that  We rebased, but did we ever raise it?  That's right, we did; rebasing made a big difference  Favorable prices  Not the really [expensive ones]  Cadillacs  -64-    2/12-13/85  Actually, you'll find that any car is expensive  $10,000 or more  And if we generalize it to say ""monetary aggregates"" that may be appropriate  -65-    2/12-13/85  You wouldn't be prepared to say monetary aggregates in the upper part of their ranges or above? Well, there are two great provisos  Opposed  Yes  I think M2 is likely to give us trouble and I would want that upper end up a little I don't care what we do to M3 because we don't pay any attention to it  99 percent  Yes, who can live with it?  Well, your point estimate is already in the upper part of the range That's another way of putting it  We count [deposits at] nonbank banks in the monetary aggregates, don't we?  [Unintelligible]  What?  It's just that it produces so much rigidity to have that as a precedent for doing it in the future It's like having a monetary rule  I think it ought to say aggregates; it ought to be generalized If they don't happen to be there--well, they won't be there  Could you put in that ""reluctantly""?  [Unintelligible] "
2740,1985-03-26," No question; the quality of it isn't much  It's the equivalent of a month's current account deficit It seems to me the price effect was quite small for that kind of quantity  I understand They have to hold it    3/26/85  In terms of total stocks of financial assets the addition of $10 billion wouldn't be large; it would be very small  It was just the public that lost  What about the implications for this clearing agent? I guess they were going out of the business anyway? Is that right?  That would show up, wouldn't it?  I certainly agree with Peter that the other agencies seem to me at least as weak, if not weaker, than the Farm Credit Banks Maybe I think that because they do have a very strong capital position It's true that they have the largest concentration of loans of a potentially bad quality of anybody in the country, but they have very good capital  So, it seems to me that we shouldn't do anything that would create a backing away, Si, although I don't think I would buy any more  That is, we avoid buying net new issues  Their total debt has been declining sharply It has been rather fortunate that their debt has been running off as potential buyers have run off also It could be a fairly delicate situation  Well, but it was a billion dollars  Well, like some of the others, I think the financial fragility is the new and potentially disruptive development that we're having in the economy The Ohio situation, of course, did get a lot of national publicity--far more than Mississippi did eight years ago That indicates something of the kind of concerns that people could have, but it's not the only thing At our last meeting we were very much steeped and involved in the question of agricultural finance Now, I don't think that has improved any in this period of time; it's just that Ohio took precedence over it and got more attention The general savings and loan situation is pretty weak, as we all know, and the Home Loan Bank Board has been working hard to try to cut back on some of the lending that is totally unwarranted that has been done there We're still subject to accidents, and not just like ESM I noticed, Bob, that the strongest Texas bank reported in the last couple of days a surprising loss in loans to its directors; and it's just [without] question about the best of the Texas banks Of course, is probably accident prone, and who knows what the next thing might be that will affect them My view of the matter is that this probably will be affecting both peoples' attitudes toward the stability of finance and also the attitudes of lenders toward what their posture ought to be I don't think it's at all a secret that the Comptroller of the Currency is taking a much tougher view in examinations now; he is classifying a lot more loans And the national banks have a lot of exposure out there now that they didn't have a couple of years ago I think that affects their attitudes and  -11-    3/26/85  the Home Loan Bank Board is affecting S&L attitudes So, both on the lending side--the availability of credit, which is something that Steve mentioned--and in terms of public attitudes, we have a new risk that I think has grown with the passage of time And that probably will be reflected by a change in liquidity preferences There is a little of that apparently in the market with Ohio but it could become very much stronger at some point in the future I think it makes less dependable--not that they are dependable ever--but less dependable than usual the observation of the monetary numbers, because we don't know what kinds of attitudinal changes might be reflected in those numbers now or in the period ahead I don't disagree with the staff forecast as a normative forecast But I do think that the risks, stemming largely from the financial side, are on the down side  Is that year-over-year, Si?  How do you feel about multifamilies, Pres?  -21-    3/26/85  It wasn't his farm was it?  By tightening do you mean interest rates?  Alternative B, if it works out, would cruise us right along this upper band for the time being That seems to me not a bad outcome if we could get it Fortunately, we have had this [slowing in] March; without March things really would be looking very grim  $500 to 600 million?  Sometimes they're wrong  Well, I rather like what Lyle said I think, cosmetically, it would be desirable to put in a 6 percent M1 and we can review later whether or not we want to change the upper limit But for now, I think the notion that growth would be running pretty parallel with that upward path line is a pretty good one I think maybe the borrowings number could be snugged to $400 million, which is very little change In fact, it may be a little easing from where we actually have been But I wouldn't go as far as Si has suggested I'm wondering if there are times--and I think there are--when it is desirable to pay more attention to the markets and less to the aggregates And since I agree that it could be pretty destructive to have a sizable, significant, appreciable rise in the funds rate at this point, I wonder whether we shouldn't reduce [the top of] that range to 9 percent  Yes Maybe we ought to lower the rate to indicate some symmetry on this; perhaps we ought to raise the 6 percent [lower limit], but I think not In any event, I think there ought to be an understanding that if following the course we're following is likely to take the funds rate above 9 percent, we certainly ought to talk about it And perhaps we ought to signal that to the market by putting that in the directive  You haven't had any inquiries for seasonal?  No takers  Right  Well, $500 to $600 million is going to put the funds rate under upward pressure isn't it? We didn't get an answer  Well, maybe what we ought to do is have an agreement as to net borrowings rather than borrowings  There has been a lot of talk about targeting interest rates as we've gone around the table  No I think it's out of character for me to even propose it!  Well, the market looks at excess reserves too And if the borrowing fluctuates some while excess fluctuates too, it seems to me they can put it together  I prefer $350 to $400 million, with some flexibility in--  Well, we ordinarily use a single point  Average the two of them  Martha was there too  It seems to me that we ought to be symmetric, Paul, and that we ought to use the word ""might"" in both cases instead of ""would""  I think that's right  And the funds rate 6 to 10 percent? "
2763,1985-05-21," There used to be projections in the New York report on domestic operations I don't know; maybe they've been taken out It was a source of leaks earlier Peter, do you have any projections anymore in your report?  I remember we had problems with that some years ago  Well, you know, it was distributed widely in the Treasury to something like 150 people some years ago  It was a big number!  I don't think they have 150 people anymore!  In both cases, it was down by 1/2 percentage point  Mike, I thought I heard you suggest that there would be less strength in state and local purchases looking ahead That sort of surprises me; I had the impression that revenues were coming in very well and I assumed that expenditures in the state and local sector would rise with more prosperous times  Well, Lyle said a good deal of what I was going to say This has been such a gloomy go-around today that I thought maybe I couldn't even survive it! I didn't get any sense as I was listening to everybody that in the first four months of the year nonfarm payrolls rose by more than 1 million workers That's a tremendous rate of addition to our employment  Well, we don't even measure productivity in services or trade and, of course, that is where the employment gains were They weren't in manufacturing I think that we tend to be bemused by manufacturing, because historically it was the cyclically volatile sector and historically where we thought we got our oomph And, of course, we are not getting any now with the import competition I agree with Lyle that that is a temporary phenomenon, although temporary in terms of years, perhaps, rather than months But we really have had a very buoyant domestic economy in my view, with the strength being sapped by the import competition And I think we ought to keep that in context  Now, I'm as concerned as anyone here--even Pres--about the condition of the financial markets I think that they are in terrible shape In fact, I can't even bring myself anymore, Bob, to say what you say about the banking [system] I don't know that it is sound or that banks are in good condition I am very much taken by the fact that we are 2-1/2 years into the recovery and that we are still talking about all of these problems We have a thousand problem banks, [the ones rated] fours and fives We have failures moving along and we are 2-1/2 years into the recovery What happens come a recession--which will come? I don't know There may be no way out of this box But I do believe that the worst conceivable thing that could happen--the thing I have nightmares about--is a situation that  -20-    5/21/85  brings about the necessity of a substantial increase in interest rates By substantial I don't mean a point; I mean a substantial increase in interest rates because of, let's say, a very sharp drop in the dollar or a sudden strengthening in the economy because of less import competition or an inflation rate that accelerates I remind all of you that all the research shows that inflation starts with prices, not wages And then when prices move up, wages follow They will do it this time too--that is, if we have another rise in prices But an increase of 3 or 4 percentage points in interest rates would absolutely sink most of our financial institutions--certainly most of our thrifts and a good many of our other financial institutions So, I think the big thing to guard against is getting ourselves into a situation where perforce we have to tolerate or accept, and maybe even encourage, a substantial increase in interest rates six months from now, a year from now, or a year and a half from now, as the case may be  So, I find myself a little timid on this business of stimulating the economy at this point through monetary expansion Some fluctuation in rates is all right, certainly One has to recognize that we are not anywhere close to our potential, that we very easily could accommodate in the near term more growth than is forecast, and that we may not have as much growth as is being forecast, because quarter after quarter we have had shortfalls in our projections But I wouldn't want to do that in any kind of gung ho way because I think that would raise the odds that a subsequent sizable fall in the dollar and a subsequent increase in observed prices would bring higher rates that would give us really serious financial troubles in our system So, I come out on the side of caution and moderation in what we do today  Now, what are you doing with the thrift [borrowings]? Is that--  Totally out, Steve?  You regard them as a functional equivalent of extended credit?  Oh, is that right?  You are prepared to accept those low M2 and M3 numbers, though?  You don't think that there is any information content in them?  -25-    5/21/85  Or that we didn't know what the money supply was  Well, I have some sympathy with Bob Black's position It makes me uneasy to be running above track on M1 There's no magic in it, of course But we specified it and it is a relatively high number historically We're at the time in the cycle when it's conceivable that we're seeing weaknesses here and there that could do the kind of thing that would lead people to say, as they do about the '70s, that we acted in an inflationary manner It is a sensitive time to overrun the objectives that we have set before I am impressed, however, by the fact that the M1 target ranges were set in the context of a higher interest rate structure than we now have And interest rates, as Frank has pointed out, do now very much affect    5/21/85  the behavior of M1 So, that may be somewhat of a temporary explanation at least I think we need to review this all quite thoroughly for the next meeting, including what NOW accounts are doing, particularly Super NOWs You remember when the minimums were reduced on all of them in January that we said we were going to watch carefully to see what happened I'm not sure that we have watched that carefully since then, having decided that nothing was going to happen So that all ought to be reviewed I'm also impressed by the extreme weakness in M2 and M3 I've asked about that several times and I'm always told that it's a technical thing that will soon reverse itself But, in fact, if you look at the family of aggregates--and you remember that the Committee has a family of aggregates so that it won't be misled by some exotic movement in one of them--we're in pretty good shape M2 and M3 have declined down not only within the parallel lines but are now within the cones And seeing that gives me a little more comfort So, I would accept alternative B And if I were going to err, I'd err on the side of tightness rather than ease  Well, it could be that It could be the Treasury refund situation and the big Treasury balance I think we just have to look at it  I wonder, Paul, whether the staff has any view on this seasonal borrowing point that Roger made I had sort of forgotten about the fact that it would be moving up--I presume significantly--in weeks to come  Yes, I think that's right But I'm hearing also that April was the lowest M2 growth since 1970 That goes back a long way It may be strictly technical, but it gives me pause so long as I see it there  One of the things is that thrifts are getting to be a part of these numbers and we know that FCA is still in trouble And as a matter of fact the whole savings and loan industry seems to be much less aggressive in terms of expansion--I guess because of the Home Loan Bank Board rule on incremental net capital So I'm wondering whether there might be something more there  No, they're going to make as many bad loans but they're going to make fewer good ones!  Yes  It's all those trade-ins, with this high level of new sales  Well, there are three items mentioned--  Yes, they really are all very difficult  Well, these are mentioned elsewhere too I think This is just somewhat--okay  Did you say $600 million without the thrifts?  ""Selected recent weeks""!  That's a two-month rate for the two of them?  Yes, but the other two are two-month rates  Well, I guess that's 6-1/2 to 7-1/2 percent  ""The sluggish April performance""  You used the word ""expected"" in both cases didn't you, Paul?  Me too  That's a shift  That's noticeable  Well, that's where [markets] put the directive language  I think they have to be ""woulds"" in both cases or ""mights"" in both cases; I don't care which it is  SPEAKER(?) Well, in both cases it ought to be ""might"" so that we don't get trapped  I can go with ""might""  [Unintelligible] you'd prefer ""woulds""  -39-    5/21/85  ""Might"" and ""would""  You wouldn't mind some company  Now we're talking!  Why don't we make it $350 to $400 million and allow some discretion to be exercised here? I think we all expressed the view that we didn't want it to threaten the discount rate  Well, that's why it is discretionary  20 points in the stock market yesterday  That certainly does seem to suggest $325 to $375 million then, doesn't it? It encompasses both views  And that means it kept all its gain  SPEAKER(?) So it is pretty good  Where you said that there would be less growth than earlier anticipated for M2 and M3, don't you think we ought to put in the percentages earlier anticipated? There's no base there unless somebody goes back and looks at--  SPEAKER(?) Yes, that's right  I would just say ""less rapidly"" instead of ""substantially less rapidly"" because, as you say, if we should happen to get a snap-back, it would be acceptable "
2787,1985-07-09," Second  Second  Could I just add on here? That is a very sharp rise in non-oil import prices on that chart, Mike Is that an 8    7/9-10/85  percent rate of depreciation of the dollar plus a rate of inflation for imported prices in foreign currency terms? It seems an awfully sharp increase to me  Something less than that?  You have about a 12 percent rise [in import prices] over this forecast period?  A lot of people say profit margins are going to decline on shipments to the United States and this does not seem to allow much for that as the dollar drops  Well, I fall into that camp that you just described, and it wasn't staff input I put in a rather higher forecast, but this chart show gives me the uneasy feeling that we are about to stall The problem, as I see it, is in these charts that tend to be toward the bottom of the page As I go through the forecast here, for example, you have a very sizable rise in the    7/9-10/85  multifamily vacancy rate and an increase in the mortgage delinquency rate; and I think that starts to raise some questions about whether residential construction will be all that high I agree with Pres; I am surprised that your vacancy rate for office buildings is only a little over ten percent since I think there is hardly a place in the Coldwell Bankers survey that that's low Maybe New York City is so heavily weighted that it brings it down In any event, it is just a question of when there will be a collapse in office building rather than whether  I should have, I suppose, done the color coordination and gone to the left, but I didn't So I see that you have a vacancy rate of more like 15 or 16 percent, which is a very high vacancy rate One hears of concessions occurring all over the country I am somewhat inclined to agree that consumers have been overspending; their debt has risen sharply and delinquency rates are up some in that area You considerably restock the car inventories and durable goods inventories and, therefore, that looks sort of high Even for the poor state and local governments, who have been spending at a very modest rate, your chart at the bottom shows their surplus dropping off to nothing in the projection period So I tend to get the impression looking through this--and I realize it is very dangerous--that a stall is quite conceivable, particularly if one takes Mr Truman's adverse line on imports, which is closer to what I would have expected than the one that the staff projected as their central tendency I tend to be persuaded by this presentation that the economy is really pretty weak  A permanent one-time drop in velocity would be the second occasion  Would you think things are still deteriorating in agriculture?  That's a big drop  A lot of people would say unemployment, Henry  Well, if it came down to 6-1/2 percent, we would have a very considerable increase in the number of employed  -17-    7/9-10/85  There is not much innovation to refer to this year  Yes It could just be an argument that with the rate of inflation down and inflation expectations declining, why, it is a better bet to hold money  It's potentially dangerous to change the base, isn't it? If I understood Steve, we don't know that this--whatever it is that is occurring--is over If it is occurring, it may continue; and in fact it seems likely to reflect itself in the third quarter What is [M1 growth for the quarter], 10 percent?  I understand that And then it could be much higher  When I first saw that table, I figured these were your charts  Bad distribution  I think it ought to be higher  Well, my observation is that we are getting far too much money with the borrowing number we have and, therefore, we ought to nudge it up a little  There almost would have to be an announcement on that--that would be such an extraordinary thing to do  -28-    7/9-10/85  We have had a very considerable increase in business activity [since] then  That's true  That's true But the question is Can we afford that much of an increase in business activity now?  Well, that's certainly true Can we afford 10 percent?  -29-    7/9-10/85  I don't think it's likely It's very difficult One would have to disregard M1 altogether  No, I don't think it is a good idea I don't think the experience of the postwar period suggests that it is a good idea  What's the first six months 11 percent?  My problem with rebasing is that we don't know that we have run the end of this string    7/9-10/85  If we could rebase on the third quarter--  But I think there is a very great danger that if you rebase, it sounds as if you are serious  And it very well may be that we'll start right out on the high side of any rebased numbers, assuming we rebase on the second quarter  If we are giving any serious thought to putting M1 on standby, I think it would be a serious error to raise the targets on the rest of the aggregates, which have been reasonably well behaved Dropping M1 and then raising M2 and M3 would certainly give the impression that we are letting [monetary policy] go to the winds I think the only way we could possibly say that we are going to watch M1 carefully and do that credibly--and we don't know what all that has been going on means--would be to hold to the [ranges for the] other aggregates that have been expanding reasonably It's true that credit is above its range; I believe it hasn't increased its excess above the range And the projection has it generally coming down in the next year  And about 1 point of that is the merger--  With the same amounts of the aggregates, Martha, and the smaller GNP, one would expect lower interest rates  -34-    7/9-10/85  And that could continue You could argue that if we have smaller GNP growth, we don't need as much credit as we did before We get these lower rates, which brings the GNP back up and brings the aggregates up to our previous ranges  One other comment I would like to make, if I could, Paul I know we haven't talked much about 1986, but I do want to remind everyone that Reg Q goes off entirely in the spring of 1986 The staff has said that they do not think it will have much effect But, boy, it is a pretty wild environment out there when you don't have any limits on anything! All NOW accounts would become super NOWs, by definition Savings accounts would come back into their own Who knows what might happen to savings accounts? So, I think we have to have a certain amount of diffidence in talking about what might happen in the aggregates in 1986 because of that event  I think I would agree with that I would like to raise the range on the basis of the experience that we have had  I wasn't thinking of raising the upper limit 2 points  You said 9 percent; I was thinking of 4 to 8 percent And I would do it on the grounds that there is a great deal of uncertainty about what may happen Zero is not the only possibility for a month; we may have a month that is negative We might find ourselves back within [the range] but running high because we have had a cumulation of such high numbers It seems to me that simply a recognition of the fact that it has run so strong thus far this year and that there seems to be a changed relationship would lead us to say that we would raise the limit because of that As Henry said, we have M1 on probation because we really don't understand what is going on here It could come down within the ranges--and it could in August, say I don't think July is a likely month, but August is a possibility If that should happen--  Yes I wouldn't say a high probability  Well, I don't see anything wrong with it What we would be doing is raising the spread too, Bob If we take it to 4 to 8 percent, I don't see anything wrong with 3 to 7 percent next year And I think [M1 growth] might well be very low [next year] because of Reg Q ending, which I think is going to lead to transfers from checking-type to savings-type instruments  Well, I can't speak with certainty, but it just seems to me that as a result of Reg Q we can get some rebirth in the kinds of instruments that we classify as M2 rather than M1  But I am talking about moving back in, with new attractive instruments  Well, it is hard to say NOW accounts could get the expansion, too, because there would no longer be the 5-1/4 percent [rate] limit on NOW accounts As I say, I just have no idea But it is conceivable that M1 could come out low in the range next year  Well, that is a possibility, too  If it were 8 percent, Steve, what could growth be from June to December?  Well, I think the argument is that you have built in excess liquidity that then becomes uncontrollable  Boy, that's a tough belief to follow right into a recession  I am sure that Friedman would say that if he were sitting here  I think we do maximize our problems if we rebase because if things continue as they are, we are going to be over the top; and if this was some kind of a strange aberration that is reversed, we are going to be below the bottom of a rebased number I think Roger is right that possibility increases That exposes us to the maximum danger of missing it utterly on either side  It's obvious that that's my preference  We surely have missed it  Because we don't know why it is down We don't know what accounts for what happened in May and June  We don't know whether it is over; we don't know if it is reversing We don't really know anything about it  I am rather impressed with the integrity argument that Jerry just gave People who have been around here for some years know that we are often accused of rebasing any time we get into trouble That has been a constant source of friction and difficulty in discussions of these matters I think we can rebase if we have a good argument for rebasing My problem with rebasing now is that we don't know what has happened In 1982 it was a stab, but it sure looked as if [M1 growth] was running way off Right now we don't know What we really have is a couple of high months, which happen to be the months just right now, and we don't know what is going to happen And when we rebase, it looks like we are rebasing to make it easier That's the old complaint about rebasing  I think that's a reason for raising the range  I do  I think the majority have indicated that they are not prepared to wring out the high M1 numbers So we are only talking about cosmetics We have given up on substance here  In one case you wipe the slate clean and in the other case you don't  It could be very hard to put back in too  That's because it is out of control  Well, if you feel much more comfortable with rebasing, I'll accept it  This time we're going to rebase but we're not going to get more serious  Yes, they are nice round numbers  With monetary--  Well, I like 4 to 7 percent too, because this is supposed to be a tentative indication for next year We know very little about what M1 is doing, as we are going to admit in one way or  -54-    7/9-10/85  another again So I think tentatively what we should say is that we would hope to reestablish this range  We don't know what's going to happen in '85    7/9-10/85  I wouldn't bet on 10 percent either  Yes  The problem is that July is rather high and we can't affect July; it may be the wrong number but we are not going to affect it And then it drifts right down; by September the point estimate is 4 percent or something, isn't it?  -59-    7/9-10/85  I think that's about as sharp a dampening as one would want, Bob And what we would then look forward to is a lower fourth quarter than the third quarter  That's continuing in the fourth quarter what the third quarter--?  I could accept that  It's the same amount  The problem is that 7 percent is very tight  That's the trouble with rebasing  I think if we're going to rebase that we ought to have a figure that we can have some reasonable presumption of hitting, so I'm for 8 percent  Well, I would take 9 percent I'd skip the 1/2 point  The 1/2 point does?  5 percent  This is quarter 4 We're talking about rebasing  That's a little more than 5 percent  Rebase again!  What about 3 to 8 percent, Paul?  If it comes back down, why, we'll accept it  With a certain amount of diffidence  -64-    7/9-10/85  Ask about the other one  You definitely want to rebase?  The reason I asked is that I'm going to vote with you I would prefer not rebasing; but if you want to rebase, I'll rebase  You could hardly be strong about this  It gives you a little better average too  -65-    7/9-10/85  If this May-June increase is reversible, we could get--  Some uncertainty  If we happen to get 3 percent  I could buy the top with a 3 percent [lower limit]  I do too  3 to 7 percent  And the range  It might take some a while to pick that up  -68-    7/9-10/85  We had that, didn't we?  Yes, I should think that--  Well, all of these are tentative Is there some word like ""tentative"" in there?  Especially tentative  Well, if we use 3 to 8 percent, it seems to me that it ought to be picked out of the first sentence and put in the second sentence  I must say that I think there's some merit to that argument that we need a little more certainty before we collapse the range  The fact of the matter is that if we need the 8 percent in M1 to keep the economy going, we're going to have 8 percent in M1 as a practical matter  But we [unintelligible] going to read the papers with interest  I don't think we want to say that  3 to 8  Particularly if it's 4 to 7 percent  I should say the whole thing's up for grabs given the two sentences They both suggest to me that it's possible that [unintelligible] things could be done for--  I don't either No  It's pretty muddy It might be one of those options  In the end of the second part of the sentence I'd be tempted to say ""would"" instead of ""might""  Yes, make it 7-1/2 percent  Consistent with what we've been saying, put it second  Would you like to change that funds rate range to 9 percent at the top?  Certainly people would be getting excited if it ran over 9 percent, wouldn't they?  Well, it seems to me some evenness-- I dislike [unintelligible] of the extreme numbers  We will have a telephone call if it gets to 10 percent?  Would you like us to reconsider our projections? "
2812,1985-08-20," Sam, the price of gold has increased significantly over this period that you are talking about too--that is to say, the dollar has dropped relative to gold Gold wouldn't have changed much in price in terms of marks or Swiss francs, I don't suppose Is that all that is being reflected here that the market is made in Switzerland and Germany? Or do you think there is something else behind this move in gold?  Yes, I think that is probably right  I see  You depend on a levelling out of net imports to get this improvement in GNP?  Well, you made the presentation  You ordinarily would expect quite a lag  Within a quarter?  If I might ask another question Jim, what do you make of the fairly pervasive weakness in nonresidential indicators in the last couple of months? Contracts and most of the elements there have been off quite substantially  Yesterday I was reading--I think a number of us received this--a letter from the home builders They really had quite an upbeat letter this time on traffic in the subdivisions and on sales and the outlook for sales over the next six months For them it was as optimistic as I have seen for a long time  I didn't know he had stopped! Don't you have another paragraph?  Of course, a corporation can do the same thing and call it defeasance  In the third quarter; we're right there  The question is Does anybody see it?  Well, that's a 25 percent drop from a pretty low number  They won't do it willingly, that's for sure  Is that a potentially big number?  Well, in order to counterbalance you, Henry, I guess I would have to say that I think the possibilities of a recession are distinctly there now The way I would visualize it occurring is that we have had enough sapping of the strength of the economy through the net imports, which I don't think will level off in the immediate future, that income growth will slow to very little The saving rate is as low as it can get The best forecast the staff can give us is for really very little final demand And with that very small final demand, I think the credit system will start to unwind We have this disaster awaiting us in income properties and it is getting closer every month than it was the month before In addition, as the Chairman and others have pointed out, in the last two years the equity buy-backs and mergers and so forth have added to debt, and [firms] just have to have increased revenue in order to support those quantities of debt Without the increased revenue that is associated with rising sales, we are going to have more and more trouble in that category of finance also And the farm credit situation is so bad that it is really hard to see what could happen now that would do other than get us into a crisis I realize that this is a very quiet period, but that is just because the fall has not come and these notes have not come due yet When they do, there are going to be very few people who are going to have any money to service their debt I think the fundamental source of [the problem] is the imbalance caused by the import situation, but where [the crisis] is going to occur, if it does occur, will be in the credit area as we get into the fall and winter--in the credit quality problems that the economy now faces I don't know that there is anything much that policy can do about it Indeed, it might be a mistake to follow strongly with expansion to try to deal with it because I think the ultimate result of that would be more inflation in the country And I guess I have a little streak of monetarism in me too, or at least I do believe that in the long run money matters and that if you get a lot of money out there, sooner or later it is going to bring inflation So I say this hesitantly because I don't have a solution to deal with it; but I do think we must recognize that recession is a distinct possibility  Well, if it is the right bias--  We have had a sort of informal desire not to change the directives in the mid-quarter meeting It will be pretty hard to avoid that  Well, this certainly is a time that separates the sheep from the goats! I am not enough of a monetarist to be able to bring myself to do something because of the behavior of the monetary numbers that has absolutely no confirmation in the real economy or in the outlook for the real economy as we can see it Indeed I would be in favor of easing if it were not for the monetary aggregates--  --because I think we are going through a very difficult period in which a little ease in rates might not hurt It might be pushing on a string and it might not accomplish too much, but it certainly would not hurt I am also quite bothered by the foreign exchange market I think that Jerry and Paul are right that we could get quite a drop in that And I suppose a material move toward easier rates would increase the odds that that would be true I think also that there is a little question about the credibility of the Federal Reserve developing out there I have seen quite a few reports and heard from quite a few people who say ""Well, we don't see any inflation immediately but you really are setting the stage for it--you are providing all of the liquidity--and we think the result of this is going to be inflationary in the long run""  I think it's showing up in the foreign exchange market and I think it's showing up a little in the precious metals market And I believe that is something that we have to be somewhat concerned about But, as I said, I just cannot bring myself to tighten interest rates--to be specific about what tightening means--on account of this behavior in M1 Therefore, I guess I am stuck pretty much where the Chairman was, except I would sort of like to see the funds rate drift back to about 7-1/2 percent, where it was when we started out, rather than see it cruise along in the high 7s--at 7-3/4 to 8 percent I think there probably has been a little questioning out there in the market as to whether these numbers mean that there has been some [slight] tightening that has been planned by the Federal Reserve, so I guess that would mean that I would lean toward the low side on this range of borrowings A $500 million level certainly seems too high to me; $350 to $400 million I think would probably do it and I hope that M1 comes back [within its range] That certainly is not a plan to bring M1 back; that's a hope that M1 will come back while we continue what is, in market terms, an unchanged policy  It takes a small fourth quarter to do that  If I understood Mr Black correctly, we didn't tighten enough, given the aggregates  That's $400 million  No, they're targeting $400 million  Well, my point is that this doesn't say where it happened to have come out; the [issue] isn't where we are now It's what we were planning, targeting, expecting to do That is where we are now  It's always either above or below  We had specified 5 to 6 percent  Well, I wouldn't want to specify the funds rate  The midpoint being $425 million?  It is a little high  Of course, if something happens say, the money supply comes in stronger than has been projected or other things    8/20/85  happen in the economy, you would expect borrowing to run above that We are talking about a beginning range, aren't we, for the--  So, unless something pushes it rather strongly in one direction or another, it does become the operating range for the period It is different than what we have done before  Yes  On John's question, Paul I think that is a reasonable question He was talking about the exchange rate, not the rate of change in the balance of trade  Was it a 4 percent decline since the last meeting?  A little more than that Is that too much?  $350 to $500 million  And the specifications of ""B""?  Pres does  -40-    8/20/85  Yes  It would be characterized as a little tighter?  Expecting to miss both of them An average--  SPEAKER(?) The average guesses  I'd rather pick 6-1/2 and 8-1/2 percent I'd take the point estimates That happens to average to 7-1/2 percent; I don't know that that means anything Have we ever said that we average the aggregates?  With a point estimate you don't expect it to be exactly right  Well, it has gone from 14 percent to 4 percent; that's quite a slowing  6 to 10 percent  ""Given the rapid growth in recent weeks"" is what we say?  Well, this is an expectation and not a policy statement Maybe--  That's the second next sentence?  Since that's what we seem to have done, I think that's what we ought to put in  But we didn't do it  I guess so  These other factors are really quite important the business expansion, inflation, conditions in domestic credit markets and--  Paul, I think we might say simply ""the movement of foreign exchange rates"" or something like that after ""the business expansion"" But then the last phrase ought to be revised to say ""domestic and international credit markets"" We don't want to drop out the international credit markets  I said ""movements"" but--  ""Developments in foreign exchange markets""  Oh, we just took that out "
2838,1985-10-01," So it's about the same rate of decline as previously  There aren't any comments on the business situation?  Why would you take money out of an interest- bearing deposit and put it in a demand deposit? That's--  Very short  And currency has gone up quite a bit too  I know  The same period that we've had a very rapid increase in credit relative to GNP  Did it? In 1982? I don't [know] either  Well, is it the exchange rate versus interest rates or is it interest rates versus prices?  Very extreme  And prices?  Above what it would otherwise go up  You have to cut the domestic demand 5 percentage points That's a lot  Ed, if you give those people income they're not just going to spend it on products, they're going to spend it on services too  And there is a macro effect  Yes  That's surprising With September growth I presume at least 10 percent, I would think that the end of September would be higher than the average for September  The third quarter is pretty well determined Are you talking about alternative C--5-1/2 percent for September to December?  On the quarterly, it's that high from the 3rd to the 4th quarter  It certainly would be desirable for him  I agree that the business outlook looks better than it did a couple months ago I realize you can find difficulties with all the statistics, but that is frequently true as you begin to see some strengthening You can say that there is an oddity here and an oddity there, or it is concentrated in this or that But in fact it is coming out quite uniformly on the stronger side A comment was made about new car sales Well, it seems to me that this endeavor is not costing the auto companies all that much The present value is something under 10 percent They have raised prices significantly, so  -19-    10/1/85  they can very easily afford to continue to do the same thing or something similar with the '86 models Their problem will be that they may run through a backlog of demand, not that they can't easily afford the kinds of promotions that they have been giving in this period Also, I think technically the business situation looks better because we have a quite moderate inventory level--in fact no inventory accumulation--and good final demands I would expect that we will see inventory accumulation and that will give us a stronger economy Even so, the staff forecast is for 3 percent growth in the fourth quarter and on the order of 2-1/2 to 3 percent in the first half of next year Say it runs stronger than that by a percentage point; it's still not anything excessive So I don't see that there is an upside risk of excessive growth in the near term, and I happen to agree with NABE, Martha I think there will be a recession by this time next year So we are talking about a fairly short-run outlook and I don't see any reason to say that the performance of the economy looks to be such that we ought to be making financial conditions tighter than they now are by any significant amount--unless the dollar breaks very strongly or something like that, which will change the nature of things  I note that not only has money been growing relative to GNP so that its trend looks different, but that is also true of debt relative to GNP, which is up very sharply in the last 4 years from 14 times GNP to 165 times GNP It looks as if, for some reason that I can't quite understand, it takes both more money and more credit to keep the economy moving at all well I think there are great pitfalls in this in the long run on the credit side; I worry about servicing the debt That may get to be a very great problem at some point in the future And on the money side I worry about having pumped all this liquidity in, which we won't be able to neutralize if something should touch off the desire to use it actively But these are not questions for today; they will become perhaps very big problems later on but not for today I think we ought to leave policy just where it is I disagree with Pres I don't think we ought to ease up any because I think that is something the market is looking for and would also associate with the G-5 accord and would be really more confining on us than not to do it But I don't think we ought to tighten at all either So I guess that's alternative B, with $500 million on borrowings as the initial estimate  I don't think that you can do it, if the evidence is that we have to have [such growth] in order to keep the economy moving at all well I think you just have to live with it until the crash  The aggregates would play a relatively small role?  If you happen to get a negative month, say, that wouldn't cause an easing?  I agree  And that ought to be about 8 percent?  It is just five weeks before the next meeting?  Good Good timing  I think we could hold this for five weeks, Paul, by which time we will know whether October--    10/1/85  I think variant II is so much more honest that we ought to--  [Unintelligible] the exchange rate too  6-3/4 percent  No, it's expected to slow and then--  It's certainly ""marked"" compared to where it has been  Even 11--  I wouldn't either  Well, ""somewhat greater or lesser reserve restraint"" is in both of them  You were the two who held up your hands  You get to decide it  He acts this way when the Board splits on something!  That does make it very much like the first variant "
2862,1985-11-04," Have they used up the Federal Financing Bank?  So moved  I think we ought to have Mr Kichline's report in the morning  Jim, that is an extraordinarily low saving rate in the third quarter Would you attribute that mainly to the surge in car sales and the credit associated with it, or what?  Higher net interest payments?  Oh, net interest; so, payments minus receipts  I assume farmers aren't spending any money?  Hauling it back?  Does that mean that you agree with the forecast?  They don't have any other place to put it!  You need a computer!  They prefer to buy low and sell high  Well, I tried to have a very optimistic view of the economy all through the summer, thinking that there would be a pretty good resurgence in the fall There were some pretty favorable indicators at our last meeting, but I must say that this recent set bothers me I am most affected, I guess, by the McGraw-Hill survey which is down one percent--and nobody mentioned that--in nominal terms Now that's a pretty good survey It's the oldest, and we always thought the best, of the private surveys That's a pretty poor, unrespectable survey result to be occurring in the fall after boards have met and plans have tended to firm up for the next year That did shock me The other thing that I worry about is that personal saving rate; the only thing you can do really is assume that it won't come back very much But it's so low that one wonders whether there hasn't been some kind of a spending desire on the part of consumers associated with the use of credit that will disappear, and that in fact the automobile producers are wrong about their forecasts for next year and it won't be as good as Si, I guess it was, suggested I don't know; that bothers me I am not sure, but it's a very mysterious thing to have a saving rate that low After all, there was supposed to be an environment that would encourage saving in  -15-    11/4-5/85  connection with supply side economics It's totally the wrong answer that has come out of the data from that point of view It's very difficult for me to incorporate the net export/import picture because we have had so little experience with that being a large factor It might be that there could be a bigger increase in exports than the staff has forecast, but the fact of the matter is that for the next year they have a contribution coming from net exports--that is, smaller net imports It's the first time since 1980 that there has been any contribution to the economy from that source, so it is a rather radical change in GNP effect that they have already put in there As far as office building is concerned, I think the longer it goes on the worse it is going to be I don't know when it is going to break, but it is going to break pretty big; and the longer it goes on the bigger the break will be when it occurs  So, I'm starting to lose my optimism; I figure at best we will get the staff forecast for the period to come and it could be a good deal worse There is a possibility of a recession and we need to recognize that I said that last time, thinking of it as sort of a remote possibility My feeling is that the possibility is a little stronger now that there will be a recession some time in the next nine months It's a distinct possibility In any event, I would want to point out to you--and I think this is what Pres Martin did--that the staff forecast is well below our bogey for the performance of the economy We [as a group] forecast 4 percent for the second half of the year, I believe, in real terms Apparently, it is going to be well below that We forecast a pretty good 1986, and it looks as though it is going to be below that by an appreciable percent or so So we are below our bogey; that seems to be increasingly clear as the months go by, and I think we will need to take that into account in determining what the monetary policy ought to be  I thought it was a minimal acceptable performance of the economy that we predicted in July That's the way it was presented in the Humphrey-Hawkins report, I thought as a satisfactory performance Otherwise, we would have needed a change of monetary policy to get a different economic result So it was acceptable, but now we have fallen more below that  I think I am, yes  He's a lot younger than the average age  In what period is that?  That's an upbeat report  And with no drop in the discount rate, I take it?  You suggest a little operation twist  As long as we have some time, would you like to discuss that a little more? That's an unusual recommendation  -18-    11/4-5/85  Well, there will also be a bunch of Treasury issues, I assume Will any of those be coupons?  We did study that operation twist at some length, and I can't recall that there were any findings of significant difference  Well, you have the mortgage borrowers there are a lot of those And they prefer fixed rates if they can get them  There's [unintelligible] at least in the home mortgage market Consumers have a very distinct preference for fixed rates  What do you mean because the Treasury will have so much difficulty financing? If so, why would they continue to issue coupons?  I understand  You don't extend that view to agencies, I take it  Well, I didn't want to mention any particular--  Steve, you have [forecast] a pretty calm M1 behavior for the remainder of the year You are not expecting any year-end surge or anything like that?  Well, Frank, I don't know If we have a continued sub-par performance of the economy, it would seem to me that that would be a reasonable justification On Friday of this week we will get the McGraw-Hill survey, which I think is going to be a big news item In addition, I think the retail sales figure, just because of car sales if nothing else, is going to be very poor  Yes I have no idea what that will show  We might as well leave it the same, right?  That was for Ml?  It's going to be hard to evaluate the budget thing isn't it, Paul?  Yes, that's possible  Or changing the range  We're now at $450-$550 million, and saying we would like to err toward some ease--if there is an opportunity--and widening that band on the low side is a good idea  I get awfully uncomfortable with the idea that we should put the dollar as the centerpiece of policy I think the economy is the centerpiece of [policy]  I don't disagree that the dollar is a significant variable, but I would point out that the objective was to get the dollar down That was a program to which you agreed to get the dollar down And it has come down and, I think, has behaved extremely well I thought for the whole period between meetings that the dollar had a lifting tendency and that's why we had to do the intervention If it doesn't lift, we don't do the intervention It was just very recently that we got a little weakness And I think the weakness has come because of the Japanese raising their rates, which is certainly a contra-economic policy from a world point of view--not because of anything we did So, I don't disagree with what is being said about the dollar, but I would again want to emphasize that I    11/4-5/85  think what we need to have is a decently performing domestic economy That's the primary objective of monetary policy  If it broke down sharply, yes We have had a great big program to bring it down and we have gotten it down a little The evidence hasn't been that it is tending to rush away Maybe it will I agree with you that that would be a bad thing  I don't know  Nobody ever told me what the program envisaged, so I don't have any sense [of that]  Oh, we certainly have I think the timing was excellent in terms of making the program look effective Anyhow, having been worrying about a high dollar for the last year and a half or two, I find it a little odd that we're now talking about how serious the possibility is And there is a possibility that it is going to break all the way down; [I don't know] how clear and present the danger is I suspect that some of Gov Seger's manufacturers wouldn't mind a little further drop  Are you suggesting that after I have left here, the Committee is going to keep the interest rates very high to keep the dollar from falling? And thus put [the country] in a major recession that the rest of the world is in--  With the same bad policy?  I would think we ought to put in 6 percent or around 6 percent  It's certainly true that we already have had the number that makes the 3 months slower I wonder whether we should leave it out and make it around 6 percent in all three [aggregates] in the previous sentence  That's right We could keep that the way the staff has it here in brackets and still not have that previous phrase, Paul  I would like to see the funds rate drift down, maybe an 1/8th of a point  I find your description too subjective also I guess I would just have to vote for an easier money policy instead of accepting something as fuzzy as you described  -31-    11/4-5/85  Well, I think it's a private policy I'm trying to bow a little toward you internationalists, but I can't bow too much because I think we need to be easing up a little  I think of $450 million as being the starting point I don't know whether that puts me on Governor Seger's side  Yes  I wonder whether the borrowing level shouldn't be in the directive It seems to me that that's what we are concentrating on now and it's not even specified It used to be that we said the aggregates, which were in there; then we said the reserve pressures, which were in there But the fact of the matter is that this discussion of policy for the last hour has been almost entirely on the question of what the initial borrowing level will be and it is not even mentioned in that directive  It might not be a bad time to introduce it, since we have a pretty wide range $350 to $550 million  I'm just struck by it  Well, that's true of the other things mentioned in the directive  -34-    11/4-5/85  I want an average for the next four quarters  I really thought he was right until this morning when the Chairman denied it  I used to think that way when the bill was written [unintelligible] I even thought the Congress might ask Why don't you get a better outcome?  That seems to be true of everything  Because we have had that low October  It seems to me the word is ""acceptable"" instead of ""appropriate"" If you use the word ""acceptable,"" it doesn't imply anything as to the future I wonder what a reading of the Congressional history of the Humphrey-Hawkins [legislation] would suggest There used to be the idea that if the targets were changed, the Congress would be notified that the targets were changed We have never utilized that, but I recall that as being characteristic of the Humphrey-Hawkins--  Well, your speech in Toronto was interpreted by some--  We have had commentary from both the House and the Senate on the summer Humphrey-Hawkins [report], haven't we? And the House specifically recommended that we not But the Senate I think--  That, it seems to me, would follow the procedure  These are on the two reports I have copies; I'm sure all Board members have  Yes  How about that!  December 17  END OF MEETING  -40-     "
2887,1985-12-16," Are they mostly deposits, Sam?  How much of each?  The answer, for the record, is No, we are not monetizing the Federal debt I move to ratify  [Unintelligible]  I was just going to refer to chart 2 here too, Dave, which is the lagged relationship It certainly doesn't look very good Indeed, it looks to me as if these last four quarters have been just about as bad as it can get if one assumes that the only reason we follow M1 is for its predictive relationship to GNP Did you try other kinds of lags and more complicated lags or anything like that in your effort to make sense of this?  Interest rates, yes  You're multiplying through by the velocity?  I would just attack one thing I must say that I'm bothered about this business of making a shift from turnover to something related to GNP because of the fact that we have so many debits related not to GNP but to financial transactions And it seems to me that that's an unsolvable problem  I rather prefer the interest rate differential approach It would measure the degree of liquidity, you might say, in the mind's eye of the public in looking at the various aspects--I suppose partly because you wouldn't have that difficulty It would be a straight reading of the interest rate differentials and the weight  I see your point, yes  They have been terrible indicators for the past year  If you compare [it with] credit growth?  The point though, Paul, is that M3 doesn't tell us anything either  They were in the zero growth area; you put in all that has been growing  And what kind of a range  What did you mean by that comment that it ""will eventually come""?  It would be an effort to capture a larger share of the business of the transactor  I think the range ought to be 2 to 12 percent and [unintelligible] if it's any good  But velocity can drop  I got [the 12] by adding 5 + 7  NOW accounts could get pretty popular  That is the thing, Paul The public seems to buy the concept that credit growth could be as much as 12 percent a year I think that we have had around 12 percent, the top end of the range, for each year at a time when obviously nominal GNP has been much less than 12 percent And infinitely extended that would mean an infinite debt burden But nobody seems to comment about that rapid growth in credit; they seem to accept that  Should have done it a year ago!  Commodity price people are close to the gold people  Well, of course, the same complaint can be made of nominal GNP that Bob made about prices How do you get there? It used to be that you could get nominal GNP by changing interest rates  How about a range for GNP?  But the main thing, Jim, that has happened since the last meeting is the increase in financial asset values, which is pretty big  You would include that in the forecast as a positive element but with a considerably muted weight, is that right?  A quarter of a percent?  Yes, I know that a lot of them are not possessed directly by households; they're in pensions and--  Jim, I understand there's going to be quite a full-scale revision on the GNP around the end of the year or early next year  So, we're in fact going to be dealing with different numbers next year Now, that includes a rebasing that changes relative weights, doesn't it? My question to you would be, since it will be an issue, I believe What kind of hazard would the changes in weights and all that goes with rebasing present for the Committee in making a projection?  It gives oil a lower weight?  Because the physical flow of oil has not done as much as other things?  I see So you get less deflation because it is based on '82 than you would by remaining with '72 Somebody told me that they thought it was going to moderate the growth rate throughout the period for some technical reason  You'd think that would raise the growth rate  But my understanding is that the whole effect would be a moderated growth rate  I don't know I understand that it has to do with the rebasing, fundamentally  Well, the price changes mainly have been in livestock  Prompt accommodational?  I think it's extraordinarily difficult to have a forecast of the economy at this time I could see the economy being stronger or weaker than the staff projection I really don't have any idea how it is going to turn out In a situation like that, I think it's best to look at the forces--as Frank did and as Jerry talked about--without line-by-line projections, to see which way these various forces are moving I am very impressed by two assumptions One is that the decline in the dollar that we have had, which seems to be extremely satisfactory, has to be for the good as 1986 goes on I don't want to put a number on it, as you just did, because I think it's awfully hard to say We have so little experience to [help us] know what responses in buying patterns will occur with changes in the exchange rate And I am impressed by Pres' comment that there is a more bellicose attitude in the foreign trade [arena] by us and others  -40-    12/16-17/85  than there has been before, so that in fact we might not get the full effect [of the dollar decline] But it is certainly to the good Also, both the decline in long-term interest rates and the rise in stock prices, which I never really dreamed would occur in the last month, are desirable outcomes from the standpoint of increasing confidence and reducing to some degree the debt service burden that's involved in our very, very heavy debt load So, those are both quite favorable developments; I agree with Frank on that  I think there is a heaviness in the economy that is probably due to uncertainty and the fact that it's getting to be a pretty old expansion now and there is not much momentum that anybody can see in plant and equipment that would carry this expansion any appreciable degree upward in the period to come And there is this housing situation, which I think is quite extraordinary I really thought last month's housing start number was the right number and that the previous number had been too low Now, with November, we are back where we were with the previous number Something is apparently going on there that is making that sector less responsive to changes in interest rates than it historically has been I also think that regardless of whether we get tax reform or not next year there is going to be a letdown in the economy, because I believe a lot of things have gone on--particularly in the second half of this year--in anticipation of some tax action next year, which won't be worth the candle once we get beyond 1985 So, whether or not there is tax reform, the incentive to spend or to speed up spending commitments in the hopes of getting out of the increased taxation has already occurred and there will be a letdown I conclude, as I did last time, pretty much as Ed Boehne did that it doesn't look like very much growth in the economy next year I am not sure whether it's 1 or 2 or possibly 3 percent, but it doesn't look like very much So, any erring should be on the side of ease, I think, in order to try to encourage a little more expansion in the economy if we can get it I am particularly impressed that there hasn't been that much movement in short rates as the whole rest of the structure has adjusted downward So I think it is probably time to [lend] a little helping hand and go on down a notch in short-term rates  No, ""A"" without a discount rate change, or ""B"" with one  Zero?  You don't measure output properly in trade and services  It's typically done, isn't it, Pres?  I'd be prepared to talk about it, Si  Is ""B plus"" toward ""A""?  Toward ""A""  Well, I hadn't wanted to take any lead in this because it's you people who will suffer the consequences  I indicated before that my preference would be to ease up a little in terms of a somewhat lower level of short rates I think we do have a window of opportunity There is a good deal of expectation that this will happen in the market I think the budget balancing bill--I doubt too that it's going to materialize as a serious move--but it gives a basis or reasoning that I think even foreigners could understand And so--  Well, it might happen After all, this is the most serious effort that has been made in a great many years to move consistently toward a balanced budget And I think it will have a psychological effect so far as new programs are concerned  I suspect that there will be great difficulties with it It is something that has occurred; it has been very much in the press and I think it gives us an opportunity I also agree that it has been helpful to have a decline in long rates and that we probably will not hold the decline in long rates unless there is some move in short rates to help bolster what has occurred So my preference would be for some easing I think it's proper, as a number of you have done, to talk about this in the absence of a discount rate change because this is not a meeting in which the discount rate is considered I can appreciate that there would have to be some negotiations and consultations and so forth with other parties abroad  -56-    12/16-17/85  to see how everything would coordinate if that were to occur So I would think that the best way to go, if the Committee wishes to move somewhat toward ease, would be--as Emmett and Gary suggested--between alternative A and alternative B with maybe $300 to $400 million in borrowing, which would be enough to begin to move the federal funds rate down Now, I had expected that the federal funds rate was going to move down this last time between meetings I thought that, other things equal, that is what we had rather agreed to do It didn't move, at least enough so anybody could notice it in the market But now I think it could move down 20 to 25 basis points without much trouble; and that could be consistent with either a 1/4 point cut or 1/2 point cut in the discount rate when the time comes to consider that It would sort of set the stage for where I would have liked to have seen the meeting come out today  Yes, we're talking about a level of long rates that goes back to 1979  Emmett thinks they're clear Well, I don't want to--  Yes, I think it could use a little help  Hopefully, the second one is Japan They certainly ought to move their rates down  The Pacific  Do you expect that to bring the funds rate--of course this is a very difficult period with the funds rate--  Do you agree that $350 million sounds like 7-3/4 percent?  Do we give December-to-March or November-to- March [figures]?  That's not as clear  -61-    12/16-17/85  ""Particularly in the absence of any change in the discount rate""? It seems a little odd  Why didn't you do it?  I really think, Mr Chairman, the better way to do it would be to go without it, and then adjust this if there is a discount rate, which we have done before  Actually, Roger, I don't think we're talking about anything quite that immediate Well, I think--  And it even becomes a part of the same minutes  And we are going to say ""this action is expected to be consistent with"" targets--  If we just say growth, it doesn't have to specify the amount for M2 and M3 ""This action is expected to be consistent with growth in M1, M2 and M3"" Forget any number  6 to 7 percent is a little thin, isn't it, considering the differences in these projections?  I don't see any great harm in that It's an acceptable range M1, I guess, [may be] about 9 percent  It's hard to get [M1] down to 6 to 8 percent I feel that anything could happen Right now, the staff is expecting a large December  I really think that phrase ought to be at the end of the sentence, Paul  ""The Committee expectsalthough it recognizes that there has been unusual volatility and uncertainty in the behavior of M1"" Just because the first one says ""consistent with that action"" in the second one, where it started out with a parenthetical phrase, I think we say what we would expect  ""M1 behavior continues to be subject to unusual uncertainty but may grow in a range of 7 to 9 percent--"" The half is--well, 7 to 10 percent is a lot better than 7 to 9-1/2 percent, but 10 percent is a high number and if it says may grow in a range of 7 to 9 percent we get--  You would say ""may not""?  It's important to say M1 behavior is subject to unusual uncertainty  Instead of ""has been subject to"" why don't we make it ""continues to be subject to""? [Unintelligible]  -66-    12/16-17/85  We must still be affected by the domestic business situation  Conditions in domestic and international credit markets also may have more operational significance  If there's a collapse someplace that would probably affect us  We would still have them in there; we just take out the phrase ""taking account of""  Yes, I think it does It puts them on an equal plane  The difference is the perception  I would rather not  Take a show of hands  And leave the funds rate at 6 to 10 percent [Unintelligible]  And hope the funds rate will come down "
