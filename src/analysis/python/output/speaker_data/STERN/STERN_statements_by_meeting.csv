49,1987-08-18," We have already touched on this, but have you done some analysis of the impact of higher energy prices on the acceleration in inflation we have seen so far this year?   Well, I am considerably more comfortable with the Greenbook forecast at this meeting than I was in July, because it seems to me that the thrust of the latest statistics on the economy, with the revisions, serves to bolster the underpinnings and credibility of that forecast, at least in my mind I think the revisions are important, as well, in this story because I think they help to put things in a more consistent picture Throughout the expansion, it seems to me, we've had consistently strong increases in employment and we were seeing weaker increases than I would have expected in GNP and so forth; and at least in my mind, some of that gap has been reduced I think we are looking at an economy that really has been performing rather well  That's certainly consistent with what's going on in the Ninth District I have talked before about the two-tier economy and the divergence between what's happening in the urban areas, which are doing well, and the rural areas But the latest developments suggest that that gap has diminished; that is, the rural economies are doing better, in part because agriculture is doing better, and in part because other aspects of the natural resource industries that the rural area of the Ninth District depends on are doing better And that's encouraging I might also comment on the fact that I've received a number of unsolicited reports from businessmen in the District about increased interest in export opportunities--that is, potential foreign customers coming to them to explore the possibilities of sales abroad of various products This is everything from the high-tech end of the world to some very basic commodities Again, I think that's consistent with what we have seen happening in the economy recently and what our forecasts suggest  I do think that, with all that good news, we probably are approaching a critical point when it comes to inflationary pressures As Mike indicated, I think you can attribute much of the acceleration in the broad price indexes so far this year to the effects of higher  -17-    8/18/87  energy prices But I think that looking forward, we have a number of things on the horizon that give me some pause even if energy prices level off or maybe even come down a bit from here One is clearly what we're seeing in the bond market here and elsewhere around the world, where there are some signs of heightened inflationary expectations that manifest themselves in long-term rates Secondly, I guess I'm not confident at all that in fiscal 1988 we'll achieve a Federal budget deficit significantly below this year's level In fact, it could could be higher, if we're not a bit lucky And, finally, as far as the labor market goes, I don't know what the natural rate of unemployment is, but whatever it is, we certainly have to be a lot closer to it today than we have been recently And not surprisingly, if you look at unemployment by various demographic groups, as you would expect, we are at the lowest rates of unemployment in general since 1980 and, in some cases, since 1977 For some groups you have to go back to 1977, at least using quarterly average data, to find unemployment rates that low I think we have benefitted heretofore from the rigidities in the wage determination process with which we are all familiar; I'm not talking just about what goes on with unions, but just the way business is run But I don't think that we can count on those rigidities in that wage determination process always working in our favor, particularly if price indexes start to move up here "
50,1987-08-18," It seems to me, if anything, that is certainly too open-ended the way it is currently written   Well, as I suggested earlier, I think that the principal risk we are likely to face, over time, is higher inflation The key question in my mind is one of timing I don't have the sense that the inflation problem is a fait accompli On the other hand, I don't think we can afford to sit back and wait until it is obvious, for reasons mentioned earlier about the cost of undoing it once it is in place Balancing those two considerations, I am not prepared to go as far as alternative C, but I do view something between ""B"" and ""C"" as perhaps a positive, helpful, preemptive strike at this point in time That entails, in my judgment, relatively little risk to the economic outlook; also, if it turns out that we were wrong, it would not be terribly difficult to undo And from that perspective, I think it merits consideration as well   Right around there, yes   I agree with Wayne, in part because when this directive is published it would seem to me to be an awkward time to  -32-    8/18/87  have downplayed the dollar if the dollar continues to do what it has been doing the last three or four days I don't think you gain much   Take it out "
103,1987-09-22," On the other side of that coin, and at the risk of some overstatement, I had the impression that the discount rate change was received with a combination of indifference and resignation more than anything else Could you comment on that? "
104,1987-09-22," With regard to our view of the economy and conditions in the District, I think what we are seeing is quite consistent with something like the Greenbook forecast In general, economic conditions in the District are quite good and have been improving consistently for some time The only areas I hear any reservations about have to do with residential construction, where reports have tended to be mediocre, and with loan demand, where bankers say there is no demand to speak of Labor markets have tightened up a good deal, again, in general; but what is striking in that regard is that there is not any discernible increase in the rate at which salaries and wages are rising as yet Apparently, at this point, people are just taking the strategy of not filling jobs or filling them more slowly than they otherwise would in this environment With regard to your question about interest rates and so forth, I guess I would not have a definitive answer either, but I would start with the dollar It seems to me that we sometimes talk as if all declines in the dollar are equal I don't start with that position It seems to me that it matters a heck of a lot why the dollar is falling For example, if we had fiscal policy in a position where budget deficits were declining in a sustainable way over time, I might predict that real interest rates were going to decline sustainably and, therefore, the dollar might decline in that environment I would say that would be fine; but I don't think that characterizes the current situation at all I think we are in a situation where, in fact, the adjustment is unlikely to come through fiscal policy Therefore, particularly in light of the June and July trade numbers, there are a lot of market participants who seem to feel the adjustment is going to have to come through other policy steps in this country I think this is kind of what Mike and Ted Truman were talking about earlier--if you are going to get continued improvement in trade, that requires higher real rates here to damp residential construction, nonresidential construction, and so forth Alternatively, of course, we may at some point get into the situation where we are not prepared for rates to rise in that fashion so that we sort of arrest the improvement in trade; that is, we get stronger domestic demand and stall the improvement in the trade balance I think that's the kind of box we are in as long as we have the fiscal policy outlook that we have That situation seems to me to be discouraging, as it has been for quite some time "
105,1987-09-22," I would favor ""B"" as you specified it, including the $600 million borrowing target And I think I would have at least a mild preference for retaining the current asymmetry in the directive for two reasons One is, as you have pointed out, we really can't find concrete signs of acceleration of inflation in the price or wage data yet And that, it seems to me, gives us an opportunity to do perhaps a little better on the inflation side than the Greenbook suggests--to lower inflation next year, if we are a bit careful here; and I think that asymmetry in the directive would help on that score Also, as I think about the near-term outlook--the next six weeks or so--it seems to me the risks are still likely to be in terms of dollar weakness, or some disruptions in the bond market that produce higher long-term rates [associated with] signs of tightening labor markets and growing concerns about acceleration of inflation down the road The asymmetric directive positions us better should that materialize, and, as I said, that's more likely to be the risk in the very short run   I doubt that we would see it in the wage or price data in that time horizon   Right And people's attitudes about what is unfolding "
163,1987-11-03," Responses in our District to what has happened in the financial markets have been all over the lot Of course, people have been preoccupied with the baseball season until recently!   I am sure the staff can prepare a memo! Initially, there was a lot of concern coming from the financial community; that seems to have diminished There have been some scattered reports of postponement of purchases of big-ticket items but  -19-    11/3/87  first of all, it seems to me, that is to be expected Second, I would reiterate the word ""scattered"" because it by no means is universal at this juncture One of our contacts who is pretty well plugged into the retail picture--not just locally but nationally--reported that his company opened six new stores the day of the collapse of stock prices and business in all of them was terrific   Well, I'm sure they highly promoted the openings; on the other hand, these were all in new communities for them He also had been to a national retailers' trade convention and reported when he came back that, basically, people were reasonably confident about the Christmas season Again, though, I think you would have to make a distinction between those people selling big ticket items and those selling more normal kinds of goods I think his statement pertains particularly to the people who are selling the broad-based, moderately priced, kinds of consumer goods We have heard some more generalized comments about people reassessing their capital spending plans for 1988 I guess that's the one thing I would point to at this juncture  With regard to the national economic outlook, I certainly support the general tenor of the Greenbook forecast although I guess my own view, and the one that comes out of our forecasting model, is that the economy will grow more slowly pretty much throughout 1988 than indicated in the Greenbook and, of course, more slowly than we had thought previously I think the major difference is in capital spending and, for what it's worth, that does seem to be consistent with the view that people are reassessing their capital spending intentions and will probably do some postponing At the risk of perhaps going beyond courageous to foolhardy, we did run the model out through 1989 to see what it produced While originally I thought that was maybe just an ill-advised exercise, in fact, it produced some reassuring results It showed a resumption of growth pretty close to 3 percent and a continuation of moderate inflation I would not put a lot of emphasis on all this, obviously, but it seems kind of consistent, if you think that what is going to happen is some postponement of expenditures in 1988 That ought to suggest that 1989 could be a reasonably good year, assuming we don't get further large down [unintelligible] in things here So for what it's worth, I simply report those results   I have lots of time to revise "
164,1987-11-03," Given all the uncertainties and everything, what do you have for the forecast of aggregate growth for the first quarter or two of next year You seem to have a sharp, or at least what I would call a significant, slowing late this year I'm just curious about what you have   I am happy to get on the ""B"" band wagon, or some variant of the ""B"" band wagon, I guess It seems to me that that is the appropriate posture for us at the moment In my mind, we have moved a significant degree already, and I think the results generally have been satisfactory One danger that I think we want to avoid here is what I might call oversteering; and I think holding with something like ""B"" is a step towards avoiding that reaction I think Frank Morris has posed a dilemma How do we keep weakness in the dollar, if it persists, from spilling into the bond market? I bring up that subject just as a reminder that I think the most logical way to get out of that trap is to actually succeed in doing something meaningful in fiscal policy here But that's still a very much unresolved matter   But that's another reason why I would--   No we don't; we probably don't have any But I think that's another reason not to oversteer or overreact at the moment We don't know how that is going to play out and we don't have much influence on it I would prefer some language like Variant I just because, as Tom [Melzer] and some others have suggested, these  -36-    11/3/87  are extraordinary circumstances and I think our language should reflect that I guess I'm not all that concerned about exactly how we fine tune that language at the moment I would pick something like ""B"" as a starting point, and I personally would prefer asymmetric language in favor of lesser restraint because it seems to me that it is highly more likely, as we go forward here, that if we are going to move at all that is the direction we are likely to want to go   No, I didn't say I would resist declines in the dollar; I just said that I think the outcome may be largely out of our hands   In my mind, it's something like a $400 million borrowing target with the expectation that the federal funds rate will be 6-3/4 or 6-7/8 percent or thereabouts "
215,1988-03-29," Well, if I wasn't confused before this discussion, I guess I would be now I don't know that I have very much to add In thinking about the structure of the Bluebook, I guess I'm persuaded that focusing on a borrowing target and focusing on the funds rate basically come out to the same thing When you read about the policy options [in the Bluebook] they give both the borrowing levels and the interest rate they're consistent with You can honestly do it either way Presumably, they pop out of the same kinds of equations Having said that, I think one of the major reasons this discussion has come up once again is the more fundamental problem that we're all aware of--and we've agonized over for several years now-- which is the breakdown of the money/GNP relationship Without that, we probably wouldn't be going through all this, because we'd be in a more comfortable situation of being able to focus on M1, M2, or something else, and just proceed along those lines  Having said all that, I guess I do have a preference for continuing to operate the way we were prior to October 19th--which I don't think is very far from the way we've been operating the last few weeks either--simply because I think that, on the margin, there is some value to going through the reserve side of the thought process  -27-    3/29/88  There's an awful lot of volatility out there, and a lot of shocks that hit the financial world and the real economy, and so on and so forth And it seems to me that we're best advised to try to incorporate as many of those things as possible "
216,1988-03-29," As far as the economy of the District is concerned, the expansion is continuing at a modest pace, and is reasonably broad-based by now I, too, have heard a few scattered reports about double ordering, and I don't think there is any question that, at least at current exchange rates, a lot of businesses in our District certainly can compete with foreign producers and foreign products  As far as the national outlook is concerned, I have changed my forecast pretty much as the staff has changed theirs in the Greenbook I have been surprised by the tenor of the incoming data on the national economy, which is generally better than I had expected I think that does call for revising up the near-term forecast What it says about the longer-term prospect for real growth, I am not altogether sure, but it makes me marginally more confident about the outlook As several people already have commented, the really striking feature about the outlook--both the one presented in the Greenbook and the one that we have developed [at our Bank]--is the acceleration of inflation that seems to be in prospect Obviously, there is a lot of uncertainty surrounding that, as there always is And the acceleration is not dramatic, but I certainly find it troubling I think that perhaps that is the key aspect at this point "
240,1988-05-17," With regard to policy, I think the timing question is a very difficult one, as you suggested The markets-- certainly the stock market and maybe the bond market as well--probably are vulnerable if we move too far too fast On the other hand, they're vulnerable if we delay too long I don't know what the precise, perfect timing for this kind of action is What I think about is our longer-term goal and the point I tried to make earlier that whatever is likely to happen on the wage and price side, it doesn't seem to me that there's going to be any deceleration next year    5/17/88 -5-  unless we act I think it is time for some further action, and I would be in favor of your second alternative, which is to go $100 million now, with an asymmetric directive, and expect that that probably will not be a big shock to the markets In fact, depending on circumstances, it could be welcomed And then what happens after that depends on the data that come in   That's not saying a lot!   I have some considerable sympathy for this proposal, but I don't think we ought to ask too much of it, in the sense that I don't think it's going to accomplish something that is always going to have us do the right thing But the merit I see in it, relative to current procedures, is that it does put the monetary aggregates back into the policy process--in my judgment, in a more meaningful way I think it adds some automaticity to our response relative to the current process, at least at the extremes, and I think that's important Maybe that's the same thing The third point I would make is that, under some circumstances, I think it will make us less reactive and more anticipatory And for those reasons, I think that this, at the least, merits a more serious consideration "
290,1988-08-16," With regard to the national economy, a point that the staff commented on and that I would emphasize is that it seems the surprises this year really have been almost uniformly on the upside The incoming statistics seem to continue to indicate strength, as I read them, and it seems to me that we have used up capacity more quickly than we had anticipated  As I look at the District economy, both the measures of economic performance and the anecdotes I'm hearing suggest to me that surprises may continue on the upside for some time longer I commented last time that, at least in many of the diversified economies of our District, we had boom or close to boom conditions, and that's continuing in those economies The one really new piece of information that I picked up in the last several weeks that I wasn't hearing much about earlier--and allowing for all the caveats such as I don't know what the seasonal factors are and the sample is small and so forth--is that I have heard from a wide range of manufacturers about their ability to raise prices now 4 or 5 percent In some cases this is the first price increase in 2 or 3 years But they are now putting them in place And some have commented that this is now the first increase; they plan on another one later in the fall So for what that's worth, I think I've started to hear a lot more, not about concerns about inflation, but about actual price increases "
291,1988-08-16," I think this is a version of Governor Angell's question But what has been the historic performance of the M2 model or equation recently? Has it been tracking reasonably well?   Well, I find it a close call between whether we tighten further now or whether we wait for a while I think your suggestion about asymmetric language resolves that as far as I'm concerned, so that the specifications of ""B"" with asymmetric language look okay to me I do think it probably pays here to take a little pause at least, and assess the results of our actions to date, given the uncertainties associated with any forecast and errors that go with these things as well Along those same lines, I would admit that I take some comfort anyway in the slowing in M2 and the prospective slowing in M2 if Don's forecasts are in the ballpark I would not be at all troubled if that in fact materializes, or even materializes a little more pronouncedly than Don envisions I think that will help keep us on the right course "
341,1988-09-20," Mike, a few minutes ago you alluded to inventories as a possibility of adding a little bit to the downside But I have the impression that your inventory path is really pretty conservative Is that a fair characterization?   Another problem for the Federal Reserve   There's very little new to report on the District economy I'll try to dispense with that very quickly As I've commented before, most of the District economy is and remains very strong The obvious exception is the areas affected adversely by the drought; otherwise, the economy in the District is in good shape  As far as the national outlook is concerned, I find myself in substantial agreement with the Greenbook forecast I don't know how much of a further rise in interest rates might be required to stem building inflationary pressures, perhaps not very much, but I think the Greenbook does appropriately identify where the risks are  As I look at the latest statistics, I think they do suggest some slowing in the pace of expansion in the last month or two--a  -17-    9/20/88  slowing that, as several people have already commented, is welcomed, in my judgment But I find that there's maybe a little tendency to exaggerate this Even though I wouldn't try to construe the August labor market report as very strong, it's still a 200,000 increase in payroll employment--2-1/2 million workers at an annual rate--which is not a trivial increase in employment at all, especially given the tightness in labor markets that already exists And, as I already suggested, inventory/sales ratios look, if anything, on the low side to me So I think we may see more strength, at least in the near term, coming out of inventories than the Greenbook forecast anticipates "
342,1988-09-20, I support the recommendation 
405,1988-11-01," Well, like many, I guess I found this to be a valuable and stimulating paper In a way it formalizes a bit some of the back of the envelope kinds of calculations that a lot of us go through from time to time But a reservation that I do have about it all is that this is a rather specialized model with lots of special restrictions in it at least implicitly If one runs some more general models and tries to identify a significant impact of M2 on prices, it can be very, very hard to find that And so I'm a little at a loss at this stage to know exactly what to make of these results in a policy sense or in a more general sense I have some sympathy with them and I would like to think that M2 is important and significant and can be a valuable guide; but I must say I think we may have here only the tip of the iceberg as far as some of the evidence that we ought to be considering is concerned   Yes, I would accept that as far as the longer run is concerned "
406,1988-11-01," With regard to the national economy and the Greenbook forecast and the [unintelligible] that are underlying that, it seems to me that the risk of falling considerably short of what's in the Greenbook is low And I think Mike Prell outlined a number of points with which I agree that account for that Orders backlogs remain substantial; inventories remain relatively low I do think there will be further improvement over time in the trade situation And I would add to that that I don't know how much fiscal restraint is assumed in the Greenbook, but I must say I'm a little concerned about the course of fiscal policy and the [impact of] Gramm-Rudman and so forth as we go forward So, as I look at that particular forecast I don't see a lot of conditional downside risk aside from the possibility of some exogenous shock I don't know if the economy is going to do a lot better than that; I'm not saying that, but I don't see that there's a lot of risk in it I think that kind of forecast as several people have commented is welcome, in part because I think we are in for a period of rather modest growth in the labor force because of demographics and other factors We probably shouldn't get too enthusiastic about what we might do on the productivity side, and so I think that does limit things from the production or supply side of the equation  As far as the District economy is concerned in this environment, the District economy continues to perform very well There are a few pockets where the drought has had a significant and adverse effect on agriculture But as I've commented before, in the large diversified metropolitan areas, the District economy has been quite strong for some time And one thing that's now very, very clear as far as much of the rest of the rural part of the District is concerned, is that the paper and forest products industry and the mining industry are sufficiently large and are expanding sufficiently strongly that they are taking the rest of the rural economy up with them And so in this District at least a substantial economic expansion is continuing "
407,1988-11-01, I support your recommendation and would only add that I think Governor Angell makes some valid points about the value of the language in the directive But it does seem to me that asymmetric language remains appropriate at this juncture as I gauge the risks 
461,1989-03-28," Peter, you may already have answered this indirectly, but in view of the widely recognized problems in the relationship between borrowings and interest rates I wonder if some market participants believe now that we're targeting the funds rate?   I said rates; you said borrowings   Getting back to a rate   Okay "
462,1989-03-28," With regard first to the District economy, in general things remain in good shape and there haven't been any major surprises or new developments that are worth reporting, with a couple of exceptions On the side of real activity the one surprise that I've noticed is that nonresidential construction activity is certainly stronger than I would have expected at this point Major projects continue to be announced and initiated in the Twin Cities and the way things are shaping up it looks like that's going to keep that sector reasonably strong early into the next decade Labor markets generally remain tight and sectors that had been expanding are continuing to expand Having said that, I do have the sense from talking to a variety of business people that the rate of expansion has eased a bit And it's very clear to me that in the last several months, at least, business people are once again noticing interest rates Interest rates have become a topic of conversation whereas as recently as perhaps four or five months ago that subject hardly, if ever, came up But that's now back on the agenda Another subject where the tone of the anecdotal information seems to have changed is cost increases In the past a lot of business people would tell you about the cost increases that they were experiencing and the difficulties they were having in passing those cost increases through They will admit now that they're having less difficulty moving those cost increases through They hardly, if ever, complain any longer about the difficulty in doing so  As far as the national outlook is concerned, I have little to add I think there are some signs that we may be approaching a soft landing, at least as far as real growth is concerned I wouldn't want to exaggerate those signs, given that January was probably boosted by very favorable weather and some backing off in February was almost inevitable We do run an unfettered model forecast; it's a wholly unfettered [vector] auto-regressive model And for what that's worth, that does not have a recession in it It has continued real growth in '89 and '90, and it has that at modest rates And, at least as far as consumer prices are concerned, it has somewhat more rapid inflation than the Greenbook "
463,1989-03-28," Well, Si Keehn and Bob Parry have already pretty much emphasized what I would want to point out That is, I'm afraid that market participants believe we are targeting the federal funds rate closely at this juncture So, while I favor ""B"" I think it's important, as we pause in the process of tightening here, that we make sure we pause at the right place and don't give the market a signal that we are in some sense backing off That's all I would add "
525,1989-05-16," Sam, given this significant increase, are the pressures, looking out a bit, still for a further rise in the dollar? Or are there some ongoing worries about a precipitous decline in the dollar and so forth? "
526,1989-05-16," Is that what you have in here--a further increase in interest rates of about 65 or 75 basis points late in the year or something?   I, too, like most of what I see at the moment To review the District economy briefly in the rural areas we have had for some time now, and it's continuing, an expansion led by recovery in copper and iron ore mining, specialty mining, strength in the forest products and the pulp paper business--strength limited mainly at the moment by environmental concerns and some shortages of raw materials The agricultural situation is shaping up in a very positive way, at least at the moment, because moisture in most of the District has been pretty good And people are optimistic about the upcoming tourist season With regard to the diversified metropolitan areas, those economies have been strong for a long time and generally remain so There have been some layoffs in some of the high-tech areas but those economies seem to absorb that pretty readily There is concern about the pace of automobile sales That's maybe the one major new element on that side of things There are also, though, labor shortages; both skilled and unskilled labor has been tight for some time What I'm picking up now is growing concern about the militancy of both organized and so-called disorganized labor There  -26-    5/16/89  is some concern about that translating into further wage pressures; businessmen seem to be divided at the moment as to whether they will be able to pass those wage and cost increases through fully or not  With regard to the national economy, our model forecast differs in many particulars with the Board staff's but the overall picture isn't very different at all It looks to me like things are unfolding about as well as we could hope for at the moment Having said that, I do think the risks have changed since we last met But I wouldn't want to exaggerate that One of the things we routinely do with our model is calculate the probability of recession, conventionally defined, going out the next 7 or 8 quarters While that probability has gone up a bit recently it hasn't gone up very much; it's not far from where it has been most of the last two years So, I take that to mean that things have shifted a bit but not a great deal "
527,1989-05-16," I support your basic recommendation, Mr Chairman It seems to me that this is a good time to go to the symmetric language, both to recognize the change that has occurred in the circumstances but also because I have a hunch that--as a practical matter both for our own internal purposes and from the perspective of market participants--the nuances involved in asymmetry and so forth are not likely to matter a lot People know the general structure of this directive and they know that they're looking at the same incoming information we're looking at They know pretty much where we are  -44-    5/16/89  And I think this is a good time simply to remove the asymmetry and let the evidence tell the tale "
585,1989-08-22," Mike, you made a passing reference to fiscal policy What difference, if any, would it make to the forecast if you had CBO's spending number rather than yours? It's about a $36 billion difference but--   Well, Mr Chairman, there's really little new to report on the District economy at this point It seems to be performing much like the national economy, as best as I can judge; that is, it's performing reasonably well but it is not uniformly strong at this point We have had some reports that things in the labor market have changed a bit in the sense that it's a little easier to find and retain workers On the other hand, there are some signs of growing labor militancy, although in general wages or even broader compensation matters are not the issues; it's really other things having to do with union shops and so forth I have had a couple of business people mention to me--I presume tongue in cheek--that they would like to see the unemployment rate go up  As far as the national economy is concerned, I think the changes to the Greenbook forecast relative to the view of the last meeting are in the right direction, but they are probably too modest My own view is that we're going to get somewhat more real growth and somewhat lower inflation than the Greenbook suggested this time I must admit I've been struck by what I've been hearing about the continued lack of build-up in wage and compensation pressures and by what I've been hearing about materials prices Clearly, a lot of business people have reported that materials prices have leveled off or have been declining and aren't the problem they were earlier So, allowing for the possibility, of course, that further data revisions may change what is rather a nice picture, it seems to me that things are going almost unbelievably well "
586,1989-08-22," I too support ""B"" It seems to me at this point that the risks are evenly and rather finely balanced It wouldn't surprise me if things went awry in one direction or the other, but I'd be hard pressed at this point to express a conviction about which way they might go Given that, I favor symmetric language I also favor it for another reason it seems to me that the modest growth in M2 in recent years, coupled with the performance of the dollar, has served us well That's the reason why I'm a bit more optimistic about the inflation outlook than some; and I wouldn't want to compromise that at this point For that reason as well I would favor symmetric language   Double ""A"" "
647,1989-10-03," My views have been deviating a bit from the Greenbook in recent months and the deviation has grown In terms of the economy, looking at the latest statistics and our own internal forecast and talking to business people around the District and elsewhere, I'm somewhat more optimistic about the outlook for real growth going forward It looks to me like the economy, all things considered, is in remarkably good shape And I expect that's going to continue On the price side, too, I'm more optimistic in the sense that I think we have an opportunity to make more progress against inflation than the Greenbook envisions I say that in part because of the course of monetary policy over the last 2-1/2 years, but also in part because business people I talk to are clearly reporting an abatement of inflationary pressures That has been going on for several months despite the fact that there are many tight labor markets in our District; that doesn't seem to have been translated into wage pressures I can only presume that concern about job security and the well known international environment--where foreign competition has been so very important--have served as restraining influences I must say, having given that optimistic assessment, that I hate to go back to an old and somewhat unhappy topic but I do think this is all jeopardized by the course of the dollar, should it continue to decline I think that would back up very quickly into deterioration in the inflationary situation and outlook and, ultimately, into the growth outlook as well So I think there are some very serious risks there "
648,1989-10-03," Well, I too favor alternative B I have a mild preference for symmetric language just against the circumstances in which we find ourselves There are indeed a lot of problems that might impinge upon us, but it seems to me that the best policy we can adopt, given all these potential problems, is to try to keep the economy on a relatively even keel And I think ""B"" accomplishes that I certainly wouldn't want to see M2 growth in the near term--by that I  -41-    10/3/89  mean the fourth quarter and going into next year--go above that associated with ""B"" I do think our credibility is very important and I think we have to be very careful about that matter "
703,1989-11-14," Well, comparing the District economy to the national economy, it looks to me like the District economy continues to do a bit better than the national economy Agriculture has had a pretty good year; residential construction has picked up a little recently; and mining and forest products and paper industries are all doing well--there's expansion underway in those, certainly in the  -17-    11/14/89  mining and the paper areas Tourism had a good year thus far and we're expecting a good winter season; employment gains have been small but the unemployment rates remain low pretty much throughout the District At the retail level, at least among the major retailers, they have had a good year and they're anticipating a good holiday season and are quite optimistic Where there has been softness recently is where we've seen it nationally, it seems to me, and that's in manufacturing One of the questions I've been asking myself is What are the implications of what we've been seeing in manufacturing nationwide? How much weight ought to be given to what's happening in the manufacturing sector? I think what we're seeing is at least a bit reminiscent of what happened in 1985 and 1986 In going back and looking at that period, manufacturing employment nationwide declined over those two years by about 600,000 workers For a period of time, at least, new orders for nondefense capital equipment were flat and purchasing managers' surveys showed some weakness While all that was going on the economy really turned in a pretty respectable performance Having said that, though, it was also a period when interest rates were coming down and money growth was accelerating But it seems to me that it tends to emphasize a couple of things of which we're always aware One is the uncertainty in looking at the outlook And the second is the caution required, because coming out of the 1985-86 period the real growth continued--if anything probably more strongly than many had expected--and there was some clear uptick in inflation and inflationary pressures at the same time So my reading of recent economic history suggests that the economy probably can weather some heavy seas at least in manufacturing It may require a response but it seems to me that we want to be cautious about the degree of that response "
704,1989-11-14," I would support your recommendation, Mr Chairman, of alternative B with asymmetric language There are only [a few] thoughts I would add to this Given the uncertainties about the near-term economic outlook, this may be a time to pay at least a bit more attention to the aggregates, to M2 Analytically that makes sense; also, M2 has responded in recent months more or less as expected and I think we can get some help there If I fully believed the staff's inflation forecast for 1990 and 1991, I would be very discouraged about what we're facing But the one thing I do conclude with that forecast is that I would be very worried about declines in the dollar from here on out "
767,1990-03-27," Well, I have a much narrower and less provocative question It has to do with profits We have seen this pressure on profits for quite some time now Is that pretty widely distributed across the economy or is it concentrated in a few sectors of manufacturing or where?   Thank you   With regard to the District economy, as been the case for quite some time now, there is very little new to report It's pretty much the same as the national economy that is, continued modest expansion is under way It seems likely to me to continue The major concerns of the District at the moment are the continuation of drought in some areas and prospective problems in the commercial real estate area But the latter is probably at least a year or two off just because of the level of activity that's currently under way  With regard to the national economy, I largely agree with the Greenbook forecast And as many people have already commented, as far as inflation is concerned that's unfortunate It confirms my view that we're simply stuck at around this 4-1/2 percent rate of inflation that we've had for quite some time With regard to the real economy, I don't disagree much with the Greenbook forecast I think we have to be careful not to overreact to the latest month or two worth of numbers We might find ourselves whipsawing policy and markets and so forth On the other hand, as the Greenbook observes and as our own exercise confirms, if one takes the January and February payroll employment number seriously we can easily get 3 percent real growth in the first quarter; and there is some possibility that those numbers are right If they are, and if that's telling us something not only about the immediate status of the economy but about its prospects, we might be looking at even more growth than the Greenbook suggests I  -26-    3/27/90  would fear in those circumstances that there may be even more inflation "
768,1990-03-27," Well, at the least we obviously have a difficult timing problem here But I find that I come out where you do We have seen that inflation is at least as stubborn, and maybe more stubborn, than many of us had expected; and that may require a tightening move But at the moment, at least, I don't have a sense of urgency about it I think, as Tom Melzer said earlier, it's probably low cost to wait until the next meeting; and indeed, if we get a lot of confirming evidence earlier than that, we always do have the opportunity to act if that would seem to be appropriate I don't want to whipsaw the economy or policy by moving now and then finding out through a series of data revisions and incoming information and so on and so forth that we overestimated some of the improvement Looking at inflation from a longer-run perspective, I don't know what it will take to start to bring it down Obviously, the scenario in the Greenbook doesn't suggest any progress in the next year or two But I think the best thing we can do under all these circumstances, as I've said before, is probably to see to it that M2 growth remains modest And I am encouraged at least about the near-term prospects there although unfortunately, as Don mentioned, it may be a little hard to read M2 as the quarter unfolds just because of the tax payment issue Assuming we get something like [the staff estimate], then we're on a rather sensible course and I prefer to wait a while longer and let some more evidence accumulate I have a mild preference for retaining a symmetric directive just because I think that maximizes flexibility I'm almost always in favor of that But for now it's a mild preference "
822,1990-05-15," The District economy looks largely like the national economy There are distinct pockets of great weakness, although overall I think it's probably continuing to perform, as it has for some time, a bit better than the national economy--whether you look at the overall growth of nonfarm employment or at specific industries that continue to perform very well, such as paper and forest products, mining, and tourism There are some other surprising bits of positive news that I'll just pass on One is that major retailers, at least in the District, continue to post very good results And home sales in the Twin Cities in the first quarter were running 15 percent above last year's first quarter and that had been a steady number month-by-month So, there have been some pretty good numbers there Also, the extent of the drought in the District has been narrowed as a consequence of some fairly heavy rains in March and April and so far in May And there's some [unintelligible] number of good reports not only of crop prospects but about capital spending in agriculture for this year  I might as well give you my two cents worth on the credit crunch We're certainly hearing a lot fewer and a lot lower volume of concerns from agriculture and small business than we were hearing a few years ago when the Farm Credit System was in distress and when there were serious problems in agriculture and so forth That's when we heard a lot about it I must say today, relative to that period, it's absolutely quiet for the most part out our way A major national developer that we're close to has reported difficulties--not his own but of competitors--in obtaining credit In fact, he has reported that on a couple of deals where he was not the low bidder and did not get the contract initially the low bidder couldn't get financing so he wound up with the contract In terms of economic activity, of course, there is no depressing effect The project is going to get done; it's just a question of who is getting the credit   And he's rather happy   Well, from the point of view of GNP you get a little more! As far as the national economy in concerned, I certainly agree with the underlying thrust of real growth as presented in the Greenbook On the inflation side, I take that message to heart as well Having said that, though, I must say that I don't have any anecdotal evidence suggesting that inflation pressures are building at the moment It seems to be pretty much the status quo And some business people at least are concerned that an effort to bring inflation down from 4 or 5 percent or wherever it is would be bad for their business because, of course, what they envision is that a recession would accompany it "
823,1990-05-15," Some people expressed the view prior to the coffee break that ""steady-as-you-go"" has served us tolerably well--at least so far--and I think that's true For the time being, I favor a continuation of that policy That would be ""B"" symmetric, in my judgment I do think, though, that it's a matter of timing I don't pretend to have any special insight about this, but it does seem to me that at best we can argue that the core rate of inflation remains stuck in the 4 to 5 percent neighborhood in which it has been for some time And at the same time, as I think Manley was describing, the  -29-    5/15/90  world more generally has become a somewhat more inflationary place Some of the European countries in particular have taken advantage of what's going on in Germany to stimulate their economies and so forth And I think that does raise the odds, as you expressed, that we are going to have to tighten at some point in the future if we're going to unstick inflation "
869,1990-08-21," Let me go back to the budget In looking at developments in Iraq and Kuwait and trying to understand the economic consequences of that in the forecast, the one thing that surprises me is that I, at least, don't catch anything on the military outlays and what that is likely to mean for the outlook   Well, as far as the District goes, it's more of the same Growth is unspectacular but it's steady We continue to do a bit better than the nation; of course, that's not a very remarkable statement these days But most of what has been happening in the District reflects a continuity of what has happened over the last several months Agriculture remains good; tourism has been good; most of the natural resource related industries are doing well; and the diversified metropolitan areas continue to do well, all things considered I would say that we're not likely in my District to continue to outperform the national economy much longer, but at the moment anyway things are still going a bit better than at the national level The run-up in oil prices as a result of Iraq and Kuwait occurred too late to stop the bikers from descending on Sturgis [unintelligible] So that turned out to be a successful event and injected a lot of income into the South Dakota economy  With regard to the national outlook, somebody used the word ""dilemma"" earlier and I think that captures it Even before the invasion of Kuwait, we were looking at slow growth and we were looking at that simultaneously with a lack of progress in bringing down inflation And it seems to me if that was the dilemma, it has only been sharpened by what has happened in the Middle East Obviously, I can't assess magnitudes, but I think it's fair to say the dilemma has  -21-    8/21/90  been sharpened My own judgment is that on top of all that--and one could probably point to some other things that have gone wrong--the likelihood of any progress on the budget has diminished as a consequence of this I would guess, although this is a double-edged sword, that we will see some kick to military spending before this is all said and done Now, that may help the real economy a bit, but I just have a sense that there's an awful lot of turmoil out there and that the dilemma, as I say, has worsened "
870,1990-08-21," Don, what do you project for M2 growth in the fourth quarter given something like the baseline assumption?  -34-    8/21/90   I support your position as well I think it's the right prescription for these circumstances There might be something to be said for a symmetric directive, in part because that's my usual preference and in part because of all the uncertainties and risks But I don't feel very strongly about that at the moment "
929,1990-10-02," Thank you, Mr Chairman For some time I have commented on reasonably good economic conditions in the District and I think by objective measures that is still the case The economy is continuing to expand at least modestly Of course, every generalization has holes in it and, as Si Keehn reported, farm implement sales clearly have leveled off--and they had been quite strong in the spring in our District Agricultural conditions in general are very good, but there are remaining pockets of drought, so there obviously are ongoing problems in those areas The construction sector has weakened in some locations Having said that, and having reported that I think by objective measures the District economy is expanding, like a lot of other people who have commented I think what has changed recently are attitudes, which clearly have deteriorated significantly There's a good deal of concern out there; we're even picking up some questions about the status of the large money center banks, which is a topic that doesn't come up very often in our District But there is some concern about that Attitudes clearly have worsened as a generalization, but there are exceptions I happened to be in a meeting with the treasurers of many of the corporations based in the Twin Cities and they almost universally reported business as strong Now, these companies tend to have very large international exposure, not just selling abroad but operating abroad So, they're not saying the US economy is strong per se But they are reporting that business for the most part is strong There were a couple of exceptions; but in general I was surprised by the tenor of their remarks and the comfort they seem to have, at least looking at their businesses worldwide  In regard to the national economic outlook, I don't disagree much with the Greenbook forecast Our own model has us avoiding a recession, although we have a continuation of three or four more quarters of very slightly positive real growth But we can also calculate probabilities of recession with the model, and clearly the probabilities have gone up relative to those calculated prior to the previous FOMC meeting I think that's just a statement of how the risks have shifted; that clearly argues that there are greater downside risks for the real economy Unfortunately, the inflation numbers, as Mike commented, also have been disappointing irrespective of food and energy prices And our model doesn't provide much comfort on the longer-term inflation outlook either So, I see risks sitting out there in both directions It's not a pleasant outlook to contemplate, obviously "
930,1990-10-02," I'd like to follow up on Lee's question In the M2 forecast for the fourth quarter, have you included anything for this flight to liquidity? Or is it based pretty much on the way you think velocity is deviating from--   Well, I have some sympathy with the concerns that have been expressed about the real economy Unfortunately, I have the impression that we're losing sight of the inflation situation as we do that As I said before, I think there are equivalent risks here In that environment, I would favor stability in policy And as I look at the alternatives, something like the growth of M2 that we would get under ""B"" would be acceptable to me I could even imagine going a bit beyond that--that is, trying to make sure that growth in M2 didn't fall below the 4 percent or so anticipated in ""B,"" which would then involve some slight easing But I have the sense here that we're talking about going beyond that for reasons that I don't find very compelling Those have to do with the composition of M2, and/or real estate problems that are long-term, and inventory problems that we certainly aren't going to solve with policy actions taken here today So, I must say that I'm uncomfortable with where we seem to be headed   I'd be willing to contemplate an asymmetric directive and even a 1/4 point move in the funds rate depending on what happens on Friday--the economic data, and how the aggregates are looking and so forth But I think I would want to stop there "
995,1990-11-13," Mike, do you make much of the divergence between the payroll and the household employment data? The household data have been quite a bit weaker for some time now and I'm wondering whether, as we come to understand the recent pattern of the economy better, that isn't telling us something   Thank you, Mr Chairman On the positive side, the District's economy, although spottier than it has been, remains in pretty good shape--especially in the rural areas because agriculture, as others have commented, had a good to very good year at least in most parts of our District And mining had a good year; indeed, they are talking about further expansion in that industry in a variety of states in the District and I would anticipate that they're going to go ahead with at least some of those plans Retailers, as best I can judge, are cautious but not particularly pessimistic at this point, at least about holiday sales  Having said all that, I think the pattern of activity for the national economy for the near term, as reflected in the Greenbook with a couple quarters of contraction, is a reasonable forecast I have a very distinct sense, based on a variety of anecdotal evidence, that the weakness we're seeing isn't particularly related to the energy situation, although obviously that's a factor At least as I get the story, it's really a combination of factors, some of which were in place before oil prices ran up Clearly, the credit availability issue has grown in importance as time has gone on And I have the sense that what we are seeing is not particularly driven by energy, but by a combination of negative factors, some of which have affected attitudes and some of which simply have cut into important sectors or regions of the economy "
996,1990-11-13, I support it as well 
1051,1990-12-18," Thank you, Mr Chairman There's not a lot of additional news to be said about the District economy; there hasn't been a lot of change I will comment on a couple of things that have come up recently In talking to some of the large firms in the Twin Cities, a good number of them had a very good 1990, particularly those that have some substantial foreign exposure or are major exporters Despite that, they almost universally have a good deal of concern about 1991, particularly domestically, of course One of the reactions that seems to be occurring is that they are stretching out their salary programs That is, they're going to go ahead in January with the normal kind of salary programs that they've had in previous years but are telling employees that those increases will last for 15 to 18 months That's something that I, at least, hadn't come across until recently, and I think it is clearly because of their concerns about the economy and business conditions in 1991 With regard to holiday sales in the District, I'm not hearing much in the way of euphoria nor terrible gloom So, I assume that things are rather mediocre and that's about all that can be said about it  With regard to the national economic outlook, I generally agree with the shape of the economic performance as expressed in the Greenbook, although I will admit that I'm less confident that the upturn is going to occur quite as quickly as envisioned in that document There are a number of intangibles to worry about at this juncture, it seems to me And I think, as Dick Syron suggested, the  -12-    12/18/90  major wild card is real estate values I just feel instinctively that if those values continue to come down substantially and if that becomes more pervasive around the country than it has heretofore, that has to have a bigger effect on the economy "
1052,1990-12-18," I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman "
1111,1991-03-26," Well, with regard to the District economy, I think we are basically beset by the same crosscurrents that are affecting the nation and that many people have discussed The market and the economy remain quite soft but the anecdotal information clearly has a much better tone encompassing housing and autos and retail activity; people at least are feeling a good deal better and traffic is up In part because of the improvement in attitudes and the change of the tenor of the anecdotes, I am comfortable with the Greenbook forecast for real activity this time And it is also this time very consistent with the pattern that our model produces, and our model is very different in structure That does raise an interesting timing question, though Even if the economy picks up promptly in April--or maybe it already has picked up--we won't see that in the hard data on aggregate activity until May or June as those numbers start to flow through Given that we obviously would want to see some consistent evidence of improvement, it really suggests that it won't be until sometime this summer that we will recognize whether or not the Greenbook forecast is turning out to be accurate I don't know what the implication of that is except that it seems to me that we might want to be even more cautious than usual in terms of responding to information as it becomes available over the next month or two  On inflation, obviously, we were concerned too about what looked like a significant acceleration of core inflation; and I'm always a little suspicious about special one-time factors that one can parcel it out to But we did run some tests to try to find out about the energy prices, assuming that the run-up in energy prices in the summer and fall may have boosted core inflation temporarily as they worked their way through the economy The tests suggested that that was in fact the case   Yes And as the subsequent decline in energy prices starts to work its way back through, it seems to me we ought to be looking at better core inflation numbers rather promptly "
1112,1991-03-26," I strongly support your proposal I think it's important that we go to a symmetric directive at this point, in part because I have an ongoing bias in favor of that largely to let evidence accumulate before we act But in these circumstances, as I suggested earlier, I think we do want to maintain a sense of balance and a perspective as we go forward here And I think the symmetric directive is appropriate "
1156,1991-05-14," Is there something unusual in what we're seeing in personal income?   Mr Chairman, I would continue to characterize conditions in the District as mixed, but overall not bad Agriculture is looking pretty good The key word there, as usual, is moisture, and in much of the District it now appears to be adequate this year The livestock sector is really doing very well, as it has over the past several years as well In the paper industry and the forest products industry, again, conditions are mixed There is a lot of excess capacity at the moment in paper and even more coming on [stream], but the profits aren't there But that's a business where they tend to run at capacity almost no matter what, and they're still running at capacity, at least in our District The wood products business has come back a bit, and that's probably a consequence of an inventory cycle and maybe some optimism about the outlook for homebuilding Clearly, housing sales have picked up substantially, certainly in the Twin Cities It's my understanding that not only are houses selling but they are selling at pretty close to asking prices without any fancy financing so far as I can tell On retail sales, once again I haven't heard any horror stories Some people say business is tough and some say it's satisfactory, and that seems to be about the way that has been holding Only one state in the District has a significant budget problem with which they have not yet come to grips I don't know at this juncture what the pieces of that resolution might turn out to be  With regard to the national outlook, I'm pretty comfortable with the Greenbook forecast I also think, as several people have commented, that it pays to reflect on the risks a bit at this juncture The risks are probably symmetric in the sense that while a recovery by midyear is likely, I do think we're going to need to see a good deal more consumer spending In that regard, I have been under the impression, and Mike confirmed it, that perhaps disposable income has been somewhat weaker than I would have expected throughout this contraction, and that is certainly a source of concern in my mind On the other hand, as to the risks on the inflation side, I find the recent data encouraging and most of the anecdotal reports I'm getting encouraging as well But I must say I'm not persuaded yet that we have nailed down a significant reduction in the core rate of inflation I'm a little puzzled as to why the bond market has not responded at this juncture, not just to the inflation news but to the overall picture of what is happening domestically and abroad And I wonder if we don't have to be a little sensitive to that   No, I don't find that an adequate explanation "
1208,1991-08-20," Well, with regard to the national economy, I do think the incoming data taken together are consistent with a modest recovery of the type described in the Greenbook I would add that I'm also a bit more encouraged about our prospects for disinflation as suggested in the Greenbook as well  There's not much going on in the District that would make me doubt this general kind of forecast--I suppose that's not the most positive way to put it--except for some signs of strain and disappointment in some businesses that may have thought the recovery was going to be a little stronger than it has to date But if you look at the other data, nonfarm employment in the District is up    8/20/91  relative to a year ago and the agricultural sector outside of the dairy industry is in pretty good shape So, things seem to be continuing to move along reasonably well Having said that, as many have already commented, there are reasons to be concerned nevertheless Some comments have already been made about commercial real estate We know we had a drop there and values are in the process of adjusting But it seems to me that the spillover there is perhaps even greater than I, at least, had anticipated--not only for the financial sector and creditors in general, but for state and local governments on the revenue side And those governments are already stressed So, we're getting some restraint there in addition to all the other factors that we can talk about And assuming nothing terribly unusual comes out of the situation in Russia, we're getting some restraint from the Federal budget as well So, when I add all that up and couple it with the weakness in M2, I think there are reasons to be concerned as to whether this is going to play out in quite the positive way that the Greenbook would suggest "
1209,1991-08-20," I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman It seems to me that whatever the explanation for M2 may be--and I don't know that we'll ever have a fully satisfactory one--this is not the time to let it either fall below the target path or deviate very significantly from its performance over the last four years or so So, I think we should pay some attention to it And we probably should go with the language in version II, giving M2 somewhat greater prominence in these circumstances, which I think is appropriate  -38-    8/20/91 "
1259,1991-10-01," At the national level, as has been the case for some time, I find myself quite comfortable with the Greenbook forecast The latest readings on the economy and its prospects suggest that a modest recovery is underway and I think it's likely to continue I would add that I'm also more confident than I have been for some time that we are finally going to see some progress in bringing down the core rate of inflation over the next year or two So, from that perspective, the outlook to me looks reasonably satisfactory  -15-    10/1/91  In the District, recent meetings that I've held have had a surprisingly positive tone But I think that's because they've been very District-specific By that I mean that they focused mainly on agriculture, which for the most part is having a good year; on tourism, which has had a good year; on residential construction, which in parts of the District at least is doing surprisingly well; and on retail sales, which have been boosted substantially by Canadian shoppers apparently flooding across the border and stimulating activity all across the northern tier So, from those perspectives, things really look quite positive On the other hand, if I talk to business people whose businesses are more diverse geographically and who do business nationally and internationally, attitudes really are terrible I've been trying to understand why, without a lot of success, because I don't think the aggregate data that we look at are as bad as the attitudes would suggest Part of the explanation may be that business people simply expect, and indeed want, stronger and more rapid improvement in activity than they are experiencing Part of it may be the pricing situation; my general impression is that it would be very difficult these days really to get any kind of price increases at all And that may be affecting them, of course, both directly and through the profit side of the business "
1260,1991-10-01," ""B"" asymmetric "
1311,1991-11-05," Yes, a couple of things, Mike I have the impression that one of the things that may be going on here is a lack of pent-up demand relative to previous recoveries, particularly in autos and in housing, in part because of the strength of the '80s Is there anything to that?   Autos   My second question Do you have a reaction to the report on the news last night and in The Wall Street Journal today about expected downward revisions in the payroll data?   Thank you   Thank you, Mr Chairman In the District, there is really little new to report; recent trends are continuing In the rural areas, activity remains fairly decent and attitudes are okay, I think, at least compared to what I encounter in the Twin Cities where, as I've reported before, attitudes are quite bad Of course, that's because there is a different mix of businesses both in terms of their diversification and their scope of operations And they pick up a lot of bad news from their other operations both domestically and internationally The Twin Cities situation is really rather interesting Unemployment in the Cities remains in the neighborhood of 4-1/2 percent as the computer industry [unintelligible] The problem with that was that the medical technology business has exploded, so the adjustment has all occurred without a great deal of dislocation But despite that, attitudes among the business community --or the preponderance of the business community that I have encountered--are quite negative And the Twin Cities do account for a good bulk of the nonfarm economic activity in the District In the Twin Cities we have come up with a couple of new forms, though not altogether new forms, of economic stimulus One is hosting major sporting events We still have the Super Bowl and the Final Four to go But in addition, more recently we have snow removal And that looks as if it's going to be affecting the economy for some time!  On the national outlook, I continue to think that a modest recovery is certainly the most likely outcome I have a suspicion that we might do marginally better than the latest Greenbook forecast But I think the real developments on the national level are on the inflation front or the disinflation front I've become increasingly optimistic that we really are making progress there The balance of the latest statistical evidence certainly suggests that, but I've also become more and more impressed by the anecdotal evidence that I get It's very hard to find any evidence of price pressures and wage pressures to speak of, at least among the people I've talked to That has been going on for a while and it has now gone on long enough that I think it really is significant There is, of course, some ongoing carping about health care costs and about the cost of [meeting] various regulations, but there's nothing new in all that And I don't have any sense that that situation is getting worse So, I do think there is clearly a positive development on that side "
1312,1991-11-05," I find these unusually difficult circumstances, but on balance I come out in agreement with you It's not that I think a 1/4 point reduction in the funds rate, whether or not it's accompanied by a discount rate reduction, is going to do a lot quickly and directly for consumer confidence or [business confidence] or jump- start the economy And we know more about jumper cables and jump- starts in Minneapolis than most! But my expectations would be more modest I am concerned about the slow growth of M2, not so much in a strictly monetarist context but in the sense that going into this year I at least was looking for continuity in policy, not a sharp departure in M2 growth from what we experienced in the previous four years I think continuity is still a virtue I don't believe such a move at this point would weaken our credibility In fact, it might enhance our credibility and I think it's the responsible thing to do at this time And I don't think it would interfere with wringing out the excesses of the 1980s, a process which has to continue if we're going to restore economic health "
1370,1991-12-17," Thank you, Mr Chairman As has been the case for some time now, District business activity is mediocre It really hasn't weakened much--and we seem to have been insulated from some of the major problems around--but it isn't all that strong either Unemployment remains uniformly low in the District; attitudes, nevertheless, are quite negative There are some positive signs, for what it's worth It really is true that you can't find a parking  -13-    12/17/91  space in the shopping malls on the weekends Retailers are quick to point out that people are looking for bargains and not buying as much as they used to, and so forth But we'll see if that plays out All I can tell you is that there's a lot of traffic The auto dealers report that sales are bad but traffic in the showrooms has picked up Perhaps people are looking for bargains or perhaps they're getting ready to buy something sooner or later In any event, there's at least a glimmer of hope there Sectors that have been in pretty good shape for some time include tourism, agriculture, and the retailers who are reachable from Canada Those areas of the economy continue to move along as they have been moving and really are quite healthy  With regard to the national situation, I agree with the comments that have already been made and, as the Greenbook forecast is currently depicting, that the risks are probably symmetric I was puzzling for a long time as to why attitudes, particularly business attitudes, are as bad as they are, given that the aggregate data don't look that bad But it seems to me that the aggregate data are starting to catch up with the attitudes, and that's reconciling that difference at least in my mind But what I would emphasize at this point is a comment that Mike Prell made earlier, which is that disinflation is in train And I think that's something that we can look forward to Anecdotally, it's very hard to find much in the way of price pressures I was struck by a meeting we had at the Bank recently during which a lot of private-sector employers in the Twin Cities reported [that they expect] wage increases of about 3 percent for the year ahead Of course, benefits are rising more rapidly than that, but 3 percent is the kind of number we haven't heard in the Twin Cities in quite some time There's a lot of concern looking to the future about aggregate demand; but we've been looking at supply, recognizing that that's somewhat of an artificial distinction But it looks to us at least as if the 1980s were characterized by unusually rapid growth in labor force participation and unusually large increases in hours worked If that is not repeated in the 1990s, and it doesn't seem likely, then the supply side of the economy's ability to grow seems to me to be constrained unless we get real improvement in productivity--which, of course, is possible, but hard to bank on-- or unless we believe that when the aggregate demand comes back the gaps are going to be made up by imports So, we may be looking at a situation where not only is aggregate demand likely to be subdued, but the growth in productive capacity may be as well "
1371,1991-12-17," I, too, support your recommendation The only thing I would add at this point is that, while it's certainly understandable that there's some frustration around the table in terms of the results we've achieved to date--at least in terms of the real economy and its tendency to fall below expectations--I think we should resist the temptation to try to do something more dramatic and more heroic I believe the course we have been on has been the right one and I think we ought to continue with that As many people have already commented, a lot of the problems we face are structural and are not amenable to changes in monetary policy And I think, as you suggested, that we are not very far from where we want to be in any event So, I'm comfortable with your recommendation "
1425,1992-03-31," Mike, would you elaborate a bit on this issue of pent-up demand that you mentioned in passing with regard to the consumer spending situation?   With regard to the national economy first, Mr Chairman, I'm struck by how much better the readings on the national economy are relative to what we were seeing as recently as three months ago and relative to what we expected to see I think the Greenbook has the appropriate response to this I personally am pretty cautious A quite modest recovery by historic standards is still what I think we're most likely to get, and that's what is reflected in the Greenbook So, I'm comfortable with that outlook But the probability of achieving something like that looks to me to be a good deal higher than we might have expected just a few months ago  At the District level, we've seen modest improvement for some time That seems to be continuing Attitudes have improved I  -19-    3/31/92  wouldn't say that they're positive necessarily, but the gloom seems to have lifted And the expansion seems to be reasonably broadly based It's evident in housing, of course, retail sales, agriculture, and tourism, so that the District seems to me to be consistent with the national picture as well "
1426,1992-03-31," Well, I certainly prefer alternative B, and I have a mild preference for symmetric language mainly because that's my usual preference I rather like the thought of just letting the evidence come in and analyzing it as the period unfolds And I think we have plenty of flexibility and have reacted quickly even with symmetric directives, but I don't feel all that strongly about it I don't know that I understand what is going on with M2 either, but I won't let that stop me from making a few comments! I think it's a little premature to get too worked up about it For one thing, I don't know what Don's numbers are precisely, but for the December through March period it looks as if M2 still grew at least as fast as we had expected at the last meeting or two So, while it bounces around a lot month to month, it's still coming in more or less as expected or a bit on the high side I'm not sure we're going to learn much more in April and May if the tax payments and so forth [distort] the data as they have in the past from time to time Finally--and I think you touched upon this in a way--if our objective is to achieve price stability, then I've been of the view for a long time that we want M2 growth at about the midpoint of its range or somewhat lower over a sustained period of time if we're going to get to price stability And that's certainly what I have in mind "
1479,1992-05-19," With regard to the District, the modest but steady progress that has been in place for quite some time continues, and I won't go into details except that there are a few concerns around One is in agriculture where, of course, this time of year moisture is always the major uncertainty, and that is the issue in some parts of the District Beyond that, there is some concern in the timber industry where environmental issues are limiting activity, and we've seen some marginal mining operations go out of business But otherwise the District economy is in pretty good shape, I think Attitudes are also in pretty good shape  -16-    5/19/92  With regard to the national economy, my views do not differ from most that have been expressed so far As Mike Prell indicated, if anything, we've done at least as well or better really than we thought we would over the last couple of quarters That [improvement] does seem in my judgment to be continuing; I'm referring to the real side, and I don't see any reason at this juncture for renewed or additional concern in terms of real activity The disappointment, to the extent there has been some, has been on the inflation side, at least as measured by consumer prices or the employment cost index In talking to business people in the District, for the most part they continue to describe a very competitive environment and they don't give any impression that it's easy to raise prices or pass along cost increases or whatever But it's a little hard to know in light of all the data whether they simply mean by all this that they can live with 3 or 4 percent inflation and thus that's what they mean by a very competitive environment It's just hard to know what they have in mind as they describe that situation  With regard to commercial real estate, the situation is quite mixed as best I can judge it I have heard of some renewed activity in the construction of warehouse and manufacturing space; it's not a lot, but there do seem to be some signs of life there With regard to office space, one of our directors, with whom you're familiar, has been ""bottom fishing"" in terms of buying office space in various parts of the country for a couple of years now He also has bought some raw land in some locations I think he feels quite positive and comfortable about this On the other hand, I do come across investors and developers who tell me it's still difficult to find financing They're not talking about financing just for new projects but to refinance or to purchase existing buildings; although when I express a counter view and basically describe what one of our directors has done, a number of people will admit that they've been doing that too It leads me to believe that perhaps there is a little more activity around than we might appreciate, but perhaps it's a little subterranean Olympia and York has not been a topic of conversation in the Ninth District, but we have our own interesting situation The so-called Mall of America, a mega mall, is nearing completion The first part of it is supposed to open in August and now that it's too late there is growing concern about how successful it is going to be So, we'll just await developments "
1480,1992-05-19," What's the sample period, Don, over which you estimate your standard model?   Well, following on your last comment, Mr Chairman, I too favor ""B,"" symmetric In part, I think we have to be careful not to respond to what we already know--the sense that we continue to look at a modest recovery by historic standards Presumably, that's what we expect We continue to expect for the next six weeks anyway to look at pretty sluggish M2 expansion; that's what the Bluebook expects at least If that isn't acceptable, we ought to want to change policy With regard to M2, since I didn't weigh in earlier, I might try to muddy the waters a little further right now Governor Lindsey's point about the volatility of M2 velocity in the short run is undoubtedly correct I recall that we ran some simulations several years ago that said that if we really wanted to apply fairly rigorous confidence intervals to the annual M2 targets, then the ranges shouldn't be 3 or 4 percentage points wide; they really had to be 6 to 8 percentage points wide if we wanted to be reasonably confident of achieving them That tells you that there's a lot of short-run volatility in velocity As to whether M2 is going to or has to bounce back at some point, I must admit I'm getting increasingly skeptical I think we may need to devote a little more time to that question and the role of that aggregate If I think about what has transpired recently and what is different, it seems to me that customers of depository institutions today--customers broadly defined--clearly face a wider range of choices than they did certainly 10 or 20 years ago, the time encompassed in the estimation period of these models Clearly, banks and other institutions face a much wider range of choices when it comes to pricing and other policies than they did 10 or 20 years ago And we're also operating for the most part in a lower interest rate environment than we have over a sustained period of time Maybe we have to go back to the '60s to find something like this, at least for short rates So, as I think about all that, it's not clear to me that there's going to be some automatic correction in M2 or indeed that a correction in M2 is desirable in these circumstances A lot has changed   Right "
1534,1992-08-18," Dave, while we're on this What is your estimate of potential growth in the economy these days and how do you parcel that out?   Thank you, Mr Chairman With regard to the District economy, I don't detect any underlying change in activity; I think it's still expanding quite modestly There really isn't a lot of additional information to add to that I might comment on a couple of recent developments to flesh that out a bit I reported before on very strong sales along the northern tier of the District to Canadians coming across the border That currently is in the process of slowing down, apparently because the Canadians are making it more onerous to get back into Canada with everything that one has purchased But that was due to change for one reason or another eventually, and it has There is a significant expansion in the paper industry under way again A couple of new plants have been approved and construction will start shortly if it hasn't already Finally, you've probably heard about the so-called ""mega mall"" that has opened up in the suburbs of the Twin Cities It actually opened about a week ago So far, it has exceeded expectations--at least the expectations of those of us whose expectations weren't too high I haven't been out there, but the press reports that traffic has occasionally exceeded 100,000 people a day There have been lines to get into the restaurants and some of the other entertainment venues and so forth Whether anybody is buying anything beyond that I don't know, but at least by some measures it's off to a positive start  With regard to the national economy, I'm certainly comfortable with the contours of the Greenbook forecast It's always difficult in a circumstance like this, when you try to do bottom-up forecasting and look at consumption and investment and so forth, to talk yourself into believing that any of these sectors is going to be very strong in this environment Yet my experience has been that just when I've talked myself into that, the economy surprises me on the high side I have a hunch that isn't going to happen this time Bob Black gave a pretty good litany of the problems that are restraining growth, and I think those are in place For what it's worth, my guess is that it will probably take longer for those to diminish than we might expect So, the general shape of the forecast portrayed in the Greenbook looks like a pretty good estimate to me The good news, of course, is that the price and cost statistics are starting to come in more in line with the anecdotal reports we've discussed around here for quite some time It seems to me that we've commented for quite some time that we have talked to a lot of business people and don't hear much about price or wage pressures and so forth and so on It took quite some time for that to show up in the statistics But now  -24-    8/18/92  it is at least starting to show up in a more convincing way, which suggests that we're making some progress in a principal and significant area "
1535,1992-08-18," I support your proposal for ""B"" asymmetric "
1577,1992-10-06," I'd like to go back to long-term interest rates one more time You put a lot of emphasis on their decline Is that-- I just don't remember--a sharply different view than you've had before?   In the District there has been a discernable but I would say small improvement in activity since the last meeting Consumer spending has improved a bit; residential construction and sales of residential units have picked up; forest products seem for the most part to be doing reasonably well, getting a little additional kick from the hurricane It has been a good year for tourism both from domestic and foreign tourists And unemployment rates in the District have continued for the most part to be well below the national average Agriculture is mixed, depending on the weather Perhaps the only real sign of weakness is in mining where some recent layoffs have occurred up on the iron range in northern Minnesota Despite this further improvement, I'd say attitudes remain uniformly cautious I wouldn't describe them as particularly discouraged, but people are cautious I don't think anybody is expecting a sharp change for the better in economic activity  I came across the same sort of concern about interest rates that Ed Boehne expressed earlier There does seem to be a view that  -27-    10/6/92  interest rates are going to go back up, perhaps significantly, at some point in the not too distant future I don't think it's tied to any expectations one way or the other about changes in monetary policy I don't think it's tied, at least not very directly, to expectations about an acceleration of inflation It may in some instances be tied to people's assessment of the budget But it's mostly that people, in their business experience, view rates as unusually low today and they don't believe that these rates are going to be sustained The analysis essentially stops there It's basically a judgment about what is typical  With regard to the national economy, we are all emphasizing the very weak and disappointing statistics that we've received over the last month or six weeks That is reflected in the forecast and I think that's fully understandable On the other hand, if you go beyond the latest statistics--and, of course, we can't do anything about them--and look at the financial variables, if anything they look a little better M2 growth has moved back into the positive range Bank credit and business loans at commercial banks seem to have picked up a bit and we hear some anecdotes about greater availability and more aggressive searching for customers on the part of bankers and others If we look at bank reserves or narrow money, we see very rapid growth, and I would say that this is something we need to keep an eye on as we go forward   In general, Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation and would only add a couple of thoughts First of all, in assessing the question of asymmetry and timing, I hope we cast a relatively broad net I am concerned about the foreign exchange markets On the one hand, we seem to believe that the dollar is lower than is sustainable but the presumption is that it's going to go lower still; and that doesn't seem to me to be an equilibrium, let me put it that way On top of that, as we weigh the desirability or necessity of additional interest rate cuts to sustain or further the recovery, I hope that we will bear in mind its consistency with our long-run objective for price stability And I must say that I don't quite understand what we would have gained by lowering the monetary aggregate targets and locking in more tightly on M2 in these circumstances There's certainly some information value in M2 but there's also a lot of uncertainty surrounding both its behavior and its implications for economic performance in the future, and I don't see how we would enhance our credibility by focusing on something with that degree of uncertainty associated with it "
1644,1992-11-17," I agree with what Ed just said, and I might elaborate a little It seems to me that there may be an organizing principle or continuum here; I don't know how far it gets us I  -55-    11/17/92  personally don't see any problem with a memorandum of discussion-- after all, these meetings are being held--and we used to do it But I do think there's a critical issue with regard to the process and how soon the memoranda are released Putting aside questions about what kind of protection we can get because of the Freedom of Information Act, it seems to me that we ought to be willing to release increasingly greater amounts of information with a longer lag The reason is, of course, that some things that are very sensitive at the moment may be considerably less sensitive or without consequence two, three, or more years down the road So, I personally don't see any problem with that If we go in the other direction, [looking at] the things we could release immediately, I think we do have to be more concerned about what's there Given that I feel an obligation to be forthcoming when we can be, I guess we should look at other ways--in terms of timeliness, in terms of content, or in terms of completeness --to enhance what we're doing to deal with some of the issues that are coming at us from the Congress "
1645,1992-11-17," Thank you, Mr Chairman In the District, things seem to have taken a distinct turn for the better I say ""seem to"" because that comment is based mostly on anecdotal reports I've picked up in the last month or two Those really have had a very positive tone I mention that, of course, against a background in which [economic activity in] the District probably has been advancing modestly throughout this period Objectively, if you look at employment, which has continued to grow, and unemployment rates, which are almost uniformly low in the District, I think the numbers suggest a reasonably decent economic performance The anecdotes are also for the most part on the positive side, although I should acknowledge a couple that are not It looks as if has serious financial problems; how much longer it's going to stay out of Chapter 11 remains to be seen As for nonresidential construction, major projects in the Twin Cities at least are about to come to a halt, I think But aside from that, the reports we get with regard to much of the agriculture in the District, housing starts and sales, retail sales so far, and tourism activity--which apparently is spilling over into Montana at least with an inrush of Hollywood types and even some Easterners--have been pretty healthy I must say that on Saturday afternoon I heard something I didn't expect to hear and haven't heard before--I'm sure you're all on the edge of your seats--about the latest progress of the Mall of America, our so-called mega mall On the radio on Saturday they were basically telling people to stay away because the crowds were so big!    11/17/92   Well, I don't know that the mall's developers are making any money--that's a different matter--but [sales] apparently are running well ahead of expectations Of course, the developers had to offer such attractive deals to get the stores in that I suspect they aren't seeing much of this But the numbers apparently are very good, and it's not particularly at the expense of the other major shopping centers in the Twin Cities, if you believe what you hear The people at the mall have done a very good job of promoting it; they're bringing groups in from all over, domestic as well as international, and that's apparently translating into real spending Help wanted signs are popping up everywhere; a lot of that is seasonal, of course, but it's not confined just to retailers and fast food operations where one would expect to see it And it is consistent with reports of tight labor market conditions in the Twin Cities and in other metropolitan areas in the District So at least at the moment, based on the latest anecdotal reports, things seem to be moving along  With regard to the national outlook, I have no real disagreement at all with the Greenbook forecast I don't have the sense at this juncture that the expansion is all that fragile, but I must say I don't have any particular sense that it's about to take off on the high side either Coupled with the headwinds discussions that we've had in the past and a close look at demographics and related factors, it may just be that this is going to be a prolonged period of slow growth relative to what we have experienced in most of the postwar period and perhaps relative to what we had earlier expected On the margin, I'm not sure there's a lot to be done about it "
1646,1992-11-17," With regard to the short run, I favor alternative B with a symmetric directive I don't see a case for a change in policy immediately or for biasing the directive one way or the other That still gives us lots of flexibility if the evidence comes in on one side or the other and a decision is made to move But to me the circumstances we currently confront suggest no immediate change  With regard to the long-run ranges, I have a slightly different take on that It's really the upper end of the M2 range that concerns me It concerns me because, given what we think we know about the outlook for nominal GDP and about the velocity of M2 over the next couple of years, that upper end of the range is clearly too high So, I would favor a new range of something like 2-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent I don't see any real need to reduce the lower end In fact, longer-run considerations, with trend growth in the economy of maybe 2 or 3 percent and assuming that M2 velocity ultimately returns to its stable, trendless state and price stability--whether inflation is actually zero or something above that given measurement problems and so forth or given what it takes to get expectations of inflation out of people's decisionmaking thoughts--suggest to me that we don't need to change the lower end of the range On the other hand, the upper end is too high, especially in an environment where I think we want to consolidate the gains we have made in bringing down the core rate of inflation and perhaps send a signal that that's our intent along the way here  With regard to timing, it's not an overwhelming preference, but I would agree with those who would prefer to do it now In February, as many have observed, there will be a lot of proposals out there and a lot of things on the agenda and we really could look like  -36-    11/17/92  we were snubbing, or worse, all sorts of proposals by deciding to lower the range at that point "
1697,1992-12-22," I have reported for some time that the District economy was expanding, and it is certainly continuing to do so The tone of the anecdotal evidence suggests that there has been some further distinct strengthening In fact, in some ways the anecdotes sound like what one would expect early in a recovery, which of course is not [the case for] this expansion chronologically In some of the sectors, though certainly not all, people are turning ebullient; I'm talking about housing, autos, and retail sales more generally Whether this is just a spike or something that is sustainable remains to be seen But clearly, in the District at the moment things are going better in terms of expansion and there is still virtually a total lack of inflationary pressures, at least according to the business contacts we have So, in most circumstances, things look quite positive  With regard to the national economy, I don't have any problems taking the Greenbook forecast as a base If I were looking for downside risks, I would point to the foreign situation Business contacts in the Twin Cities that do any amount of business in Europe or Japan have reported exceedingly negative results recently They suggest to me that those economies are far worse than I at least had understood them to be Whether that is a precursor of things to come is much more difficult to say But clearly, they report very bad conditions and, at least as far as their own businesses are concerned, they are not optimistic [about the outlook for exports] On the other hand, though, putting that one risk aside, I would not be at all surprised to see the national economy grow somewhat more rapidly than the Greenbook suggests My reading of history in the postwar period at least is that once the economy develops some momentum on the up side--and I think that may be in the process of occurring--we tend to be surprised both at its duration and, for a time, at its magnitude While the Greenbook forecast for the most part has a rather nice, steady 2-1/2 to 3 percent growth quarter-by-quarter, if momentum is really building here, I think for a time we will see more rapid growth than that  -15-    12/22/92 "
1698,1992-12-22," ""B"" symmetric "
1754,1993-03-23," Thank you, Mr Chairman Well, economic activity in the District continues on the more or less steady upward course it has been on for quite some time At a recent meeting somebody used the phrase ""silently successful"" to characterize the District and I think that's a pretty good phrase There doesn't seem to be any change in inflationary pressures so far as I can detect, but there are a couple of areas of spot labor shortages I referred to this a little the last time; I've picked up a few more indications of it It doesn't seem to be very pervasive at the moment but the fact that it exists at all has surprised me There has been almost no discussion of the Clinton program that I've detected, certainly in its broadest terms What people are mostly concerned about, as you might expect, is what it implies for either the military bases in the District or for the agricultural programs I get the sense that whether they like  -20-    3/23/93  the program or not, they're willing to accept it as long as they believe it's affecting the country more or less across the board What they're worried about are the differential impacts that might affect the region  With regard to the national economic outlook, I have no problems with the Greenbook forecast both for growth and for inflation What does concern me are some of the same issues that Bob Forrestal alluded to I don't know, obviously, where the Administration is really going to come out with regard to trade policy or health care or industrial policy as it pertains to the airlines or technology or whatever But it seems to me that those things all work in the direction of resource misallocation While I don't know that they are going to be very significant quantitatively, they certainly cut in the wrong direction both in terms of growth and in terms of inflation, assuming that the Administration doesn't just go ahead and support NAFTA or GATT And I'm worried that there are some things going on there that may not help the economy in the long run Having said that, there's a question about why interest rates have finally come down I think, as several people have commented, that it is due to more favorable expectations about future inflation; it's really a consequence of the conduct and prospects for both monetary and fiscal policy, given the way those things have evolved over the last 6 to 12 months And I do think the credibility of monetary policy has probably improved a bit I doubt that we could demonstrate that in any convincing way; that's just my sense of things And I think that has been a principal factor in the decline in rates "
1755,1993-03-23," I, too, support alternative B, symmetric language, and the alternative description of the monetary aggregates Like many others, after the discussion before the break I re-thought the price situation and went back to fundamentals a little, recognizing that we're probably not going to be very good at getting the timing precisely correct Most of these factors have been mentioned and I won't belabor all of them But it seems to me that [we are in] an environment where most of the other industrialized economies are either weak or contracting, where labor markets here are relatively soft, and where fiscal policy is probably going to give us at least some dose of restraint; that just doesn't strike me as an environment in which inflation is going to accelerate for any durable time I think we can certainly wait until at least May before acting "
1807,1993-05-18," I admit I don't understand the inflation numbers very well but, in thinking about the discussion on profit margins, maybe there is something there telling us about the degree of slack After all, those price increases seem to have stuck for whatever reason And maybe part of that has to do with the international situation Maybe foreign competition isn't as vigorous as it was earlier; certainly something of that [nature] must be what is going on in autos I would think  -12-    5/18/93   The economy of the District continues to improve There are some signs of life now in nonresidential construction A lot of it is public construction, but it looks like that sector is poised for a pretty good year in many parts of the District Consumer spending appears to be continuing to grow and business out at the Mega Mall has held up very well In agriculture, the livestock business is very healthy and very strong With regard to crops, there is the concern about moisture but, of course, it's always either too dry or  -22-    5/18/93  too wet This year apparently it's too wet but I have a hunch they'll still [be able to plant] most or all of their crop There are also some renewed signs of life in the energy business Exploration and leasing activity in western North Dakota and eastern Montana are starting to show some signs of life, and iron mining activity in northern Minnesota is expected to pick up as a consequence of the improvement we're seeing in the domestic steel industry  The one thing I might comment a little further on is what's happening to employment It's something that, of course, shows up in the data, so I think we're aware of it But I've heard a couple of comments lately that have put this very directly Employment is up in the District And yet if we talk to business people, they say they're clearly trying to do more--or at least the same--with less when it comes to employment Part of that has to do with fringe benefit costs, such as workers comp and insurance and health care Part of it, I think, is expectations in that businesses that used to think they were going to make at least some of their higher incomes over time through expansion are revising down their expansion plans That has to do in part with environmental restrictions and other regulations I think they're concluding that the way to improve profitability is through very tight cost containment, and they seem to be succeeding And that has affected employment, certainly in the District, and perhaps nationwide as well  With regard to the outlook for the national economy, my principal concern, as many have commented, is the inflation situation I am not as sanguine as the Greenbook that inflation is going to decelerate from here I certainly agree that a lot of the fundamentals we typically look at--slack in the economy, money and credit growth, and so on and so forth--don't seem to suggest an environment where inflation ought to be accelerating In fact, they suggest an environment where further deceleration is likely Yet I remember from the 1970s that we're always pretty good at explaining away inflation but those [situations] don't seem to have happy endings So, I'm very uncomfortable with what we're seeing and I'm not convinced that what is going on now is simply temporary and will self-correct "
1808,1993-05-18," In these circumstances I think we need at a minimum an asymmetric directive toward tightening A lot of the reasons for that have been covered and I won't belabor them But I would note that we have been shooting for further disinflation and indeed, ultimately, for price stability That is the long-run target that we have committed to, appropriately, and we seem to be drifting  -51-    5/18/93  away from it I don't think it's fatal if the drift goes on a little longer; and I admit that I don't know what the short run--the next month or two of data--may bring But it seems to me that we have to be very careful at this point because we're not getting the result we anticipated nor are we moving in the direction of our long-run objective So, at a minimum I think we need the asymmetric directive toward tightening "
1861,1993-08-17," Thank you, Mr Chairman As far as the regional economy is concerned, it remains reasonably healthy, which is the report I have been providing for quite some time now In general, construction is quite strong; retail sales are pretty good; manufacturing is mixed; tourism, at least in the western part of the District, has been strong We did run a special survey of about 100 bankers in the areas of the District affected by the floods I guess it's reassuring to report that they didn't have anything very startling to say in the sense that while crop losses in some cases are substantial, they are not expecting major spillover effects on economic activity   Yes, spillover I'm glad you picked up on that; I was waiting for somebody to do that They were not expecting major spillover effects in many other areas of economic activity And, of course, we may get a little subsequent stimulus down the road from rebuilding and so forth  With regard to the national economy, we have been debating whether this sort of ""slow motion"" recovery was going to accelerate and turn into more rapid growth; that debate is continuing at least internally But for the moment I have concluded, as I have in the past, that the Greenbook has it about right That is, I don't see the seeds of an acceleration in place So I think this very modest expansion at the national level is likely to continue and, therefore, I find myself in agreement with what I guess is the consensus As far as inflation is concerned, maybe in part because of the publicity surrounding the asymmetric directive and your testimony or whatever, a lot of people have gone out of their way recently to tell me that they aren't seeing any inflationary pressures in their businesses at all And some people have gone beyond that to report that they've tried to raise prices and haven't been able to make those increases stick That suggests to me that people are still learning They are willing to go out there and send letters to their customers that as of a certain date prices on certain lines are going up, and I guess what they tend to hear in response is that their customers will not accept these price increases and that they don't care what the underlying rationale may be So, I conclude that people are still learning about the state of the markets and their inability to make price increases last, and that probably [augurs] well for the longer run "
1862,1993-08-17," I think as a tactical matter this probably is the time to return to symmetry It strikes me that it would take some very surprising events to lead toward a change in the funds rate in the five weeks before the next meeting Having said that, I do have a couple of reservations about a return to symmetry, one of which already has been expressed And that is that when it becomes public, it may be subject to over-interpretation--not necessarily misinterpretation but a ""Now what are they up to or what do they see?"" kind of thing But also I'm a little troubled by the fact that we seem to be responding again to the latest price statistics Now, it's certainly true that they are better, but I have not heard anybody express a much more positive view about longer-run inflation The forecast for the balance of this year and for 1994 is pretty much what it has been for an extended period of time It seems to me that we really ought to be looking and thinking about that as we do this So, I would be careful about putting a lot of emphasis on the fact that the latest price data look better and that, therefore, we don't need the asymmetric directive "
1906,1993-09-21," In terms of economic conditions in the District, the trends and patterns remain generally positive as they have for quite some time There are some concerns with regard to agriculture because of the weather, of course There's the concern that all the shoes haven't dropped yet with regard to military bases and possible closures And there are some strikes under way in some of the taconite mines in northern Minnesota and the upper peninsula in Michigan But with those caveats, conditions really are pretty good Employment is up in all District states and we are getting renewed    9/23/93  reports of pretty tight labor market conditions in some of the major markets in the District That does not seem yet to have translated into demonstrable wage pressures, but we are hearing reports of difficulty in hiring--and these are above-minimum-wage type positions --and retaining workers  With regard to the national economy, I don't see much that's going to break us out of this pattern of moderate growth and moderate inflation that we've been in for quite some time I've been surprised--Ed Boehne raised this point--that there has been as much patience, or maybe less impatience than I would have expected, with regard to the performance of the economy over the past couple of years Maybe that's about to change, but so far it seems to me that there certainly has been less impatience than I expected And I guess the Committee at least implicitly seems to be patient or satisfied with both the pattern of growth and inflation that we've been getting "
1907,1993-09-21," Far be it for me to break the pattern ""B"" symmetric "
1970,1993-11-16," Well, as several other people have commented, I start from the position that we really have nothing to hide So in terms of what we release, I don't see a lot of danger, at least going back, aside from privacy considerations Going forward, of course, we get into the issues of the deliberative process and I'll comment on that, but in general I have favored Memoranda of Discussion In listening to the conversation this morning, I think what we're talking about in looking at the distinction between MODs versus lightly edited transcripts is really a question of quality I think the quality of the Memoranda of Discussion is going to be higher and, therefore, the documents are in some sense more useful [It's higher quality] versus the openness, or at least the appearance of [greater] openness, if we confine ourselves to lightly edited transcripts And I must say the more I look at that, the less the issue seems to be very clear to me So I can live with either alternative going back And I'd have no problem if we wanted also to provide the raw transcripts, again with the appropriate lags People who wanted to do that kind of comparison could then see what [editing] work was done Going forward, I think--   Well, five years or more as far as I'm concerned I think that's sort of a tactical question Going forward, again I started with a presumption in favor of Memoranda of Discussion, but I must say I don't feel the distinction between those and the lightly edited transcripts is all that great I have a mild preference for the Memorandum just because I think the quality of the document is higher  I don't think this is the right time, frankly, to change our procedures with regard to taping and transcripts In a way I think that would be self-defeating in the sense that while we're trying essentially to be more open, that would give the appearance at least that we were becoming less open [The elimination of taping and transcripts] may be worthy of consideration down the road, but at the moment I don't think that's the way to go And I do think, though we ought not try to resolve this today, that we should consider the  -28-    11/16/93  question once again of when we release the directive or the policy decision because, as I consider that issue, I don't think our current practices are necessarily optimal   Or more   First choice would be lightly edited and second choice would be raw transcripts with annotation   Five and three   MOD first; edited transcript second "
1971,1993-11-16," First with regard to the District, I've reported for a long that the District economy has been fundamentally sound, and that continues to be the case The one exception is the exception that has also been the case for some time now and that's the areas of agriculture that were affected by the flooding We did have a meeting in the Bank about a week or so ago with a group of business leaders from the Twin Cities representing a wide range of businesses I will comment on that briefly because they did hold some views with great conviction; they were very adamant about it Three themes emerged and I will just report to the Committee on those One was that they were pretty much of one mind that there is no inflationary pressure around whatsoever And they were quite vociferous about that Secondly, they were very concerned about the health care proposals, particularly from the point of view of what they meant for prospective employment and costs of employment I would say that they were almost universally negative about that Thirdly, while they agreed that in many respects the latest statistics on the aggregate economy and what they were seeing in at least some of their own businesses were more favorable--and maybe a good deal more favorable--than what we were seeing earlier in the year, they continue to think that the expansion is very fragile and could easily be disrupted The one exception to that was people in the real estate business, especially in residential but even to some extent in commercial Clearly, residential has had a very good year in the District, and commercial activity has started to show at least some signs of improvement But outside of those areas, I think it's fair to say that there was still a view that the expansion is quite fragile  With regard to the national economy and the economic outlook in the Greenbook, clearly this expansion has moved in fits and starts and it looks as if another start is under way But starts have been followed by periodic fits, and that's what the Greenbook seems to be envisioning again I don't know that I would take very strong exception to that but I do have some sense that maybe at this point the economy really is starting to build a little momentum And that, coupled with the anecdotes that we've been getting for quite some time about the lack of inflationary pressures, leads me to speculate at least that while we may get the same kind of path for nominal GDP in 1994 as envisioned in the Greenbook, we might have a somewhat more favorable split between real growth and inflation than is envisioned there I can't say that with any great conviction at this point but I do have a sense that it wouldn't take a lot for things to turn out that way But other than that, I don't have any sharp departures from the outlook as depicted in the Greenbook "
1972,1993-11-16," I favor ""B"" symmetric I have some sympathy for the issue of how we are going to know when the right time to deviate from this path is But we can't avoid that responsibility, and my best judgment is that this is not the time "
2039,1993-12-21," I can support your recommendation, although it seems to me that the real reason for doing this is that it will provide some comfort to our friends that we've gone ahead and taken this step toward openness I think your suggestion to have people from Mr Kanjorski's staff and Mr Leach's staff is a good one I'm wondering if it's possible to go even further In one of your letters you suggested that you did want to meet with Chairman Gonzalez or to testify, and I wonder if there's any way to tie that into this and get that done "
2040,1993-12-21," Thank you, Mr Chairman With regard to the economy of the Ninth District, there has been further improvement; that's a trend that has been under way for quite some time The stronger sectors appear to be consumer spending and residential construction And some people have even used the language that the District economy is ""strong"" And that's about as ebullient as they get in the cautious conservative area of the Upper Midwest  With regard to the national economy, I think the Greenbook forecast is reasonable Our internal forecast is not very different from that, although I recall that we did not forecast the significant slowing we saw in the first half of '93; and that gives me a little pause as we go into 1994 Having said that, and assuming that the general tenor of the Greenbook forecast or our forecast turns out to be accurate, I don't think it matters very much whether real growth  -18-    12/21/93  turns out to be a little more rapid or a little slower than is indicated in the Greenbook It seems to me the critical factor, as several people have commented, is what happens to inflation Neither the Greenbook forecast nor our internal forecast has any further deceleration of inflation in it and that certainly is a cause for concern On the other hand, if you listen to the anecdotal evidence-- at least out our way--it appears to be very, very difficult to raise prices, and people are not seeing much in the way of incoming price pressures either And the international situation and the slack available in foreign economies might also tend to make one a little more optimistic about the situation One other thought--and this is perhaps heretical, but nevertheless--many of us have accepted as kind of a working definition of price stability [that inflation is not a factor] in economic decisionmaking, and perhaps we're a little closer to that than we realize At least talking to some of the business people out our way, I certainly have to think that they are adjusting to the idea that price increases are simply going to be few and far between "
2041,1993-12-21," While I find it something of a close call, I don't think the evidence is persuasive that we should move now So I support your prescription Having said that, I do think that before too long we ought to try to come to grips with what we mean by effective price stability I also think we have an obligation to come to grips with some of the evidence in the work that Messrs Stockton and Beebe presented in terms of what are the empirical benefits of  -38-    12/21/93  further reducing inflation from modest levels I don't think we can gloss over that question with theory "
2103,1994-03-22, I agree with what Governor Kelley just said 
2104,1994-03-22," Our reports on the Ninth District have been positive for a long period of time now and nothing has really changed In fact, it appears that there has been a further step-up in activity pretty much across the board both by region and by sector Attitudes are positive; employment has continued to increase; expectations about 1994 for the most part are positive, and this is a continuation of what has been going on for quite some time If we are looking for negatives, one thing that has become more pronounced in recent months is that the phenomenon of Canadian shoppers coming across the border to spend their money has diminished, in part because of changes in the exchange rate and in part because of changes in Canadian policies that have made that more difficult and more expensive One other factor that is of some interest relates to housing activity We have had brisk sales for quite some time now and we are getting reports from realtors both in the major cities and in some of the smaller cities as well that the problem they face is a lack of supply of unsold homes That ought to augur well for construction going forward So the news in the District certainly remains positive and if anything has improved even further  With regard to the national economy, our model, although its structure is quite a bit different from the one that underpins the Greenbook forecast, produces a forecast that's really quite similar My own view is at least a little more optimistic about the pace of real growth, which is to say that I think we might do a little better than those two forecasts But I think the more salient features of the outlook have to do with the lack of disinflation, the lack of further progress in bringing the rate of inflation down both in our forecast and in the Greenbook forecast, given the monetary policy assumption  On this question of slack, we have done some analysis of the past several years that confirms my impression that the labor force at least for a time in the 1980s grew more rapidly than might have been expected Participation rates rose; the rate of increase in participation rates appeared to be above trend at least for some time That's not a situation that is, of course, sustainable forever, so it does not particularly surprise me that we are getting slower growth in participation rates now And if all of that holds together, I think it does tell us something about how much slack or how much capacity we can expect from the economy going forward If one wanted to be a little more optimistic about all of that, one would factor in the international situation because it does appear that there is a good deal more slack elsewhere in the world, certainly in the other industrial economies, than there appears to be here at the moment Despite all this and despite the strength in the regional economy, while there may be a minor increase in reports of greater wage or price pressures, there is nothing very broadly based or very  -27-    3/22/94  significant there yet, at least as far as the anecdotal information that we are picking up is concerned There may be a smattering of it but there is nothing that leads me to believe we have seen any significant change in that arena at this stage "
2105,1994-03-22," As most people have already stated, it certainly seems appropriate to act now How far we ought to go and how fast we ought to try to get there, are the difficult questions My best judgment is that we'll be at this for some time; it may well be that the funds rate has to go to 4 percent or more by the time we are done But I don't have a strong conviction about how far we will need to go As to the timing issue, it seems to me that we are probably going to be at this until we are either more confident than we are today that we have established an environment for renewed disinflation or until we actually see renewed disinflation It may surprise us and occur earlier or something else may happen that changes our view about appropriate policy But having said all that, I think we should bear in mind, and I'm certainly willing to be humble about all this, that the confidence interval around any forecast is very wide And I think that argues for caution So, I'm comfortable with your 1/4 point recommendation now I think that is the appropriate magnitude And I would prefer a symmetric directive with the understanding that if we need a conference call, we can have one "
2153,1994-05-17," Thank you, Mr Chairman The District economy continues to be very healthy The only exception to that is the energy sector, which of course is not very large in the District; otherwise, things continue to do very well I think people are becoming increasingly optimistic, and that's starting from, at this point, a fairly optimistic base A few anecdotes, some of which I've reported before, which I think are interesting and relevant I've heard a number of reports over the last several months about lean inventories, with the clear implication that people expect some attempt to step up production and build inventories over the next several months I would expect that to occur Continued reports about labor shortages, particularly of skilled labor in many markets, do not seem to have translated into a broad-based increase in wage pressures, although in the Twin Cities market it does appear that wage increases--this is from the panel that we work with in trying to plan our own compensation--turned out to be larger in 1993 than those that had been planned Exactly what was going on there I don't know, although we face a pretty tight labor market  On the banking side, there are reports of increases in loan demand and some preliminary indications that banks are starting to bid a little more aggressively for funds through small time deposits-- something we haven't seen for quite some time As far as pricing and price pressures go, it's very hard to find any broad-based indications of acceleration of inflation, but what I am hearing is that discounts are diminishing and the frequency of sales is diminishing It's very hard to quantify, but that does seem to be occurring  With regard to the national economy, I must say the logic of the Greenbook forecast does appeal to me It seems to me that the increase in interest rates, particularly in long rates, may work as that forecast envisions, that is, growth in real GDP will slow once again--whether it occurs in the third quarter or somewhat later remains to be seen That may succeed in stabilizing the rate of inflation about where it has been Although I must observe that in the last couple of expansions--coming out of the 1980-82 recession and the 1973-75 recession--once the economy built up momentum, those expansions seemed to go on longer and to be stronger than we, certainly, had anticipated Now, some of that may be the fact that,  -21-    5/17/94  of course, the momentum is not independent of the policies we pursued; and maybe we just reacted too late But at least a naive reading of those expansions suggests to me that once the economy starts to develop some momentum, that tends to go on for a while  Some numbers that I was looking at raise questions in my mind about what we might be able to say about the inflation outlook These numbers suggest, though I guess it's a little too early to even call this analysis, that the relationship between labor market conditions and the performance of wages or compensation seems to have deteriorated in the early 1980s--around 1983 and 1984--and hasn't been reestablished This suggests that we can't conclude very much from labor market conditions and what that might imply for wage pressures Similarly, there seems to be deterioration in the relationship between utilization rates and consumer prices that occurred about the same time I don't take much comfort from that; it raises uncertainty in my mind, if nothing else, about the price outlook, and it forces me to rely a little more on my intuition My instincts at this point are that the risks of inflation certainly are on the up side, particularly because we're not indifferent to errors in that direction In other words, we're not terribly concerned if we undershoot inflation We might be a lot more concerned if we overshoot "
2154,1994-05-17," I support the proposal in its entirety I am a little concerned--somebody mentioned this earlier--about the comments we get from time to time that we ought to take whatever actions we're going to take and then pause I don't think the statement gives the  -35-    5/17/94  impression that we're necessarily locking ourselves into that for any extended period of time I guess what I'm concerned about is a view in the markets now, and I don't know why it should arise now, that we are more clairvoyant than we are--that we somehow know where we're going and when we're going to stop And I think we ought to be careful and try not to convey that impression "
2206,1994-08-16," I have a couple of questions, Mike The first one has to do with the price forecast How much of that is empirical as opposed to judgment? I ask because some preliminary work we've done suggests that if you look at capacity measures versus measures of price or wage inflation, they look pretty good into the early 1980s but then the relationship seems to deteriorate rather significantly I'm curious what you see going on there   My second question--as I understand the forecast, you have long-term interest rates coming down next year, is that right? [Mr Prell Yes] How much precedent is there for a decline in long rates like that in circumstances where you have stable short- term rates and a continuing expansion? Obviously, we had some periods in the 1980s when long-term rates came down in the middle of the expansion but short-term rates were declining through at least some of that period as I recall So I'm trying to look for history and my memory isn't that good about all that   The Ninth District economy continues to be robust The strength remains broadly based whether you look at manufacturing, construction, natural resources, or to get the demand side, consumer spending and so forth Both the objective measures of activity and the anecdotal evidence, I think, are consistent with the kind of performance we saw in the national economy in the first half and suggest to me that we will see pretty good strength continuing in the second half of this year as well Jobs are plentiful in many, many areas both geographically and across different industries and skills I'm struck by--business people are usually anxious to share their problems when they come across a Federal Reserve official, but they haven't had a lot of problems to share apparently There are two exceptions to this generally positive picture One is that some of the wheat producing areas have a problem with too much moisture and that may affect things there and may back up into the condition of some of their lenders as well And home sales have slowed a bit, particularly in the Twin Cities, but that has to be put in the context of having come off two very strong years of home sales in the metropolitan area   In parts of North Dakota and Minnesota where they have had a fair amount of moisture, yes It's going to affect both yield and quality   I don't know With regard to the national economy, the incoming data haven't affected my view of things from the last meeting I think we do have continued strong growth in demand In the second half, I see the economy probably growing a bit slower than it did in the first half, but I'm not expecting a lot of slowing based on what I can see going on here As I hinted earlier, I'm uncertain what this means for inflation because the relationships between capacity and price or wage pressures don't seem to me to be as robust as they were in the early 1980s In those circumstances, I tend to fall back on a few things that I think I do know having to do  -16-    8/16/94  with what we might expect for labor force growth and for hours worked per employee When I go through that kind of arithmetic in my head, I come to the conclusion that we will have to be lucky to avoid a building of inflationary pressures here if I'm right about the strength of demand "
2207,1994-08-16," I certainly support the recommendation and, as several people have already commented, I think the statement and any other discussion that occurs in the next weeks are very important The facts of the matter are that we don't know what is going to come down the road, and if and when we may have to move next I think we ought to make that clear to the markets, and I believe the statement does a pretty good job of that--that this is not a permanent position "
2263,1994-09-27," Thank you, Mr Chairman First, with regard to the Ninth District economy, the objective measures of economic activity suggest that the regional economy remains strong The anecdotal evidence--of course there is always a danger of paying too much attention to that--suggests that activity has even picked up another notch, which is pretty remarkable because the regional economy has been operating at quite an accelerated pace for an extended period of time Nevertheless, business people seem quite positive about recent developments virtually across the board Labor markets have tightened further and jobs are certainly readily available Despite those circumstances, there is still no widespread evidence of building inflationary or wage pressures, but I think it is fair to say that there are more scattered indications of growing inflation and wage  -25-    9/27/94  pressures It is by no means widespread, as I suggested, but as we listen to people comment about input prices and about what is happening in specific labor markets and so forth, there certainly is more talk today about inflation than there was a few months ago Even some of the business people who have been quite skeptical of our concerns about inflation, thinking that we might be worried about a phantom, have started to acknowledge that there may be a little more to it than they at least thought earlier It's also true that when we talk to bankers--I think this came across in the FAC minutes but it comes across almost everywhere--if anything credit is a good deal more readily available today to small and medium-size businesses than it was a year ago or even less It does not appear that our moves toward higher interest rates have had any restraining effect in that sector  With regard to the national economy, it may be slowing, but not very much in my view, although I will admit that depending on how the inventory numbers play out, we could get some readings of real GDP that suggest a slowing My reading of the incoming data at the national level suggests there is a good deal of momentum in the expansion I guess the only way I can describe it is that it looks strong I do think this will be accompanied by some acceleration of inflation as the Greenbook suggests Bob Forrestal raised an interesting point that this may be just a temporary, cyclical spike that we need not get very worried about But it seems to me that identifying whether it's a temporary spike as opposed to something more durable may turn out to be exceedingly difficult, and certainly history doesn't provide very much comfort on that score "
2264,1994-09-27," I find myself in substantial agreement with Al Broaddus and for many of the same reasons It seems to me that the economy has a good deal of momentum I'm not at all confident that we are moving toward a sustainable path at this point I think the banking system is in the process of supporting rapid growth, and this may well occur without any significant change in the size of its balance sheet, just a change in composition I think the evidence suggests that, so far at least, we have not moved particularly early or particularly forcefully relative to historical experience, so I'm not persuaded that we're ahead of the curve Finally, I hope I'm wrong when I say this, but I'm concerned about our ability to analyze the price data and come up with all these fine reasons why something unusual is going on and the rise in prices won't last We can tell those kinds of tales, but I must say that that kind of analysis has led to past policy errors, and I'm afraid I'm reminded of one of Yogi Berra's expressions about ""deja vu all over again"" "
2324,1994-11-15," I used to comfort myself with the observation that since sterilized intervention really didn't affect anything, it probably really wouldn't harm anything either, a sort of a no-harm-no- foul kind of rule But I have come to the conclusion that sterilized intervention does have some cost Al just cited the credibility issue Also, I am observing that this Committee has a lot of discomfort with these operations I don't know where that goes beyond what we are already doing in the sense that we probably ought to keep these operations to a minimum to the extent we can, unless we believe that for monetary policy reasons we are going to do some unsterilized intervention; that's a different story Also, I would say that I think this discussion is helpful More communication about what we are doing and why would be helpful When we do get involved in intervention, it is very hard from time to time to understand exactly what prompted it on that occasion when it didn't prompt it on other occasions Sometimes, there doesn't seem to be any particular pattern or rationale I would certainly feel more comfortable with it all if I knew what it was about the circumstances in question that prompted the action "
2325,1994-11-15," Mike, as I recall when the household survey was changed by the Labor Department, a lot of people anticipated that at some point there would be a significant bump up in the unemployment rate, which has not materialized Is that simply because it has been swamped by employment gains or what is the explanation for that?   Thank you   With regard to the District economy, there is not a lot new to report; it remains strong Manufacturing is robust Materials prices are going up Employment is high throughout the District In some of the metropolitan areas, the reports we are getting are that everybody who wants to work is working What seems to be restraining some further job growth in those areas is housing shortages; businesses would attract more labor from the rural areas in the region or maybe from outside the District, but there is no housing in some of these places Despite that, there are no widespread reports of wage or price pressures, at the retail level at least What wage pressures there are seem to be concentrated mostly at the lower end of the pay scales I think that is because of the difficulty of retaining workers there; they have so many easy opportunities to move out and up Elsewhere in the District, the agricultural situation is mixed It is a good year for crops, though prices are not entirely favorable It has been tough in the livestock industry at least outside the dairy sector Since they are coming off about 7 good years, I'm not sure there are any real problems emerging there We did hear some reports from our Advisory Council members about interest rates starting to bite in the housing and furniture markets It is hard to know exactly what to make of that in light of the national statistics that seem better But however that may be, it is clear that the paper industry has bounced back  -22-    11/15/94  With regard to the national economy, I don't have a lot to add to what has already been said When we go through our translation process that takes the labor market data, in this case for October, and turns them into a GDP estimate for the fourth quarter, we get about 4-1/2 percent growth in real terms at an annual rate In some sense, that's neither here nor there, of course It's history, but it does tell us something about the underlying momentum of the economy, which I do think is quite positive and quite strong There is always the danger of extrapolating the latest reading On the other hand, as several people have already commented, it seems to me our experience over the years has been that once momentum starts to build in terms of real growth, it tends to go on for quite some time and it probably takes more restraint than we usually anticipate, at least early in the game, to avoid an acceleration of inflation or indeed to make progress in reducing the rate of inflation  Finally, let me comment on the suggestion that Al Broaddus just made I may come out at a somewhat different place than he did, but I do think that the suggestion to consider the implications of longer-run inflation targets may be a constructive one   Well, you certainly wouldn't want to do it without considerable political support I agree with that "
2326,1994-11-15," I also support your recommendation for 75 basis points on tactical grounds because it seems to me that the markets have been discomfited by our failure to respond recently I don't think that that has done our credibility any good I would reiterate, though, a couple of the dangers that other people have mentioned At some point, there is a danger of overkill I don't know whether 150 basis points in total is going to turn out to be too much or too little On fundamentals, I think there might be something to be said for buying a little time to see when the presumably lagged effects of previous tightenings start to bite, or if they do But because of the state of the markets and market expectations, my view is, as I stated, that 75 is fine for now "
2375,1994-12-20," Thank you For the most part, the Ninth District economy remains very strong; much of it is operating at full employment or maybe even beyond Two interesting pieces of information have become available since the last meeting On the anecdotal side, I think there is some accumulating evidence that housing is slowing down, both sales and construction activity--that there has been some response to higher interest rates I wouldn't say that the supporting information is overwhelming, but I think there has been enough of it to indicate some effect in our area Secondly, we did have a meeting with a large number of Twin City business leaders several weeks ago, and I would say the general tenor of that meeting was that whatever we have here, we don't have equilibrium What I mean is that most of their talk was about labor shortages across the board, from the skilled to the entry level jobs That market hasn't cleared It has not resulted yet in a lot of wage pressures, although people talk frequently about raising wages in one part of the pay  -16-    12/20/94  scale or another But it sounded to me as if there is more to come, that we clearly have some disequilibrium The same thing was true when they discussed what they were seeing in terms of crude and intermediate materials prices and availability There obviously are pressures there It sounded to me as if there is more to come and that ultimately that will put pressure on final goods prices Now whether this results in simply a blip in inflation at the consumer level or something more sustained remains to be seen But clearly there is a lot of pressure If these people are representative, there is a lot of pressure coming  With regard to the national outlook, I guess what I found the most surprising part of the Greenbook forecast, something that people have already commented on, was the inflation outlook If I used the Greenbook type of framework, which as I understand it relies a lot on capacity pressures to drive inflation, and look at how the economy has performed and where we are in terms of the unemployment rate and capacity utilization and so forth, I think I would come out with a lot more inflation over the next several quarters than is there My concern is that we could get an acceleration of inflation--the 1/4 point or so that the Greenbook seems to envision is just noise That could happen or not happen depending on a lucky or unlucky break or two My judgment would be that if we get an acceleration of inflation, we will not need a magnifying glass to discern it   You can go from 02 to 03 of a point--   You can go from 02 to 03 percent per month and that gives you a percentage point right there On a monthly basis, it doesn't look like very much "
2376,1994-12-20," I'd favor ""B"" with a symmetric directive I favor ""B"" because I do think we have applied some restraint and, given the lags, I think we ought to be patient and take some time to  -39-    12/20/94  see what effects, if any, they have I favor a symmetric directive for several reasons Part of it is my normal antipathy to, or discomfort with, asymmetric directives But more fundamentally on this occasion, I have trouble imagining what evidence we will get in the next several weeks that is really going to help us address what I consider to be one of the key questions What is the economy going to be like and what is the appropriate stance or policy actions that will influence things later in 1995 and into 1996? It just doesn't seem likely to me that we are going to learn anything in the next several weeks that is going to help us very much in addressing those questions I may be wrong, but we can have a conference call if significant new information does materialize Beyond that, the suggestion has been made, and I certainly agree with it, that there are a number of fundamental longer-run policy issues that the Committee should discuss and perhaps try to reach consensus on I noted a number of them in my recent communication [Secretary's note A copy of Mr Stern's letter to Chairman Greenspan, dated November 29, 1994, is appended] And I think the one that is on the table already about longer-run inflation objectives is a good place to start   Yes "
2430,1995-03-28," Thank you, Mr Chairman Let me comment first on the national economy I find myself a little more confident than I normally am about the general contour of the Greenbook forecast in part because, as many people have commented, the incoming data on the national economy are convincing evidence to me that the pace of growth has slowed Those data are also consistent with the tenor of the anecdotes that I have been picking up in the District lately I take some comfort from the incoming data and the Greenbook forecast and indeed from our own forecast, because as recently as a couple of months ago it was mostly a hope and a prayer that growth would slow to something more consistent with trend Now I think it is a little more than that I don't know where the risks lie, particularly; I do know that the confidence bands around these forecasts, if one does it rigorously, are very, very wide I think that is worth bearing in mind as we go forward  With regard to the Ninth District and the anecdotes there, first of all, I think it is worth saying that the District economy on balance remains very healthy But, and there are some ""buts,"" there is no doubt that auto sales, housing activity, and retail sales generally have slowed perceptibly The sellers are disappointed and their attitudes have soured somewhat I think they attribute this slowing to the level of interest rates to at least some considerable degree On the other side of the coin, labor remains in quite short supply in most of the District This has not translated into any real acceleration in the rate of wage inflation, but it does seem to be affecting expansion plans and/or current production activity, simply deferring those plans or limiting output; I think it has made a difference The final comment I would offer is that I have a sense that we are in for some kind of inventory correction I say that not on the basis of a lot of rigorous analysis of how production has matched up with consumption or other spending, but mostly as I listen to stories about some of the disappointment that has occurred That suggests to me that there are some inventories around that people would rather not be holding, whether they want to admit it or not Certainly, the incoming production data on the national economy have  -30-    3/28/95  been stronger than the spending data, consistent with the same story That suggests to me that an inventory correction will occur "
2431,1995-03-28," Don, in your discussion about inertia and what might or might not work, you did not mention the monetary base Is that principally because of the currency component, especially the currency held abroad, or do you have something else in mind?   Good  -40-    3/28/95   I think Don Kohn raised a couple of interesting points, and I would like to start with comments on those I do think this problem of interest rate inertia is a real problem, potentially at least It may be that what we are seeing in the financial markets now is a consequence of unsustainable euphoria for one reason or another But it may be on the other hand that the markets are telling us something significant I don't have a judgment about that, and I believe we should be careful about rushing to a conclusion about that While it is not fully convincing, it is worth noting that some work  -46-    3/28/95  that we have done suggests that the monetary base might be a useful indicator or maybe some sort of useful intermediate target, even recognizing the problems with the currency component I think that is worth pursuing down the road  With regard to the immediate situation, I certainly favor alternative B I don't feel all that strongly about the question of symmetry versus asymmetry, but I come out on the side of favoring symmetry Part of that is my usual reluctance to go to an asymmetric directive In these circumstances, as I suggested already, we don't know a lot about what the markets are telling us about recent interest rate movements, at least I don't But it is also true that the period between now and the next meeting is relatively long, and we are going to get a lot of incoming information We don't meet again until fairly late in May if I have the calendar right I don't have a feeling as to what the incoming information may tell us, and I would like to be in a position of simply judging it as it comes in Beyond that, and maybe I am just being a little too cynical here, I am certainly not pleased by the performance of the dollar, but I don't think we ought to put ourselves in a position where we might want to react to that I am not persuaded that that would be appropriate at this juncture or that it is something we can do very successfully So, I would be reluctant to go to asymmetry "
2482,1995-05-23," The economy of the Ninth District is similar to what has been reported in virtually all the other Districts The pace of expansion has slowed But I must say the tenor of the information and anecdotes that have come in suggests to me that, relative to the numbers that we have seen for the national economy, the District economy remains pretty sound The strength is concentrated right now in basic industries Pulp and paper production is strong; iron and copper mining is strong; energy exploration has picked up I would describe sentiment as cautious but not negative There has been some concern expressed about what might follow from the battle with Japan on the auto parts issue, and whether that could inhibit some of our producers who currently export non-auto related goods to Japan But industry attitudes don't seem to be particularly negative Labor markets remain quite tight, especially for skilled workers, but as usual that does not seem to be translating into broad-based wage pressures A couple of mortgage bankers that I ran into recently have expressed growing optimism I gather their volume has picked up  With regard to the national economy, I don't have any serious problems with the soft landing pattern in the Greenbook forecast I would observe that it not only is a soft landing but it is a rather quick one It only takes a couple of quarters of below-trend expansion before we get back to what appears to be trend or steady state And I guess I am struck that even if things work out that well, that means in some sense that we are going to be looking at subpar numbers on the national economy for at least six months, that is, into October or November We probably ought to recognize that up front and gird ourselves to be patient if, in fact, we get incoming evidence on the national economy of that nature That's inherent in the forecast and that seems to be what we ought to be expecting, at least as the most likely scenario "
2483,1995-05-23," I, too, agree with ""B"" symmetric The only comment I would add is that when I submitted my Humphrey-Hawkins numbers earlier this year, I was relatively negative about the inflation outlook, at least for this year Unfortunately, nothing has happened to change my view about that On the other hand, looking at all the incoming information on the economy, I am marginally more confident that this may turn out to be a temporary acceleration in the core CPI, and I don't see any reason to take action at this juncture "
2534,1995-08-22," I have a couple of questions First, Charlie, on the international side With regard to the other industrial nations, as I looked at your projections I couldn't discern the reasons you are expecting improvement in their economic activity Is that based on the general cyclical notion that those economies have been growing slowly, if at all, so they are bound to do better in the future or is there something more fundamental going on that has led you to believe they are going to do better?   Second question I don't fully understand it, but I gather that BEA is going to use the chain-weighted index to deflate GDP and that will lower previous estimates of real GDP, significantly in some cases Does that also mean that productivity estimates are going to come down significantly? If so, is that really credible?   Thank you, Mr Chairman The District economy remains healthy and activity generally has picked up over the summer That pickup has been reasonably widespread across industries and regions of the District There have been some further gains in employment At the same time, labor does remain in relatively scarce supply That combination is interesting because it still has not translated into anything resembling a broad-based-acceleration of wages or even growing wage pressures One interesting anecdote bearing on this--and I would not argue that this is a widespread development at this point--came from a fairly large employer in our District who indicated that he was having a lot of trouble finding workers He said he has gone to outsourcing some of his back office activities; he has contracted with a firm in Maine to do some of this work Apparently, labor is more readily available there and he can get the work done at a reasonable rate As I said, I am not suggesting that such outsourcing is widespread, but we may see more of it as time goes on  One exception to this general picture of economic health is the livestock industry; a second is manufacturing For whatever reason, manufacturers in our District feel business is soft and they are not optimistic They believe they are going to be cutting output further for some time I think that's a reasonable generalization of their views  With regard to the national economy, I am certainly in general agreement with the contours of the Greenbook foreast The major surprise to me has been that things seem to be working out so    8/22/95  well, and certainly a bit better than I might have expected a month or two ago I think we are moving toward a foundation for a resumption of sound economic growth I anticipate that wage and price pressures will remain relatively restrained That is based in part on what I see going on in the economy in terms of the difficulty of raising prices and the reluctance to raise wages or other forms of compensation I don't see anything that is going to come along soon to disturb that So, I think we are in pretty good shape "
2535,1995-08-22, I support it as well 
2595,1995-09-26," In general, I am in favor of this legislation I think it is the right direction to move for the reasons that a number of people, including Ed Boehne, cited This will get us toward our largest contribution to economic prosperity over time Having said that, I would agree--this may seem unusual--with both Tom and Alan If we start thinking about the implementation issues, they are rather daunting As Don Kohn mentioned, this would join the issue of whether we really want to achieve price stability in an opportunistic sense or whether we want to go with something like alternative C irrespective of how things stand at the moment My judgment would be that there would be no escaping those kinds of questions if this legislation were put in place So, I think that would likely be a very challenging environment That does not mean that we should not go this route, but I do think some issues that we have been able to finesse in recent years will be joined rather directly if we go down this path "
2596,1995-09-26," Ted, would you elaborate a bit on the Daiwa situation and whether that's known in the market?   I heard something about it on the news this morning, but I didn't see any details   They are a primary dealer, Bill?   The Ninth District economy remains strong Labor markets are tight The rate of unemployment in Minnesota is at or near an all-time low Particularly bright spots in the economy are construction, both residential and commercial, mining and energy output, and forest products The only major exceptions to this generally favorable picture are cattle producers, who are being adversely affected by low prices--but that is coming off seven or eight pretty good years--and tourism, where apparently the summer season turned out to be mediocre; again, that is coming off several back-to-back very strong years  As far as the national economy is concerned, I have no problem with the general path of the Greenbook forecast, and I am hard pressed to identify a particular bias in the risks Our model forecast is more optimistic than the Greenbook--more optimistic in the sense that we have slightly more growth in 1996 and 1997 and slightly less inflation In fact, we have a deceleration of inflation Given our inability to be precise about these things, I would judge either outcome to be acceptable "
2597,1995-09-26," I also favor ""B"" symmetric  -37-    9/26/95 "
2654,1995-11-15," Thank you We recently have had meetings with our directors and our advisory council, and several themes emerged from those discussions Many of them are not new, but I think they are worth emphasizing because they were universal The first of these themes was that labor markets are very, very tight across the District and across skill and experience levels--everything from unskilled, inexperienced workers to college graduates, MBAs, and so on While that was reported by virtually everybody who commented on it, they also commented that despite the fact that those labor markets have been tight for quite some time, there is no real sign of any acceleration in wage increases or price increases across the District Also, credit is readily available There has been a striking lack of reports of difficulty in finding credit Real estate construction markets have strengthened and are continuing to strengthen The  -26-    11/15/95  manufacturing sector, in contrast, is pretty sluggish outside of the paper industry If there is one group that is concerned about current industry conditions and where the economy is likely to be going, I would have to say it is the manufacturers Those we have talked to who do business internationally say that outside of Japan they are seeing improved business Japan appears to be, as we know, largely a case unto itself at the moment Finally, those who commented on this issue indicated that capital spending today is being driven by technological change rather than interest rates They would not argue that interest rates are altogether inconsequential, but they seem to feel that they really have to continue to introduce new technology in order to remain competitive  With regard to the outlook for the national economy, I share the view evidenced in the Greenbook that we will see a continuation of respectable real growth from here It will not be at the pace of the third quarter, but I don't see any reason to doubt that the economy will continue to grow at a pace in the neighborhood of 2 or 3 percent on average over the next several quarters With regard to the inflation outlook, I must admit to a fair amount of uncertainty If I had to write down a number, I would probably write down something like the 3 percent in the Greenbook But if there is one thing that really has surprised me in the past year or maybe two, it has been the fact that despite tight labor markets, rapid growth in demand, and tight product markets we have not seen any acceleration of inflation I have a tinge of optimism regarding the inflation outlook, and if I were to err I would guess that we might do a bit better on the inflation side than that number I would write down "
2655,1995-11-15," That's almost enough!   I favor ""B"" symmetric at this meeting I might say a word or two about what we might consider going forward from here It seems to me that the degree of sogginess in the economy in the meeting five weeks from now will be one issue, but I think an equally important issue will be the path we want to put inflation on One way of looking at the work on the Taylor rule is, of course, that policy is overly restrictive Another way of looking at it is that it's appropriately restrictive because we want to bend inflation down further from here Where that leads me is that we need to have a discussion and try to get agreement at some point on whether we want to try to move toward lower inflation deliberately as opposed to opportunistically I think that's a key issue and I don't have a way of judging what we ought to do in December without coming to some understanding about that "
2705,1995-12-19," Thank you, Mr Chairman Let me start by saying that I agree with Mike's comment that the expansion at the national level has not run out of steam and that it will continue  As far as the Ninth District economy is concerned, it remains in pretty good shape, although the anecdotes this time around are perhaps a bit more mixed than they have been in a while, and I will comment on that Retailers, of course, express concern That goes with the territory to some extent I think the concern also reflects the fact that there are simply more of them, and they are getting smaller shares of a growing market That is part of what is going on here Certainly, some of the large auto dealers in our District point out that a shortage of sports utility vehicles in particular is restraining sales from what they otherwise would be I happened to be at a meeting with a variety of real estate and construction tycoons whose business is concentrated, but not exclusively, in the Twin Cities metropolitan area They were all smiles, because 1995 was a very good year for these people, though not a record year This included everything from single-family and multifamily developers on up through commercial construction, large-scale projects, and so forth They seem very comfortable with the outlook for 1996 I would say that they were confident that they were going to have another good year  As has been the case for quite some time, labor markets in the District are tight There are shortages of skilled and unskilled workers in various parts of the District As Tom Melzer mentioned for his District, I think the shortages are constraining expansion in some parts of our District That also has started to translate into more signs of wage pressures than formerly was the case It's by no means universal, but I did hear more about sizable wage increases recently than I had earlier The principal area of concern is in manufacturing Even those manufacturers who have had a pretty good year in 1995, and there is quite a number of them, say that orders have slowed, and they express some concern about 1996 I have a sense that inventories are higher in a large part of manufacturing than managers would like them to be They intend, of course, to pare those back, but that implies that the manufacturing sector could remain soggy for some time That seems to me to be the principal area of softness at the moment  I think Mike Prell's commentary about inflation and the risks on the up side is well taken But I wonder if there isn't an equally good case to suggest that maybe we are going to do better on inflation than the published forecasts suggest If I wanted to make that case, I would point to the following factors They are not additive; I will just throw them out as factors One is a number of consecutive years of modest growth in the money supply measures The second is my sense that productivity has done better than anticipated and probably better than measured in many cases This is something that may well continue Third, I think we are going to get a continuation of restrictive fiscal policy It may be back loaded and all of that, but I think it is still likely to occur Finally, I have a sense that more and more central banks around the world are committed to low inflation policies Ultimately, that matters So, I think one can  -18-    12/19/95  make a case that the inflation outlook based on those factors may be a bit more promising than we might otherwise expect "
2706,1995-12-19," Thank you, Mr Chairman First of all, Don, let me say that I appreciate your effort here in looking at opportunistic versus deliberate strategies I found this very helpful I understand better what I meant! [Laughter]   Maybe I'm the only one Just to talk a minute about that, I do think the opportunistic approach is the one we ought to follow I say that because as I understand the evidence and given the quality of the evidence, and both may be flawed--that is, my understanding and the evidence [Laughter]--it doesn't suggest that there are big gains in taking inflation from 3 percent to 1 percent or something like that If that's true, we should not want to pay a very big cost to do that I think that comes out in favor of an opportunistic approach Having said that, it may surprise you to  -44-    12/19/95  learn that I favor no change in policy at this meeting As I commented earlier, while I believe that we may get a soggy quarter or two because of the inventory situation, there is nothing at the moment we are going to do about that with a policy change As I look out further into 1996 and 1997, I am hard pressed to see cumulative weakness in the economy I am hard pressed to see a significant problem that I can identify Yes, there can always be shocks; yes, I recognize that there are risks, but I think there is a good possibility that something like the Greenbook forecast will be realized Maybe real short-term interest rates are on the high side but I guess I am not entirely persuaded of that Even if they are, perhaps that will reveal itself in lower inflation rather than anything else So, at this juncture, I would favor ""no change"" "
2749,1996-03-26," Thank you, Mr Chairman Our District economy has outperformed the national economy for a number of years, but I do not have the impression that that is continuing If anything, District growth certainly has been less than that of the national economy in recent months The principal areas of concern are the manufacturing and cattle industries All the cattle producers with whom I have talked describe their industry as an unmitigated disaster Having said that, I think the District economy in general is still fundamentally sound Part of the reason for the slowing growth is a factor that I have mentioned before, namely, labor supply constraints Labor markets remain very tight There are a few more, but still scattered, indications of increasing wage pressures and a somewhat more aggressive attitude on the part of labor In addition, I would say that consumer spending on both goods and houses has been healthy in the last couple of months  With regard to the national economy, as has been the case for some time, I remain generally comfortable with the contours of the Greenbook forecast I do think that the risks to the outlook may have shifted a bit recently, and I say this because as I look at the real side of the economy today, it strikes me as being in better shape than I had earlier expected it to be at this point Therefore, I think there is probably less risk of prolonged weakness or even prolonged stagnation on the real side By the same token, as I look at some of the potential indicators of rising inflation and in particular think about conditions in labor markets and labor attitudes, I sense that the risk of somewhat more inflation than at least I had earlier anticipated may also have increased "
2750,1996-03-26," I, too, support your recommendation "
2804,1996-05-21," This is an idea that we ought to pursue I don't know if Don's suggestion is optimal, but we have to start somewhere  -45-    5/21/96  I also think that we need to start with at least some structure In this case I don't think it's critical whether we use a 1998-type goal or push the goal out a little in time We have to start with some structure and some process because many of the questions that have been raised around the table have suggested, at least to me, that there are a lot of very difficult issues involved here While we might agree that we are all in favor of price stability, we need to get beyond that general notion and decide what price stability means and, practically speaking, how we should go about implementing it, over what timeframe, and so forth Those are difficult questions They will get even more difficult as we really start to contemplate them, and it seems to me that we ought to get our feet wet somehow What Don is proposing strikes me as a reasonable way to get started We will see what kind of issues surface; we will see what we learn from this; and we may see how we can address issues like an opportunistic versus deliberate approach to disinflation "
2805,1996-05-21," Thank you Mike, one of the themes that came through in the Greenbook, and you alluded to it briefly today, is the deterioration in inflationary expectations You seem to think that inflationary expectations are going to rise, and I would like you to elaborate a little on that It seems to me that one could tell a story that a lot of what is happening here stems from one-time supply shocks, and it is not obvious to me how that translates into inflationary expectations So, I would like to know a little more about your thinking Do you have some sort of COLA mechanism in mind or exactly what?   So it is a sort of preservation of real wages story?   I gather that you think it's consistent with historical experience; we have had these kinds of shocks before   Thank you In the Ninth District, while there was some pause in growth earlier, activity has once again picked up Most of the news has been on the positive side, and I would say that the regional economy is now advancing more strongly than I, certainly, expected just a few months ago To give you a flavor of some of this, housing activity is strong and as best I can judge will remain so There is a lot of activity in major metropolitan areas and housing shortages in some parts of the District Manufacturing activity is strong and improving; state tax revenues have been running above expectations; and energy exploration activity has picked up Perhaps the one obvious sign of difficulty is in agriculture where some livestock producers are having severe problems and where grain producers say they may or may not harvest a crop Our problem is not drought; it is too much ice and too much moisture Farmers have been getting out into the fields late, among other problems  As far as wage increases and price pressures are concerned, I would say there has been no pronounced change, but there are scattered indications that labor is getting a little more aggressive and wage increases in some instances are turning out to be a little higher than we were hearing earlier On the price side, the anecdotal news does not indicate any pronounced change, but I sense that, if anything, there is perhaps a little more inflationary pressure than was the case just a few months ago  With respect to the national economy, I certainly agree that there are increased risks of more inflation than I expected earlier We are going to get more inflation than I anticipated It is difficult for me to assess the degree and duration of these risks It was not very many months ago that the concerns were focused more on the down side, appropriately in my view That was the case in late 1995 and early this year Those concerns have obviously diminished, and diminished rather quickly I can imagine that some of the upside concerns prevailing at the moment could diminish quickly as well, but my sense is that it would take a favorable combination of events for that to happen as quickly as it did earlier on the down side "
2806,1996-05-21," As I think about the economy and how it is likely to perform from here, my suspicion is that housing still has some momentum that will carry it beyond the next quarter or two That would also be my judgment about capital spending As far as the consumer is concerned, I do not doubt the significance of the wealth effect, but we have had sustained gains in employment as well So, I don't think that what is going on in that sector is entirely a wealth effect That leads me not to be terribly concerned about the outlook for the real economy It looks satisfactory, or maybe even better than satisfactory, to me going forward Is this going to translate into the kind of inflation performance that is forecast in the Greenbook or something even worse? You have pointed out, Mr Chairman, that we do not fully understand what is going on there, whether it is job insecurity or other things I agree with that I think it may only be with the benefit of some considerable hindsight that we will understand that fully  From another perspective, if I look at real interest rates and the real federal funds rate and ask myself whether monetary policy is too stimulative or too restrictive or too whatever right now, my judgment is that it is not very far from where it ought to be I do not have a strong conviction as to which direction it may be off When I couple that consideration with what I believe about the real economy and what I think I know and do not know about inflation, that tells me that anything we do ought to be quite cautious I just do not have the sense that I know enough with enough confidence right now to come out strongly on one side or the other So, for this meeting I am prepared to stand pat But I must say that I am getting increasingly concerned about the inflation situation While we can always explain it away with special factors--grain prices or energy prices or whatever--it is always true that if we take out the most rapidly rising components we get something that we like better I think we have to be very careful about pursuing that very far   I prefer symmetry on philosophical grounds "
2857,1996-08-20," Mike, I agree with your characterization of the productivity data, but I think the business community would take sharp exception to it Everywhere I go they talk about the tremendous productivity improvements that they are achieving I must say that I am increasingly uncomfortable about our ability to reconcile the two sources of information I wonder if you have given that some further thought and have any new information?   Thank you   Thank you, Mr Chairman The District economy remains healthy I have been impressed most recently by strength in many of the natural resource industries Labor markets continue to be tight and if anything they have tightened a bit further They are so tight in fact that my kids have found jobs! [Laughter]  As far as the national economy is concerned, I read the situation much like the Greenbook Wage increases clearly are more rapid They are not offset currently by improvements in productivity, and I think increased price pressures are likely to result  I would like to comment briefly on an issue that has intrigued me recently, though I must admit it is something that is hard to quantify It is the use of personal credit cards by small businesses, by entrepreneurs, for business purposes There is no question that this is going on, and I strongly suspect that it is increasing in volume and breadth I say that because of the anecdotes  -22-    8/20/96  that I have been hearing; one just has to raise the subject to hear from almost anybody in the small-business arena how they use their credit cards for business purposes It is not surprising given the teaser rates that are available and the ease of credit card applications as opposed to applications for small-business loans at banks I think the consumer credit data are being affected by this phenomenon because the small-business people I talk to do not tend to pay this borrowing down; they tend to roll it over from one teaser rate to another and indeed to build up an increasing volume over time It does not mean that we ought to be sanguine about credit-quality issues Of course, that depends on whether we believe small businesses are more likely to repay this type of borrowing than consumers I do not have any convictions about that But I think it does mean that when we look at consumer credit data relative to something like disposable income, we may be getting a misreading of credit exposure because the denominator is not quite right What we want to include in the latter is business revenues, business income, or cash flow, or something like that I have discussed this with Don Kohn and I do not think we have much data on it, but it is something that we may want to bear in mind as we think about some of these credit versus income issues   No I really do not   No, not on the teaser rates These are 59, 69, 8 percent rates, and they are available without any effort Applications just show up in the mail "
2858,1996-08-20," Thank you, Mr Chairman I believe that the risks to economic performance are on the high side in the sense that the stage is set for more wage and price inflation than is desirable and perhaps than market participants expect To be sure, the price data so far this year can be read favorably, but I know I am preaching to the converted in saying that we have to be forward-looking There has been a lot of discussion of productivity and, of course, productivity is important; it matters for a lot of things But the productivity performance notwithstanding, whether we have mismeasured it or not, we do know for sure that output growth so far this year is unsustainable because employment growth thus far this year has been roughly twice the sustainable growth of the labor force Initial claims data suggest that this may be continuing There are also signs that aggregate demand, in fact, is moderating But the evidence is preliminary on this score, and it is not at all clear that it will moderate to a degree that will significantly change the labor market conditions I just described Given the risks as I perceive them,  -39-    8/20/96  waiting to act might damage our credibility, and more importantly in my view, might well make it more difficult for us to contain inflationary pressures This could ultimately produce circumstances that would threaten the ongoing expansion of the economy Moving modestly toward restraint now would seem to entail relatively little risk to economic performance and moreover could start us down the road that over time would not just contain inflationary pressures but could set the stage for some reduction in them I would think that would be a prudent course of action and favorable for the long-term health of the economy "
2912,1996-09-24," Thank you, Mr Chairman By almost all objective measures, the economy in the Ninth District remains very healthy Labor markets continue to be tight and, given the quality of new hires, businesses report spending increasing amounts on training new workers Our District is one of those where the local measures of housing activity would be consistent with the surprisingly positive national statistics Housing through most of the District has been better this year, whether we are talking about sales or new construction, than it was in both of the preceding two years and has continued to hold up as the year has progressed This also turned out, somewhat surprisingly, to be a satisfactory summer tourism season even though it got off to a slow start Despite these positive objective measures, business attitudes appear to be a bit on the cautious side at the moment based on our recent conversations I am not exactly sure about the source of this disconnect It may be that businessmen are in fact expecting the slowing that has been widely advertised for the second half, or it may be that they are influenced by their continuing inability to raise prices and the continuing virulence of competitive pressures  With regard to the national economy, I certainly agree with the spirit of the Greenbook forecast, so I will make only a few comments I think the economy is on solid footing It appears that demand is moderating, but it is uncertain if this moderation is sufficient to relieve pressures on resources in a meaningful way I share the concern that resource pressures will lead to a modest acceleration of inflation We went back and looked in a little more detail than usual at the experience of the mid-1960s and the late 1980s Those years involved long periods of labor market tightness that in our judgment were perhaps comparable to what we have been experiencing recently What we saw was that those periods were associated eventually with an acceleration of inflation Of course, what happened back then is not independent of the policies that were pursued, and we have to be careful about causality and all of that Nevertheless, the data suggest the risk that more inflation is in train and that it will emerge eventually "
2913,1996-09-24," I agree that it is a close call At the broadest level, the performance of the economy has been favorable It has been characterized by growth at or above trend and by low inflation In recent months, it appears that the pace of the expansion and demand are slowing as anticipated and inflation has been quiescent If I stopped there, it might be easy Yet, I feel uncomfortable and I suspect that comes as no surprise The bottom line is that I feel uncomfortable because of what I perceive is going on with resource utilization, particularly in the labor market, and what I think history tells us about the implications of that sooner or later for inflationary pressures I would add that, should we get some acceleration of inflation, I believe that will bring with it some further disruptions and perhaps require a policy response that will jeopardize what has been a very favorable economic performance  Before I came in here today, I was thinking a bit about the institutional issues that the Vice Chairman raised But I have to say that I am not smart enough to know how things are going to play out on November 15 when the vote at this meeting is released The bottom line, at least for me and I do not mean to be a purist about this, is the integrity of the process here I continue to favor some policy tightening now, and I personally think a 1/4-point increase would be appropriate You may be right that it is going to take more, but in my view it pays to be humble about our ability to forecast with accuracy in these circumstances, given the lags in policy and the uncertainty about the magnitude of the effects of policy I conclude that a small response is appropriate at this juncture "
2962,1996-11-13," As far as the District economy is concerned, there is little to report because the very healthy trends continue, as has been the case for a long time Labor markets remain very tight, and I have no doubt that there are outright labor shortages that are restraining activity and expansion in some parts of the District Anecdotes of wage pressure have increased and while we are hearing more about that, the pressure does not appear to be showing up in any of the broad measures of wages I am not in a position to reconcile the anecdotes in one direction and the data in the other Part of the explanation would appear to be a greater reliance on variable pay, which seems to be both larger and going deeper into organizations than we earlier thought But the evidence in support of that explanation still is very fragmentary at this point, and I would not put a lot of emphasis on it Whatever one might say about wages and wage pressures, business people remain adamant, as a number of people have already commented, that they cannot raise prices and that inflation is not something they are confronted with or that they contemplate  As far as the national economy is concerned, I would characterize developments in recent months as generally pleasant surprises Inflation has turned out to be less of a problem than I feared earlier, and demand does seem to be slowing along the lines that we anticipated I am not particularly worried about the third- quarter slowdown in consumer spending That story looks to me like the dog that does not bark or did not bark What I mean is that retailers are prone to complain and in fact do complain almost no matter how good things are The fact that I do not hear them complaining suggests to me that sales remain satisfactory  I clearly do not understand some of the dynamics in the labor market If we work our way through the data, there are some signs of an upward creep in the rate of wage increases But given that we probably have been underestimating the rate of growth of productivity, it may be that cost pressures have been offset to this point Having said that, we know that businesses are relying increasingly on less skilled, less experienced workers because they are the only ones available to fill vacancies, and we may be at the point where we are about to run through the good news as far as being able to offset somewhat higher wages with productivity improvements That is, we may start to see real increases in labor costs and the pressures that follow from that I do not know how much to make of that at this point because, as I said earlier, it seems to me that most of the surprises in recent months have been pleasant "
2963,1996-11-13," Thank you, Mr Chairman As I commented earlier, recent developments have been favorable, and I believe there is something to Ed Boehne's observation that we ought to take the good news when we can get it However, it still seems to me that the principal risk that we face is that of more inflation than we have forecast I laid out my basic concerns having to do with taut labor markets, and we may be at the point where we are starting to run out of good news on productivity, if we can in fact accurately measure it or observe it But having said all that, I do think that the risk of a meaningful acceleration of inflation has in fact diminished It looks to me as if expectations of future inflation also have diminished among market participants, judging by what has been happening in the bond market If that is right, then for a given nominal short-term interest rate, a given funds rate, the real short- term interest rate is at least a bit higher today than it was earlier  In sum, I believe that at least for now the risk of an acceleration of inflation has been addressed, hopefully adequately, by higher real short-term interest rates, and I am prepared to support your recommendation "
3018,1996-12-17," Thank you, Mr Chairman The Ninth District economy is still characterized by favorable business conditions almost throughout Perhaps the most noteworthy thing to report relates to a recent meeting that we had with about 30 business leaders The most striking thing they had to report is something I have commented on here but they certainly emphasized it, namely, how tight labor markets are and how difficult it is to find both skilled and unskilled workers This is translating into higher wages The wage pressures are by no means pervasive, but I think it is fair to say that larger wage increases are becoming more common The business leaders talked about new hires being increasingly expensive, both because of the skills or lack of skills they bring and because they are finding that at least in some cases they have to offer more generous benefit packages, especially to attract part-timers Those conditions have been in evidence for some time and I think they probably have intensified a bit  As far as the national economy is concerned, I am generally comfortable with the path of the Greenbook forecast I am hard pressed to think of something that would materially change that pattern going forward, at least through 1997 To be sure, there are risks that aggregate demand could either fall short or turn out to be somewhat stronger than envisioned in the forecast, but it is hard for me to assess those risks with any degree of confidence Without being very rigorous about this, the risk that I, at least, can identify most clearly is on the supply side With labor markets in the shape they are in and with what we are seeing in wages and are starting to hear about compensation more generally, there is clearly a risk that those pressures are going to build We need to keep our eye on the implications for inflation going forward, at least in the short term "
3019,1996-12-17, I support your recommendation 
3064,1997-03-25," Thank you, Mr Chairman Most measures of economic activity in  the Ninth District remain positive In particular, labor markets are still tight, and there are  widespread labor shortages But we are at the point that this is so familiar, so much a part of  the landscape, that people mentioned it only in passing Wage pressures are there but they    3/25/97  are scattered and by no means overwhelming With regard to other District developments,  construction activity is positive, the manufacturing sector is doing well, and state tax  revenues are running well above what had been anticipated A major potential negative is the  weather Widespread flooding is anticipated in the spring, but for better or for worse, the  snow and ice have not started to melt yet  As far as the national economy is concerned, I certainly agree with the significant  upward revisions in the Greenbook forecast, and I think, if anything, they may be  conservative My sense of the dynamics of the situation is that the economy will probably--  and will certainly without a change in policy--grow at the higher pace of the latest forecast or  maybe even faster I would point to a couple of factors My sense of the inventory situation  is that there is considerable room for some significant spending on inventories going forward  and that such spending will probably add significantly to aggregate demand  As I think about financial conditions and the broad range of variables that one  might throw into that bucket, it seems to me that financial conditions remain very  comfortable whether we look at interest rates, growth in the broad measures of money, equity  prices--even though they have waffled a bit recently--or credit availability in general As I  see it, we have financial conditions that are consistent with further substantial expansion in  demand  Finally, as far as inflation is concerned, I agree that a variety of temporary factors  has worked so far to restrain inflation to a pace that is certainly lower than I would have  expected at this point in the expansion I think that may continue for some time In  particular, I would point to the state of many of the other major industrial economies around  the world where there is considerable slack In my view, that has been an important factor in    3/25/97  what has been going on here But having said that, I would emphasize that the factors that  have been restraining inflation are certainly temporary and that the inflationary risks are  clear "
3065,1997-03-25," I am generally comfortable with your recommendation, Mr  Chairman I do not want to dwell on too many nuances, but let me just make a couple of    3/25/97  additional comments Like President Broaddus, if I interpreted him correctly, I guess I am  somewhat less confident than you that we are not behind the curve My concern is that there  seems to be a lot of momentum to demand in the economy, and that momentum could  translate into rising inflationary pressures While I agree with your assessment that we  probably have been underestimating productivity growth for some time, I wonder how  widespread that mismeasurement is and what the prospects for productivity are going  forward Mike Prell's report on the dichotomy between the views of the banker and the  industrialist is perhaps a little indicative There is no doubt that the productivity increases  have been substantial in manufacturing, but people in the financial services industry at least  implicitly suggest that they have not achieved the same kind of gains I think that is one of  the reasons they have not quite bought into the ""new era"" story the way others have  Having said that, I think that when we make policy adjustments like this, it pays to  be cautious We are uncertain about the outlook; we are uncertain about the effectiveness of  policy; and because of those uncertainties, I think we ought to be cautious As I said, I am  comfortable with your recommendation "
3110,1997-05-20," Thank you, Mr Chairman The economy in the Ninth District  remains healthy The expansion is continuing; it remains well balanced and broadly based  both geographically and by industry There are three or four developments of relatively  recent vintage that are worth commenting on First, there was a very severe flood in the Red  River Valley that runs between Minnesota and North Dakota and on into Canada This flood  has been very disruptive in that part of the world, but it probably will not have any broad    5/20/97  ramifications for the national economy or even for the District economy as a whole Of  course, part of its effect will be reversed because, while wealth has been destroyed, economic  activity tends to pick up as replacement activity occurs There also were significant losses in  some of the cattle herds around the District due to the severe winter this year, and that is a  double-edged phenomenon as well because, for those people who did not lose cattle, prices  have improved recently  At our recent directors' meeting and also at a meeting of our advisory council, a  couple of things of interest came up One is that we have further confirmation of the tautness  of the labor markets in the District If we look at the District data, as best we can get a  handle on them, employment gains over the past 12 months outpaced the increase in the labor  force by a significant amount Our directors and advisory council people are very explicit  about labor shortages and about very, very tight labor markets That is not new; it is just a  confirmation They also indicated, and I think it is fair to say, that there have been some  signs that wage and now price pressures are becoming a bit more generalized than formerly  was the case Business people are still very wary and talk a good deal about how competitive  the business environment is, how difficult it is to raise prices, and how cautious they are  about doing that At the same time, I think they will admit that price increases are perhaps  becoming more commonplace than was formerly the case in the District  With regard to the national economy, I will strike a couple of familiar themes I  am sympathetic with the general pattern of the Greenbook forecast and with Mike Prell's  description of where the risks lie That is, I think they lie in the direction of our possibly  getting a more rapid increase in aggregate demand than the Greenbook envisions, and that  will lead to greater price pressures In part, I feel that way because I am not entirely    5/20/97  persuaded that aggregate demand will slow as appreciably as is indicated in the Greenbook  There are a couple of reasons for that First, the increase in wealth over the past 2-1/2 years  or so has been enormous, and it seems to me that the implications for consumer spending are  quite straightforward It is just a question of degree Secondly, I have a sense that the  outlook for BFI is quite positive So, it seems to me that the risks, in terms of how demand is  likely to perform, are more on the high side We may continue to get some very favorable  developments on the supply side We all have spent a lot of time trying to analyze exactly  what is going on there and the extent to which that will continue I do not have a conviction,  but I would not place a large bet on favorable supply side developments continuing much  longer; at least, I would not make such a wager without very favorable odds "
3111,1997-05-20," Thank you, Mr Chairman I have to admit that I feel a little like  Dr Watson to your Sherlock Holmes You wove together all these strands and reconciled  the various puzzles that I have been worried about Whatever else may be going on, we  know that as the period of economic growth has lengthened, gains in employment have  outpaced what would seem to be consistent with what demographic trends normally would  generate in terms of labor force growth and any reasonable long-term trend in participation  rates and hours worked So, I am still a little cautious about where we are and how the  economy is performing    5/20/97  I would add that I continue to agree with the basic concern that the risks here are  that demand will outpace supply and that we will experience a buildup of inflationary  pressures I do not feel that it is absolutely urgent that we act on that concern at this meeting  But having said that, I ran through the same chronology that Jerry Jordan referred to earlier  in the meeting and arrived at close to the same conclusion That is, I think that if we delay  action now, we may not find ourselves confronting circumstances where we are convinced  and confident of the need for a policy tightening move and have a persuasive explanation  until perhaps November Now, I do not know if waiting until November would turn out to be  a fatal error, but why find out? It does seem to me that circumstances today ought to  persuade us not to wait that long or run the risk of waiting that long So, I would certainly  prefer a modest tightening now "
3156,1997-08-19," Mike, I understand that you are assuming a significant decline in equity  values next year How important is that to your view of how things are going to transpire?   Thank you, Mr Chairman Conditions in our District have not changed  much in years in the sense that the moderate and steady expansion that has been under way  continues Employment has continued to grow and there are some anecdotal indications that    8/19/97  employers are going to new extremes to find workers Construction activity is healthy, both  residential and commercial, and certainly the major contractors in our District, of whom there are a  decent number, are quite optimistic about the outlook Perhaps the only prominent soft spot in the  District is tourism, which is experiencing a disappointing season I don't have an explanation for  that It may be partially weather related, but that is the one sector that jumps out as a departure  from a generally healthy economy Wage and price pressures are generally absent People have  been commenting particularly favorably about nonlabor costs because they are not seeing increases  in input prices The one exception is in the health care area where we have had a very competitive  market for some time and have enjoyed small increases or even declines in costs People in the  health care industry have been suggesting with more force than usual that the favorable trend may  be over  As far as the national economy is concerned, my impression of the Greenbook forecast is  that it is very finely balanced It projects modest growth and what I would describe as relatively  low inflation In my view, it would not take much to tip the economy off that generally positive  course one way or another Abstracting from fluctuations in inventory investment over the next  quarter or two, my view is that we will see somewhat more growth in the real economy than the  Greenbook envisions and somewhat more inflation as well But whoever is right about that, it  seems to me that the risks in the outlook have not changed significantly in recent months; they  continue to lie on the side of greater inflation, given where we are cyclically Thank you "
3157,1997-08-19, I agree 
3200,1997-09-30," Thank you The Ninth District economy remains quite healthy, and I have  asked myself what has changed in our area that might provide a clue as to the future performance of  the national economy The short answer to that is ""not much,"" but let me comment on a few  aspects of the situation in any event District agricultural conditions are mixed Livestock  producers find themselves in better shape than they expected and are having their best year in some  time On the other hand, producers of wheat and other small grains are finding themselves in even  worse shape than they anticipated, both in terms of the size of their crops and the prices they are  going to get As Mike Moskow commented, the paper industry is doing better and probably better  than it expected at this point in time The scramble for labor continues in the District and, if  anything, it has intensified I would say that there is more commentary among business people  about wage pressures than I was hearing a few months ago For the most part, that has not  translated into price pressures or price increases yet I have come across a couple of reports of  firms that, after not raising prices or at least not making price increases stick in recent years, have  done so recently, and it appears that those increases will stick So, there may be something going  on there, but I would say it is premature to conclude very much  As far as the national economy is concerned, given the momentum that appears to be  underlying what is going on, I have some sympathy for the changes to the Greenbook forecast We  are looking at more real growth and lower inflation, and that is sensible But it does strike me that  changes to the forecast could almost as easily have been made in the opposite direction on the  grounds that the unemployment rate has fallen more rapidly than we anticipated, capacity  utilization rates have risen, employment gains have been larger than can be sustained in the long  run, and all of that might lead us to believe that we are going to see more inflation and less growth  in the future, even in the relatively near future, than is envisioned in the Greenbook    9/30/97  However that may be, my concerns are heightened a bit by some analysis we have done  on what I would describe as proxies for imbalances Of course, these variables are not infallible,  but they all have moved into ranges where they are beginning to flash some warning signs In  particular, we have been looking at the quit rate, capacity utilization in manufacturing, and the term  structure spread Based on historical performance, all these indicators are now in ranges where we  might anticipate slower real growth and/or more inflation than in the Greenbook forecast some time  in the next 12 months Again, I would not want to make too much of that at this point, but for those  of us who still have some faith in the old time religion, I do think that there may be some warning  signs out there "
3201,1997-09-30," Thank you, Mr Chairman I, too, accept your recommendation largely  because I think there is still sufficient uncertainty to warrant caution While it is tempting to take  the attitude that we ought to sit back and enjoy this economy, I see a danger in that The danger is  that we will wait too long before acting, as has occurred on occasion in the past We ought to  remain sensitive to that possibility, and that leads me to view November with a good deal of  interest "
3251,1997-11-12," Peter, I have a couple of questions on the primary dealer situation Is it  your impression that the performance of some of the dealers has deteriorated over time?  Secondly, what do we know about the profitability of their current operations?    11/12/97   I assume that you get a sense of what is going on by talking to them "
3252,1997-11-12," I will try to be concise As far as the District economy is concerned, I  can say the same thing that Mike Prell said about the national economy virtually all sectors are  strong Labor continues to be in very short supply I think there has been some upcreep in the  rate of wage increases, but it certainly has not been dramatic, and it does not seem to have  affected pricing as yet  Just a couple of other comments about the region Hotel occupancy rates in  Minneapolis are quite high We know first-hand that they are high not only currently but  prospectively as well We have been trying to book dates next year for director and other  meetings, and we are running into difficulty There are two new hotels under construction in  downtown Minneapolis and two or three major commercial office towers, so we clearly are  seeing some step-up in commercial construction activity in the largest metropolitan area of the  region The other comment I would make is that retail sales recently have been quite healthy,  and if traffic in the malls is any indicator, the holiday spending season looks promising  As far as the national economy is concerned, if I assume that the Greenbook has the  various repercussions of what has been happening in Southeast Asia and elsewhere about right,  then it seems to me that we face greater risks than are indicated in the Greenbook numbers Let  me explain what I mean by that I think the immediate risk is for more of an acceleration of  inflation than is projected in the Greenbook I say that because it seems to me that there is a  good deal of momentum to aggregate demand There are gathering cost pressures Labor is in    11/12/97 70  even more short supply than was the case earlier, and credit availability is ample But longer  term, I think the risks may be on the other side I say that because it seems to me that if we carry  out the policy envisioned in the Greenbook and we get the assumed decline in stock values and  associated negative wealth effects, the resulting sluggish growth in real GDP in 1999 and  perhaps beyond will occur according to the Greenbook forecast in an environment where the  saving rate stays at a quite low level I can imagine circumstances where that saving rate may  bounce up, if not in 1999 then certainly thereafter If so, it seems to me that the higher rate of  saving would add to the risks of an even more sluggish economic performance So, my sense of  the situation is that perhaps we are facing, both near term and longer term, greater risks than the  Greenbook numbers suggest "
3253,1997-11-12," I, too, support your recommendation, Mr Chairman It seems to me  that financial markets are too sensitive at this point for an action on our part Having read  recently about some previous financial episodes in Southeast Asia and elsewhere, I also have a  suspicion that that circumstance may turn out to be a bit worse than we currently expect, with  implications both for financial markets and perhaps for somewhat greater spillovers to the real  economy  Having said that, though, if we were in more normal circumstances--and clearly we  are not--I think I would want to get started with a little more restraint today I say that because  as I assess the risks, as I discussed earlier, it seems to me that the value of some restraint today  would be that we would get a more favorable inflation performance than the one we are  otherwise risking and perhaps a smoother path for the economy as well "
3303,1997-12-16," Thank you, Mr Chairman The District economy continues to grow at  a healthy pace as usual I will not dwell on much of that in detail; it is not an unfamiliar story  We recently had a couple of meetings with business leaders, and I would say the general  information gleaned at those meetings indicated no major surprises Business people are  uniformly positive about the 1998 outlook Construction is a particularly bright sector They  clearly expect economic growth to continue All in all, I would say the forecast is generally  favorable It is also clear now, at least in our region, that wage pressures have become pervasive  both geographically and by job and skill categories It is very, very hard to find workers, and    12/16/97 42  there are more reports of larger wage increases Some business people believe that they can  offset the higher wages with productivity improvements or other actions Some say that they  expect profit margins to be squeezed in 1998 and presumably beyond That was the general  thrust of the commentary at those meetings All in all, the District economy continues to  perform very nicely  As far as the national economy is concerned, my view is that the risks are on the  downside at this stage But in making that statement, I would not start with the current  Greenbook forecast If we compare that forecast with, say, that in the September Greenbook, we  do not have any tightening of policy in the current Greenbook in contrast to the staff assumption  in September While I certainly recognize that Asia and its repercussions represent a significant  shock that was not anticipated in September, we also have had more sustained aggregate demand  than was anticipated We now have tighter labor markets We have an economy that displays a  good deal of momentum So, if I were going to write down a baseline forecast based on all of  this, I would put in more real growth and more inflation than is in the Greenbook  Against that background, I think the risks are on the downside I say that because if  the Greenbook is right that there will be no appreciable acceleration in inflation, and if I am right  that wage pressures are now pervasive, which is pretty well baked in the cake, then it seems to  me that the implications or at least the risks for profit margins, stock prices, and ultimately real  activity are on the downside "
3304,1997-12-16," Thank you, Mr Chairman I support your recommendation both in  terms of alternative B and a symmetric directive I do so principally because I believe there is  more than enough uncertainty to go around We do not know how severe the Asian problem is  going to be We do not know how far it is going to spread We really do not know what it  means for the United States in terms of quantifying it In light of all that, it seems to me that no  change in policy and a fair amount of flexibility are appropriate at this point "
3356,1998-03-31," Thank you, Mr Chairman Let me start by commenting on three or  four characteristics of the District economy, some of which are by now familiar and some  perhaps less so I will then talk a little about the national economy  With regard to the District, nearly all sectors of the regional economy remain very  strong For example, District employment is up about 3-1/2 percent from early 1997 to early 1998  In Minnesota it is up over 4 percent What is really remarkable, if not startling, about those  numbers is where the new workers are coming from We do not exactly get Sunbelt immigration  rates in our District! [Laughter] It is a very impressive performance   I think part of the explanation is that people are taking second and even  third jobs I wasn't going to get into the anecdotal competition on this [Laughter] We do hear    3/31/98  stories about places like Mall of America that are sufficiently desperate that they will hire a  worker, if they can find one, who for whatever reason is willing to work only from 400 in the  afternoon until 800 in the evening three days a week These are people who obviously are doing  other things much of the time We hear that some of them may be in the process of taking their  third job  On the other hand, we are seeing something that we have not observed since probably  the mid-1980s I don't want to exaggerate this, but we see some indications that a two-tier  economy is developing where the urban areas are doing better than the rural areas The principal  problem in the rural areas is agriculture There it is partially a question of commodity prices--  and Asia may be having some effect--and partially a question of growing conditions, which right  now are not terribly favorable Having said that, there is always a problem with every  generalization, and the energy sector, which is of course rural, and the iron ore industry, which is  also rural, are both doing very well at the moment  The third and final regional characteristic I want to comment on relates to shortages I  will not comment further about the labor situation, but there is a related shortage of housing,  particularly in those rural areas where employment has gone up In the metropolitan areas, I  think housing construction has been sufficiently strong to more or less keep up with housing  demand There has been a shortage of office space, but that is in the process of being alleviated  and it probably will disappear in the next several years There are now five significant office  projects under way in downtown Minneapolis and at least two in downtown St Paul  Developers report uniformly that they have no problem finding financing  As far as the national economy is concerned, overall I must say conditions look very  good to me Real growth, both current and prospective, seems secure, and I believe inflation will    3/31/98  remain low at least for some time If I wanted to worry, I think I would worry about the  following things, especially in the context of the Greenbook forecast One is that the Greenbook  seems to have a very favorable nominal wage adjustment in the face of very tight labor market  conditions I worry a little about whether we really ought to expect that to happen I also worry  about the role of a stock price decline in that forecast I do not have a conviction about stock  prices, and I would not premise a forecast on it I guess, like Larry Promisel, I'm not quite as  negative as the Greenbook about the foreign trade situation, at least longer term I must admit  that growth in M2 is starting to concern me a little  In my view, the kicker here is productivity I don't want to get caught up in how we  measure productivity, but all of those adverse factors can be offset if productivity is on a  fundamentally more favorable trend Certainly, business people have asserted for a long time  that it is and they continue to do so They also continue to indicate that it is very hard to make  price increases stick Indeed, a more favorable underlying or fundamental trend of productivity  would help to rationalize stock prices I think I will stop there "
3357,1998-03-31," 1, too, support your recommendation, Mr Chairman, and I share Bill  Poole's concern about the timing of the release of the asymmetry We now release it at a point  when it does not do us any good, and I think the implication of that is what Ed Boehne was  talking about You can give a policy speech that elaborates on our current attitudes "
3407,1998-05-19," Thank you, Mr Chairman The preponderance of the evidence that has  become available since our last meeting is generally consistent with the path that the District  economy has been on and also with the path that the national economy is currently on That is,  much of our regional economy remains sound and healthy Labor markets remain very tight  Wages are going up more rapidly than formerly, but not as rapidly as I might have expected given  the tight conditions in our regional labor markets Some of that wage restraint may be due to the  fact that there are more and more unconventional ways of compensating people that we may not be  picking up in our reports and part of it may be consistent with the thought in the Greenbook  forecast that people recognize that they are in fact better off in real terms The one exception to this  is in the natural resources industries and in agriculture in particular I commented at the last  meeting about the reemergence of a two-tier economy in our District--something that we saw in the  1980s--and it is reappearing, particularly among wheat producers and some livestock producers  who clearly are having a very difficult time A combination of wheat disease and reduced prices is  affecting output and incomes It is hard to convey the sense of despair that some of these producers  currently feel, but there will undoubtedly be further contraction in the number of producers in parts  of our agricultural economy The land is likely to remain in cultivation, but the trend is toward  fewer producers That, of course, is something that has been under way for decades in the District,  but it is now occurring in a period of accelerating economic activity  As far as the national economy is concerned, abstracting from short-term fluctuations  in inventory spending, I am convinced that aggregate demand will continue to grow at a fairly  healthy clip There is a wide variety of reasons for that One set of reasons has to do with financial  conditions, and they have been commented on Credit seems to be readily available The monetary    5/19/98  aggregates have been growing rapidly There are many implicit signs such as the number of  mergers and so forth that suggest there is not much monetary restraint In my view how things play  out will depend on what happens on the supply side There, I think productivity is a key Of  course, productivity is very difficult to forecast It might grow rapidly enough for supply to keep  pace with demand, and we could get a very favorable inflation outcome I would be inclined to  leave it at that were it not for what I take to be quite accommodative financial market conditions I  referred to a few things there My reading of real interest rates, as I look at the charts labeled  ""Financial Indicators,"" is that while they are not low, they are not exceptionally high by any stretch  of the imagination If we think about how the interest-sensitive sectors of the economy have been  performing, we certainly would not conclude that real interest rates have exerted much of a  restraining influence One could always argue, I suppose, that those sectors would be growing even  more rapidly if real interest rates had not risen somewhat, and that probably is true But they  certainly have been doing well under current circumstances So, my concern is that we have a set  of financial conditions that is setting the stage for a rate of expansion of aggregate demand that is  going to exceed what supply is capable of accommodating "
3408,1998-05-19," I come out much where you did, Mr Chairman I talked earlier about  what might be called the tension between the strength in aggregate demand and accommodative  financial conditions and what clearly has been rapid growth in aggregate supply The latter is    5/19/98  premised, I think, on favorable productivity conditions, and the question is whether that will or will  not continue If it does, of course, we could get a favorable resolution of all this Another possible  resolution is that productivity will fall short but businesses, because of competitive market  conditions, will not be able to pass along their cost increases and profit margins will get squeezed  That would lead to the long anticipated correction in equity values that would cool demand over  time So, that is another potential resolution I do not have a conviction as to how all this  ultimately is going to play out I think this is a case where there is, at least in my mind, so much  uncertainty that I conclude we should not do very much In that environment, I am comfortable  with your recommendation "
3454,1998-08-18," Thank you, Mr Chairman District economic conditions remain  positive, but they are perhaps a bit more mixed than they were formerly I previously have talked  a little about the emergence of a two-tiered economy in our District, and the gap between the  urban economy and the rural economy appears to be widening  On the positive side, consumer spending remains strong Real estate markets are  healthy Construction activity is buoyant Most recently, markets for rental apartments have    8/18/98  become very, very tight in the urban areas of the District Rents are moving up significantly  Construction will undoubtedly follow once labor becomes available Labor markets are tight  Just one anecdote on that issue The Minnesota State Fair, which is a major activity in our part of  the country as you might imagine, gets under way in about 10 days They are short about 600 or  700 temporary workers that they need to hire to open the Fair There is, I would say, widespread  upward pressure on compensation, and I think it is fair to say that labor is becoming more  militant, at least in our area  On the other hand, in the rural parts of the District the problems in agriculture are  serious, as Tom Hoenig just mentioned Mining activity is softening Energy exploration is  slowing Some executives from the paper industry told me recently that their industry is not doing  well They are talking a lot about the trade situation and the need in their judgment for a lower  dollar  As far as the national economy is concerned, I have talked before about what I perceive  as the tension between the pace at which domestic aggregate demand is growing versus the  growth in aggregate supply and how the two might ultimately be reconciled At the moment, it  looks as if the reconciliation is occurring through the serious and sustained weakness in Asia and  the squeeze on domestic profit margins, with their attendant effects on equity prices and  ultimately their wealth effects on the economy If those trends remain in place, I think the  Greenbook forecast is more likely to materialize than I thought formerly I also think that  however this plays out, the risks look to me to be very large The Greenbook forecast may be a  good central tendency, but the risks that I see on both sides are significant "
3455,1998-08-18," Thank you, Mr Chairman I, too, favor alternative B and I also support  symmetry I almost always am in favor of symmetry It has the advantage in this case of being  appropriate [Laughter] "
3519,1998-09-29," Thank you, Mr Chairman I certainly favor earlier release of the  minutes and clarifying the language with regard to the tilt or the lack thereof Like Bob Parry, I  have a mild preference for something like Option 2, but there doesn't seem to be a huge  difference between the two versions as I read them  I share Ed Boehne's reservations about the immediate release of the decision on the  tilt Historically, it seems to me that it has been a very noisy signal because we frequently have  had a tilt or changed the tilt and nothing followed That gives me some pause I'm not sure we  are going to have the intended results from that kind of release, at least at this point in time So,  I'm not in favor of immediate release at least for now, and I would prefer to hold off making a  decision   Another form of collateral! "
3520,1998-09-29," Thank you Ted, I would like you to elaborate a little on Brazil and the  risks there because I have the sense that at least some in the international financial community  are trying to draw a line in the sand with regard to Brazil Yet, while you said you were  expecting the Brazilian real to depreciate, you are expecting that to proceed in an orderly way  Obviously, it is not hard to imagine something much worse happening   Yes    9/29/98   Thank you, Mr Chairman As far as the District economy is  concerned, general conditions remain favorable, although I think it's fair to say that the trends  are a little more mixed than was the case earlier in the year Attitudes have not changed  dramatically, but I do think there is a little more caution and a little more concern now than there    9/29/98  was earlier On the positive side, labor markets remain very tight The unemployment rate in the  state of Minnesota has dropped to a new record low, and this must be the third or fourth record  monthly low established this year Housing activity and nonresidential construction activity in  general remain strong Auto sales are healthy The weaknesses are in agriculture, where I think  the problems are well recognized and are quite severe in at least parts of the District, in parts of  the manufacturing economy, and in mining activity Trade issues, especially with Canada, have  become a matter of concern, and several of the governors in the District are taking actions at  least to show the flag with regard to trade  As far as the national economy is concerned, I started by assuming that the national  economy would grow at trend, which is not too different from the model forecast Then, I asked  myself where the risks lie Like others, I concluded that the risks at this juncture are mostly on  the downside relative to trend growth I don't know exactly how I would parcel that out on a  quarter-by-quarter basis, but that is what I concluded Having said that, I think we have to be  careful not to get carried away with the downside risks I am not at all sanguine, but I think it is  worth reminding ourselves that there has been a lot of discussion around this table in recent  months, indeed in recent years, that the equity markets have been overvalued The implication  was that those prices had to come down Indeed they have! In some sense, we are getting what  we expected or what we hoped I think there has been a similar discussion that quality spreads  were far too narrow They have now widened out Again, that seems to be something that we  expected would happen and hoped would happen in the context of a necessity for domestic  demand to slow to a pace more consistent with the growth of aggregate supply We were  concerned about the excessive availability of credit Those conditions seem to be changing  Again, that is something that we anticipated and to some extent hoped for In my view, what we  are seeing here to a great degree is developments that we either expected or hoped for, and while,    9/29/98  as I said, I think the risks are on the downside, I believe we should be careful not to lose sight of  the fact that these developments were anticipated, at least in part What I conclude from all this  is that it is very hard to see any inflationary momentum building in the current environment So,  I think we are in for further periods of modest inflation "
3521,1998-09-29," I, too, support the recommendation for a 1/4 percentage point reduction  in the fed funds rate It seems to me that that is the prudent thing to do given the risks as I  perceive them I view such a policy adjustment mainly as on the margin of our effort to insulate  the domestic economy from the series of negative developments that has engulfed the world in  recent months  As far as symmetry and asymmetry are concerned, as I have commented before, I have  a long-standing preference for symmetry most of the time This is one of those times, mainly for  the reasons you cited, Mr Chairman I think events will determine what happens and I do not  feel that asymmetry buys us very much in this setting "
3584,1998-11-17," I think Option 2 would be a distinct improvement and I favor that I  think dropping that sentence about ""any potential changes"" is probably a good idea because it  seems redundant to me, but I don't feel very strongly about it "
3585,1998-11-17," Thank you, Mr Chairman As far as the Ninth District economy is  concerned, there has been no appreciable change in recent months Labor markets remain very  tight If anything, they have tightened further because we are getting the normal increase in  seasonal part-time demand for workers Consumer spending has been strong and that appears to  be continuing My unscientific survey of mall parking lots suggests that they are operating close    11/17/98  to capacity, or in some cases even beyond Construction remains strong Banks are seeing  strong loan demand in part, no doubt, because other investors and lenders have disengaged to  some extent My impression is that bankers are both willing and able to accommodate the  demand that they are seeing  Less favorably, conditions in both manufacturing and mining are mixed, depending on  their exposure internationally, and agriculture has problems of one degree or another throughout  much of the District largely as a consequence of both crises If you're looking for change in our  District, you have to look to the governor's office in Minnesota! [Laughter]  As far as the national economy is concerned, I would use the phrase ""broadly  acceptable"" to describe what is going on I am referring to recent developments and conditions  in the economy and the outlook, as I see it, for both economic growth and inflation I certainly  would say that recent trends in financial markets are broadly acceptable, and better than I might  have guessed a month ago, or certainly six or seven weeks ago No doubt part of this is due to  the policy changes we made, and there is now a danger of overreacting to the last six or seven  weeks of readings on these various things But taking a step back, all this reminds me of  something that I think we have known for a while, and that is that our economy is fundamentally  very resilient I believe that is what we are seeing "
3586,1998-11-17," Mr Chairman, I have a mild preference for alternative B for two  reasons First, I consider the case for alternative A far from overwhelming Secondly, I think  there is something to be said at this stage for patience, not necessarily for patience's sake but  because the next meeting is only five weeks away and because we want to make sure that any  action we take will be consistent with our long-run objectives "
3646,1998-12-22," I think the suggested approach is an excellent one It gives us the  opportunity to provide more information in a timely way when appropriate, and we can learn  from that experience "
3647,1998-12-22," Thank you, Mr Chairman At the broadest level, the District economy  remains healthy There is very little question that it is continuing to expand But that  generalization applies principally to the major metropolitan areas where construction, both  residential and nonresidential, is strong and consumer spending is robust Labor markets remain    12/22/98 35  very tight and there are clear signs of wage pressures, especially for entry-level jobs where firms  have to bid up salaries in order to attract people  On the other hand, parts of the District that have been struggling for some time  continue to struggle Agriculture, and especially livestock, is one example of that; mining and  the energy sector are a second; and parts of the manufacturing economy are a third I would say  that in those sectors, if anything, the problems have become more significant and attitudes have  deteriorated a bit further Of course, most people and the bulk of the economic activities are in  the major metropolitan areas, so in trying to put this together one doesn't want to exaggerate  some of those out-state problems, as it were  As far as the national economy is concerned, two aspects of it have struck me for some  time One is its resilience If you think about the events that have buffeted the national economy  over the last 10 or more years and counterpose that with its performance, there is no question that  resilience has been a characteristic of this economy The other somewhat related aspect is that  while we clearly have had a lot of turmoil coming from abroad, principally in the last 18 months  or so, the economy seems on net to have weathered that well Of course, when you cut through it  all, those developments are not entirely negative either in terms of their implications for interest  rates and inflation or for the interest-sensitive sectors of our economy  I think the outlook for the economy in general is positive in terms of sustainable real  growth There are a couple of significant downside risks that people have commented on One  is the Brazilian situation and another is, at least in some people's judgment, an excessively  elevated equity price But I don't know what probabilities to attach to possible corrections in  those situations In fact, it is my view that we probably will get more real growth or at least  more growth in aggregate demand than is indicated in the Greenbook over the next year or two    12/22/98 36  Taken by itself that is certainly positive The question is what rate of inflation is likely to  accompany it So far at least, the surprises in the inflation numbers have been on the downside  and that is to the good And the weakness in commodity prices suggests that that may continue  On the other hand, I must say that the rapid growth in the monetary aggregates and  generally accommodative credit conditions do give me some pause They are a source of at least  some potential concern At a minimum we need to monitor that closely "
3648,1998-12-22," I, too, support ""B"" symmetric   I prefer option 3 I think the last sentence on the monetary aggregates  should be retained I don't feel that strongly about the debate over ""in coming months"" versus  simply ""during the intermeeting period"" On balance, I'd keep the sentence the way it is and  leave it in "
3692,1999-03-30," Thank you, Mr Chairman With regard to the District   economy, overall conditions remain quite favorable and, if anything, activity has picked   up a bit Retail sales have been strong in recent months, manufacturing activity for the   most part has been positive, construction activity has certainly been healthy, and labor   markets of course have remained tight In the interest of balance, I should note that   agricultural and other natural resource industries are continuing to struggle Home sales   in the Twin Cities metropolitan area have slowed a bit, although realtors tell us that it is   due to a lack of supply rather than a lack of demand And bankers are expressing a little   concern about the credit quality of their commercial loan portfolios--or rather the other   guy’s commercial loan portfolio [Laughter]   As far as the national economy is concerned, I find myself in agreement with   the general pattern of the Greenbook forecast By that I mean that the current quarter is   turning out very well once again and that the moderation in real growth going forward,   certainly relative to last year and maybe to the last three years, is something with which I   agree--without getting into details about the precise magnitudes I also would expect, as   does the Greenbook, some modest acceleration of inflation   Having said that, my feeling is that the risks to the forecast, if anything, have   diminished recently Or maybe I was simply too pessimistic earlier On the upside, of   course, the concern is not the rate of real growth but the rate of inflation that might   accompany it And certainly in recent years I have been reducing my inflation forecast   with some frequency My sense is that many of the rest of us have been doing the same   thing, or have been reducing the level of the federal funds rate that goes with any   inflation forecast, or both     3/30/99 35   On the downside, I have been impressed at the lack of repercussions from   events in Brazil on the rest of Latin America and elsewhere in the world My feeling, for   what it’s worth, is that we are in a better situation than I anticipated and that the risks   going forward have diminished, if anything  "
3693,1999-03-30," I support your recommendation of “B” symmetric I will   elaborate very briefly by saying that if I were a betting man, given initial conditions, I   would bet that our next move is more likely to be an increase in the federal funds rate   than a decrease But I don’t have any conviction about its timing and I don’t see   anything significant to be gained by adopting an asymmetric directive now or by   becoming more aggressive now So I am comfortable with your recommendation I   would add, with regard to the actions we took last fall to reduce the funds rate, that   nothing I have seen in subsequent developments has led me to believe that things have   gone wrong in the wake of those actions So I see no reason to want to undo them at this   point  "
3739,1999-05-18," Thank you The District economy remains robust, which is not   a change in conditions That is true virtually across the board, whether one looks at   consumer spending, tourism activity, or manufacturing activity Construction is very   strong, both residential and commercial, and houses are selling as soon as they hit the   market The one obvious exception is agriculture, which remains in the doldrums   Despite the problems in that sector, I think it is worth remembering that they are not   nearly as severe as they were in the mid-1980s nor do they have the implications for the   banking system, at least at this point, that they had back then   I had a meeting recently with a range of representatives from the financial   services industry in the Twin Cities, and generally they confirmed this very positive view   of regional conditions as well as broader conditions There was a sense in their   conversations about the economy that is a bit different this time from past experience     5/18/99 37   One might expect that from some of the financial people, at least those who are close to   the equity market I think one reason they feel that way relates to the international   situation They see the US economy as being able to tap into capacity abroad, both   traditional manufacturing capacity as well as labor They also feel, of course, that the   United States is playing a particularly critical role at the moment in the global economy   As far as the national outlook is concerned, I believe the prospects for real   growth are favorable I don’t think there’s much question about that Aggregate demand   is strong and I am relatively optimistic about aggregate supply I agree that we have a lot   of problems in measuring productivity, much less forecasting it But I ask myself what I   think determines productivity If one approaches the analysis in that way, there is reason   to believe that productivity is on a more durable and positive trend And I think it is   worth bearing in mind that business people have been saying for quite some time--well   before it started to show up in the statistics--that they were getting sizable increases in   productivity   As far as inflation is concerned, that CPI number captured lots of attention, I   think justifiably It is worth reminding ourselves, though, that we have been anticipating   a modest acceleration of inflation In my judgment the problem with getting too   comfortable with that observation is that that modest acceleration may depend crucially   on monetary policy assumptions Thank you  "
3740,1999-05-18," Thank you, Mr Chairman I support your recommendation   The most important thing to me in all of this is that we make an announcement because I   believe it is very important at this stage that we give the public some sense of our   thinking in the current environment I would second Mike Kelley’s emphasis on   inserting some thoughts in that statement about longer-term trends as opposed to focusing   on the latest CPI number  "
3793,1999-08-24, The question is what they are going to charge their customers for this  
3794,1999-08-24," Thank you, Mr Chairman Most of the major economic trends in our   District remain in place or have intensified recently Consumer spending is healthy   Housing and nonresidential construction activity are strong The manufacturing sector is   doing well; the agricultural sector is not Labor markets remain tight and I think it is fair to   say, at least based on the anecdotal evidence, that wage increases have notched up a bit I   would not say the same thing about inflation, although I do have the impression that   discounting has diminished, and that is the other side of the price coin I suppose   As far as the national economy is concerned, the outlook is good My principal   concern in the current circumstances has to do with aggregate supply and productivity I   think aggregate demand is growing at a satisfactory pace at least and is likely to continue to   do so We all know that we have very tight labor markets and it’s clear that the rate of     8/24/99 62   increase in compensation has been accelerating I believe there is a chance that it will   continue to do so This may all play out fine as long as aggregate supply and, in particular,   productivity grow rapidly enough to offset that acceleration and keep demand and supply in   balance The risk is that that won’t happen And if it doesn’t, the inflationary consequences   concern me  "
3795,1999-08-24," I favor both aspects of your recommendation, Mr Chairman--that is,   the increase in the federal funds rate objective and the symmetric directive I would add that   I will be mildly surprised if we don’t wind up deciding that we need to move the funds rate   up a bit further before too long But I think a symmetric directive permits us to do that, and   I’m comfortable with what you are proposing     8/24/99 82  "
3840,1999-10-05," Speaking of prospects for Japan, what is the current and prospective state of   play of policy in Japan these days, including their attitude toward intervention, either unilateral or   joint?    Thank you, Mr Chairman The major trends in the District economy remain   intact, which is to say that outside of the agricultural sector the District economy is very healthy   Consumer spending is strong; auto sales are particularly strong My casual observation, for what   it’s worth, is that one of the things going on in the automobile area is that an increasing number of   households now have more cars than drivers There seems to be specialization; people are buying   cars for particular purposes Some of that might be weather-related in our District; nevertheless,   that’s clearly occurring   Housing activity is also strong Home prices in the Twin Cities metropolitan area have   been rising significantly and home improvement activity is robust I suspect it’s limited only by   the availability of contractors because in any neighborhood I drive through I see evidence that   people are improving their homes by remodeling or adding to them   Employment growth in the District has slowed I think that’s basically because we’re   running out of workers Apropos that, the unemployment rate in the Twin Cities metro area has   dropped below 2 percent again, and there is a mid-sized city or two where the unemployment rates   are even lower than that The only other thing I would pass on about the District is that I expect to   see some deterioration in credit quality at the banks, which is partly related to agriculture, of   course But beyond that, in talking to bankers it seems to me that they are still chasing the   marginal customer And sooner or later I think that will come home to roost   My view of the national economy is similar to my view of the District in the sense that I   think the trends that have been in place for some time will continue It seemed likely that the     10/5/99 33   second-quarter slowdown in growth was an aberration and that turns out to be right Inflation has   remained modest As we all know, if we take a step back and think about the last several years, the   national economy has performed remarkably well We’ve had rapid growth and modest inflation,   which is quite consistent with what our VAR model was forecasting over that period of time If   this keeps up, I’m going to have to develop some confidence in that model! I would note that the   model continues to forecast essentially more of the same But I think the Greenbook raises the   right question Is inflation going to accelerate from here? Several people have commented, and I   agree, that it depends a lot on how productivity performs in the future I’m relatively optimistic   about that, but I’ll reserve the rest of my comments until later  "
3841,1999-10-05," Thank you, Mr Chairman I, too, favor alternative B Let me take just a few   seconds to say why First of all, as I said earlier this morning, I am relatively optimistic about   productivity, and that gives me some confidence going forward Secondly, that optimism assuages   some of my concerns about inflationary pressures I simply don’t think the case for a significant   acceleration of inflation is all that convincing at this point And thirdly, I do believe we have a   little time We have moved the funds rate up The markets, especially long-term markets, have   moved rates up even more I think we can wait to see what all that brings So, I favor “B”   On the symmetry versus asymmetry issue, normally I favor symmetry, and that’s true today   But it’s not a big deal to me If we go asymmetric, given the procedures we have set up, we have   to say something about it I would come out about as Ned Gramlich did Probably the least bad   alternative under these circumstances is just to publish it Also, I think the markets--or some   participants in the market--are probably expecting asymmetry Several people have commented   along those lines And it’s probably not a bad idea to remind people that the door is not closed as   far as the November meeting of the Committee is concerned  "
3898,1999-11-16," I really agree with Ed Boehne’s point, but I can’t resist! [Laughter]    So, let me make a couple of constructive suggestions One is with   regard to that reference to the pool of workers in the second paragraph I would just drop that   sentence Whether we’ve said it before or not, I don’t think really matters; I don’t know why   we’d want to raise it again My only other comment is on the next sentence, the first sentence of   the next paragraph I think there should be a way to qualify that phrase “appears likely” a bit so   that the markets don’t get carried away    With regard to the alternatives on symmetry or asymmetry, I strongly   favor alternative I as well for the reasons that the other advocates have cited With regard to   recommendation number nine and the Chairman’s authority, I’m in favor of something like what   is proposed here I’m willing to leave the decision on the exact language to others, but I   certainly favor something like that  "
3899,1999-11-16," Thank you The District economy remains healthy If anything, it has   improved even further because a couple of the sectors that were lagging--namely, iron ore   mining and oil exploration--have picked up recently, albeit in the case of oil exploration from a   relatively low base Otherwise, manufacturing is strong and construction activity is uniformly   strong Retail sales are robust and in general retailers are quite optimistic about the upcoming   holiday season Labor markets remain very tight But interestingly--and I have no explanation   for this--if you ask retailers about the availability of temporary part-time workers for the holiday   season they say it’s no problem finding them How they are managing that I don’t know, but   that’s the report   The exception to all of this is the same old exception, which is agriculture The   principal problem there, of course, is commodity prices There is no question that problems in   agriculture per se have spilled over to the rural economy more generally if one looks at   employment measures in the rural areas Those people don’t have any trouble finding jobs in the     11/16/99 32   cities, so they don’t remain unemployed for long But, of course, they do have the adjustment of   moving or commuting from the farm to the city   As far as the national economy is concerned, it seems to me that we are in a   circumstance where substantial real growth is assured and the question is what inflation will   accompany it What can we say about inflationary prospects? The Greenbook has what I, at   least, consider to be a major new look at productivity and comes out, I think, with a significantly   more positive picture And the Greenbook forecast now is in many respects a lot like our VAR   forecast One might think that the more favorable path of productivity, other things equal, would   lead to a diminution of concerns about prospective inflation and inflationary pressures But the   Greenbook basically has the same old song as far as inflation is concerned And I guess I have to   say that I’m just not entirely persuaded Our model has for some time been more sanguine about   the inflation outlook and it remains that way I think it’s very clear that a lot is happening on the   supply side of our economy, perhaps more than we know If we calculate productivity from the   income side rather than from the output side, we continue to come up with significantly more   favorable numbers So, if anything, my uncertainty about the inflationary outlook has increased   rather than diminished at this point  "
3900,1999-11-16," I can accept your recommendation, Mr Chairman Although I think   there is some chance that this action may be unnecessary, I doubt it will be harmful Let me just   reiterate my own uncertainty about what the appropriate model is in this environment It seems   to me that many of the conventional models that we’ve been looking at over the last several   years have simply been wrong on the critical issue of the acceleration of inflation I think we   need to bear that in mind   An alternative explanation, undoubtedly also oversimplified, is that what we’ve seen   in the last several years has been a series of positive supply shocks, presumably related to     11/16/99 53   productivity, that have given us more growth and less inflation than we otherwise would have   expected It was just a movement along the demand curve I don’t know whether this will   continue I’m not sure what the appropriate policy stance is in this environment I’ll go along   with the recommendation, but I think we are a bit at sea here  "
3960,1999-12-21," Thank you, Roger Let me comment first on the intermeeting   authority issue that Bill McDonough just mentioned I share Al Broaddus’ concerns and   perspectives on this, but I am persuaded when I look at this language that it is satisfactory I   think it does protect us adequately and I am not troubled by what has been proposed   With regard to the bias language, originally I was in favor of the recommendation in   the memo, Option 1 As I’ve thought about it some more, I have to say--and I realize this is   not the world’s most constructive observation--I’m not entirely happy with either option   The reason is that staying with something close to the asymmetry wording we have been   using does imply I think some presumption about a move at the next meeting, which history   suggests often has not materialized In Option 1, the option in the memo, I don’t think this     12/21/99 74   is necessarily a fatal flaw But my reservation is that we could find ourselves from time to   time in a somewhat awkward position of having changed policy but not changed where we   think the risks lie That is quite likely and in some cases appropriate But it may also raise   the question  If the Committee thinks that’s where the risks are, why didn’t we move more   aggressively?  Maybe that can be handled in subsequent statements or in other ways If I   had to vote, I would vote in favor of Option 1 But I must say I have some reservations   about both options  "
3961,1999-12-21," Thank you, Mr Chairman The District economy remains in good   shape and I will only comment on a few things that have changed relative to previous   discussions Agriculture, it turns out, has had a somewhat better year than many had feared   A lot of that is due to government payments But in addition crops turned out to be large,   which helped, and the cattle market has improved a bit Commercial construction has been   strong in the District for quite some time and a number of new office buildings will be   coming on stream in the Twin Cities market over the next one to three years It is now   anticipated that as a consequence vacancy rates will probably double or triple in the Twin   Cities But that really doesn’t seem to have caused any alarm  It is, I guess, the other side   of the coin when a lot of buildings are built in a short period of time  Employment gains in   the District have slowed; that appears to reflect mostly just a lack of unemployed workers   Labor markets remain very tight Wage gains start at 3 or 4 percent and go up from there;   but the distribution is skewed and most of the increases really are in the 3 to 4 percent range   But, of course, that leaves out all of the other extras that might go into compensation There   is still a general lack of broad inflationary pressures And overall I would say that most of   our contacts are quite positive about the economic outlook for the year ahead   As far as the national economy is concerned, I have a fair amount of conviction   about the outlook for economic expansion Our model forecast is for growth of 3½ to 4     12/21/99 33   percent in real terms over the next two years  That’s actually a little below the Greenbook   forecast but it seems to me that conditions are right for a continuation of pretty solid real   growth   I have a lot less conviction about the inflation outlook The Greenbook, of course,   has a story of accelerating inflation This is a familiar story and it has a certain logic to it   But the surprises to inflation over the last several years have been on the downside There is   a danger in extrapolating that kind of performance On the other hand, we have been trying   to do some serious statistical work on the unemployment/inflation/NAIRU relationship, and   it looks as if that relationship really deteriorates a lot beginning in the mid-1980s We are   skeptical that there is any real relationship between unemployment and inflation if one   concentrates on the period since about the mid-1980s Now, I wouldn’t bet the farm on this   work just yet We have more analysis to do But our work thus far does suggest that we   may want to look elsewhere for insights about inflation  "
3962,1999-12-21," I have a mild preference for the symmetric version I’ve been struck   in recent weeks by the fact that market participants seem to have been tracking right along   with us They have been interpreting the incoming data pretty much as we have I doubt   that anybody will be misled or surprised by the language of the symmetric directive and I   think they will continue to do what they have been doing And given that we do face   uncertainties associated with Y2K and have invested a lot in avoiding Y2K-related   disruptions, I don’t see any particular advantage to an asymmetric directive at this stage  "
4014,2000-03-21,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Ninth District's economy remains   healthy  Construction activity is strong as is consumer spending  We have a couple of auto   dealers on our two boards of directors and we asked them whether energy prices were affecting   auto sales  Their answer was not so far as they could tell; auto sales continue to be robust    Labor markets, of course, remain very tight  And there is a bit of an unusual inventory problem   developing; by that I mean that the problem is getting the inventory from the back room or the   basement to the shelves  In some retail stores, the shelves are only partially stocked, and   retailers tell us they just can't hire the staff to keep up with shelf stocking  A couple of our   directors have reported that they see signs that inflation is stirring  These are people who sit on a   variety of corporate boards, and they are bringing to us reports that input prices are going up and   also that to some extent those companies are starting to implement price increases on their own   that so far are sticking   As far as the national economy is concerned, I really don't think there is very much   new  I continue to believe that the expansion of aggregate demand is secure and that, therefore,   the outlook for real growth is positive  I continue to be relatively optimistic about future   productivity gains, but I don't have a conviction about whether that will lead to domestic   aggregate supply keeping pace with aggregate demand or not  In my view, what might be the   decisive factor here is financial conditions and how accommodative or restrictive they turn out to   be  We did ask several of our directors to check with their sources to see whether the higher   interest rates that have appeared in the marketplace over the past year or so have had any effect              - 62 -     on spending or on future investment plans or other such decisions  And in general the answers   we got back were “no, not to this point”  "
4015,2000-03-21,"  I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman, because virtually any   reasonable framework that I can think of implies that in current circumstances real interest rates   should go up  "
4060,2000-05-16,"  Mike, I have a question about the simulations  If you carried these   out to 2002 or 2003 and beyond--maybe you did or maybe you didn't--what would you get for   inflation?  I'm particularly interested in the baseline case and its flat funds rate scenario after   this year     What I am trying to get a handle on is how much more inflation we   ought to anticipate in another year or two in the baseline case and the flat funds rate  I   certainly believe you that the tighter policy may produce the kind of reaction you're talking   about  But in those other two scenarios--     Three percent?  Okay     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Ninth District economy remains   very strong for the most part and, if anything, we've seen an intensification of existing trends    Employment gains have been sizable  At the same time, people report that it has become even   harder to find prospective employees across the skills spectrum  Help wanted signs   proliferate virtually wherever one goes  Discretionary spending continues strong  The most   recent anecdote of this has to do with activity in the second home market in the resorts and   retirement areas in the District, which are clearly thriving  Existing homes tend to be selling      54  very rapidly throughout the District at rising prices, and inventories of homes for sale are low    We are also seeing some improvement in the natural resource industries, including mining and   agriculture   On the other side of the coin, I am hearing of some signs that construction financing   is getting harder to find for both residential and commercial construction  I take that to mean   that rates have gone up for those kinds of deals or that in some cases people are getting turned   away  And at least one of the large developers based in our District has indicated that his   company is taking a much more cautious stance now and is cutting back on activities in some   of the hot markets in which it has been operating around the country     There has also been some anxiety throughout the District about what might happen   at this meeting  That anxiety is hard to characterize  It ranges from people who are afraid we   will do too much to people who fear we will do too little  So, there is no telling where the   right button may be as far as that audience is concerned   At the national level, I think prospects for real economic growth continue to look   good  The incoming data suggest that to me; the Greenbook forecast suggests that; and our   own model forecast, which is a bit more conservative than the Greenbook, still has very   acceptable real growth  On the inflation outlook, I continue to be uncertain, perhaps even   more uncertain than usual  I, too, have been watching the incoming data and listening to talk   about pressures here and there  Obviously, taken at face value, those developments all raise   concerns  On the other hand, we have been doing some serious empirical work on that issue,   and that work suggests very modest increases in inflation from here on out  I will defer   further comments on that perhaps until later in the meeting      55  Finally, I think there is a chance that we may be seeing something significant going   on in the stock market  Dave Stockton commented on the flattening of the Wilshire 5000    Obviously, some of the air has gone out of the NASDAQ  That means the IPO market is a lot   less receptive than it was a couple of months ago, and that seems to me a potentially   significant development if it persists  I have no conviction about whether it will or won’t    Thank you   "
4061,2000-05-16,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I'm fully comfortable with your   recommendation in all its aspects and I share the thinking that real interest rates should be   going up from here  Let me just add one other thought, which is that I assume we will be   open-minded about where we are going to go next and at what pace  One reason I think we   want to maintain that stance is the point I alluded to earlier, namely my own uncertainty about   the inflation outlook  I'm not persuaded, especially with this action, that we're going to   confront a significant acceleration of inflation  I say that in part because we in Minneapolis   have been looking for the effects of labor market tightness and its correlation to future   inflation--not only in the last several years but we've taken this back empirically for quite   some time, and we can't find evidence since about 1984 that labor market variables make a   significant contribution to forecasting inflation  I'm not entirely sure what we ought to   conclude from that, but one thing we certainly ought to conclude is that we should be cautious   as we think about what has happened in the economy and its implications for the future  "
4107,2000-08-22,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Sifting through the recent data and anecdotes   on the District economy suggests that it remains quite healthy but that some changes are occurring   beneath the surface  First of all, employment gains remain substantial  That is not a change  Labor   markets are very tight and there is some continued upward pressure on compensation  On the other   hand, our contacts say that significant price competition persists  Overall manufacturing activity is   strengthening, although some producers are expressing concerns about higher energy bills, and if   that persists, I think it is a factor that probably will affect output going forward  It appears that   consumer spending and residential construction activity have slowed a bit, but at this point those   adjustments appear to be modest in magnitude  In any event, nonresidential construction remains   quite strong   We have made some inquiries recently about productivity and its prospects because some   of our business contacts have expressed the view that the large gains--maybe the largest gains in   productivity--are now behind us  While some people adhere to that view, I would say that the   majority of our business contacts remain quite optimistic about the outlook for productivity and   believe that further large gains are in store  So, overall, we are hearing a pretty positive, optimistic   story in that regard   As for the nation, it looks to me as if the US economy is on a favorable course  I think   the outlook for real economic growth remains positive  As far as inflation is concerned, our VAR   model has no acceleration of inflation over the next four quarters; it has inflation running a bit below   2-1/2 percent at an annual rate  Obviously, there is a lot of uncertainty surrounding that kind of       44  forecast, but if it's more or less correct, it suggests that we at a minimum have some time before we   have to take further steps to address that issue  Thank you  "
4108,2000-08-22,"  I, too, support your recommendation, Mr Chairman, including the bias   toward concerns about heightened inflation going forward  As I indicated earlier, I do think we have   some additional time to assess that situation, and given current real interest rates I believe we are not   too far from where we need to be even over the longer run  "
4159,2000-10-03,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  The economy of the Ninth District remains   healthy, but I think there are signs of moderating activity  On the positive side, labor markets   continue to be very tight  The agricultural sector is doing better than expected, mainly because crops   are turning out to be very large  The mining and energy sectors are expanding  And while the   picture in construction--both residential and nonresidential--is mixed, overall I think activity in that   sector has probably leveled off at a relatively high level  The major area of slowing appears to be in   consumer spending, and I’ll come back to that in a minute   As far as the nation is concerned, I think the outlook remains positive  Our projections are   for a continuation of significant real growth through 2002, although at a pace somewhat below the   Greenbook forecast  And we have inflation stabilizing, albeit at a bit higher rate than our former      61  forecast  What is new, at least to me, is what I’ve been hearing anecdotally from retailers and from   analysts who follow retailers  They are reporting a significant slowing in consumer spending or at   least disappointing sales over the last several months  Now, this information is anecdotal; it’s not a   scientific sample  There may be a lot of noise in it, but I don’t doubt the sincerity of the reports, in   the sense that retailers do seem to be greatly disappointed with what they have seen recently  And   this is from some fairly significant players in the retail sector  Thank you  "
4160,2000-10-03,"  I do, too!  [Laughter]  "
4203,2000-11-15,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Overall business conditions in the Ninth   District are generally consistent with what we've seen for several years now, although there are a   few changes on the margin  First, employment gains continue and labor markets remain very   tight  That's a familiar story  I think it's fair to say that the natural resource industries, including   agriculture, had a better year than was anticipated  In agriculture, that's due mainly to very large   crops and favorable weather conditions and so forth  But a couple of the taconite mines in   northern Minnesota, although they have been operating at capacity, have announced prospective   cutbacks in output and employment and, of course, have attributed that to foreign competition in   the steel industry               40      Construction activity probably has leveled off, but lots of major projects are under   way  I don't think we will see any change in resource utilization in that sector for some time   because of the large number of projects in the pipeline  And as I commented last time, it does   appear that consumer spending has slowed across a wide range of products and retailers, and that   trend has continued as well  We’ve picked up a lot of anecdotes about a slowdown in consumer   spending, certainly relative to expectations and relative to the performance earlier in the year   On a much more positive note, anecdotes from a variety of business contacts have   been very positive about prospective productivity gains  Of course, this is not a scientific   sample, but the people we've talked to recently seem very optimistic about their ability to extract   further large gains in productivity through the application of a wide range of technologies  So,   we may continue to see very favorable news on that front if that turns out to be an accurate   assessment   As far as the national economy is concerned, we're looking for real growth over the   next couple of years of about 3-1/2 percent  That will be accompanied, in our view at least, by   continued tight labor markets  I agree with those who have indicated that the incoming data at   the national level have clearly pointed to a slowing in the rate of economic growth  Presumably,   all that involves is an economy adjusting from growth in excess of 5 percent over the first half of   this year and something better than 4 percent in the three previous years to this more moderate   pace   On the inflation side, as others have commented, there has been an uptick in both   headline and core inflation  If energy prices cooperate, presumably headline inflation will be   more favorable next year, but I'm not as optimistic that core inflation will be  Thank you               41     "
4204,2000-11-15,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support your recommendation    For some time I’ve believed that our policy is positioned about where it should be  That   continues to be my view  We obviously haven't had to take any action in the last several   months, and that's fine I would have trouble changing the balance of risk statement   because in my view not enough has changed in the past several weeks  I think we would   have a real problem explaining and justifying the basis for such a change  Some of our   discussion has been couched in terms of future growth of the economy below potential    Putting aside what we really know about potential with any confidence, obviously our   ability to forecast the economy reasonably accurately is limited  One thing we do know   is that the economy has tended to the very, very resilient in recent years  Thank you  "
4252,2000-12-19,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I would describe economic conditions in the   District as steady, but sentiment has changed recently and significantly so, as best I can judge    Clearly, people are becoming more cautious and more concerned about the outlook  I think financial   market developments have something to do with that, with the flight to quality in the debt markets   and the decline in equity values   As far as evidence on activity in the District is concerned, it's a mixed bag  Labor markets   remain tight and employment does continue to increase  Commercial construction is a distinct bright   spot--it's very strong--and home building has held up well  And, as I’ve commented before,   agricultural conditions turned out to be better this year than earlier anticipated, and farm incomes   and credit conditions were better as a consequence      47  On the less positive side, I would say that consumer spending has to be described as no   better than mediocre  Traffic in the malls and other places seems to be high, but spending doesn't   seem to be commensurate with the traffic  As for the auto industry, of course, auto dealers are   having a tough time  It's not hard to prompt them to use the word ""fear""  Clearly, inventories of   new cars are high; we are also hearing that inventories of used cars are quite high as well   Higher energy prices have adversely affected some manufacturers, forcing them either to   curtail activity or in some cases to shut down because of profitability concerns  In general, I would   say that profit margins are being squeezed in a variety of businesses  Price pressures in the District   seem to be confined mostly to the services sector   As far as the national economy is concerned, I think Dave Stockton did a good job of   summarizing the current economic situation  Specifically, it seems to me that a slowing in real   growth has occurred more rapidly and with more severity than I had earlier anticipated  This may   turn out to be temporary, as both the Greenbook and our forecasting models suggest, especially if   one interprets the slowing as simply a reduction from the 5 to 6 percent range we experienced part of   last year and this year to something more like 2 or 3 percent  But I must admit I am not entirely   comfortable with that interpretation, partly because of what I perceive to be the breadth of the   slowing and partly because I remember painfully from my forecasting days that one doesn't   recognize excessive inventories and high inventory/sales ratios until after the fact  The imbalances   become evident after sales turn out to be more disappointing than expected  However that may be, it   seems to me that going forward inflation is likely to level off and perhaps even abate a bit over time    Thank you  "
4253,2000-12-19,"  I generally support your recommendation  Let me briefly make two other   comments  First, I do share some of Bob Parry’s concerns that a statement about risks weighted   toward economic weakness is going to raise the question of why didn't we act now  Hopefully, we   will have some language in the announcement that will at least give a sense of our reasons   Secondly, and this is a point I’ve made before, I think we soon ought to consider putting at   least one nail in the NAIRU coffin  Not only has the economy failed to perform according to that   framework in the last five or six years but, so far as I'm aware, going back 15 or 16 years there just is   no evidence of an empirical relation between labor market conditions and inflation  "
4296,2001-03-20,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Sifting through the variety of   anecdotal reports we’ve been hearing on the region, it appears that our District economy   has performed about in line with what the national statistics have indicated for the   country, namely that growth has stabilized at a low rate  If we look at the District by   region, conditions are very mixed  The parts of the District that are doing well are   generally the metropolitan areas; the more rural areas that are dependent on natural   resources and manufacturing are struggling  If we look at the District by various sectors   of the economy, we see a similarly mixed picture, with some sectors doing quite nicely   and some having a difficult time  In general, one bright spot clearly is construction   activity, which remains healthy pretty much throughout the District  Another bright spot   is employment, with the continuation of tight labor markets  But those taut labor markets   are accompanied in some locations by reports of accelerated upward pressures on   compensation     3/20/01 49  At the national level, as I’ve already indicated, I have no disagreement with the   Greenbook’s estimate for growth in the current quarter  It appears likely to me that   growth will turn out to be around 1 percent plus or minus, very similar to rate in the   fourth quarter  That is, economic growth has stabilized at a low rate  Our model has the   economy gradually improving from here, quite similar to the general pattern in the   Greenbook forecast  I am concerned about the inventory correction process still ahead of   us, but presumably that is reflected in the Greenbook numbers  In addition, it seems to   me that significant risks stem from potential developments abroad  The list of foreign   economies that are facing difficulties of some kind seems disconcertingly long, and it   doesn’t seem likely to me that we will skate through all of those potential difficulties   without some reverberations     On the other hand, the US economy has proven quite resilient in the last 10 to   20 years  I think that is an important and fundamental characteristic, especially when   monetary policy has been providing support, which it seems likely to continue to do  "
4297,2001-03-20,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support your recommendation    I'm coming at this largely in the way Ned Gramlich described earlier  It seems to me that   the real federal funds rate should be moving lower, and a 50 basis point cut seems   appropriate  I don't know if that will turn out to be sufficient but I do think it will prove   to be constructive   I share your concerns about the potential of a false dawn here, though   obviously none of us can see the future very clearly  But another possibility--and perhaps   a better bet at least in my mind--is that rather than a V-shaped recovery we will get   initially just a very, very modest recovery  It may be similar to the type we had in the   early ’90s, when for a time there was a lot of concern about the fragility of the economy   and the sustainability of its performance  "
4341,2001-05-15,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  The latest evidence and anecdotal   information suggest that the District’s economy is not terribly different from what we’ve been   hearing for some time, nor does it differ from the situation the national statistics have depicted    The picture is rather mixed  The manufacturing sector continues to contract  Labor market   conditions appear to be easing and, as one looks around the cities and the countryside, the   prevalence of help-wanted signs has clearly diminished  On the other hand, construction activity,   both residential and nonresidential, remains strong  If anything, it has probably picked up a bit   recently, with the announcement of another major project or two in the Twin Cities metropolitan   area  Consumer spending appears to be growing modestly  The agricultural sector also would be   described as mixed, depending on weather and, of course, on prices  In fact, it may be a little   better than I would have expected because we are hearing scattered reports of some pickup in   capital spending by producers; they are buying new equipment such as pickup trucks and so forth    And, of course, the energy sector has benefited from higher prices   As far as the nation is concerned, my view of the prospects for the national economy is   roughly similar to that of the Greenbook  I think the next couple of quarters will be slow as   business firms continue to work through the inventory correction process  After that, I would   expect a gradual improvement in the rate of growth but certainly no sharp acceleration, as best I   can judge the outlook at the moment  If this pattern materializes, I would expect the   unemployment rate to continue to move up gradually  And my view of the outlook for inflation is   that it could well stabilize, with consumer price inflation in the neighborhood of 2-1/2 percent and   the PCE a little below that       5/15/01     48   I think the risks at this stage are roughly equally balanced  I say that because I don’t   consider the outlook all that ebullient and it’s not difficult to imagine it being better than my   forecast  On the other hand, I do believe there is some risk that we may encounter more inflation   than I, at least, expect and hope for  In the short run, my concerns are focused on my reading of   the compensation and ECI data for the last couple of years  But in the longer run, it’s really going   to depend on what policies we pursue  Having said that, I’ll resist the temptation to say anything   further about policy until later  "
4342,2001-05-15,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I share many of the general sentiments that   Presidents Broaddus and Minehan expressed  In fact, I think I could go a bit further and make a   reasonable case for why we ought to pause today  But given the tide, I won’t belabor that issue    Nevertheless, a key issue for me is the lag question  It’s certainly well acknowledged that there is   a lag between our actions and their effects on the economy  At some point we’re going to have to   remind market participants, probably in a relatively forceful way, of those lags  And at some   point we’re going to have to take that pause, probably well before there is altogether convincing   evidence that the economy is stabilizing and improving  I think that day is, if not here, not all that   far away  As a consequence, I believe we need to be quite cautious at this stage  "
4387,2001-08-21," Thank you, Mr Chairman  As I’ve commented before, and it continues   to be the case, the District economy for the most part is moving in lockstep with the national   economy  The District’s economy has slowed further, I would judge, but the slowing hasn't been   sharp As for labor market conditions, reported job vacancies are still considerable but they are   shrinking, and meanwhile layoffs are increasing  The weakness is most visibly concentrated in   the manufacturing and mining sectors, and participants in those sectors are not expecting any   material improvement until sometime next year   Both housing and nonresidential construction activity in our District remain healthy   and positive at the moment, although I think the seeds of some slowing are clearly visible now    Vacancy rates in commercial space are rising  So while there is a lot of current activity, the   rising vacancies will weigh on prospects for future projects  And while homebuilding activity   and sales also remain healthy, at the upper end of the market the pace of sales is clearly slowing   As has been the case for several months now, consumer spending and tourism activity   are at best mediocre  One exception, where things are a little better, is apparel sales  Why that's   the case, I’ve been unable to determine  But people in that business seem to be pleasantly   surprised with the sales they've been experiencing   One of the two bright spots in the District is the energy sector which, of course, has   benefited from price changes  The other is agriculture, where--in parts of the District that have   not been plagued by drought--farmers clearly are going to get both good crops and better prices   than they had earlier expected And we are hearing some scattered reports about spending on   durable goods by producers in those sectors for which prospects are looking up   As far as the national economy is concerned, I don't know that I would use the term   glum, but I find myself in substantial agreement with the Greenbook forecast  I believe that real     8/21/01 27   improvement in the pace of economic activity is still some time off and I think the improvement   is likely to be anemic, at least initially, when it occurs  I'm hard pressed to identify any   significant positive surprises in the latest batch of macroeconomic data that we have received    And the international situation is worse than I had anticipated earlier both because growth abroad   seems more sluggish than I had expected and because the recent decline in the dollar raises at   least a yellow flag in my mind  I agree that it's too early to reach any firm conclusions about   what that might portend but it does suggest to me that we should be paying at least some   attention to developments on the international front   I've commented before and I think it's still the case that the inventory correction   process has a ways to go As best I can judge with the benefit of hindsight, we clearly had a   capital spending bubble that has now collapsed  And that's not something that monetary policy   is inherently well positioned to deal with     If I wanted to be a bit more positive--and I think there's something to this--there may   be reasons to believe that consumer spending will hold up as long as the rise in unemployment   from this point is not too drastic  In that regard, I take some comfort in what's going on in the   housing market  Sales of both new and existing homes have been quite healthy for a long period   of time and, after all, the purchase of a house is a long-term commitment that people are willing   to make  Now, this may involve some asset reallocation, and obviously interest rates are   favorable Nevertheless, the fact that people are willing to undertake those kinds of long-term   commitments at the pace that has prevailed in recent months is a development I view as positive   Finally, I am comfortable with the Greenbook's relatively favorable inflation outlook    But in my view, what we now know about both productivity and compensation suggests that the   profit outlook is clearly negative     8/21/01 28  "
4388,2001-08-21," Thank you My interpretation of the course of policy is consistent with   what Don Kohn said at the outset That is, as best I can judge the situation, we’re trying to prop   up components of aggregate demand that are interest-rate sensitive until the inventory correction   process runs it course and until conditions and attitudes change in a favorable way for capital   spending I don’t think that’s an unreasonable policy and it’s probably the best available policy    As I’ve indicated before, I’m concerned about the lags and what they mean for our   future course of action But let me add that I’m not opposed to a quarter point reduction in the   funds rate at this stage I won’t get into the lag issue at any great length except to say that I     8/21/01 73   believe we are going to have to change course and adopt at least a policy of stability before   there’s totally persuasive evidence that the economy is reaccelerating in a major way  I say that   not because I think we’re going to be reluctant to change course when it’s appropriate but   because of what I would call the recognition lag  It’s very unlikely that the evidence will   accumulate in such a way that it will be entirely convincing that it’s time to stop easing policy    My experience with these situations in the past is that the evidence comes in mixed for an   extended period of time, so we’re going to have to make the best judgment we can as that   happens In addition, if we think about the timing of the published data--the anecdotes, of   course, may help--we won’t know if the economy has rebounded until well after the fact  Let’s   suppose, just for illustrative purposes, that the economy really starts to reaccelerate in the first   quarter Well, we won’t get all that much data on the first quarter until well into the second   quarter and the data are unlikely to be convincing until well into the third quarter  So I’m   concerned about that recognition lag going forward    Well, I sincerely hope you’re right but the proof is in the pudding  "
4433,2001-10-02," Thank you, Mr Chairman  Let me start with a quick rundown   of what’s going on in the District economy  Much of this was in the written report we   submitted earlier, although I do have some updates  Production was largely unaffected   by the events of September 11th, and that is still the case today  On the other hand,   consumer spending in the first few days following the attacks was essentially stopped in   its tracks But reports from large retailers in the District suggest that sales bounced back   quite quickly Now, I’m not talking about big-ticket items  This is exclusive of autos   and homes and so forth  But activity at malls--at discount stores and even department   stores--came back rather quickly to normal levels  I guess it’s also fair to say that   restaurants in the District have been surprisingly busy, at least in the last couple of weeks    Housing activity, which had been sound, remains sound  But as I reported at the last   meeting, sales at the high end of the market certainly seemed to be slowing, and that     10/2/01 41   continues to be the case My sense is that there is growing caution in that area and I   would be surprised if next year’s housing activity in the District came anywhere close to   the pace of the last two or three years   For the most part, nonresidential construction activity has continued unabated    There was, of course, a major expansion of the airport under way and that project has   slowed if not been put on hold  I don’t think that situation will go on for too long unless   people are prepared just to let the project rust as it sits there  There have been a lot of   cancellations of prospective conventions September and October are very big   convention months in Minneapolis, so that matters a good deal  The hotels are running   with low occupancy rates and other travel-related businesses are similarly affected  The   airports that I’ve been in at least have been very quiet, although Northwest Airlines has   reported some improvement in future bookings  I’m not sure exactly what to make of   that, but the airline people seem somewhat surprised about what’s coming down the pike     Obviously, the business community is of the opinion in general that aggressive   action both on the fiscal side and on the monetary policy side is appropriate here  I don’t   have to go very far out the door to hear somebody in the business community offer that   opinion One other development is that in the wake of all this, we lost one medium-sized   brokerage firm that was involved in an ill-advised securities lending transaction   As far as the national economy is concerned, in thinking about the outlook and   in listening to the staff discussion, the key word here is obviously uncertainty  I happen   to think that the near-term outlook is for more weakness than projected in the Greenbook,   but I wouldn’t put too much stock in any forecast  As many people have already said,   we’re in an environment that we really don’t know a lot about  Normally, when     10/2/01 42   uncertainty goes up, that implies to me the need for policy caution so as to avoid   significant errors  But in the current situation we can be fairly certain--or at least I am of   the opinion--that the downside risks have magnified and that the inflation risks have   diminished  In any event though, I’m not sure that economic policy is going to be key to   the relatively near-term future  I think what we need is tranquility at home and success   abroad  "
4434,2001-10-02, I support your recommendation  
4478,2001-11-06," I’ve been thinking about what we might see in some of the data that will be   published over the near term, in particular payroll employment and the impact of seasonal factors  I   assume, other things equal, that the seasonals anticipate an increase in employment in December and        11/6/01 25   probably in November, although I’m not sure, and then some runoff in the first part of next year  Is   that right?    Right So even if we don’t get further substantial employment reductions,   the seasonally adjusted numbers are likely to look fairly lousy    Okay, thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  As has been the case for some time, the District   economy is tracking closely with the national economy  There are some oases of strength but I don’t   think they are particularly representative, so I won’t spend a lot time on them     Overall labor market conditions have eased and layoffs and initial claims for   unemployment compensation are up  Office vacancy rates have begun to rise  That was certainly   anticipated Vacancy rates for other commercial properties are also rising and apartment vacancy   rates are increasing as well The expectation is that that will feed back on activity as projects   currently under construction wind down  It has been a very strong year for single-family   construction in the District but in that area, too, the outlook is less promising  Sales, especially at the   upper price end of the market, have slowed and I anticipate that the region will have a lot of trouble   next year duplicating the residential construction performance of the previous two or three years     There has been some tightening in credit conditions overall, but my impression from   talking to a variety of people is that decent quality credits can still be accommodated on reasonable   terms  So I don’t sense a huge amount of tension or a problem there     By way of a few more specific anecdotes, I talked to the leaders of a couple of national   retailers They described their business over the last four or five weeks as okay relative to reduced   expectations One cited same store sales as running about 1 percent ahead of a year ago; that’s   down, of course, from what typically had been the case  But retailers generally seemed to think that   things could have been worse, perhaps significantly worse  So that was their take on the situation   They also added that the discount business was doing better than the full service department store   business, which is not particularly a surprise   I talked to executives of a couple of large paper companies who also described their   business as okay relative, of course, to subdued expectations  That has been a business in which it     11/6/01 38   has been tough to make money for several years  Those executives were quite cautious about capital   spending going forward and didn’t put a lot of weight on whatever programs Congress might gin up,   but perhaps that view is specific to their industry  Finally, I talked to an official of a full service   financial services firm who said that their sales of a wide variety of investment products have been   quite robust recently   As far as the national economy is concerned, I’m in general agreement with the contours   of the Greenbook forecast I suspect that the contraction in the current quarter may be a bit deeper   than is projected in the Greenbook and it may take an extra quarter before we see a recovery   sometime next year  Those are pretty much guesses on my part  Talking to business people in the   community, their views are along the same lines  They expect business conditions to get worse   before they get better and that the recovery will occur later rather than sooner  But having said that,   we do know that the economy is very resilient even without the stimulus in place or in prospect    And, of course, we do have a lot of monetary stimulus in place and it appears to me that more fiscal   stimulus is likely  This resilience is something that I think we need to bear in mind  Its implication,   to me anyway, is that we want to calibrate policy very carefully from here on out so that we give   ourselves at least a chance of winding up in the right place for a sustainable period  "
4479,2001-11-06," I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman, although I think Don did   make good arguments for both of the alternatives he described  I am a bit concerned that if the tenor   of the economy doesn’t change until sometime in the spring, say, we’re going to run the risk of   either overdoing it or at some point having to disappoint market expectations  That risk may not be   huge in this environment; it is there nevertheless   "
4529,2001-12-11," Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’m not sure I have a lot to add at this point, so   let me be brief  I’ve reported for a long time now that the District economy has been tracking the   national economy rather closely  As a generalization that still is the case, but let me make a few   comments about things that are a little different or new     Clearly, labor market conditions in the District have eased--that is not new--but the   unemployment rate has actually risen very little to this point And I would have to say, as best I can   judge from anecdotal reports, that holiday hiring was better than I had anticipated earlier  The major   retailers I’ve spoken with seem satisfied so far with holiday sales--relative to their subdued   expectations let me add  Nevertheless, they are not complaining inordinately about what they are   seeing The pattern in sales that has been evident for quite some time--with discounters doing better   than full service department stores and specialty apparel people somewhere in the middle--seems to be   continuing, based on same-store sales data and discussions with these retailers  The large retailers also   indicate that they have made no adjustments to their capital spending plans for the next year or so    History tells them that if they cut back, they will find that they’ve done it just as the economy starts to   improve and will wish they had proceeded with the additional stores  So, on those grounds, they   haven’t changed their capital spending plans     In conversations with some people from several large financial services firms, we hear that   their business with consumers remains very active both in terms of demands for credit and sales of   financial instruments, though demands from the business side are slow  And finally, while     12/11/01 48    commercial construction activity is slowing in the District, housing activity as measured either by   construction or sales continues to be reasonably robust  It certainly has held up longer and better than   I would have expected by this stage   As far as the national economy is concerned, I’m more confident than I have been for some   time that something like the Greenbook forecast will materialize  The basic story as I see it is that the   strength in consumer spending is restraining the weakness this quarter  There will be some payback   for that next quarter but then a more sustained improvement will get under way  The latest data   indicate to me that, if nothing else, the economy is clearly in a process of stabilizing  It is not falling   off a cliff And as I said, I find the Greenbook story reasonably convincing, although I would   certainly not be astonished if it took another quarter or so for the recovery to get under way  I think   timing is always a matter of considerable uncertainty     As I’ve commented before, housing activity is a measure we might consider in thinking   about the mindset of the consumer  After all, the purchase of a house is a long-term commitment    When people are willing to buy a new home, that involves a 15- or 30-year commitment, even   allowing for sales and refinancings and so forth  And the housing activity numbers continue to   suggest to me that consumer confidence remains reasonably healthy      I would also note that whenever economic activity starts to pick up, it’s likely to take us   some time to recognize that upturn unless all series turn positive at once  My experience is that that   rarely, if ever, happens So even if the economy starts to improve in the second quarter my guess is   we won’t recognize that with much confidence until the third or the fourth quarter  I would think, by   the way, that the unemployment rate is going to continue to go up for some time  That seems to me to   be almost baked in the cake     Finally, I will restrain myself and not discuss policy preferences at the moment     12/11/01 49   "
4530,2001-12-11," Thank you, Mr Chairman  I would prefer to leave policy unchanged today    Let me quickly sketch out the elements of my reasoning  Part of it I touched on earlier  I do think that   the story in the mainstream Greenbook forecast is a reasonably convincing one and I’m certainly more   confident about the outlook than I have been for the past several meetings  Is it a done deal?  Of   course not, but that I think is too high a bar We’re not going to know that for quite some time  It   does seem to me that the recent spate of data suggests that the economy is stabilizing  Not only do the   data suggest that but a lot of market participants are expecting that, based on the way financial assets   are being priced And at least in my view our economy has a history of being resilient and largely   self-correcting Beyond that, I think policy has been very expansionary  I’m not talking just about   aggressive reductions in interest rates, although we have done that  We have also had very rapid   growth in the monetary aggregates and it would be a shock to me if we got deflation, given the kind of   growth we've had in money for some time now  I don’t know how fiscal policy will play out, but I   would guess that we will get some added fiscal stimulus  And while it’s certainly true that if this   further reduction in rates turns out to be a mistake we can reverse direction when needed, it’s possibly   destabilizing--though I don’t want to overstate this--to embark on that kind of policy path  So for that   combination of reasons, recognizing that perhaps no one of them is convincing by itself, I would   prefer to stay where we are  "
4587,2002-03-19," Thank you, Mr Chairman  My issue was similar to Bill Poole’s  I’m   concerned about getting involved with GNMAs because of what that may lead to with regard to   the pressure to make outright purchases of  Fannies and Freddies, which I think would be a huge   mistake  So despite all the imperfections, if I had to vote, I would vote in favor of looking at the   foreign RP pool first    Well, I can be very brief  I agree with the comments that Al and Jack   made  And as far as the TV camera is concerned, I suspect the ratings would be disappointing, to   say the least! [Laughter]  "
4588,2002-03-19," Thank you, Mr Chairman  While the news on the District economy is still   somewhat mixed, I would have to say that in general it has been on the positive side, perhaps   surprisingly positive  Hiring has resumed  Activity in the manufacturing sector has stabilized   and begun to expand Mining activity on the iron range in northern Minnesota and the Upper   Peninsula of Michigan has started to pick up, and that was true even before the tariffs on   imported steel were announced  And for the most part, the economies in the western part of the   District are reported to be doing well  Residential construction is a particularly bright spot    Some builders have indicated that they are booked out into 2003, although cancellations are   always possible I’m hearing very little about inflationary pressures, though of course one can   find particular items about which people have some price concerns  Business attitudes are the   one thing that continues to concern me because I think business people are still uncertain and   quite cautious about the economic environment I suspect that is largely because of their   concerns about profits going forward And I suspect that some at least are still adjusting with   some difficulty to an environment of price stability  Retailers have generally done well in the   District and, as Bill Poole mentioned, inventories in the retail arena are low  So if positive sales   surprises continue, that will lead to substantial ordering and presumably to increases in   production   On the national scene, I have few comments to make  For some time, there have been   reasons to be optimistic, and now I don’t think it’s going out on a limb to say that the recovery is   at hand I’m impressed by the size of the upward revision to the Greenbook forecast  I, too, was     March 19, 2002 Page 49 of 117  earlier thinking that growth would be in the neighborhood of 3 percent this year  I’m not   inclined to change my view on that just yet, partially because there’s noise in the data and   partially because I think there may be some payback effect yet to come from the consumer side    But if we do get growth of something like 3 percent, which is below the Greenbook forecast, I   would still consider that to be a very satisfactory, or maybe better than satisfactory, year  "
4589,2002-03-19," I, too, support your recommendation, Mr Chairman  Let me just make   one additional comment  We’ve been looking recently at what I suppose I would generously call   some low inflation policy rules  While recognizing that beauty is frequently in the eyes of the   beholder, the implication of these rules, at least at the moment, is that there is no need to move   today  "
4632,2002-05-07," You’re the boss! [Laughter]    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Overall the tenor of the anecdotes in the Ninth   District has improved recently Let me just give you a quick rundown of that  Housing and   residential construction, which has been a bright spot, remains a bright spot  Activity is strong,   and sales of upper-end homes, which had slowed for a time, have picked up dramatically   recently  Auto sales remain healthy  Consumer spending overall seems reasonably strong, and   people are quite optimistic about the outlook for the upcoming tourist season  Reports in the   mining and energy sector are mixed, but reports in manufacturing have improved recently  And   there are some signs of a modest amount of hiring going on throughout the District  In response               May 7, 2002 46 of 81  to the issue that arose earlier, I have heard no anecdotes whatsoever about stress stemming from   demands by employers on those currently employed to work longer hours or whatever  That   kind of anecdote just doesn’t seem to be around  I would say that there is little anticipation of an   acceleration of inflation But there are lots of concerns about some prices, particularly insurance   premiums  And finally, I’d say that the outlook for nonresidential construction has in general   deteriorated; on the other hand, this will probably be a record year for highway construction   activity and some related transportation construction   As far as the national economy is concerned, I think we are at the point—we’re already   seeing this—where we’re going to hear a lot about the fragility of the recovery  This tends to go   with the territory, in my recollection  Part of it is just a response to the nature of the incoming   data And partly, of course, it reflects the fundamental fact that not all sectors of the economy   pick up or pick up robustly in the same period of time  I think we should recall that the economy   tends to be very resilient, as demonstrated by the length and persistence and durability of the last   two expansions despite some significant shocks along the way  Having said that, I think the   Greenbook forecast is a pretty good place to start as far as the outlook is concerned  If I had to   make a bet, I might reduce the second half of this year and take a bit off the first half of next year   just because my instinct is that capital spending will be a little slower to come along than is   anticipated in the Greenbook But I wouldn’t make a big deal of that  In my view the outlook   for growth is satisfactory as is the near-term outlook for inflation    "
4633,2002-05-07, I agree also  
4685,2002-08-13," Thank you, Mr Chairman  Most, but not all, of the anecdotes and   readings on the District economy have been positive  Retail sales and consumer spending   continue to advance That’s true of autos, but it’s also true outside the auto sector as well,   according to the reports we get  Spring and summer tourism has been pretty good in most parts   of the District  The agricultural situation actually has improved  To the extent that there were   drought conditions in our District, for the most part that has been relieved The energy sector in            western North Dakota and eastern Montana is operating at a relatively high rate  The   employment situation is mixed, with no change in white-collar employment but some    improvement in hiring of production and temporary workers  And while there certainly are no   broad-based signs of inflation, some materials prices are reportedly moving up     August 13, 2002 48 of 92  Nonresidential construction activity is slow, and vacancy rates, especially for Class B and   lower-rated buildings, are high and rising Residential construction activity and all that   surrounds it, including sales and permits and so forth, remain very favorable  Reportedly, for   example, home prices in the Twin Cities are up 15 percent over the past year  Meanwhile,   though, apartment vacancy rates have increased, and I think rents are stabilizing and perhaps   even weakening a bit  And at some point the relative price shift will feed back into relative   changes in activity  But I think that’s probably some time off   Let me offer a few thoughts about the national economy and outlook  We’ve already   talked a lot about that Obviously, I don’t want to dismiss the disappointing nature of the   incoming aggregate data we’ve seen, the revisions, and the weakness in equity values  But I   don’t want to exaggerate it or overreact to it either  I haven’t changed my forecast of the   economy over the next six quarters or so  My forecast was a little lower than the Greenbook’s as   of the last meeting, and now we’re closer together  We really don’t know whether the economy   is going to grow at a rate of 2½ percent or 3½ percent, just to throw out a couple of numbers,   over the second half of this year But it seems to me that the outlook remains basically   satisfactory As many people have commented already, policies, both fiscal and monetary, seem   to be expansionary  I do think that we will see some material improvement in spending on   equipment and software next year, and I believe consumer spending will continue to advance    And as I’ve noted before, when we see the activity we’re seeing in housing and homebuilding         August 13, 2002 49 of 92  and people’s willingness to make fifteen- to thirty-year commitments, which is inherent in most   purchases, it seems to me that consumers remain relatively positive about their circumstances   and about the outlook Finally, history is on our side in the sense that the economy has proven to   be resilient in the past and I think it’s proving to be resilient again  After all, we’ve had three   consecutive quarters of growth, albeit modest growth, following September 11  And if you had   told me back in September or October that that was the performance we were going to get, I   certainly would have been pleasantly surprised  "
4686,2002-08-13," Thank you, Mr Chairman  I can support your recommendation  As Vince   reminded us, earlier in the year market participants had priced in a significant and relatively early   tightening of policy As it turned out, I think we were well advised not to act on that  Now they   are pricing in some easing of policy soon if not immediately, and personally I think we are wise   today not to react to that either  I would offer one caution about changing the bias in the risk   statement, although I can certainly go along with it  It’s one thing if we want to whipsaw   ourselves a little by changing the forecast as the numbers come in  But I think we should be   careful about having that feed into the financial markets and potentially the real economy  Now,   obviously what we’re talking about doing here is not likely to have a profound impact    Nevertheless, I think there is a potential for trying to overanalyze the incoming data and to   exaggerate the possibility that somehow a new trend has been established            August 13, 2002 80 of 92 "
4737,2002-09-24," Thank you Dave, you mentioned along the way that the initial claims   data seemed more consistent with small declines in employment rather than small increases, and   yet you’ve maintained the small increases in the Greenbook forecast  Could you give me a sense   of your thinking that has led to that more optimistic conclusion?    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be brief because in my view very little has   changed on balance since our discussion at the last meeting  As far as the District economy is   concerned, perhaps one way to characterize it is to distinguish between the consumer and   business sectors The consumer sector continues pretty much as we have been discussing around   the table for a good number of months now  Spending at retail has been strong—autos, of        September 24, 2002 52 of 115  course, have done very well—and tourism activity has been good  Housing continues to do well,   and home improvement spending is another notable bright spot     The agricultural sector has picked up in many parts of the District where the drought has   been alleviated Problems still persist in a few places, but geographically the drought area has   diminished, so in fact agriculture is doing a little better  And based on anecdotal reports, it   appears that the labor market is showing a few more signs of activity across a broader range of   job opportunities, so that’s a plus On the other hand, in manufacturing and related businesses,   activity is pretty quiet, as it has been for some time  Little has changed there   As far as the nation is concerned, I guess it’s repetitious to say, but I think an economy   with modest growth and low inflation is the most likely outcome and an acceptable one  We ran   the incoming monthly and quarterly data through our VAR forecasting model, and it produced   basically the same forecast for this meeting that it did for the previous meeting  I take that to   mean that the model didn’t interpret the incoming data as providing any large surprises or that   any surprises were offsetting My point is that the outlook doesn’t seem to have changed very   much based on what has happened over the intermeeting period   I do continue to think that a significant and broadly based expansion in business spending   is probably still some time off  There has been some discussion, of course, of the jobless   recovery, and that is not a preferable outcome  However, if we look back at 1990-91, as I   recall—depending on exactly how one interprets the data—it took a year and maybe as much as   two years before we saw some really significant and sustained increases in employment    Nevertheless, that expansion turned out to be a very long lived and healthy one  One   observation, of course, doesn’t make a trend, so I don’t think we ought to draw too many   conclusions from that except to say that we may be well served by some continued patience         September 24, 2002 53 of 115 "
4738,2002-09-24," I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman, and I would remain open   minded about whether we will need to react in the intermeeting period or not  But I would   caution against responding to what are inherently noisy data—we’ve had a lot of experience with   that—and also against holding ourselves to a standard of previous Greenbook forecasts  I say   that because, as Bill Poole mentioned, for the most part the results this year have come out pretty   much as expected if one were to put any realistic confidence interval around those forecasts    They certainly have been largely consistent with what I expected for the year as whole when I   submitted my forecasts in January and July    I agree with him, too; more communication is better than less        September 24, 2002 105 of 115 "
4795,2002-11-06," Let me start with recent changes in District economic conditions, which   generally have been modest—and not all of them have been negative  The housing sector         November 6, 2002 45 of 122  continues to be a very bright spot, and even homes priced at the upper end of the market seem to   be continuing to move fairly rapidly  Labor markets are steady, I would say, but not strong    Manufacturing appears to be stable  We participated in a survey with the Minnesota Department   of Trade and Economic Development, and I at least was somewhat surprised by the reports  I   wouldn’t say the tone was one of optimism, but most manufacturers seemed to feel that their   businesses were stabilizing and that the outlook, at least for the second half of the year, wasn’t   too bad Now, that survey was completed in September, and conditions may have deteriorated   since then But that was the message we got at the time   I talked with a couple of senior executives from large firms in the paper industry who   pretty much confirmed that sense of the business outlook  Certainly, they weren’t in despair  I   would characterize those conversations as reports that business was tough but not awful  It was   possible to make money  They were profitable but, of course, not as profitable as the business   executives would have liked A similar conversation with a couple of senior executives in the   publishing business had the same tone and tenor   Consumer spending has been mediocre at best recently, although one remaining bright   spot outside of housing is tourism activity, which has been pretty good during the fall, and   reportedly early inquiries for next summer have been fairly strong  Finally, I would say that   commercial construction has taken another turn down     As far as the outlook for the national economy is concerned, I don’t have a significant   alternative to the Greenbook forecast to suggest, but I will distinguish between what I think I   know and what I think I don’t know I’m very uncertain about whether growth in real GDP will   pick up next quarter or sometime later next year; it may not happen until 2004 or perhaps beyond   that What I think I know, or at least what I’m less uncertain about, is that productivity is on a         November 6, 2002 46 of 122  strong and favorable trend, inflation is low and likely to stay low, and inflationary expectations   are low and likely to stay low Thank you  "
4796,2002-11-06," Mr Chairman, I support the 50 basis point reduction in the funds rate   target I think there’s a good chance that it’s the right thing to do  But even if it’s not, as you   already suggested, the risks of taking this action seem low basically because of the situation in   which we could find ourselves with regard to productivity and current and prospective inflation     As far as the balance of risks is concerned, despite the nature of the disappointing news   coming in, I suspect the risks aren’t all that unbalanced to begin with  So I have no problem with   moving to a balanced risk statement  "
4844,2002-12-10," Thank you, Mr Chairman  I would describe District economic conditions   as mixed  Somewhat surprisingly, at least to me, manufacturing does appear to be improving   modestly and the improvement seems rather broadly based  We see it in the production of basic   materials, in some industrial equipment, and in some higher-tech products as well  I don’t want   to overstate this, but I’ve been a bit surprised at what we’ve been hearing and seeing in the   manufacturing sector    Residential construction and residential real estate in general remain very healthy  That   trend, of course, has been in place for a long time and is consistent with most of the information   that we’ve been getting at the national level  Labor markets I would describe as relatively stable;   they haven’t been improving, but they haven’t been deteriorating further And if anything, local   unemployment rates have drifted down a bit  Consumer spending appears to be mediocre, as   best I can judge I don’t know how holiday sales are going to turn out, but I don’t have the sense   at the moment that the year is going to be all that exciting in that regard     Despite these conditions, which I would characterize as mediocre, I think business   attitudes remain quite sour  What I hear from a lot of business people is that conditions are no   better than they were a year ago  From their perspective I think there’s a sense of frustration that   no demonstrable improvement has occurred over the last several quarters                                                     As far as the national economy is concerned, I’m reasonably comfortable with something   like the Greenbook forecast for the next four or five quarters, for several reasons  I won’t go   through all of them, but I’ll mention a few  One is that I do think we’ll get more fiscal stimulus;         December 10, 2002 45 of 87  and monetary policy is stimulative as well  That, in my view, augurs well for future economic   performance  Moreover, I think the economy is fundamentally quite resilient  Jerry Jordan   already commented on that, and I won’t elaborate  But that resilience has been demonstrated   repeatedly in the last twenty years  I also believe that productivity is on a favorable trend that is   likely to persist   I would reiterate a point that was touched on in the earlier discussion of deflation  It   seems to me that, with strong productivity improvement under way in two very, very large   economies, the United States and China, and given what that implies for pressure on producers in   some other countries, downward price pressure around the world should not be unexpected  If   deflation were to materialize in this circumstance, when productivity is growing very rapidly, I   wouldn’t be at all surprised if it didn’t turn out to be relatively benign if not constructive  Thank   you  "
4845,2002-12-10," I, too, support your recommendation  My only concern is whether you   intend to bank that hour and a half that you didn’t use!  [Laughter]  "
4897,2003-03-18,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I would describe the District economy as   stable, and I do think that’s probably the right term  There doesn’t seem to be any appreciable   deterioration at this point, but at the same time there’s little net growth  Employment for the   most part is flat, although at the far western and eastern ends of the District we do have   somewhat more favorable reports  But those are relatively thinly populated areas, with relatively   small economies  If one talks to our directors and other business people about their hiring plans,   fundamentally they don’t have any, which is to say that they’re not intending to add to their   employment levels anytime soon  There is still a lot of optimism surrounding the housing sector,   but I have the sense that in at least some of the larger markets the builders now have gotten   ahead of demand, and that will obviously have implications for activity as time goes on    Consumer spending ex-autos appears to be close to flat, and of course, auto sales have been   softer recently as reflected in the national numbers   As far as the national economy is concerned, I would make several maybe semi-random   points  First of all, the downward adjustment to the Greenbook forecast for real growth in the   current and subsequent quarter looks right to me  I think that’s consistent with the tenor of the   incoming national data and is certainly congruent with the anecdotes that I’ve been picking up as   March 18, 2003 41 of 101    well  At the same time I don’t have the sense that the longer-term outlook in the Greenbook has   changed any as we get to later this year and into 2004  I also think that’s appropriate  I haven’t   changed my longer-run view  To be sure, there’s a tremendous amount of uncertainty  But those   of us who’ve been at this for a while also know that there’s a great tendency toward getting   whipsawed if one puts a lot of emphasis on the last observation or two and not so much on the   evidence regarding underlying fundamentals  I think the fundamentals underpinning the longer-  run outlook, which looks pretty favorable to me, are still in place  I won’t go through the entire   litany, but I will point to the productivity numbers that some people have already cited and to the   continued growth in disposable income     I do believe, and this is the view in the Greenbook as well, that employment is going to   be slow to pick up  We saw that following the 1990-91 recession  But my reason for expecting   that is not just historical precedent  For businesses there’s a lot of pressure on the top line and on   the bottom line  In that environment, adding to employment is just not a change that’s going to   come very quickly  Further, I do suspect that the near-term risks to the economy are probably on   the downside  That’s a suspicion, not really a conviction  But whether it’s right or not, I think   we’re already positioned for that possibility  Policy has reacted, and interest rates are clearly   low  I’m not sure that we’ll necessarily get a great deal of clarification regarding the outlook   even if the conflict with Iraq goes very well  I’d like to think we would  But there are a lot of   other problems around the world, some of which could even be exacerbated depending on how   the situation in Iraq plays out  Finally, in my view this is the time to avoid over-guessing and   acting as if we know more than we do  There’s a tremendous amount of uncertainty, and it’s   probably going to pay to be patient and cautious and see how things unfold  "
4898,2003-03-18,  I support your recommendation  
4946,2003-05-06,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  As far as the District economy is concerned,   we have the usual mixed bag of readings on activity  But overall I would say that the recent   tenor of the incoming information has been perhaps a bit better  What I’m going to discuss is   based a little on data but comes mostly from anecdotes heard at a recent meeting of our Advisory   Council on Small Business, Agriculture, and Labor and at a meeting with the leaders of the Twin   Cities financial community   Housing has continued to be a bright spot, at least through March  All indicators of   housing activity in the District have been quite favorable  As far as the industrial sector is   concerned, I would say that, at worst, conditions have stabilized, and some small manufacturers   are suggesting that activity is picking up  The trucking industry in our part of the world seems to   be quite busy, although the large amount of consolidation in that industry may be a contributing   May 6, 2003 37 of 115    factor  But I would say that overall there is certainly some optimism among small manufacturers   and others in industry that the next six months will be better than the last six to twelve months    Consumer spending for the most part has held up, and credit quality doesn’t seem to be a   concern among the vast preponderance of banks  On the negative side, there certainly has been   no discernible improvement in labor market conditions, and no dramatic increases in hiring   appear to be under way  Pressures on state and local government budgets persist, and we haven’t   seen all of the ramifications of that yet  The major airline based in Minneapolis is suffering, as   are most of the other major airlines, although to date its problems aren’t quite as severe as some   of the higher profile ones that we are all aware of   Finally, based on conversations with our contacts, there doesn’t seem to be any reason to   expect a quick acceleration in capital spending  The story I got on that really has three parts,   some of which are related  One is clearly what I would call a productivity story  Businesses   simply have found ways to produce more with the same inputs  They were quite explicit about   that, and they seem to feel that it has some way to go  Related to that, there is very little pressure   on capacity so there’s no stimulus to business capital investment coming from capacity   pressures  Moreover, some businesses, as others have commented already, have been busy   restructuring their balance sheets and want to get that completed before they contemplate sizable   capital spending projects     As far as the evidence on the national economy is concerned, I read it the way others   have done, I think  Clearly it has been on the soft side, which has produced what I would   expect—caution among forecasters and among the business community  I share that caution at   this stage  But I try to remind myself that there’s always the danger of getting whipsawed here   by marking down the forecast just as conditions are about to get better or vice versa  One thing I   May 6, 2003 38 of 115    know for sure from the days when I was doing a lot of bottom-up forecasting is that, in sluggish   circumstances such as this, it’s very hard to convince yourself that economic activity is actually   going to pick up  It’s just the nature of the beast  Today, outside of defense spending, it’s hard   to envision an acceleration in most of the components of aggregate demand Yet we know from   history that sooner or later the economy does pick up, especially when the fundamentals—and by   fundamentals I’m talking here about productivity and the stance of monetary policy and fiscal   policy—are favorable     But in addition, I view Dino’s description of financial market developments, with   essentially a rise in equity prices in many parts of the world and declining credit-quality spreads,   as confirming what we already know, which is that in the past several weeks the big things have   gone right  By that I mean that the war ended successfully and quickly, energy prices came   down significantly and rapidly, and earnings have been at least no worse than earlier feared or   expected  All of that gives me some comfort, but it doesn’t help me answer the question as to   when we might actually see some acceleration in economic growth  "
4947,2003-05-06,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Let me start first by commenting on the   statement, which I like a lot  It may not be perfect, but I consider it a distinct improvement so I   think we should go with it  As for policy, on balance I agree with you that we’re probably better   off not acting today  Not only are financial markets fragile, but they can also be fickle  We   don’t want to do anything that will set them off unnecessarily  I think Bill’s and Don’s argument   is right that this statement conveys much the same sentiment as a funds rate cut  But it’s still   different from taking an easing action because people in the market know that we’re going to be   reading the incoming information on the economy, as are they  So I feel more comfortable   deferring any action until June depending on the nature of the incoming information   "
5002,2003-08-12,"  Yes, speaking of productivity, the numbers in the Greenbook forecast for   next year that jumped out at me were the very large employment gains and the very slow   August 12, 2003 19 of 110    productivity improvement  I’d like to know the intuition underpinning those projections because   I’m not sure those are the numbers I’d write down if I were trying to forecast them     Thank you, Mr Chairman  As far as the Ninth District is concerned,   overall economic activity is stable to improving  Let me just cite a few examples of that  On a   year-over-year basis, employment is stable in virtually all District states, but I’d say that the   undertone of the labor market has improved  There clearly are stirrings of net hiring, in   August 12, 2003 44 of 110    particular for some higher skilled positions  I can probably make the same set of statements for   manufacturing  Most measures indicate that activity in that sector has been stable in recent   months  But again there seem to be some hints of a greater level of optimism among at least   some producers  Residential construction, which of course has been a bright spot, is still up   significantly on a year-over-year basis  The same is true for sales and prices of houses  So that   sector continues to do well  Of course, that was the situation before the recent increase in   mortgage rates, but I’ll be surprised if that increase has a material effect on activity in the   housing sector, in the short run at least   Surprisingly, there are some new projects under way in nonresidential construction   activity, mostly expansion of hospitals and other health care facilities and some office building   construction in a few of the medium-sized cities in the District  Finally, after a slow start,   tourism activity seems to have picked up in many parts of the District, and that apparently has   brought with it some improvement in retail sales as well, mostly in the tourist centers  So overall   I would say that the situation in the District is improving, although probably not at a rapid rate    As far as the national economy is concerned, many people have observed already—and I   agree—that the latest actual data are clearly on the more positive side  But I would sound a   somewhat cautionary note here  We know that those data are unreliable; they can be subject to   significant revisions; and one or two months don’t make a trend  Nevertheless, given the   improvement in the data and given that the stimulus we’re all anticipating and have talked about   is now upon us, I do think some acceleration—probably significant—in economic activity going   forward is likely  That said, the precise timing remains open to question, at least in my mind     Clearly there is no real inflation or inflationary pressure in front of us, as best I can judge,   and that prospect could be reinforced if productivity is better than the Greenbook forecast   August 12, 2003 45 of 110    suggests for next year  Part and parcel of that scenario is the likelihood that employment will be   slower to pick up as we go forward or that employment gains will be more modest than is   typically the case  But with real growth continuing, an acceleration in growth in prospect, and   inflation low, it seems to me that overall the economy is in pretty good shape  "
5003,2003-08-12,"  I, too, support your recommendation, Mr Chairman  I would comment   that what struck me about your remarks was the discussion about who has the right model—  whether the Federal Reserve does or the market does  Of course, there are lots of other   possibilities  In that regard I have to admit that I’m less concerned about further disinflation or   even deflation than perhaps many others around the table  It’s true that we’ve had a positive   productivity shock in the United States, China, India, and probably parts of Central and Eastern   Europe, and I’m no doubt leaving out some important places  But it’s not clear to me that we   ought to be as concerned as I think we are about further reductions in the rate of inflation     August 12, 2003 80 of 110   "
5026,2003-09-15,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  First of all, I count myself among those who   don’t think that our current policies are all that bad and in need of a major overhaul  I agree with   most, but not all, of the comments that President Moskow just made  So let me offer a few quick   suggestions and express a couple of concerns  As I understood your conversation with Bob   Parry, one suggestion is to use the Bluebook more extensively to spell out some alternatives and   give at least a rough idea of the language that would go with them  Whether that’s alternative 4   September 15, 2003 52 of 78    in Vincent’s material, I’m not sure  In any event, I think that’s a constructive suggestion, and we   ought to think about trying to implement that over time     Second, I think we should try to accelerate the release of the minutes whatever we do   with the statement  In other words, I don’t think moving up the publication of the minutes is   contingent upon what we put in the statement  I believe the minutes are an underutilized asset    We spend a good deal of time and go to a lot of trouble to prepare them as it is, and then we   release them at a time when people are no longer interested in them  It seems to me that they are   an accurate representation of what has been discussed at a meeting, and we ought to try to get   them out while they’re still relevant  In my view they would do a better job of providing a   description and conveying the nuances of what was going on at the meeting than anything else   that we could do  So if I would urge anything strongly, it would be the earlier release of the   minutes  I personally believe that whatever added resources it would take to accomplish that   would probably be well worth it     Yes     That could be  But if Jack is right, I won’t take him fishing again!    [Laughter]     I have a couple of concerns, and one of them Michael just expressed  I   don’t know what it means to say “the risks to economic growth are weighted toward the upside”    Presumably what we mean is that higher growth could lead to higher inflation  But that ought to   be captured by the inflation statement  Now, maybe some other meaning is intended  If so, I   must say that it’s not obvious to me what that would be  If we stay with the language we have   here, sooner or later it’s going to come back to haunt us  So I’m concerned about the   connotation of the word “risks”     My final thought is a response to one of the questions that Vincent raised  Can we sum   up the risks to inflation or price stability and the risks to the real outlook?  I’m a little   uncomfortable with that  We’ve been doing it, and I don’t think it has caused any serious   problems yet  But Ned and a few others have raised some concerns about that at previous   meetings, and logically I’m just not sure that it is the best of all possible approaches   September 15, 2003 54 of 78      Right     I thought that was a very good idea at the time  But we might want to   reflect earlier rather than later on how we may want to change this going forward because I do   believe that it could get awkward     Right   "
5080,2003-09-16,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Overall, the data on the District economy and   the anecdotes that have come in indicate that, as usual, it is tracking quite closely with the   national economy  So the regional economy is improving  Consumer spending is strengthening   pretty much across the board, and some auto dealers report that this clearly will be their best year   ever  Residential construction spending remains strong  Commercial construction for the most   part remains rather soft, and I’d say the leaders of the large commercial construction firms in the   District continue to be concerned about the outlook, although there has been a pickup of   construction activity in some of the midsized cities in the District  Manufacturing activity is   improving overall, particularly for firms that make products related to housing  There are some   signs of improvement in employment there as well  Although I’d say that overall employment is   probably stable in the District, there are signs of some net hiring under way  Perhaps the only   reservation I’d note about the signs of improvement we’ve seen lately is that overall business   attitudes still appear to be very cautious     As far as the national outlook is concerned, the general contours of the Greenbook   forecast—namely, reasonably rapid growth over the next two plus years and subdued inflation—  seem to me to be fairly well grounded and justified at this point  If I have any reservation about   the forecast, it relates to the productivity/employment split  Clearly there will be a cyclical   improvement in the labor market at some point  But the gains in employment forecast for a good   chunk of next year and into 2005 strike me at this stage as somewhat unlikely, in part because I   think the productivity improvement we’re seeing is going to prove to be longer-lived than the   Greenbook forecasters apparently anticipate  As far as manufacturing is concerned, I think that   at some point there will be a cyclical improvement in employment in that sector as well, but I   September 16, 2003 51 of 106    believe it’s worth bearing in mind that manufacturing employment in this country actually   peaked in 1979 and it hasn’t surpassed that peak since  "
5081,2003-09-16,"  One for 28!     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I certainly support leaving the federal funds   rate target at 1 percent  As for the other issues, the overriding concern in my mind is the   potential reaction in the marketplace  I will say a bit more about that in a minute  Because of   that I feel rather constrained as to what we can or should do at this meeting  So I will certainly   accept your recommendation on the balance of risks statement, although my instinct is to agree   September 16, 2003 87 of 106    with those who feel that the risks on the inflation side are moving in the direction of balance  If   they’re not balanced yet, I think they may well be shortly  Also because I feel constrained, the   language you’re proposing here on fostering the containing of disinflationary forces is okay with   me  But presumably the reason we want to tread slowly and carefully here is that we’re   concerned about creating all sorts of turmoil in the financial markets  The likelihood of that is   hard to gauge  I’m certainly prepared to go along with this, but I do think that concern is the   reason to proceed cautiously  And it’s not just the question of the reaction of the financial   markets but what that reaction could do to what we think is a gathering momentum in the   economy  "
5139,2003-10-28,  No maybe about that!  
5140,2003-10-28,"  Dave, I have a couple of questions related to the labor market and other   variables  For quite some time you’ve forecast a very strong improvement in employment   beginning relatively early next year and extending through 2005  I assume at the end of the day   that it must be intuition rather than a purely model-based result  Do you have any anecdotes or   other information that would give me greater confidence than I have at the moment that   something like that result is likely?  Of course, it’s accompanied by well below trend growth in   structural productivity for that whole period     Well, let me pursue this one step further  Obviously, we can get this path   of real GDP growth with almost any combination of hours and productivity growth  If we got   employment gains of, say, 200,000 to 250,000 a month rather than 300,000 to 340,000 a month   going forward and the difference was made up by productivity, to what extent would that mix   give you a different inflation forecast?  I don’t know the interworkings of your model that well,   but I assume it would give you even lower inflation in a more or less base case environment than   the scenario you presented     It would give us deflation?     Well, I think some improvement is under way  I question whether it’s   going to reach the magnitudes you have projected in the Greenbook   October 28, 2003 24 of 126      Okay     Thank you, Mr Chairman  A preponderance of the reports on the District   economy have been positive, but before I quickly summarize those findings let me just identify   the sectors that are still soft  One, of course, is commercial construction, where activity is quite   subdued  The second is tourism  Tourism has improved over time, but it has still been a   mediocre year for that industry in the District  And although business attitudes are certainly   better than they were nine or twelve months ago, I would have to say that they are still cautious    Other than that, though, I think the District economy has tracked the national economy   reasonably well, as it typically does  We have seen gains in employment in the private sector   over the past several months, but since state and local governments are still reducing   October 28, 2003 59 of 126    employment, those gains have not shown through to any great extent in the overall job numbers    Strength in consumer spending has been sustained, and housing activity and related measures   have strengthened further  I would judge, based on anecdotes, that manufacturing has improved   in the District over the past several months  One final piece of information on the District comes   from a contact who is knowledgeable about freight shipments through a variety of modes—that   is rail, barge, and truck—and he has reported that both volumes and prices have increased   perceptibly in recent months   As far as the national economy is concerned, like the Greenbook I am optimistic  If I   have any reservation, it’s the one that I alluded to earlier, namely that I would expect to get   something like the Greenbook forecast but with greater increases in productivity and somewhat   smaller increases in employment, acknowledging that forecasting productivity in the short run is   probably close to impossible  But if that scenario were to come to pass, that would reinforce my   conviction that inflation is going to stay low  If one adheres to gap analysis, though, I suppose   one would have to allow for the possibility that inflation could go even lower  Personally I think   that would be a benign development, but I realize that many people around this table have come   to a different conclusion about that  "
5141,2003-10-28,  I’m comfortable with your recommendation  
5252,2004-03-16,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  The trends that have been evident in the   District economy for some time are continuing, so economic activity is expanding further  Let   me just start with inflation where, at least in our District, to date there seem to be few signs of   any broad-based price pressures and no real concern about inflation, although there are some   March 16, 2004 50 of 107    concerns about prices of particular products and services  I’ll say a bit more about that in a   minute   One distinct bright spot in the District is spending on equipment and software  That has   become evident over the last several months, and based on the anecdotal reports we’ve been   getting, the strength in such spending continues  Interestingly, the state and local government   budget situation has not turned out to be quite as dire as earlier expected  That is due in part, of   course, to policy changes that were made and in some cases to the fact that revenues are running   above earlier projections  There is, however, a transit strike under way in the Twin Cities, and   the principal issue there seems to be benefits—especially who is going to pay for the cost of   health benefits   Both manufacturing and mining in the District are expanding, and employment is going   up modestly in those two sectors  Maybe more important in terms of the labor market situation,   there really is little talk from our sources these days of further large reductions in payrolls    That’s certainly consistent with what we’re seeing in the initial claims data  So at worst,   employment is stabilizing; at best, it’s growing in some industries  Consumer spending has been   reasonably strong thus far this year, but people are getting more concerned about higher energy   prices, and the implications of that for home heating and gasoline bills may curtail discretionary   expenditures going forward  So far, though, there doesn’t seem to be any significant evidence of   reduced spending, as best I can judge  And finally, in construction, housing does remain a bright   spot in our area     As far as the national economy is concerned, I have only a few comments to make   because I haven’t changed my outlook for the national economy at all  I believe the outlook is   quite positive, and the incoming data haven’t provoked me to reassess that view  While I would   March 16, 2004 51 of 107    describe the incoming data on the national economy as positive, they perhaps are not as positive   as some expected earlier  But I do think there’s a danger in over-emphasizing high-frequency   data  There’s a lot of noise in them  We’ve all had a lot of experience looking at data that seem   to tell one story one month and a different story two or three months later, after some additional   observations and revisions  Fundamentally, I think that the national economy is in good shape   and that we can look forward to good growth both this year and next   I have one final comment, and that is on the productivity issue  I’ve been suspicious for   some time about the deceleration in productivity projected in the Greenbook  It has been pushed   off a bit  But to the extent that what we are seeing turns out to be more fundamental—more   secular rather than cyclical—the implications are either for the same growth in GDP and smaller   employment gains or for more-rapid growth in real GDP  In any event, though, I for one hope   that rapid productivity gains continue  "
5253,2004-03-16,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I, too, would have at least a mild preference   for going to balance on the inflation risks  The reason is that, as I listened to the discussion   today, it struck me that we heard more anecdotes that seemed consistent with the possibility of   building inflationary pressures  So on that basis, as well as other factors, balance seems   genuinely appropriate to me  That’s where I would come out on the issue  "
5303,2004-05-04,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Much of what I plan to say is going to sound   familiar by now  I will start by observing that the trends that have been apparent in the Ninth   District for some time have accelerated and we have a rapid expansion ongoing  Recently we’ve   had meetings with our Advisory Council on Small Business and Labor as well as with leaders of a   variety of Twin Cities’ financial services firms and our board of directors, and almost all of the   anecdotes have been distinctly positive  Let me run through some of those quickly   The manufacturing sector is expanding substantially  Employment is growing in that area,   exports are up, investment in equipment and software is growing, and firms in general are seeing   top-line growth and are quite pleased with that, needless to say  Labor is generally available in the   District, but hiring has picked up, and there is some discussion of the skills mismatch issue that   Dave Stockton and others alluded to  Housing remains quite strong, and a number of large projects   have been started recently; so at least on the construction side, people are still optimistic    Construction of office space remains weak, but absorption has begun to pick up, and if that   continues, it will probably lead to some renewed activity in that arena  Consumer spending has   been and continues to be strong     May 4, 2004 48 of 112       The really significant change is the one that others have already identified, and that’s on the   pricing side  The anecdotes are almost universally along the lines that companies are finding the   ability to raise prices now and that those price increases are sticking  It’s happening across a wide   range of goods and services, and I think that has done something positive for business attitudes and   confidence  But it is quite widespread, and I must say it gives me a bit of pause   As far as the national economy is concerned, I have only two or three comments  First of   all, from my perspective the situation and the outlook that we’re confronting haven’t changed very   much  I’ve thought for a long time that the outlook is positive, and the recent data have served to   confirm that  As Dave said, the economy does appear to be firing on virtually all cylinders now    On the inflation side, I’m not predicting a significant acceleration of inflation from here; but based   on the data and the anecdotal information, there’s clearly more action on that front than I would   have expected as recently as two or three months ago  Something is going on  It may turn out not   to persist, but I do think the likelihood of further declines in inflation—or even a leveling off at the   recent pace—has probably diminished  And finally, I can’t resist the temptation to add that I   question the value of trying to go from the output gap, however measured, to resulting inflation  I   just don’t think it is in the data  "
5304,2004-05-04,"  I, too, support the recommendation  I think the language does give us   adequate flexibility at least for the next two or three months, as best I can read the situation  And   I’m hard pressed to suggest any better alternative  So I support your proposal  "
5351,2004-08-10,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  There has been little change in the District   economy recently; that is, a broad-based expansion is under way and is continuing  Labor demand   appears to be strengthening  Manufacturing has been a particularly bright spot recently, especially   for larger firms that operate and sell internationally  We have seen the anticipated improvement in   tourism activity  In talking to contacts in the hospitality industry, including some people who   operate a chain of upscale, upper-end hotels around the country, they say they’ve seen steady   improvement throughout the year  Finally, I would reiterate Bill Poole’s comment about   bottlenecks in the railroad industry and, for that matter, in other forms of transportation as well    That is something that was called to my attention some time ago, and it apparently persists today   As far as the national economy is concerned, there are two issues on my mind  One is   energy prices  The other is equity prices, although my concern about equity prices is offset at least   to a degree by the decline in intermediate- and longer-term interest rates that we’ve seen  But the   August 10, 2004 39 of 103          primary question to me is, have recent developments fundamentally altered the economic outlook?    Or put another way, would I disagree substantially with the Greenbook forecast?  My tentative   answer to that question is, no, I wouldn’t  I’m fairly comfortable with the fundamental outlook   expressed there, and for reasons that have already been cited here—the expansionary stance of both   monetary and fiscal policies, the persistence of a significant advance in productivity, and improving   economies around the world  All those factors continue to give me some confidence that the US   economy will continue to perform reasonably well    Let me make one further comment about energy prices  At least according to the anecdotes   that I’ve been getting, higher oil and gasoline prices seem to be having mostly what I would call   “second-order” effects  That is, nobody is saying that they have laid off people or ended a second   shift or something like that because of higher energy prices  The effects are all showing up in either   explicit surcharges or, more implicitly, through pass-throughs  So whatever effects those higher   prices are having are coming through those channels  "
5352,2004-08-10,"  It has a nice ring   August 10, 2004 73 of 103            Thank you, Mr Chairman  I, too, support the ¼ point increase in the funds   rate at this stage  Also, I think that the “measured pace” language and the conditional clause have   served us remarkably well so far  I believe that people in the marketplace pretty much understand   what we’re trying to do and where we’re going  The question for me was whether we wanted to   expand that last conditional phrase  There may be some value to doing it, but I agree that it isn’t   August 10, 2004 82 of 103          essential  I don’t think it unduly constrains us  My guess is that we would pause only if the   economy seemed to be going substantially off course  "
5405,2004-09-21,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’m going to take your admonition seriously   and say about the District economy that it continues to track the national economy quite closely,   as it has throughout this recovery  I’m tempted to let it go at that, except there was a   development yesterday that went largely unnoticed and is a cause for celebration  I’m sure you   noticed it; the Minnesota Twins clinched the Central Division for the third consecutive year—  demonstrating once again that a small market team can succeed  [Laughter]   When I think about the national economy, it seems to me that the evolution of the   forecast this year has not been all bad  That’s not a ringing endorsement, I understand  We’re   certainly looking at somewhat slower growth than I had anticipated earlier, but we’re also   looking at a bit lower inflation than I had expected  Beyond that, it seems to me that, if we think   about broad trends rather than meeting-to-meeting fluctuations in the data, changes in the   forecast, and clouds that appear from time to time and then dissipate, we see the following    Growth last year was 4½ percent in real terms and is likely to be something like 4 percent this   year  The unemployment rate has declined—perhaps not quite as much as measured, but it has   declined  Inflation is low—and it’s certainly low in the historical context of most of the postwar   period—and it seems likely to stay there  Moreover, I think the outlook is positive, and I say this   for essentially two reasons  One is productivity, and the other is history  Although history   obviously doesn’t repeat itself precisely, I think there is a message in the long expansions of the   1980s and the 1990s, which is that the economy is fundamentally resilient and fundamentally   September 21, 2004 50 of 100          flexible  Expansions, once established, don’t terminate quickly  And from that perspective, I   think we’re in good shape overall   On the employment situation, the staff probably recalls that I’ve been skeptical about the   employment forecast for some time  Now I find myself skeptical about the explanation pointing   to a reluctance to hire  I guess I’m an outlier in this regard, but I must say that for quite some   time no business person I’ve talked to has expressed anything special about his or her   willingness or unwillingness to hire  My sense of the situation is that they’re making the same   kinds of decisions they always make with regard to these kinds of issues  Now, if we mean by   “reluctance to hire” that we can’t explain the slow improvement in employment, I agree with   that  But I really don’t know that there’s anything special there   Finally, with regard to our earlier discussion on exchange rates, I certainly don’t object to   thinking about how that might play out and what our role might be  But as I think Karen   observed, it doesn’t have to play out in a disorderly fashion  And it seems to me that, if we want   to avoid the risk that movements in exchange rates could turn disorderly, we’re going to have to   adhere to sound policies in any event      I’m not sure  That move may be necessary but not sufficient  [Laughter]   "
5406,2004-09-21,"  I, too, support your recommendation, and I would largely echo Bill   Poole’s remarks  "
5458,2004-11-10,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Let me start with just a few comments about the   District economy  Recent reports on consumer spending have been mixed; we had one relatively   strong month of spending on autos and in non-auto retail sales, followed by a much more modest   pace of sales in the next month  An area that has picked up, though, has been tourism, where better   weather late in the summer and in the fall has clearly benefited that sector  Manufacturing has   continued to expand in the District, and agriculture appears to be having a good year for the most   part   A little over a week ago, we hosted at the Bank a meeting on housing and residential   construction activity  There were several reasons for this  One, of course, was the fact that we hear   periodic discussions of a potential bubble in house prices  But second, I’ve been struck, as I’ve   watched developments in the Twin Cities and as I’ve traveled around other cities in the last several   years, by the absolutely high level of construction activity that seems to be occurring  It’s not only   new building, but conversions of all sorts of warehouses, schools, and former office buildings to   residential property  A change in mix seems to be occurring as well, with more of the construction   and renovation yielding townhouses and condominiums rather than the standard single-family   home   I thought it would be a good idea to try to get some other people’s perspective on this, so we   had at the meeting a group of developers, lenders, consultants, and economists  They brought a   national perspective, although they did have special expertise in the Twin Cities market and a few   other particular markets across the country  In general, I would say that their comments were   positive and largely unsurprising  There was little overall concern about a bubble in house prices   November 10, 2004 48 of 107    and little anticipation of a major correction in house prices in the near term  There was, however,   fairly widespread agreement that the pace of increase was likely to slow going forward   Let me just note three specific issues that came up because I, at least, found them of interest    The first, which it won’t surprise this group to hear, is that they attributed a good deal of the   strength in housing to very favorable financial conditions  In this regard they talked not only about   low interest rates but also lower down-payment requirements  I might add that a couple of the   lenders did say that they thought the credit pendulum had swung too far  They felt that credit   conditions had become too easy, and they were anticipating some potential difficulties going   forward—presumably in somebody else’s shop!  [Laughter]  Second, they reported that at least in   some markets a significant percentage of the purchases of new units were by investors, where the   term “investors” means people who don’t intend to occupy the property, at least not immediately    As best they could judge, in some markets investors were buying up to 30 percent of the new   additions to supply  And finally, they noted that there seemed to be some acceleration of purchases   by first-time homebuyers who were concerned that they were going to be priced out of the market if   they waited longer  The implications of that, of course, are that at some point such sales will slow   because people will have acted if they could  So that’s a summary of that meeting   Let me turn to just a few comments on the national economy  To me, the outlook for the   national economy continues to remain favorable  I’d like to think that I would have made that   statement even without the October employment report, but of course that’s a counterfactual, so we   won’t be able to observe it  But I do believe that growth is on a favorable trend  I personally think   that the economy will grow a little more rapidly next year than the projection in the Greenbook, and   I expect inflation to remain low   I’ve been asking myself this question  What is the neutral real federal funds rate?  I find   that a challenging concept, but I’ve tentatively decided to think about it in terms of what the rate is   November 10, 2004 49 of 107    that would be consistent with our price or inflation objective over time  Now, of course, we haven’t   formalized an inflation target, so I’m using the working definition of price stability  That’s what I   have in mind  And it seems to me, without going out on any limbs here, that it’s safe to say that the   funds rate continues to be lower than it will need to be in the long run, so the trajectory we’re on   seems to me to be appropriate  Thank you  "
5459,2004-11-10,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support the recommendation of B′  It seems to   me that there is no need to change the language, at least at this point, because I think market   participants understand the conditional nature of what’s going on here  So in that sense, I think   we’re positioned rather well  I remain open as to when we may want to change the language and   how we may want to change it, but for now I think we’re still reasonably well positioned  "
5519,2004-12-14,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ve felt for a long time that the minutes, given   the way we currently handle the timing of their release, are an unappreciated or at least   underappreciated asset  So I continue to strongly favor moving up the release date  I think Don   basically made the case, so let me just quickly summarize things as I see them     In my experience, the minutes are accurate, they are comprehensive, and they are valuable    They illustrate the thinking of the Committee, and they get into the issues that we discuss when we   consider policy  I think all of that is important to communicate to the public  In short, I believe it   would improve communication to release the minutes earlier, when people would have an incentive   to take a real interest in them  And that, to me, is the reason for doing it     I agree that there are some potential downsides, and I don’t want to overstate or exaggerate   the benefits  But I do believe that, on balance, the benefits are rather compelling  I also think that   it’s certainly possible from time to time that market participants will read something in the minutes   that we believe is innocuous and make a lot more of it than we would  But in my view we shouldn’t   be so paternalistic and worry that, if market participants don’t get it right every time, something has   gone seriously wrong  Most market participants are smart, sophisticated people, and I think, on   balance, they will get it right most of the time; and when they don’t, that’s their business  "
5520,2004-12-14,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Comments from directors and from a wide range   of contacts indicate further improvement in the District economy—indeed some acceleration   recently—and the improvement is quite broadly based  Given that, let me just comment on a couple   of developments that seem particularly relevant  There have been in the District sustained, albeit   moderate, gains in employment for better than a year now  Hiring plans are positive, according to   our most recent survey, and some skills are now in short supply  The investment outlook appears to   have improved recently  Some projects that were on the back burner, according to business   contacts, have now been moved forward  In general, I think businessmen are feeling a bit more   upbeat, and that is fueling some enthusiasm for further investment  The final point I would mention   about the District economy is that, despite tightening labor markets, wage increases remain   subdued—generally in the 2 to 3 percent range—and price pressures are modest as well   As far as the national economy is concerned, I think it’s perhaps at least worth noting that   the current expansion is now into its fourth year, and recently at least things have been turning out   pretty much as we expected  Now, that might be a reason to worry, but I prefer to look on the bright   side of that  I agree with a point that Dave Stockton mentioned—that the fundamentals supporting   further economic growth from here forward are distinctly positive  If I were writing down a GDP   December 14, 2004 39 of 118           forecast at the moment, I might write down something a little stronger than the Greenbook forecast   for both 2005 and 2006   On the inflation side, I do expect inflation to remain low, but I must admit that I’m a little   less confident about that than I was a few months ago  If I ask myself why, I think it has mostly to   do with the dollar  It’s not so much that I’m concerned about the pass-through, narrowly defined;   it’s really more a concern about the changing nature of the competitive environment implied by the   declining dollar  And that gives me a bit of pause as I contemplate inflation prospects  But I think   that’s a pretty slim reed to hang all that much on, so I personally would stick with a low inflation   forecast for now   Having said all that, it seems to me that the policy course is pretty clear here  We should   continue with the policy path that we’ve been on  Thank you  "
5521,2004-12-14,"  I, too, support your recommendation, and I agree that this is not the time to   try to fine-tune the signal  I don’t think the case is sufficiently compelling to do that  "
5571,2005-03-22," Dave, I’m interested in your work on labor force participation  We’ve   been looking at that a bit, too Can you give me a sense of what’s driving the new forecast of a   leveling off in labor force participation rates of women?    Thanks    Thank you, Mr Chairman  The broad-based expansion in our District   economy persists  Employment is continuing to increase  The manufacturing sector is a standout,                    March 22, 2005 50 of 116  growing rapidly Demand for construction equipment reportedly is very strong  Backlogs are   building in that sector, and there are long lead times  There is an emerging scarcity of some skilled   labor The mining and energy sectors, not surprisingly, are strong  Housing construction activity   remains robust, although sales have slowed a bit year-over-year  The concerns expressed by   business leaders are the usual suspects medical insurance costs, rising raw material prices—   including energy, of course—and rising transportation costs   Turning to broader issues, based on the tenor of the incoming information on the economy   and on my earlier forecast, the national economy continues to look quite good to me  It’s still early   in the game, of course, but 4 percent real growth this year looks like a reasonable forecast  It would   not be a stretch but simply a continuation of what we’ve experienced in the previous two years   As far as inflation is concerned, I do not expect a material acceleration in core measures of   inflation this year Nevertheless, I do see signs that there is some buildup in price pressures    Therefore, it seems to me that the risks we are confronting are in the process of shifting, mostly   because the risks of a subpar or disappointing performance of the real economy have diminished but   also because the inflation pressures have perhaps ticked up a notch   I think the policy implication of this is that we can continue for now with the program that   we have been on of ¼-point increases in the funds rate But I do think we need to modify the   language in the announcement to reflect changing circumstances and to preserve internal   consistency  "
5572,2005-03-22," I, too, favor the 25 basis point increase, and I’m comfortable with the   language of alternative B Looking forward, I do think we have an obligation to communicate   clearly about policy prospects, to the extent that we can And if this involves from time to time   sharing our uncertainty with market participants, then so be it  "
5619,2005-05-03," Thank you Well, two issues have been weighing on my mind  They’re   really the two issues that Dave Stockton addressed First, is the recent reduction in the Greenbook   forecast roughly appropriate, or will the economy do appreciably worse or possibly significantly   better than that?  Second, is the forecast of modest inflation still tenable in the face of the increase in   most core measures that we have seen?   I must say that I think there is a danger of over-interpreting and overemphasizing a batch of   statistics, all of which became available within several weeks in April, given their reliability or   unreliability and given that not all of them seemed to me to be a particular surprise  Still, I wouldn’t   totally dismiss them, so I am inclined to reduce my forecast of growth, although it’s perhaps still a   bit above the Greenbook projection of 3½ percent Plus, for what it’s worth, our internal forecasting   model grinds out about 3 percent growth quarter after quarter  I’m more optimistic than that and                                 May 3, 2005 37 of 116  maybe a touch more optimistic than the Greenbook for three sets of reasons one, the fundamentals;   two, the nature of the anecdotes I’ve been getting; and three—and perhaps most importantly—   history   As far as the fundamentals are concerned, we have the usual suspects that we’ve been talking   about at this table for several years now continuing comfortable financial market conditions,   underlying expansion in productivity, a general lack of supply-side constraints, and still healthy   consumer and corporate balance sheets on average   As for the anecdotes, discussions with business leaders in our District and an examination of   District economic data for the most part yield positive conclusions  Manufacturing is clearly   continuing to advance, employment is increasing, and labor markets appear to be gradually   tightening, especially in areas where mining and energy activity are strong  Consumer spending   activity is continuing to expand, and reports on capital spending and commentary associated with   capital spending from directors are really quite strong overall  All of this is balanced a bit by a note   of caution, which has crept in among firms with large exposures in the transportation sector, but I   would have to say that the anecdotes preponderantly have really been quite positive   As far as history is concerned, I consider particularly relevant the long expansions of the   1980s and the 1990s In my view, those expansions were not particularly dependent on good luck   nor on astute policies conducted with exquisite precision, although I do believe that policy made a   positive contribution But I think the real lesson of those expansions was that the economy is   fundamentally sound, flexible, and resilient  And I don’t think those traits have been altered or have   diminished just because we’re in a new decade  So that gives me a fair amount of confidence that   the outlook remains favorable and that the expansion remains well grounded                                 May 3, 2005 38 of 116  As to inflation, I continue to think that moderate inflation will prevail, with the performance   of core prices probably at a pace comparable to that over the last five or six years on average  Still,   there is no denying that core measures of inflation have been increasing persistently since late ’03,   and this does give me a bit more concern  And it makes me a little more cautious than I was   formerly about the inflation situation currently and about the outlook for inflation  Thank you  "
5620,2005-05-03," Thank you, Mr Chairman  I, too, think the ¼ point increase in the funds rate   target is appropriate, and the language in alternative B is fine with me today  I don’t think it’s   essential to make any major changes in the language at the moment, and it’s probably not a good   idea                                    May 3, 2005 100 of 116  I do agree with President Yellen and others that the balance-of-risk statements should   probably be jettisoned at the earliest opportunity But I would also say that I think there is value in   providing some forward-looking guidance to the markets  More generally, among other things, it   helps to assure a certain consistency in policy, and I think that is of value as well  "
5663,2005-08-09," Thank you, Mr Chairman  The District economy continues to track the   national economy quite closely, as it has for a long time  And as I commented at the last   meeting, what is striking about the District economy right now is the breadth of the economic   expansion Virtually all sectors are either strong or improving, and I won’t go through a review   item by item  I will say that with the growth in economic activity in the District and with                   August 9, 2005 46 of 110  improving employment conditions, wage increases still remain quite modest, as best I can judge    And inflationary pressures haven’t changed, as best I can assess the situation   As far as the national economy is concerned, we’re now almost four years into the current   economic expansion and, overall, things look quite good to me  That in a way is remarkable in   and of itself, as I think of the conversations we’ve had around this table over the last four years   and the variety of concerns and issues that were raised  To be sure, policy has played a role in   supporting this economic performance but, as I’ve commented before, I think once again we are   observing the fundamental soundness, resilience, and flexibility of the economy   The situation is starting to resemble in broad terms, in my mind at least, the long   expansions of the ’80s and ’90s  In fact, without stretching too far, I think one could perhaps   make the case that the situation is even a little better than a few years into those expansions    After all, today we have low interest rates, low inflation rates, well-anchored inflationary   expectations, for the most part a fairly well-balanced domestic economy, and what I might call a   promising international economy  I call it promising not because I’m thinking about Europe or   Japan, but because I’m thinking about China and India and some of their smaller brethren   There are some issues, to be sure  One is oil prices, which have already been mentioned   today The federal budget situation is another one, although I think that’s more a secular than a   cyclical problem  And then there are housing prices  All I would say there is that even if there is   a bubble, and even if it bursts, the quantitative significance of that remains quite unclear, as far   as I’m concerned   I do think we need to pay considerable attention, as we have been, to the inflation   situation, but my sense of the situation is that there is no significant deterioration under way or   imminent at the moment  And I’m inclined to stick to my random walk methodology for                       August 9, 2005 47 of 110  forecasting inflation It has worked remarkably well for a good number of years now    [Laughter] Having said that, I do think it’s appropriate to continue with the policy path we’ve   been on That seems, given the way the economy has evolved, fully appropriate to me  "
5664,2005-08-09," Thank you, Mr Chairman  I, too, am comfortable with your   recommendation, and I’m also happy to resist the temptation to change the language any more   than necessary at this point Going forward, my preference would be to continue, where   possible, to provide some guidance  But that’s an issue for another day  "
5708,2005-09-20," Thank you, Mr Chairman  Let me start with a few pertinent facts about   the District economy, both pre- and post-Katrina  Overall, the District economy remains healthy    Employment is continuing to advance modestly; and in at least a few geographic areas, it seems   likely that employment gains are being constrained by a lack of available labor  Construction   activity, both residential and nonresidential, is strong and/or improving  And one of the large   credit card issuers in our District has reported—and I think this is reflective of national   conditions—that repayments on credit card debt are up and charge-offs are at a 10-year low     Higher fuel prices so far have not led to production cutbacks or plant closings in the   District Where possible, firms are switching to less expensive sources of energy, and surcharges   are, of course, common Higher energy prices do, though, seem to be particularly adverse for   local governments and for farmers, who are also adversely affected by the infrastructure   destruction and disruption in the Gulf area   As for the effects of Katrina on the national economy, at the qualitative level I think we   actually have considerable experience in analyzing these kinds of shocks, and in my view the   Greenbook at that level has it essentially right  It seems to me, as others have commented, that   in the short term we will get a disruption to growth followed by a rebound and presumably   ultimately a resumption of trend growth  And, as far as inflation is concerned, I think we will get   an acceleration ultimately followed by a return to trend, assuming that policy adheres more or   less to the path that it would have followed   At the quantitative level, though, it seems to me difficult to say anything precise with a   lot of confidence But I would venture that in these circumstances—because of the concentration   of the population, the number of people affected by the disaster, and the affected area’s location                         September 20, 2005 65 of 117  relative to the energy and transportation infrastructure—the amplitude of the swings, both in   terms of growth and inflation, and perhaps the duration of the adjustment, would be extended    There’s a temptation, I suppose, to exaggerate this  After all, a relatively small part of the   economy is affected  But it seems to me that, in any event, uncertainty has increased  And if   this overall description is roughly appropriate, then I find thinking about monetary policy more   complicated than it was formerly  Moreover, I don’t think the situation is going to get clarified   in the near term, because the incoming data, of course, will be difficult to read, given that they   will be affected in one way or another by both the disruption and the recovery efforts as they   proceed   In these circumstances, I feel most comfortable falling back on fundamentals—namely,   the flexibility and strength of the underlying economy, which I don’t think are affected by this    So I come out with a view that it’s appropriate to continue on our path of removing policy   accommodation, and I would favor a ¼ point increase in the fed funds rate  Having said that, I   think we are getting to the point where we’ve removed a lot of accommodation  And one of   these days we need to consider that and also think about how that ought to affect the language in   the statement  "
5709,2005-09-20," I, too, support your recommendation, Mr Chairman  I have some   sympathy with your warning about the 1970s and the way things gradually kind of got away   from us  Having said that, I’d like to think that we’ll succeed in conducting policy in a more   effective way this time around  "
5753,2005-11-01," Thank you, Mr Chairman  Changes in District economic conditions have been   small recently and seemingly largely offset each other  So the economy overall continues on a   positive path   Housing activity, especially the pace of sales, has been slowing recently, although to some   extent that is seasonal  But I think it’s fair to say that overall some of the vigor in housing is in the   process of diminishing  In contrast, commercial real estate development has been picking up   modestly and in a number of locations throughout the District, and developers seem more optimistic   than they have for some time  Manufacturing activity is continuing to advance  The mining and   energy industries are operating at high levels of capacity, as you would expect  And employment is   increasing, except at Northwest Airlines   I don’t think the underlying fundamentals of inflation have changed recently, but there are a   few more reports in the District of the ability to pass through cost increases—more reports than I   had been hearing formerly  Also, at a meeting of our Advisory Council on Small Business and   Labor, there were more reports of products on allocation than I had expected to hear  While there   are ready substitutes for some of these products, for others, like concrete, that’s not quite the case    And that will be, without question, constraining activity relative to what otherwise would have   occurred   As far as the national economy is concerned, I don’t have any material disagreement with the   Greenbook assessment of the outlook although, if left to my own devices, I might write down a little   more real growth in the next several quarters  My sense is that the economy has a good deal of                               November 1, 2005 58 of 114  positive momentum to it, as others have observed, and spending associated with recovery from   Hurricane Katrina will add to that  I am also encouraged on balance by the modest reports on core   measures of inflation for the last couple of quarters  So, overall, both the current state of the   economy and its prospects look favorable to me  Core inflation may tick up a bit, as depicted in the   Greenbook, but I would expect that to be temporary  And as far as the risks of stagflation are   concerned, while I certainly wouldn’t dismiss that as a possibility—and I would acknowledge that   the episode in the mid- and late-1970s initially, as I recall, snuck up on policymakers—it’s hard for   me to develop a stagflation scenario without serious monetary policy errors  And that’s in our   power to avoid   Against that background, I would favor another ¼ percentage point increase in the funds rate   at this meeting  I would also endorse the comments of President Yellen about the need to review   and make some significant changes to the statement accompanying our decision  And I think there   may be some urgency to that  One way of viewing that, at least as I’ve been thinking about it, is   that if we continue on the path we’re on, we’ll be looking at a nominal federal funds rate of 4½   percent before long and a real rate north of 2 percent  At that point, are we still going to be willing   to talk about removing policy accommodation?  Will we be willing to do it at 4¼?  Today we’ll be   at 4 percent, so I don’t think the time is far off when we’re going to have to confront these issues  "
5754,2005-11-01,"  I support all parts of the recommendation—the change in the funds rate, the   existing language, and the possibility that we will alter the familiar language at the next meeting  "
5797,2005-12-13," Thank you, Mr Chairman  Let me try to restart this discussion by saying, first,   that I largely agree with the Greenbook assessment of the economy and, in particular, with the overall   positive economic outlook it presents  This is consistent with the incoming data on the national   economy that we’ve received recently and with the preponderance of recent reports on the District   economy as well  Notably, the District is benefiting from an overall good year in agriculture,   sustained improvement in the manufacturing sector, and what I would call positive substitution effects   stemming from hurricane-related disruptions elsewhere, which have led, for example, to more   shipping out of the Port of Duluth-Superior than otherwise would have occurred, more volume for   local trucking firms, and so forth   One minor difference I might have with the Greenbook outlook pertains to the labor market   and the unemployment rate It seems to me that the forecast for economic growth in 2006 overall is   not terribly different from what we’ve had in ’04 and ’05  And cumulatively, the unemployment rate                         December 13, 2005 50 of 100  dropped nearly a full percentage point from the end of 2003 to the end of 2005  Using that as a rough   guide or rule of thumb, I would think we’d get at least some modest further decline in the rate of   unemployment next year  I would hasten to add—and I think this is potentially a more important and   maybe also a more controversial point—that even if we get that drop in the unemployment rate, it   wouldn’t affect my inflation forecast  In fact, looking at the totality of the information available, I   don’t think that the risks to the core inflation outlook are skewed one way or the other, and I’m   inclined to agree with Dave Stockton’s assessment that inflationary pressures are close to topping out    I say this because incoming data on core inflation have been relatively favorable, bond markets   suggest to me that inflation expectations remain well anchored, and a lot of policy accommodation   has been removed     Indeed, summing up these factors as well as the results from most versions of the Taylor rule   presented in the Bluebook, calculations with Fisher-type interest rate equations, and the Greenbook   forecast itself, it seems to me that after this meeting we will at least be very close to the point where   we will have raised the federal funds rate sufficiently for now  Thank you  "
5798,2005-12-13," Thank you, Mr Chairman  I agree with the recommendation to raise the   federal funds rate target by ¼ percentage point, and I can accept the language in alternative B as it is   drafted here   If I were the policy czar on this, I would make an argument to take out “measured” on the   grounds that we want to at least alert market participants to the prospect that we’re getting close to   ending the more or less automatic ¼ percentage point increases, because we’re getting close to having   removed all of the policy accommodation that we need to remove  President Moskow made the other   side of the argument for removing “measured,” and I took your comments as implicitly working in the   same direction  So I think “measured” ought to come out, if not at this meeting, soon; it seems to me   that it certainly has about outlived its usefulness   I would also, if I had my druthers, replace “likely” with just “may” or “may well”  But as I   said, I can accept this language as drafted, because I don’t have any special insights as to whether   market participants are going to like one word better than another  But of course, however the market                                   December 13, 2005 78 of 100  happens to react, the relatively prompt release of the minutes will help because the market will get a   more complete picture of our thinking within a relatively short period of time  "
5845,2006-01-31,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Let me start with one anecdote about housing   activity in the District  I don’t know how representative this is nationwide, obviously, but there are   signs of slowing in both housing construction and, more dramatically, in sales recently  And this   winter in the Twin Cities, several hundred unionized construction workers are not working  Last   year 100 percent were  But they’re all expected to be back at work in the spring, and that suggests   January 31, 2006 53 of 106    to me—and this is more a question than a conclusion—that the ultimate correction in housing may   occur later and be more severe than I was earlier expecting   As far as the national economy is concerned, like others, I am inclined to discount the fourth   quarter  I find the Greenbook story about the outlook reasonably convincing  I personally think that   we will see pretty good growth in both ’06 and ’07  I tend to rely, as you know, on the underlying   fundamentals and the resilience of the economy, and those things seem to me to be sound and in   place  And so I think the overall outlook is pretty good   I do think that there was a disconnect in the fourth quarter between the supply or output side   and the demand side  If you look at the numbers for employment and hours, you would have   certainly come up with a stronger forecast  Now, you may plug in a negative productivity number    That’s one way of reconciling it  Maybe the November and December employment data will get   revised down  I guess that’s another way of reconciling it  Perhaps some of the aggregate demand   components will ultimately be revised up a bit  But there does seem to be a disconnect there,   nothing that I find all that troubling, but something I think worth bearing in mind if we want to think   about the fourth quarter   I think the key to the outlook and to policy going forward, though, is inflation  And I went   and looked at what has happened to the core PCE over the past eight or nine years  And the range   of increases in core PCE inflation over that period was about 1¼ to 2¼ percent, and I think the   average over the past eight or nine years was something like 1¾ percent  I don’t cite those numbers   just to prove that I can look them up  I cite them because I would characterize that whole period as   a period of low inflation, maybe something resembling price stability  And if I ask myself, “Is   inflation likely to break out on the high side of that range in the relatively near term?” my answer to   January 31, 2006 54 of 106    that is “no”  And I think most bond market participants, at least the way they are pricing things,   would also answer that question with a “no”   Part of that is, of course, that we have been moving policy, and it seems to me that policy,   measured by the real federal funds rate, is now certainly in the ballpark where it needs to be  I   anticipate that we’ll move again today, as I think we should, in part to validate market expectations    Is policy perfectly positioned within the ballpark?  Well, I don’t know the answer to that, but I do   think it is well positioned within the ballpark, and I think we need to bear that in mind as we go   forward  "
5846,2006-01-31,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I find myself in agreement with, I guess,   everybody who has already spoken  The ¼ point increase seems appropriate to me  I’m   comfortable with the language as proposed, and I think we should defer the discussion of ownership   of the statement until March  "
