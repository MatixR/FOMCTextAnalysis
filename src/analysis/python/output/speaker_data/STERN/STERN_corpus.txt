 We have already touched on this, but have you done some analysis of the impact of higher energy prices on the acceleration in inflation we have seen so far this year?   Well, I am considerably more comfortable with the Greenbook forecast at this meeting than I was in July, because it seems to me that the thrust of the latest statistics on the economy, with the revisions, serves to bolster the underpinnings and credibility of that forecast, at least in my mind I think the revisions are important, as well, in this story because I think they help to put things in a more consistent picture Throughout the expansion, it seems to me, we've had consistently strong increases in employment and we were seeing weaker increases than I would have expected in GNP and so forth; and at least in my mind, some of that gap has been reduced I think we are looking at an economy that really has been performing rather well  That's certainly consistent with what's going on in the Ninth District I have talked before about the two-tier economy and the divergence between what's happening in the urban areas, which are doing well, and the rural areas But the latest developments suggest that that gap has diminished; that is, the rural economies are doing better, in part because agriculture is doing better, and in part because other aspects of the natural resource industries that the rural area of the Ninth District depends on are doing better And that's encouraging I might also comment on the fact that I've received a number of unsolicited reports from businessmen in the District about increased interest in export opportunities--that is, potential foreign customers coming to them to explore the possibilities of sales abroad of various products This is everything from the high-tech end of the world to some very basic commodities Again, I think that's consistent with what we have seen happening in the economy recently and what our forecasts suggest  I do think that, with all that good news, we probably are approaching a critical point when it comes to inflationary pressures As Mike indicated, I think you can attribute much of the acceleration in the broad price indexes so far this year to the effects of higher  -17-    8/18/87  energy prices But I think that looking forward, we have a number of things on the horizon that give me some pause even if energy prices level off or maybe even come down a bit from here One is clearly what we're seeing in the bond market here and elsewhere around the world, where there are some signs of heightened inflationary expectations that manifest themselves in long-term rates Secondly, I guess I'm not confident at all that in fiscal 1988 we'll achieve a Federal budget deficit significantly below this year's level In fact, it could could be higher, if we're not a bit lucky And, finally, as far as the labor market goes, I don't know what the natural rate of unemployment is, but whatever it is, we certainly have to be a lot closer to it today than we have been recently And not surprisingly, if you look at unemployment by various demographic groups, as you would expect, we are at the lowest rates of unemployment in general since 1980 and, in some cases, since 1977 For some groups you have to go back to 1977, at least using quarterly average data, to find unemployment rates that low I think we have benefitted heretofore from the rigidities in the wage determination process with which we are all familiar; I'm not talking just about what goes on with unions, but just the way business is run But I don't think that we can count on those rigidities in that wage determination process always working in our favor, particularly if price indexes start to move up here   It seems to me, if anything, that is certainly too open-ended the way it is currently written   Well, as I suggested earlier, I think that the principal risk we are likely to face, over time, is higher inflation The key question in my mind is one of timing I don't have the sense that the inflation problem is a fait accompli On the other hand, I don't think we can afford to sit back and wait until it is obvious, for reasons mentioned earlier about the cost of undoing it once it is in place Balancing those two considerations, I am not prepared to go as far as alternative C, but I do view something between "B" and "C" as perhaps a positive, helpful, preemptive strike at this point in time That entails, in my judgment, relatively little risk to the economic outlook; also, if it turns out that we were wrong, it would not be terribly difficult to undo And from that perspective, I think it merits consideration as well   Right around there, yes   I agree with Wayne, in part because when this directive is published it would seem to me to be an awkward time to  -32-    8/18/87  have downplayed the dollar if the dollar continues to do what it has been doing the last three or four days I don't think you gain much   Take it out   On the other side of that coin, and at the risk of some overstatement, I had the impression that the discount rate change was received with a combination of indifference and resignation more than anything else Could you comment on that?   With regard to our view of the economy and conditions in the District, I think what we are seeing is quite consistent with something like the Greenbook forecast In general, economic conditions in the District are quite good and have been improving consistently for some time The only areas I hear any reservations about have to do with residential construction, where reports have tended to be mediocre, and with loan demand, where bankers say there is no demand to speak of Labor markets have tightened up a good deal, again, in general; but what is striking in that regard is that there is not any discernible increase in the rate at which salaries and wages are rising as yet Apparently, at this point, people are just taking the strategy of not filling jobs or filling them more slowly than they otherwise would in this environment With regard to your question about interest rates and so forth, I guess I would not have a definitive answer either, but I would start with the dollar It seems to me that we sometimes talk as if all declines in the dollar are equal I don't start with that position It seems to me that it matters a heck of a lot why the dollar is falling For example, if we had fiscal policy in a position where budget deficits were declining in a sustainable way over time, I might predict that real interest rates were going to decline sustainably and, therefore, the dollar might decline in that environment I would say that would be fine; but I don't think that characterizes the current situation at all I think we are in a situation where, in fact, the adjustment is unlikely to come through fiscal policy Therefore, particularly in light of the June and July trade numbers, there are a lot of market participants who seem to feel the adjustment is going to have to come through other policy steps in this country I think this is kind of what Mike and Ted Truman were talking about earlier--if you are going to get continued improvement in trade, that requires higher real rates here to damp residential construction, nonresidential construction, and so forth Alternatively, of course, we may at some point get into the situation where we are not prepared for rates to rise in that fashion so that we sort of arrest the improvement in trade; that is, we get stronger domestic demand and stall the improvement in the trade balance I think that's the kind of box we are in as long as we have the fiscal policy outlook that we have That situation seems to me to be discouraging, as it has been for quite some time   I would favor "B" as you specified it, including the $600 million borrowing target And I think I would have at least a mild preference for retaining the current asymmetry in the directive for two reasons One is, as you have pointed out, we really can't find concrete signs of acceleration of inflation in the price or wage data yet And that, it seems to me, gives us an opportunity to do perhaps a little better on the inflation side than the Greenbook suggests--to lower inflation next year, if we are a bit careful here; and I think that asymmetry in the directive would help on that score Also, as I think about the near-term outlook--the next six weeks or so--it seems to me the risks are still likely to be in terms of dollar weakness, or some disruptions in the bond market that produce higher long-term rates [associated with] signs of tightening labor markets and growing concerns about acceleration of inflation down the road The asymmetric directive positions us better should that materialize, and, as I said, that's more likely to be the risk in the very short run   I doubt that we would see it in the wage or price data in that time horizon   Right And people's attitudes about what is unfolding   Responses in our District to what has happened in the financial markets have been all over the lot Of course, people have been preoccupied with the baseball season until recently!   I am sure the staff can prepare a memo! Initially, there was a lot of concern coming from the financial community; that seems to have diminished There have been some scattered reports of postponement of purchases of big-ticket items but  -19-    11/3/87  first of all, it seems to me, that is to be expected Second, I would reiterate the word "scattered" because it by no means is universal at this juncture One of our contacts who is pretty well plugged into the retail picture--not just locally but nationally--reported that his company opened six new stores the day of the collapse of stock prices and business in all of them was terrific   Well, I'm sure they highly promoted the openings; on the other hand, these were all in new communities for them He also had been to a national retailers' trade convention and reported when he came back that, basically, people were reasonably confident about the Christmas season Again, though, I think you would have to make a distinction between those people selling big ticket items and those selling more normal kinds of goods I think his statement pertains particularly to the people who are selling the broad-based, moderately priced, kinds of consumer goods We have heard some more generalized comments about people reassessing their capital spending plans for 1988 I guess that's the one thing I would point to at this juncture  With regard to the national economic outlook, I certainly support the general tenor of the Greenbook forecast although I guess my own view, and the one that comes out of our forecasting model, is that the economy will grow more slowly pretty much throughout 1988 than indicated in the Greenbook and, of course, more slowly than we had thought previously I think the major difference is in capital spending and, for what it's worth, that does seem to be consistent with the view that people are reassessing their capital spending intentions and will probably do some postponing At the risk of perhaps going beyond courageous to foolhardy, we did run the model out through 1989 to see what it produced While originally I thought that was maybe just an ill-advised exercise, in fact, it produced some reassuring results It showed a resumption of growth pretty close to 3 percent and a continuation of moderate inflation I would not put a lot of emphasis on all this, obviously, but it seems kind of consistent, if you think that what is going to happen is some postponement of expenditures in 1988 That ought to suggest that 1989 could be a reasonably good year, assuming we don't get further large down [unintelligible] in things here So for what it's worth, I simply report those results   I have lots of time to revise   Given all the uncertainties and everything, what do you have for the forecast of aggregate growth for the first quarter or two of next year You seem to have a sharp, or at least what I would call a significant, slowing late this year I'm just curious about what you have   I am happy to get on the "B" band wagon, or some variant of the "B" band wagon, I guess It seems to me that that is the appropriate posture for us at the moment In my mind, we have moved a significant degree already, and I think the results generally have been satisfactory One danger that I think we want to avoid here is what I might call oversteering; and I think holding with something like "B" is a step towards avoiding that reaction I think Frank Morris has posed a dilemma How do we keep weakness in the dollar, if it persists, from spilling into the bond market? I bring up that subject just as a reminder that I think the most logical way to get out of that trap is to actually succeed in doing something meaningful in fiscal policy here But that's still a very much unresolved matter   But that's another reason why I would--   No we don't; we probably don't have any But I think that's another reason not to oversteer or overreact at the moment We don't know how that is going to play out and we don't have much influence on it I would prefer some language like Variant I just because, as Tom [Melzer] and some others have suggested, these  -36-    11/3/87  are extraordinary circumstances and I think our language should reflect that I guess I'm not all that concerned about exactly how we fine tune that language at the moment I would pick something like "B" as a starting point, and I personally would prefer asymmetric language in favor of lesser restraint because it seems to me that it is highly more likely, as we go forward here, that if we are going to move at all that is the direction we are likely to want to go   No, I didn't say I would resist declines in the dollar; I just said that I think the outcome may be largely out of our hands   In my mind, it's something like a $400 million borrowing target with the expectation that the federal funds rate will be 6-3/4 or 6-7/8 percent or thereabouts   But if you do, it should not come as any big surprise This is certainly one of the most well advertised potential events in a long time   Pumping a lot of reserves in there   Well, if I recall, the origins of that were that it was precisely to try to get--   --to get at banks that had these seasonals and so forth That was very much an "eyes open"--   I have a couple of comments that I'd like your reaction to As I understand what you're saying, one of the reasons  -24-    12/15-16/87  you're uncomfortable with the narrow aggregates is that this relatively high interest elasticity makes them, in some sense, not very good as automatic stabilizers   But I guess I would ask What is the alternative? It still seems to me that these aggregates are preferable to targeting interest rates, for example, and trying to adjust interest rates if you get a positive or negative spending shock Secondly, I agree that the body of evidence you have here doesn't demonstrate very convincing superiority of M1A or M1 relative to M2, but I think you can turn that statement around I don't think it demonstrates the superiority of M2 versus M1 or M1A either In fact, I view all this as somewhat of a tossup I was a little surprised at Bob Black's negative reaction to this because I don't see any very strong reason for preferring one to the other on the basis of all we have here   I wouldn't want to dismiss the base too quickly, though We have done some of these horse races in the last several months as well; and somewhat to my surprise, in terms of the stability of the relationship to income, the base tends to win, though not by wide margins   Yes, right   I think Frank is right we are not going to find one variable On the other hand, if we're looking at a range of variables, I think the base deserves some consideration   With regard to the regional economy, as some people have already suggested, it remains quite difficult out our way to find any pronounced negative effects as a consequence of the stock market decline in October Most sectors in our District continue to do reasonably well Anecdotal evidence is generally positive, particularly with regard to manufacturers and what they are seeing in terms of trade and international competitiveness It leaves me, at this point, with very little doubt as to where we are going in that direction I'm not sure that this continuing strength in domestic demand is all to the good at this point, as Bob Black already commented As for my view of the national outlook, I'm going to echo Ed Boehne here to some degree The Greenbook may be certainly a satisfactory outlook, and it may be about as good as we can expect I happen to think that we are probably in the midst of this transition to an economy in which growth will be driven by growth in trade and, for a time at least, in inventory building and that domestic final demand will be subdued I'm not sure that we can go through this kind of adjustment process, this transition, and avoid a recession It seems to me that that's a risk that we have to run and that we may not have much choice about it I have been struck that--at least until what's been happening with OPEC the last several days--the bond market, as far as I can read it, has been reacting to declines in the dollar kind of the way it was back in April and May and again in August and September That's one form of the market discipline that would be foisted upon us if we don't take steps to promote the transition ourselves, or at least to allow it to occur   I, too, would favor the specifications of alternative "B", although I'm a little uncertain about exactly what normal borrowings means in this context Let me come to that In terms of implementation, I would prefer alternative (3) My guess would be that we might as well start around the turn of the year and use that as a cover because I don't think we're going to have much choice There's a chance that the markets are going to do something unusual There will either be pressure or maybe a lot of excess reserves around, depending on how people position themselves I don't think we want to sit there and work real hard to try to offset all that But it seems to me to be a logical time, maybe an unavoidable time, to start As I said, whether the borrowing that would be associated with that is $300 million or $400 million, I'm really not quite sure I would start with the intention of keeping the federal funds rate roughly where it has been; but as the period develops, obviously, I wouldn't expect that it was going to stay there precisely And I would prefer a symmetric directive   However we may decide to tilt policy in the short run, it seems to me that in the longer term we have to keep our eye on the price stability goal And I think achievement of that is consistent with some of Mike Prell's language that we touched upon yesterday; in other words, I think that's how you do achieve maximum sustainable growth in employment and output In the current setting, what I'd like to achieve is a certain continuity in policy at this point And I'd also like to facilitate this transition or adjustment that's occurring in the economy that we have discussed--or at least not take steps to retard that adjustment by trying to bolster domestic demand All of those considerations lead me to alternative III, which I think works in the direction of price stability and all that goes with it over time I think it provides ample room for growth in the economy in terms of the outlook that we discussed yesterday at some length; I also think it is consistent with this transition or adjustment that needs to occur I might also note that--well, this has been covered and I won't dwell on it--the midpoint is consistent, I gather, with the Greenbook forecast Moreover, while it's a little hard to go through all these numbers with the revisions and so forth,  -36-    2/9-10/88  as I look at growth of M2 and M3 over the last two- or three-year period, on average, they've grown about 7-1/2 percent or maybe a touch more It seems to me, at this point in time, that we would not want to have acceleration beyond that kind of rate of growth So, I come out in the alternative III camp as well   I'm assuming I don't know any less about it today than I knew about it in the past; let me put it that way   Yes, that's right I think you might argue, although I'm not about to press it, that last year's shortfall is history now and we can't do anything about it I'm not sure you want to have much of an acceleration from that   I'd like to go back to this question on inventories and distribution of business around the world Assuming there's going to be some sort of an inventory cycle of the type you have forecast, or even greater Do you have any sense as to what extent we could take comfort that that's going to result in a greater slowing in production abroad than domestically--given that we, of course, are importing a lot more than we used to?   Well, on the other side of it, to what extent is our domestic industry going to benefit from that?   As far as the national economy is concerned, I guess my own view is a little less optimistic than the staff's, mainly because I think the first half is going to be a bit weaker My intuition is that the inventory correction might be more significant than they're predicting I also think we probably have not yet seen the effects of the stock market decline I think that's coming I also think we are in the midst of this transition that Ed Boehne has referred to--and I don't think that this transition from consumer-led growth to export-led growth needs to go smoothly in each and every quarter So, I think we have to be prepared for a certain amount of bumpiness as we go forward  Let me give you my intuition about it all in talking to people around the District, I'd say they're probably, in general, somewhat more optimistic and more positive than I am, although [not] ebullient But that has been the tenor, I think, for a while now Part of the reason is that agriculture is clearly doing better I won't go through all the reasons for this, but agriculture is doing better and people are starting to observe that that is filtering into mainstreet business in rural communities Clearly, that will be a reversal of what had been going on for a number of prior years I think retail sales, in general out our way, have been better than expected And finally, I just want to report that the major airline in our District indicates that their cargo business has been quite strong both to Europe and to the Orient--unusually strong, I'd say   I'm generally in favor of alternative B, with one slight modification that I'll get to in a moment But I think, as several people have mentioned, that we should work a little harder than we have, at least, at achieving the borrowing objective--however we specify it In light of that, and in light of what I've seen going on in the markets lately and the relationship between the funds rate/discount rate spread and borrowings, I think I would favor a borrowing target probably in the neighborhood of $200 million rather than $250 million If we worked to achieve that, I wouldn't be surprised if the funds rate might drop below 6-1/2 percent on occasion; but on occasion, it might also rise to, or maybe even above, 6-3/4 percent I wouldn't try to prejudge or pinpoint that to a great extent  As far as the long run is concerned, I am where I was before; that is, it seems to me that given all the circumstances, alternative III is the preferable one I don't see a conflict between the short- run stance of policy and the long-run objective package As I read Don's numbers, those things look like they fit perfectly They don't seem to be at all that much variance We are not very good at forecasting monetary aggregate growth month-to-month or quarter-to- quarter anyway So, I think you could convey a message about both the short-run needs and concerns about the economy as well as the long-run objective of policy with that combination   I guess I'm not in favor of a wider potential range I'm not sure I see particularly what it buys us I'm not violently opposed to it, but--   But that has been the case for some time, and for M2 and M3 we kept these 3-point ranges, regardless   Well, I don't see any problem with that I think one of the values of the ranges is that when you hit the limits, you've got to stop and think and assess the situation Do you want to permit the aggregates to go outside on the high side or the low side, or don't you? It seems to me that's one of the virtues of the ranges  -60-    2/9-10/88  And we may decide to let them go, but at least we will have given some healthy analysis to the question   What about the language in here with regard to flexibility? Would we be likely to retain that or would we pull that?   Well, if I wasn't confused before this discussion, I guess I would be now I don't know that I have very much to add In thinking about the structure of the Bluebook, I guess I'm persuaded that focusing on a borrowing target and focusing on the funds rate basically come out to the same thing When you read about the policy options [in the Bluebook] they give both the borrowing levels and the interest rate they're consistent with You can honestly do it either way Presumably, they pop out of the same kinds of equations Having said that, I think one of the major reasons this discussion has come up once again is the more fundamental problem that we're all aware of--and we've agonized over for several years now-- which is the breakdown of the money/GNP relationship Without that, we probably wouldn't be going through all this, because we'd be in a more comfortable situation of being able to focus on M1, M2, or something else, and just proceed along those lines  Having said all that, I guess I do have a preference for continuing to operate the way we were prior to October 19th--which I don't think is very far from the way we've been operating the last few weeks either--simply because I think that, on the margin, there is some value to going through the reserve side of the thought process  -27-    3/29/88  There's an awful lot of volatility out there, and a lot of shocks that hit the financial world and the real economy, and so on and so forth And it seems to me that we're best advised to try to incorporate as many of those things as possible   As far as the economy of the District is concerned, the expansion is continuing at a modest pace, and is reasonably broad-based by now I, too, have heard a few scattered reports about double ordering, and I don't think there is any question that, at least at current exchange rates, a lot of businesses in our District certainly can compete with foreign producers and foreign products  As far as the national outlook is concerned, I have changed my forecast pretty much as the staff has changed theirs in the Greenbook I have been surprised by the tenor of the incoming data on the national economy, which is generally better than I had expected I think that does call for revising up the near-term forecast What it says about the longer-term prospect for real growth, I am not altogether sure, but it makes me marginally more confident about the outlook As several people already have commented, the really striking feature about the outlook--both the one presented in the Greenbook and the one that we have developed [at our Bank]--is the acceleration of inflation that seems to be in prospect Obviously, there is a lot of uncertainty surrounding that, as there always is And the acceleration is not dramatic, but I certainly find it troubling I think that perhaps that is the key aspect at this point   With regard to policy, I think the timing question is a very difficult one, as you suggested The markets-- certainly the stock market and maybe the bond market as well--probably are vulnerable if we move too far too fast On the other hand, they're vulnerable if we delay too long I don't know what the precise, perfect timing for this kind of action is What I think about is our longer-term goal and the point I tried to make earlier that whatever is likely to happen on the wage and price side, it doesn't seem to me that there's going to be any deceleration next year    5/17/88 -5-  unless we act I think it is time for some further action, and I would be in favor of your second alternative, which is to go $100 million now, with an asymmetric directive, and expect that that probably will not be a big shock to the markets In fact, depending on circumstances, it could be welcomed And then what happens after that depends on the data that come in   That's not saying a lot!   I have some considerable sympathy for this proposal, but I don't think we ought to ask too much of it, in the sense that I don't think it's going to accomplish something that is always going to have us do the right thing But the merit I see in it, relative to current procedures, is that it does put the monetary aggregates back into the policy process--in my judgment, in a more meaningful way I think it adds some automaticity to our response relative to the current process, at least at the extremes, and I think that's important Maybe that's the same thing The third point I would make is that, under some circumstances, I think it will make us less reactive and more anticipatory And for those reasons, I think that this, at the least, merits a more serious consideration   Well, let me talk a little about the District first I commented on the drought last night and I really don't have much to add to that situation Exclusive of the drought, although it's hard to do this in any rigorous sense, I think that District economic growth is actually accelerating We have continued improvement in the mining economy, continued strength in pulp paper, wood products, and so forth And it is turning out to be a good to a very good year for tourism, even though it has been too hot to catch any fish In Minnesota, which in terms of economic activity is the heart of the District, if it weren't for the drought, I think you'd almost have to describe the situation as a boom Unemployment in Minnesota now is down to just a touch over 3 percent All the metropolitan areas, where the economy is reasonably diversified, are looking at very strong economies So, that's a description of the situation  As far as wage pressures go, what we've picked up anecdotally from some of our directors and advisory council people is this one of our manufacturers, whose entry level wage is $6 to $7 an hour, reported that he just can't keep people at that wage at all It's like running an employment agency They'll hire somebody in the morning; [the new employees] work a couple of hours and if they don't like it, they just walk out the door at the first break and apparently go across the street or go do something else It's a very tight labor market in that sense We do have reports, certainly, that minimum wage jobs are going vacant in the District Our own experience has been that it's certainly taking longer, considerably longer, to fill entry level clerical jobs than it did as recently as a year ago Another one of our manufacturers indicated that now he's just starting to have problems with the union Now, I don't think it has translated into higher wages or anything like that yet, but my impression is that the union is just starting to get more aggressive At least that's what he has reported  As far as the national economic situation is concerned, I find myself largely in agreement with the Greenbook outlook And the Greenbook, at least in my view, does point to the right issues that we have to confront here I think it might well be difficult without some further policy actions to keep the rate of increase in the deflator at or below 4 percent over some sustained period of time Whether we'd do that in any quarter-to-quarter PERIOD, I wouldn't try to forecast But I have a hunch that that's where the risks lie And I think international considerations are going to turn out to be important, perhaps increasingly important, in this situation because I am struck by the fact that it's not just our economy that has grown more rapidly over the last several quarters, but a number of important foreign economies Other things equal, I think that does add to demand pressures   Well, I have nothing to add I'd keep the ranges we have for this year and go for alternative III for next year   I like your suggestion, Mr Chairman To me, the key thing at this point is the asymmetrical directive I don't feel personally that it's necessary to do much immediately, but as I noted earlier--and many of us discussed this--I think the risks are on the side of more inflation looking down the road And I would like to be positioned to address that if and when it's appropriate I certainly can support raising the borrowing target to $600 million associated with alternative B I don't view that as having much of an effect one way or the other at this point   With regard to the national economy, a point that the staff commented on and that I would emphasize is that it seems the surprises this year really have been almost uniformly on the upside The incoming statistics seem to continue to indicate strength, as I read them, and it seems to me that we have used up capacity more quickly than we had anticipated  As I look at the District economy, both the measures of economic performance and the anecdotes I'm hearing suggest to me that surprises may continue on the upside for some time longer I commented last time that, at least in many of the diversified economies of our District, we had boom or close to boom conditions, and that's continuing in those economies The one really new piece of information that I picked up in the last several weeks that I wasn't hearing much about earlier--and allowing for all the caveats such as I don't know what the seasonal factors are and the sample is small and so forth--is that I have heard from a wide range of manufacturers about their ability to raise prices now 4 or 5 percent In some cases this is the first price increase in 2 or 3 years But they are now putting them in place And some have commented that this is now the first increase; they plan on another one later in the fall So for what that's worth, I think I've started to hear a lot more, not about concerns about inflation, but about actual price increases   I think this is a version of Governor Angell's question But what has been the historic performance of the M2 model or equation recently? Has it been tracking reasonably well?   Well, I find it a close call between whether we tighten further now or whether we wait for a while I think your suggestion about asymmetric language resolves that as far as I'm concerned, so that the specifications of "B" with asymmetric language look okay to me I do think it probably pays here to take a little pause at least, and assess the results of our actions to date, given the uncertainties associated with any forecast and errors that go with these things as well Along those same lines, I would admit that I take some comfort anyway in the slowing in M2 and the prospective slowing in M2 if Don's forecasts are in the ballpark I would not be at all troubled if that in fact materializes, or even materializes a little more pronouncedly than Don envisions I think that will help keep us on the right course   Mike, a few minutes ago you alluded to inventories as a possibility of adding a little bit to the downside But I have the impression that your inventory path is really pretty conservative Is that a fair characterization?   Another problem for the Federal Reserve   There's very little new to report on the District economy I'll try to dispense with that very quickly As I've commented before, most of the District economy is and remains very strong The obvious exception is the areas affected adversely by the drought; otherwise, the economy in the District is in good shape  As far as the national outlook is concerned, I find myself in substantial agreement with the Greenbook forecast I don't know how much of a further rise in interest rates might be required to stem building inflationary pressures, perhaps not very much, but I think the Greenbook does appropriately identify where the risks are  As I look at the latest statistics, I think they do suggest some slowing in the pace of expansion in the last month or two--a  -17-    9/20/88  slowing that, as several people have already commented, is welcomed, in my judgment But I find that there's maybe a little tendency to exaggerate this Even though I wouldn't try to construe the August labor market report as very strong, it's still a 200,000 increase in payroll employment--2-1/2 million workers at an annual rate--which is not a trivial increase in employment at all, especially given the tightness in labor markets that already exists And, as I already suggested, inventory/sales ratios look, if anything, on the low side to me So I think we may see more strength, at least in the near term, coming out of inventories than the Greenbook forecast anticipates   I support the recommendation   Well, like many, I guess I found this to be a valuable and stimulating paper In a way it formalizes a bit some of the back of the envelope kinds of calculations that a lot of us go through from time to time But a reservation that I do have about it all is that this is a rather specialized model with lots of special restrictions in it at least implicitly If one runs some more general models and tries to identify a significant impact of M2 on prices, it can be very, very hard to find that And so I'm a little at a loss at this stage to know exactly what to make of these results in a policy sense or in a more general sense I have some sympathy with them and I would like to think that M2 is important and significant and can be a valuable guide; but I must say I think we may have here only the tip of the iceberg as far as some of the evidence that we ought to be considering is concerned   Yes, I would accept that as far as the longer run is concerned   With regard to the national economy and the Greenbook forecast and the [unintelligible] that are underlying that, it seems to me that the risk of falling considerably short of what's in the Greenbook is low And I think Mike Prell outlined a number of points with which I agree that account for that Orders backlogs remain substantial; inventories remain relatively low I do think there will be further improvement over time in the trade situation And I would add to that that I don't know how much fiscal restraint is assumed in the Greenbook, but I must say I'm a little concerned about the course of fiscal policy and the [impact of] Gramm-Rudman and so forth as we go forward So, as I look at that particular forecast I don't see a lot of conditional downside risk aside from the possibility of some exogenous shock I don't know if the economy is going to do a lot better than that; I'm not saying that, but I don't see that there's a lot of risk in it I think that kind of forecast as several people have commented is welcome, in part because I think we are in for a period of rather modest growth in the labor force because of demographics and other factors We probably shouldn't get too enthusiastic about what we might do on the productivity side, and so I think that does limit things from the production or supply side of the equation  As far as the District economy is concerned in this environment, the District economy continues to perform very well There are a few pockets where the drought has had a significant and adverse effect on agriculture But as I've commented before, in the large diversified metropolitan areas, the District economy has been quite strong for some time And one thing that's now very, very clear as far as much of the rest of the rural part of the District is concerned, is that the paper and forest products industry and the mining industry are sufficiently large and are expanding sufficiently strongly that they are taking the rest of the rural economy up with them And so in this District at least a substantial economic expansion is continuing   I support your recommendation and would only add that I think Governor Angell makes some valid points about the value of the language in the directive But it does seem to me that asymmetric language remains appropriate at this juncture as I gauge the risks   Well, I agree with those who've observed that we are some significant distance away even now from pure federal funds rate targeting and I guess I would prefer to keep my distance from such targeting I see a couple of reasons for that One is to some extent the grass is always greener phenomenon Every time a problem crops up we'd like to find a better way and I would too I have a hunch that search is going to turn out to be long and arduous Equally important, as you know we were pretty much committed to the federal funds rate in the 1970s I wouldn't attribute all the problems with policy in the 1970s to the federal funds rate target, but I wouldn't say that it was helpful either Based on that historical experience, I'd be very cautious about going back to something like that Now, we may find a different way of implementing closer control of the funds rate if that's what we want to do But again I think despite the problems with the current procedure, the history of the 1970s doesn't make me sanguine about tighter control of the federal funds rate   I'm not complaining about current procedures, but as I said, it's a long way away from pure targeting of the funds rate   I guess what I wonder about in that setting is how to adjust the band, not where we are day-to-day within it   I've reported at a number of meetings now about the generally positive, actually quite positive, economic conditions in the District I've been in a lot of meetings since the last meeting of this Committee and that general tenor certainly continues In fact, one of the striking things about those series of meetings is a lack of discussion of problems that people are encountering One exception to that deals with things that I think we are well aware of like excess office space, hotel space, concerns about what people perceive to be some of the excesses on the financial side of the business world I hear a lot of talk about the shortages of labor, not just skilled but unskilled But that does not seem to have translated into what I would call generalized acceleration of wages from where they've been running While you can find people who are talking about having to raise wages 6 or 7 percent, that is by no means typical And I get the sense that generalized pressures for a variety of reasons just have not built up, and I have not been hearing anything about a generalized acceleration in prices either  As far as the national circumstances are concerned, our model forecast is somewhat stronger than the Greenbook especially going out over time But that forecast has essentially flat interest rates And, therefore, I take that forecast in some sense to be consistent with the Greenbook That is, if you want at some point to start to constrain inflation more than we have and bend it down, it is going to require higher rates If not, you are likely to get something that our model generates which is somewhat more rapid growth and no discernible progress on the inflation side I think, as several people have already commented, that the latest batch of national statistics has removed a lot of uncertainty about the state of the economy and suggests that it just has a great deal of momentum to it Even if we allow for the possibility that these statistics might be revised in the future, the gauges have been very high And as I've commented before, it seems to me from some work that we've done at our Bank that we've got to start looking toward employment gains that are running more in the neighborhood of 200,000 workers a month or less if we are going to be on a sustainable path and if we are going to bring inflation down further over time And I suspect that if and when that happens, there is going to be a lot of comment and some concern about whether the economy may be slowing excessively And I would suggest that that's more like what we need and more sustainable  -41-    12/13-14/88   I agree with those who think that we need some further tightening and that we need it right away I came in here favoring something between "B" and "C," which I interpret to be pretty close to what you've proposed, Mr Chairman One way we might approach that--a little elaboration on that--something we used to do would be to just put a range on borrowings, $500 to $600 million Not only does that have the value of getting us in the direction we want to go, but given the uncertainty between interest rates and borrowings these days, it gives us a little more explicit flexibility it seems to me in terms of how policy is implemented The only thing I would add to all of that, this is certainly for more serious consideration in February rather than immediately, is that I do think we should keep an eye on the long-term situation I would admit that I take some comfort in the modest growth we've had in M2 over the last year or two, though I wouldn't bet the farm on it But in light of that modest growth, I wonder if a 7 percent upper limit on the M2 range in 1989 is really appropriate And it strikes me to be on the high side given M2's performance in the last year or two  -58-    12/13-14/88   Right   I think the case for alternative "II" is a strong one Bob Forrestal made part of it given the staff forecast of M2 and the GNP forecast and so forth, that does get us closer to the center of that particular range That is, if M2 is going to grow something in the neighborhood of 3-1/2 percent, that range is just more appropriate in its own right But beyond that, we've had modest growth in M2 in both 1987 and 1988 Against that background, it doesn't seem to me that an upper end of that range as high as 7 percent for 1989 is appropriate I must say, finally, that as far as considering possible ranges for 1990 and what we might want to do next year, I don't know how that's all going to play out But I think what we can say with some confidence is that if we're committed to price stability over time we're going to want to see modest growth in M2 again in 1990 I don't expect that we're going to run into difficulty Therefore, if we move to 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 [unintelligible]   Mike, with regard to the slowing in auto sales that you have in here Is that due principally to a squeeze on income or is it the effects of the age of the stock of vehicles on the road?   With regard to the District economy, the expansion in the District remains very solid at this point in time The fourth quarter probably turned out better than many people had expected Retail sales--these are [reports] from a major retailer-- were distinctly stronger in December and in January than we might have expected And there is, by the way, a major expansion in the paper industry underway in the District in a variety of locations  Looking at the national economy, if I compare our model's forecast to the Greenbook I would have to say that our model's forecast is more favorable in the sense that it has somewhat more rapid economic growth with basically stable rates of inflation--at recent levels--and stable interest rates Having said that, I think there is a message there that's similar to the Greenbook message that is, that if you want to get the rate of inflation down it's going to take more than prevailing interest rates to accomplish that--or at least there is a relatively high probability that that's the case If I look at the data as the Greenbook does on compensation, producer prices, consumer prices, and so on for the last year I think there clearly was a deterioration in the cost and price picture My concern is that that might well continue I would admit that to date we have had less inflation than I would have expected, given the growth in the economy and pressures as I perceive them on capacity But having said that, we still have more inflation than I would like to see  -14-    2/7-8/89   Well, let me comment a little further about the risks as I see them I don't see much risk at this point in time, with one caveat, to some further tightening I personally wouldn't go all the way to "C," but I would be inclined to go to $700 million [borrowing] immediately The only risk that I can really see of doing that relates to external factors--the issue of external balance And I think the solution to that ultimately lies with a change in fiscal policy rather than anything that we can do Beyond that it does seem to me that something between "B" and "C" is appropriate here and now As I say, I don't see much risk to the real domestic economy from such a move While I personally feel that inflation is already excessive and probably will rise, we may be pleasantly surprised here; I'll acknowledge that But I don't see that an additional small move at this point in time is going to [be harmful]; if anything, it's simply going to help [produce] a pleasant surprise if we're fortunate And at best it will turn out to have been an appropriate action I don't place a lot of weight on it but there apparently is some expectation in the market that some further tightening is imminent And I don't think we want to see rates slide back from where they are now  -55-    2/7-8/89   Peter, you may already have answered this indirectly, but in view of the widely recognized problems in the relationship between borrowings and interest rates I wonder if some market participants believe now that we're targeting the funds rate?   I said rates; you said borrowings   Getting back to a rate   Okay   With regard first to the District economy, in general things remain in good shape and there haven't been any major surprises or new developments that are worth reporting, with a couple of exceptions On the side of real activity the one surprise that I've noticed is that nonresidential construction activity is certainly stronger than I would have expected at this point Major projects continue to be announced and initiated in the Twin Cities and the way things are shaping up it looks like that's going to keep that sector reasonably strong early into the next decade Labor markets generally remain tight and sectors that had been expanding are continuing to expand Having said that, I do have the sense from talking to a variety of business people that the rate of expansion has eased a bit And it's very clear to me that in the last several months, at least, business people are once again noticing interest rates Interest rates have become a topic of conversation whereas as recently as perhaps four or five months ago that subject hardly, if ever, came up But that's now back on the agenda Another subject where the tone of the anecdotal information seems to have changed is cost increases In the past a lot of business people would tell you about the cost increases that they were experiencing and the difficulties they were having in passing those cost increases through They will admit now that they're having less difficulty moving those cost increases through They hardly, if ever, complain any longer about the difficulty in doing so  As far as the national outlook is concerned, I have little to add I think there are some signs that we may be approaching a soft landing, at least as far as real growth is concerned I wouldn't want to exaggerate those signs, given that January was probably boosted by very favorable weather and some backing off in February was almost inevitable We do run an unfettered model forecast; it's a wholly unfettered [vector] auto-regressive model And for what that's worth, that does not have a recession in it It has continued real growth in '89 and '90, and it has that at modest rates And, at least as far as consumer prices are concerned, it has somewhat more rapid inflation than the Greenbook   Well, Si Keehn and Bob Parry have already pretty much emphasized what I would want to point out That is, I'm afraid that market participants believe we are targeting the federal funds rate closely at this juncture So, while I favor "B" I think it's important, as we pause in the process of tightening here, that we make sure we pause at the right place and don't give the market a signal that we are in some sense backing off That's all I would add   Sam, given this significant increase, are the pressures, looking out a bit, still for a further rise in the dollar? Or are there some ongoing worries about a precipitous decline in the dollar and so forth?   Is that what you have in here--a further increase in interest rates of about 65 or 75 basis points late in the year or something?   I, too, like most of what I see at the moment To review the District economy briefly in the rural areas we have had for some time now, and it's continuing, an expansion led by recovery in copper and iron ore mining, specialty mining, strength in the forest products and the pulp paper business--strength limited mainly at the moment by environmental concerns and some shortages of raw materials The agricultural situation is shaping up in a very positive way, at least at the moment, because moisture in most of the District has been pretty good And people are optimistic about the upcoming tourist season With regard to the diversified metropolitan areas, those economies have been strong for a long time and generally remain so There have been some layoffs in some of the high-tech areas but those economies seem to absorb that pretty readily There is concern about the pace of automobile sales That's maybe the one major new element on that side of things There are also, though, labor shortages; both skilled and unskilled labor has been tight for some time What I'm picking up now is growing concern about the militancy of both organized and so-called disorganized labor There  -26-    5/16/89  is some concern about that translating into further wage pressures; businessmen seem to be divided at the moment as to whether they will be able to pass those wage and cost increases through fully or not  With regard to the national economy, our model forecast differs in many particulars with the Board staff's but the overall picture isn't very different at all It looks to me like things are unfolding about as well as we could hope for at the moment Having said that, I do think the risks have changed since we last met But I wouldn't want to exaggerate that One of the things we routinely do with our model is calculate the probability of recession, conventionally defined, going out the next 7 or 8 quarters While that probability has gone up a bit recently it hasn't gone up very much; it's not far from where it has been most of the last two years So, I take that to mean that things have shifted a bit but not a great deal   I support your basic recommendation, Mr Chairman It seems to me that this is a good time to go to the symmetric language, both to recognize the change that has occurred in the circumstances but also because I have a hunch that--as a practical matter both for our own internal purposes and from the perspective of market participants--the nuances involved in asymmetry and so forth are not likely to matter a lot People know the general structure of this directive and they know that they're looking at the same incoming information we're looking at They know pretty much where we are  -44-    5/16/89  And I think this is a good time simply to remove the asymmetry and let the evidence tell the tale   Thank you, Mr Vice Chairman I'm sensitive, as I think everyone is, to the emphasis on the long-run objective of price stability But from my perspective, I think this is the time to acknowledge our uncertainty about 1990 I think it's possible to oversell this signal effect with regard to the ranges It's more important, in my mind anyway, where we actually come out rather than what our announcement is as to the particular ranges at this point in time Where my uncertainty about the outlook and the associated growth in the aggregates for 1990 lead me would be simply to adopt the    7/5-6/89  1989 ranges for 1990 I find it a little awkward to lower, say, the M3 and debt ranges and maintain M2, as under alternative II, for example It seems to me that that suggests we know more than we do-- that we're in a position where we can lower some ranges and not others And I find it difficult to go down that path It just seems to me that at this point in time we don't lose much by simply reestablishing the 1989 ranges for 1990 recognizing, as already has been pointed out, that we're going to get another look, or two looks, at that later this year and in February I happen to believe that we're certainly going to learn a lot over the next six months about prospects for 1990, and I'd want to use that information   As best I can judge, the District economy is now performing very similarly to the national economy That is, the pace of the expansion in general has slowed--allowing, of course, for the usual diversity between economic sectors and particular regions within the District As this has happened it seems that earlier concerns and reports about inflationary pressures have ebbed at the same time; and this has gone on even though for the most part labor markets remain quite tight and we continue to hear reports of labor shortages  With regard to the national economic outlook, our model generates an interest-rate pattern similar to the Greenbook--that is, essentially flat interest rates from here on out--and somewhat more rapid real growth, especially for 1990 I personally am a little more cautious than that, in part from reading and reviewing many of the same statistics we've all looked at and Governor Johnson summarized But having said that, I would also add that in many respects it seems to me that things have worked out largely as we might have hoped a few months ago, in the sense that I think it was recognized that we needed a slowing in consumer spending and a slowing in the pace of employment gains if we were to arrest what appeared to be building inflationary pressures and some deterioration in the psychology about the price outlook So, I think in many ways things have evolved about as well as we might have hoped   But I thought National rejected the contract   Don, are there any reasons why you may be more or less confident about the path of M2 over the next 6 months than usual?   I support your prescription   Mike, you made a passing reference to fiscal policy What difference, if any, would it make to the forecast if you had CBO's spending number rather than yours? It's about a $36 billion difference but--   Well, Mr Chairman, there's really little new to report on the District economy at this point It seems to be performing much like the national economy, as best as I can judge; that is, it's performing reasonably well but it is not uniformly strong at this point We have had some reports that things in the labor market have changed a bit in the sense that it's a little easier to find and retain workers On the other hand, there are some signs of growing labor militancy, although in general wages or even broader compensation matters are not the issues; it's really other things having to do with union shops and so forth I have had a couple of business people mention to me--I presume tongue in cheek--that they would like to see the unemployment rate go up  As far as the national economy is concerned, I think the changes to the Greenbook forecast relative to the view of the last meeting are in the right direction, but they are probably too modest My own view is that we're going to get somewhat more real growth and somewhat lower inflation than the Greenbook suggested this time I must admit I've been struck by what I've been hearing about the continued lack of build-up in wage and compensation pressures and by what I've been hearing about materials prices Clearly, a lot of business people have reported that materials prices have leveled off or have been declining and aren't the problem they were earlier So, allowing for the possibility, of course, that further data revisions may change what is rather a nice picture, it seems to me that things are going almost unbelievably well   I too support "B" It seems to me at this point that the risks are evenly and rather finely balanced It wouldn't surprise me if things went awry in one direction or the other, but I'd be hard pressed at this point to express a conviction about which way they might go Given that, I favor symmetric language I also favor it for another reason it seems to me that the modest growth in M2 in recent years, coupled with the performance of the dollar, has served us well That's the reason why I'm a bit more optimistic about the inflation outlook than some; and I wouldn't want to compromise that at this point For that reason as well I would favor symmetric language   Double "A"   My views have been deviating a bit from the Greenbook in recent months and the deviation has grown In terms of the economy, looking at the latest statistics and our own internal forecast and talking to business people around the District and elsewhere, I'm somewhat more optimistic about the outlook for real growth going forward It looks to me like the economy, all things considered, is in remarkably good shape And I expect that's going to continue On the price side, too, I'm more optimistic in the sense that I think we have an opportunity to make more progress against inflation than the Greenbook envisions I say that in part because of the course of monetary policy over the last 2-1/2 years, but also in part because business people I talk to are clearly reporting an abatement of inflationary pressures That has been going on for several months despite the fact that there are many tight labor markets in our District; that doesn't seem to have been translated into wage pressures I can only presume that concern about job security and the well known international environment--where foreign competition has been so very important--have served as restraining influences I must say, having given that optimistic assessment, that I hate to go back to an old and somewhat unhappy topic but I do think this is all jeopardized by the course of the dollar, should it continue to decline I think that would back up very quickly into deterioration in the inflationary situation and outlook and, ultimately, into the growth outlook as well So I think there are some very serious risks there   Well, I too favor alternative B I have a mild preference for symmetric language just against the circumstances in which we find ourselves There are indeed a lot of problems that might impinge upon us, but it seems to me that the best policy we can adopt, given all these potential problems, is to try to keep the economy on a relatively even keel And I think "B" accomplishes that I certainly wouldn't want to see M2 growth in the near term--by that I  -41-    10/3/89  mean the fourth quarter and going into next year--go above that associated with "B" I do think our credibility is very important and I think we have to be very careful about that matter   Well, comparing the District economy to the national economy, it looks to me like the District economy continues to do a bit better than the national economy Agriculture has had a pretty good year; residential construction has picked up a little recently; and mining and forest products and paper industries are all doing well--there's expansion underway in those, certainly in the  -17-    11/14/89  mining and the paper areas Tourism had a good year thus far and we're expecting a good winter season; employment gains have been small but the unemployment rates remain low pretty much throughout the District At the retail level, at least among the major retailers, they have had a good year and they're anticipating a good holiday season and are quite optimistic Where there has been softness recently is where we've seen it nationally, it seems to me, and that's in manufacturing One of the questions I've been asking myself is What are the implications of what we've been seeing in manufacturing nationwide? How much weight ought to be given to what's happening in the manufacturing sector? I think what we're seeing is at least a bit reminiscent of what happened in 1985 and 1986 In going back and looking at that period, manufacturing employment nationwide declined over those two years by about 600,000 workers For a period of time, at least, new orders for nondefense capital equipment were flat and purchasing managers' surveys showed some weakness While all that was going on the economy really turned in a pretty respectable performance Having said that, though, it was also a period when interest rates were coming down and money growth was accelerating But it seems to me that it tends to emphasize a couple of things of which we're always aware One is the uncertainty in looking at the outlook And the second is the caution required, because coming out of the 1985-86 period the real growth continued--if anything probably more strongly than many had expected--and there was some clear uptick in inflation and inflationary pressures at the same time So my reading of recent economic history suggests that the economy probably can weather some heavy seas at least in manufacturing It may require a response but it seems to me that we want to be cautious about the degree of that response   I would support your recommendation, Mr Chairman, of alternative B with asymmetric language There are only [a few] thoughts I would add to this Given the uncertainties about the near-term economic outlook, this may be a time to pay at least a bit more attention to the aggregates, to M2 Analytically that makes sense; also, M2 has responded in recent months more or less as expected and I think we can get some help there If I fully believed the staff's inflation forecast for 1990 and 1991, I would be very discouraged about what we're facing But the one thing I do conclude with that forecast is that I would be very worried about declines in the dollar from here on out   An interesting dilemma If you start with cell 1 on Exhibit 14 that is a course in which the higher the sacrifice ratio that you s-cart with, the greater the burden you place on benefits to make the whole exercise worthwhile Or another way of saying it is the more seriously, it seems to me, you've got to consider stabilizing inflation at the current rate, assuming that's possible--I have some doubts about that But if you start with something like that I would be surprised, given what I know about the benefits, whether you can grind them out and make them equivalent to the costs  SPEAKER(?) But that's a question--   I understand; I understand that   No, I'm saying I personally would start with the weak credibility case So that gets me off to a different start I'm saying that if you start with something as pessimistic as that I think you have a difficult challenge in a rigorous way to justify it   That's right I personally don't think--   On the timetable question, I think we can establish a relatively specific timetable because I think we have to provide more rather than less In other words, I would suggest that if we wanted to do that--say, pick 1995 or whatever in the middle of the decade--we should also explain what else we expect to happen What are the accompanying developments? What are we really looking at as best we can judge the situation? That includes being specific about such things as our not anticipating anything extraordinary happening to energy prices or to the dollar or whatever I don't think it's credible to simply say the target is zero inflation by 1995 and let it go at that It seems to me that we should provide more information, and then as things unfold we're in a good position to explain why we either are or are not achieving the path we set for ourselves, or why we have to make modifications because of events we can't control I don't think that's terribly different, frankly, from what we're doing right now with the Humphrey-Hawkins testimony We're simply going further There's going to be a lot of uncertainty, but that's always the case And if we're providing more information so that people can understand what our true objective is, and the circumstances surrounding that objective, and the conditioning assumptions and so forth--if we put it in those terms--I think we can do it But I think to just throw it out there would get us in trouble from a number of different perspectives So, I wouldn't just establish a zero inflation objective by some time period As far as the question of the price level or the rate of inflation yes, theoretically, I think we want a steady price level But in practice I'll take Ed Boehne's suggestion let's get the rate of inflation down and then we'll worry about what we do next after that    12/18-19/89   Well, I have only a little to add to all of this I think Tom Melzer is probably right We're going to need to shift the focus to some measure or measures of the money supply as we proceed here if we can, both for substantive reasons and also because that has some political advantages as well, as we go forward My experience is similar to that of some of the others who have commented Once in a while I'll have a business person come up to me and say that they support the zero inflation objective; but most of the time the sense I get is that they don't have any trouble with 4 and 5 percent inflation and they're more or less content with that   It's mixed in the board   Well, that's what I was going to say I think part of the motivation behind this is the squeeze on profits I don't think there's much question about that Part of it, as somebody already commented, is that we have had 7 years of expansion and improving prosperity, and people--or some people at least--are reasonably content with all of that The other aspect, which is really the other side of the same coin, is that in our District unemployment rates in almost every state are below the national average and yet the number one political issue out there is still jobs I've been trying to figure out how you reconcile that All I can figure out now is that the 1980-82 recession left such an indelible impression on so many people that that is still a big, big issue and people just don't want to tangle with something like that again   With regard first to the District economy, I think the economy is actually better than the mood What is weighing on the mood are a couple of things that we talked about yesterday One is that profit margins are getting squeezed and that clearly is affecting business peoples' view of the situation The other is the struggling manufacturing sector in our area, particularly high-tech But if you go beyond that, major retailers seem at least satisfied and maybe more with holiday sales thus far There are scattered reports of smaller specialty operations not doing very well, but the major stores seem happy The reports on virtually all the metropolitan areas in the District are generally positive in terms of business conditions And because of some recovery in agriculture and other factors that I've mentioned before--including tourism, strength in the paper products and lumber industry, and expansion in mining--most of the rural areas are doing pretty well One exception, which is sizable geographically but not so sizable in terms of population, is North Dakota where there are a series of problems; otherwise, the District economy continues in my view to be in pretty good shape  -80-    12/18-19/89  With regard to the national economic situation, I don't think there's any doubt that we're in for two or three slow quarters I just don't see a way around that But beyond that, my guess is that the Greenbook forecast is perhaps a bit on the cautious or conservative side Looking at income and consumer balance sheets, I think consumer spending on nondurables and services will do better as next year progresses and as 1991 unfolds than the Greenbook suggests at the moment On the inflation situation I've been more optimistic for some time that we would start to see some disinflation or deceleration in the rate of price increases I must admit, given the statistics over the last quarter or so in consumer prices and in compensation and so forth, that I'm beginning to wonder whether that has been an accurate assessment I just don't have the sense, looking at that data, that such optimism is quite as justified as it might have been I do pick up comments occasionally in the District When you ask business people about inflation, they say it's not a problem; but if you get them to elaborate, what they mean by "not a problem" is that it's continuing at 4 or 5 percent   Well, Mr Chairman, I think you have made the case for taking some action now What troubles me about it is that I think if we do take that action, it's going to make our job more difficult as 1990 rolls along in terms of bringing in M2 growth about where we'd like it to be--at a rate of growth consistent with our attainment of our longer-run objective Weighing those factors and acknowledging that it's a difficult choice, I come out on the side of not taking any action now and going with an asymmetric directive even more strongly; a symmetric directive I can certainly live with But knowing what I can see about 1990 and the trajectory that M2 has been on and so forth, I just don't think that this is a circumstance where I'd want to push further   [This] might help Manley a little I think M2 ran for almost two quarters earlier this year at the bottom end of, if not outside, the range; I can't remember exactly And I don't think the market overreacted to that in the sense that we were going to force the aggregates back in at the same time we were raising interest rates It was clear we weren't intending to do it I think they had the aggregates back a little further even than we did   Well, I'm concerned about all'these choices and the circumstances we find ourselves in I'm not worried at the moment about how we're going to get to price stability; I'm worried about how we're going to start to bring inflation down to what I think ought to be a somewhat more modest objective And it seems to me to be one of the [unintelligible] in M2 growth If you look at the recent history of M2, as Don pointed out, it has been running the last 3 years with increases of 4-1/4 to 5-1/4 percent per year Even allowing for some slippage, that suggests to me an upper limit on the M2 range in 1990  -32-    2/6-7/90  of about 6 percent I really am concerned that anything above that would represent, obviously, some significant acceleration over its recent trends and would not help us on the inflation side In my view it would make it more difficult to bring inflation down in the future I really think we're placing an awful lot of emphasis on the precision of these relationships in these alternatives and strategies; I find that very difficult to accept So, I personally think that something like an M2 range of 3 to 6 percent is appropriate here And I guess I'm not really concerned about M3 and debt     Mike, I'm not sure I understand your personal income forecast If I look at the middle panel of Chart 10, your numbers for '90 and '91 are comparable with '80, '81, and '82 But at best it looks like it stays on the weak side even given your modest growth path   Well, there's little new to report as far as the District economy is concerned We've had a modest and sustainable expansion underway for a long time now It seems to be continuing and it seems to be reasonably well balanced both by economic sector and by region of the District for the most part There is some pessimism and concern around and that has been true for a while But for the most part that doesn't seem to be reflected in the actual numbers on economic performance In talking to some business people I too hear reports about a leveling off or declines in some input prices, especially materials But where you don't hear that, of course--and I think where the problem is to some degree--is in compensation Clearly, if anything--at least in our area--it is accelerating Part of it is the medical cost problem, but I don't think it's tied exclusively to that If you look at inflation from the wage and compensation cost side, that's a distinct problem  As far as the national situation is concerned, as I suggested with that question I asked earlier, I think the economy will do a bit better in 1990 than the Greenbook suggests I think the Greenbook is conservative in regard to real disposable income and growth in consumer spending As a consequence, I think we'll see a little more strength there It wouldn't alter the outlook radically in my view, but I think the economy will do a little better As far as inflation is concerned nationally, I have been cautiously optimistic for some time that we were going to succeed in bringing inflation down sometime soon I must admit my optimism is fading I would simply note that if you look at consumer prices excluding food and energy, the rate of increase has been stuck on a fourth quarter-over-fourth quarter basis in the 4 to 4-1/2 percent range since 1983 Actually, I think there was one year that it was worse But otherwise, it has been pretty well stuck there since 1983; we just haven't made any further progress over that whole timeframe   Well, I also favor no change in policy at this juncture, largely for the reasons that you and Ed Boehne have expressed I don't see much of a case for any change As far as the real economy is concerned, even if it's starting to improve, it's likely to remain sluggish for another quarter or two anyway I am sensitive to how rapidly the money supply, M2, grows this year, but I don't have any sense of urgency that we have to start doing something about it on the basis of the projection that has been presented so far Experience, it seems to me, has taught us that these growth rates can wander around substantially over periods as long as six months or so So, as I said, I don't have a lot of urgency about that at the moment I also would favor symmetric language for the reasons expressed and also because it doesn't tie our hands   Well, I have a much narrower and less provocative question It has to do with profits We have seen this pressure on profits for quite some time now Is that pretty widely distributed across the economy or is it concentrated in a few sectors of manufacturing or where?   Thank you   With regard to the District economy, as been the case for quite some time now, there is very little new to report It's pretty much the same as the national economy that is, continued modest expansion is under way It seems likely to me to continue The major concerns of the District at the moment are the continuation of drought in some areas and prospective problems in the commercial real estate area But the latter is probably at least a year or two off just because of the level of activity that's currently under way  With regard to the national economy, I largely agree with the Greenbook forecast And as many people have already commented, as far as inflation is concerned that's unfortunate It confirms my view that we're simply stuck at around this 4-1/2 percent rate of inflation that we've had for quite some time With regard to the real economy, I don't disagree much with the Greenbook forecast I think we have to be careful not to overreact to the latest month or two worth of numbers We might find ourselves whipsawing policy and markets and so forth On the other hand, as the Greenbook observes and as our own exercise confirms, if one takes the January and February payroll employment number seriously we can easily get 3 percent real growth in the first quarter; and there is some possibility that those numbers are right If they are, and if that's telling us something not only about the immediate status of the economy but about its prospects, we might be looking at even more growth than the Greenbook suggests I  -26-    3/27/90  would fear in those circumstances that there may be even more inflation   Well, at the least we obviously have a difficult timing problem here But I find that I come out where you do We have seen that inflation is at least as stubborn, and maybe more stubborn, than many of us had expected; and that may require a tightening move But at the moment, at least, I don't have a sense of urgency about it I think, as Tom Melzer said earlier, it's probably low cost to wait until the next meeting; and indeed, if we get a lot of confirming evidence earlier than that, we always do have the opportunity to act if that would seem to be appropriate I don't want to whipsaw the economy or policy by moving now and then finding out through a series of data revisions and incoming information and so on and so forth that we overestimated some of the improvement Looking at inflation from a longer-run perspective, I don't know what it will take to start to bring it down Obviously, the scenario in the Greenbook doesn't suggest any progress in the next year or two But I think the best thing we can do under all these circumstances, as I've said before, is probably to see to it that M2 growth remains modest And I am encouraged at least about the near-term prospects there although unfortunately, as Don mentioned, it may be a little hard to read M2 as the quarter unfolds just because of the tax payment issue Assuming we get something like [the staff estimate], then we're on a rather sensible course and I prefer to wait a while longer and let some more evidence accumulate I have a mild preference for retaining a symmetric directive just because I think that maximizes flexibility I'm almost always in favor of that But for now it's a mild preference   The District economy looks largely like the national economy There are distinct pockets of great weakness, although overall I think it's probably continuing to perform, as it has for some time, a bit better than the national economy--whether you look at the overall growth of nonfarm employment or at specific industries that continue to perform very well, such as paper and forest products, mining, and tourism There are some other surprising bits of positive news that I'll just pass on One is that major retailers, at least in the District, continue to post very good results And home sales in the Twin Cities in the first quarter were running 15 percent above last year's first quarter and that had been a steady number month-by-month So, there have been some pretty good numbers there Also, the extent of the drought in the District has been narrowed as a consequence of some fairly heavy rains in March and April and so far in May And there's some [unintelligible] number of good reports not only of crop prospects but about capital spending in agriculture for this year  I might as well give you my two cents worth on the credit crunch We're certainly hearing a lot fewer and a lot lower volume of concerns from agriculture and small business than we were hearing a few years ago when the Farm Credit System was in distress and when there were serious problems in agriculture and so forth That's when we heard a lot about it I must say today, relative to that period, it's absolutely quiet for the most part out our way A major national developer that we're close to has reported difficulties--not his own but of competitors--in obtaining credit In fact, he has reported that on a couple of deals where he was not the low bidder and did not get the contract initially the low bidder couldn't get financing so he wound up with the contract In terms of economic activity, of course, there is no depressing effect The project is going to get done; it's just a question of who is getting the credit   And he's rather happy   Well, from the point of view of GNP you get a little more! As far as the national economy in concerned, I certainly agree with the underlying thrust of real growth as presented in the Greenbook On the inflation side, I take that message to heart as well Having said that, though, I must say that I don't have any anecdotal evidence suggesting that inflation pressures are building at the moment It seems to be pretty much the status quo And some business people at least are concerned that an effort to bring inflation down from 4 or 5 percent or wherever it is would be bad for their business because, of course, what they envision is that a recession would accompany it   Some people expressed the view prior to the coffee break that "steady-as-you-go" has served us tolerably well--at least so far--and I think that's true For the time being, I favor a continuation of that policy That would be "B" symmetric, in my judgment I do think, though, that it's a matter of timing I don't pretend to have any special insight about this, but it does seem to me that at best we can argue that the core rate of inflation remains stuck in the 4 to 5 percent neighborhood in which it has been for some time And at the same time, as I think Manley was describing, the  -29-    5/15/90  world more generally has become a somewhat more inflationary place Some of the European countries in particular have taken advantage of what's going on in Germany to stimulate their economies and so forth And I think that does raise the odds, as you expressed, that we are going to have to tighten at some point in the future if we're going to unstick inflation   Where I start on all this, Mr Chairman, is with the M2 growth rates that Governor Angell enumerated We are well into our fourth year of moderate growth in that aggregate and I think it's important that we sustain that kind of performance It's important principally because that's what is going to get us to our long-run objectives and to the kind of overall economic performance that we want to achieve in the long run So having said that, I think we should lower the ranges for 1991, consistent with the alternatives specified here I would apply that to all the variables although, as I said before, M2 is the one that I at least focus on principally I think it's important that we consolidate what we have accomplished over the past several years, and in my judgment that's the kind of range that will help us do that With regard to 1990, the current year, I feel a little less strongly about what we ought to do with the ranges Despite some of the mysteries surrounding what has happened to M2 [and M3] recently, it seems to me that we have enough information with regard to the thrift contraction and so forth that it probably does make sense to lower the ranges for 1990 as well That's where I would come out with regard to that issue As I think Don mentioned yesterday, and certainly we're all aware of it, if we were to get some meaningful budget package and a meaningful shift in fiscal policy--and that's a big "if"--we might want to reexamine all this I certainly wouldn't prejudge where we would come out were that to happen; that's going to depend on an awful lot of things, including progress toward our objective and what's happening to market rates and bank offering rates, and the list goes on and on So, at this point I think we just have to put that issue aside and be prepared to deal with it if and when it becomes appropriate   No, I would lower those because I think we have enough information to make the case that that's the sensible thing to do   Yes   I'd lower that as well  -32-    7/2-3/90 -33-   Yes   Well, I have two reactions One is that I don't think we felt that we knew the magnitude of the thrift [effects] with any precision But I don't think it's just the question of the thrifts The year is half over, so in some sense we have the 3-1/2 percent or so growth of M2 behind us for six months We're looking at relatively modest projections for M2 growth for the third quarter as well Those may turn out to be wrong, admittedly; but if they are in the ballpark, we have pretty modest growth for about 3/4 of the year and that's a fair amount of information it seems to me   Well, I guess I can't judge the degree of precision with which Congress views this [target-setting] I've always viewed it as clearly having a wide range of uncertainty   With regard first to the District economy, for some time I have reported that it was doing better than the nation as a whole We just had some data revisions; the series we follow most closely are nonfarm employment and income, and the data revisions confirm those reports Both for 1989 and early in 1990 at least, the District has outperformed the nation I think essentially what is going on is that the natural resource industries in the District, which sometimes act as a drag, have actually been pulling things up In that regard, I'm referring to mining and forest products and paper and, of course more recently, agriculture In fact, the farmers in our District have just about run out of things to complain about and that almost never happens We too have had a lot of rain but it was much needed So, people's spirits are up and that has positive implications not only for morale and farm output but for implement spending and so forth On top of what has happened to natural resources, as I have reported before, the diversified economies in the Twin Cities and some of the other mid-size metropolitan areas have done pretty well throughout most of this expansion We recently had meetings not just with our directors but also with our advisory council on small business, agriculture, and labor And, based on those meetings, I would say the general tenor is positive It is not ebullient; there certainly is not a great deal of confidence going forward, but in general they are relatively satisfied with what is happening at the moment There are a couple of exceptions, both of which are obvious anybody whose business is related to defense is concerned as are those in construction--although they are not concerned about new home sales, I must add, which continue to run above year-ago levels in many places in the District Generally, I don't think the District is going to continue to outperform the national economy much longer It is likely to perform much like the national economy; that is, I think things are going to become a bit more sluggish as we go ahead  Commenting very briefly on the national situation, I have a [unintelligible] sense that, as Tom Melzer and a couple of others suggested, we may be poised for some progress on inflation in terms of disinflation here I say that in part because of the slow growth in money that we've had over an extended series of years now, but also because in terms of anecdotes from people in the District I really haven't had any reports of growing inflation pressures in at least a year Of course, the latest aggregate price statistics look a bit better Now, the obvious kickers are the services sector and some of  -17-    7/2-3/90 -18-  the things that Mike pointed out in his report about the [unintelligible] and so forth Nevertheless, I think we may be close to a point where we finally start to see some progress there As far as real growth is concerned, I'm pretty comfortable with the Greenbook forecast or maybe even something a bit better I think most of the fundamentals are in place for some acceleration of growth But having said that, I must say that the statistics for the last few months on employment and consumer spending, and my impression of what is happening with home prices, raise the yellow flag   Where I stumble a bit with your suggestion is with the automaticity of the move I too have a great deal of interest not only in the upcoming data but in how the economy is likely to perform over the next several months given the situation as it has changed with regard to consumer spending and whatever wealth effects we may get out of housing I must admit to a lot of uncertainty as to how that's all going to play out I'm a little concerned by the asymmetric directive with the automaticity of moving on the basis of another week or two weeks' worth of data; that gives me some pause   I don't disagree with your interpretation of the latest data at all It's just that I've watched these data bounce around an awful lot   No, actually, I had concluded what I was going to say You've elaborated your views on how you see this And, as I said before, my concern was with the automaticity of the move not with the asymmetric language on "B"   No, I would say I'm somewhat comforted by your comments   Let me go back to the budget In looking at developments in Iraq and Kuwait and trying to understand the economic consequences of that in the forecast, the one thing that surprises me is that I, at least, don't catch anything on the military outlays and what that is likely to mean for the outlook   Well, as far as the District goes, it's more of the same Growth is unspectacular but it's steady We continue to do a bit better than the nation; of course, that's not a very remarkable statement these days But most of what has been happening in the District reflects a continuity of what has happened over the last several months Agriculture remains good; tourism has been good; most of the natural resource related industries are doing well; and the diversified metropolitan areas continue to do well, all things considered I would say that we're not likely in my District to continue to outperform the national economy much longer, but at the moment anyway things are still going a bit better than at the national level The run-up in oil prices as a result of Iraq and Kuwait occurred too late to stop the bikers from descending on Sturgis [unintelligible] So that turned out to be a successful event and injected a lot of income into the South Dakota economy  With regard to the national outlook, somebody used the word "dilemma" earlier and I think that captures it Even before the invasion of Kuwait, we were looking at slow growth and we were looking at that simultaneously with a lack of progress in bringing down inflation And it seems to me if that was the dilemma, it has only been sharpened by what has happened in the Middle East Obviously, I can't assess magnitudes, but I think it's fair to say the dilemma has  -21-    8/21/90  been sharpened My own judgment is that on top of all that--and one could probably point to some other things that have gone wrong--the likelihood of any progress on the budget has diminished as a consequence of this I would guess, although this is a double-edged sword, that we will see some kick to military spending before this is all said and done Now, that may help the real economy a bit, but I just have a sense that there's an awful lot of turmoil out there and that the dilemma, as I say, has worsened   Don, what do you project for M2 growth in the fourth quarter given something like the baseline assumption?  -34-    8/21/90   I support your position as well I think it's the right prescription for these circumstances There might be something to be said for a symmetric directive, in part because that's my usual preference and in part because of all the uncertainties and risks But I don't feel very strongly about that at the moment   Thank you, Mr Chairman For some time I have commented on reasonably good economic conditions in the District and I think by objective measures that is still the case The economy is continuing to expand at least modestly Of course, every generalization has holes in it and, as Si Keehn reported, farm implement sales clearly have leveled off--and they had been quite strong in the spring in our District Agricultural conditions in general are very good, but there are remaining pockets of drought, so there obviously are ongoing problems in those areas The construction sector has weakened in some locations Having said that, and having reported that I think by objective measures the District economy is expanding, like a lot of other people who have commented I think what has changed recently are attitudes, which clearly have deteriorated significantly There's a good deal of concern out there; we're even picking up some questions about the status of the large money center banks, which is a topic that doesn't come up very often in our District But there is some concern about that Attitudes clearly have worsened as a generalization, but there are exceptions I happened to be in a meeting with the treasurers of many of the corporations based in the Twin Cities and they almost universally reported business as strong Now, these companies tend to have very large international exposure, not just selling abroad but operating abroad So, they're not saying the US economy is strong per se But they are reporting that business for the most part is strong There were a couple of exceptions; but in general I was surprised by the tenor of their remarks and the comfort they seem to have, at least looking at their businesses worldwide  In regard to the national economic outlook, I don't disagree much with the Greenbook forecast Our own model has us avoiding a recession, although we have a continuation of three or four more quarters of very slightly positive real growth But we can also calculate probabilities of recession with the model, and clearly the probabilities have gone up relative to those calculated prior to the previous FOMC meeting I think that's just a statement of how the risks have shifted; that clearly argues that there are greater downside risks for the real economy Unfortunately, the inflation numbers, as Mike commented, also have been disappointing irrespective of food and energy prices And our model doesn't provide much comfort on the longer-term inflation outlook either So, I see risks sitting out there in both directions It's not a pleasant outlook to contemplate, obviously   I'd like to follow up on Lee's question In the M2 forecast for the fourth quarter, have you included anything for this flight to liquidity? Or is it based pretty much on the way you think velocity is deviating from--   Well, I have some sympathy with the concerns that have been expressed about the real economy Unfortunately, I have the impression that we're losing sight of the inflation situation as we do that As I said before, I think there are equivalent risks here In that environment, I would favor stability in policy And as I look at the alternatives, something like the growth of M2 that we would get under "B" would be acceptable to me I could even imagine going a bit beyond that--that is, trying to make sure that growth in M2 didn't fall below the 4 percent or so anticipated in "B," which would then involve some slight easing But I have the sense here that we're talking about going beyond that for reasons that I don't find very compelling Those have to do with the composition of M2, and/or real estate problems that are long-term, and inventory problems that we certainly aren't going to solve with policy actions taken here today So, I must say that I'm uncomfortable with where we seem to be headed   I'd be willing to contemplate an asymmetric directive and even a 1/4 point move in the funds rate depending on what happens on Friday--the economic data, and how the aggregates are looking and so forth But I think I would want to stop there   Mike, do you make much of the divergence between the payroll and the household employment data? The household data have been quite a bit weaker for some time now and I'm wondering whether, as we come to understand the recent pattern of the economy better, that isn't telling us something   Thank you, Mr Chairman On the positive side, the District's economy, although spottier than it has been, remains in pretty good shape--especially in the rural areas because agriculture, as others have commented, had a good to very good year at least in most parts of our District And mining had a good year; indeed, they are talking about further expansion in that industry in a variety of states in the District and I would anticipate that they're going to go ahead with at least some of those plans Retailers, as best I can judge, are cautious but not particularly pessimistic at this point, at least about holiday sales  Having said all that, I think the pattern of activity for the national economy for the near term, as reflected in the Greenbook with a couple quarters of contraction, is a reasonable forecast I have a very distinct sense, based on a variety of anecdotal evidence, that the weakness we're seeing isn't particularly related to the energy situation, although obviously that's a factor At least as I get the story, it's really a combination of factors, some of which were in place before oil prices ran up Clearly, the credit availability issue has grown in importance as time has gone on And I have the sense that what we are seeing is not particularly driven by energy, but by a combination of negative factors, some of which have affected attitudes and some of which simply have cut into important sectors or regions of the economy   I support it as well   Thank you, Mr Chairman There's not a lot of additional news to be said about the District economy; there hasn't been a lot of change I will comment on a couple of things that have come up recently In talking to some of the large firms in the Twin Cities, a good number of them had a very good 1990, particularly those that have some substantial foreign exposure or are major exporters Despite that, they almost universally have a good deal of concern about 1991, particularly domestically, of course One of the reactions that seems to be occurring is that they are stretching out their salary programs That is, they're going to go ahead in January with the normal kind of salary programs that they've had in previous years but are telling employees that those increases will last for 15 to 18 months That's something that I, at least, hadn't come across until recently, and I think it is clearly because of their concerns about the economy and business conditions in 1991 With regard to holiday sales in the District, I'm not hearing much in the way of euphoria nor terrible gloom So, I assume that things are rather mediocre and that's about all that can be said about it  With regard to the national economic outlook, I generally agree with the shape of the economic performance as expressed in the Greenbook, although I will admit that I'm less confident that the upturn is going to occur quite as quickly as envisioned in that document There are a number of intangibles to worry about at this juncture, it seems to me And I think, as Dick Syron suggested, the  -12-    12/18/90  major wild card is real estate values I just feel instinctively that if those values continue to come down substantially and if that becomes more pervasive around the country than it has heretofore, that has to have a bigger effect on the economy   I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman   I support your proposal, Mr Chairman, and I agree with Tom Melzer that we have an opportunity here really to make some progress on the core rate of inflation if we conduct our affairs [unintelligible]   Well, I was hoping I wouldn't follow Dick because I don't have any colorful adjectives to use to describe the District economy! I guess I would have to say it's mixed The rural areas, because of the importance of agriculture, continue to do reasonably well One exception is the areas where wood products are important It took a little longer to hit them than I might have thought, but clearly because of the weakness in housing that sector has deteriorated On the other hand, in the Twin Cities there is a lot of concern about many of the issues we've already touched on this afternoon And while the objective measures of economic activity are still reasonably good, there are lots of signs of at least imminent softness in the economy  With regard to the war, I haven't been able to judge what it has meant psychologically There are a couple of objective things Some of the large corporations have either eliminated or severely curtailed foreign travel as a consequence of the war On the other hand, some of the firms that clearly have military business said their orders have just taken off There is no question about that The response has been large and very quick, and they, of course, are quite positive  With regard to the national economy, like many others, I guess I'm not as confident as the staff about the recovery occurring quite as quickly and quite as robustly as the Greenbook suggests It seems to me that even if this turns out to be a garden variety recession, it could well last into the spring and maybe even into the summer In that regard, I thought the latest employment report was  -26-    2/5-6/91  more or less consistent with that--suggesting that maybe this is a garden variety recession but that it has a way to go  I can't resist commenting a bit on the credit crunch and the real estate situation I think maybe we are exaggerating the effects of the credit crunch, at least in that area In a sense we do have an inventory problem in the economy It's not in manufacturing; it's in real estate We simply have too many office buildings, too much retail space and, in many parts of the country, too much residential space We know that prices are going to decline in that environment and they have I don't happen to think that additional credit availability would help the situation at all I can't think of any responsible way of addressing this problem We're really paying for the excesses of the 1980s both in the real estate market and in financial institutions We have to work our way through those We have to let the market deal with this because the excess supply is apparent As I say, I don't see any responsible way out of that   I certainly support alternative B With regard to the question of the language Looking to the future, if all we want to consider is asymmetric language toward ease, that certainly makes sense because I find it very hard to believe that between now and March we will get enough coincidence of events to suggest that we would want to raise the borrowings target and the funds rate However, we have moved a lot recently, and I think we do have to consider the lags in all this In light of that, I would have a preference for symmetric language just because I think we run the risk of not allowing the actions that we've taken to date to have an effect on both the aggregates and ultimately on the economy   Well, with regard to the District economy, I think we are basically beset by the same crosscurrents that are affecting the nation and that many people have discussed The market and the economy remain quite soft but the anecdotal information clearly has a much better tone encompassing housing and autos and retail activity; people at least are feeling a good deal better and traffic is up In part because of the improvement in attitudes and the change of the tenor of the anecdotes, I am comfortable with the Greenbook forecast for real activity this time And it is also this time very consistent with the pattern that our model produces, and our model is very different in structure That does raise an interesting timing question, though Even if the economy picks up promptly in April--or maybe it already has picked up--we won't see that in the hard data on aggregate activity until May or June as those numbers start to flow through Given that we obviously would want to see some consistent evidence of improvement, it really suggests that it won't be until sometime this summer that we will recognize whether or not the Greenbook forecast is turning out to be accurate I don't know what the implication of that is except that it seems to me that we might want to be even more cautious than usual in terms of responding to information as it becomes available over the next month or two  On inflation, obviously, we were concerned too about what looked like a significant acceleration of core inflation; and I'm always a little suspicious about special one-time factors that one can parcel it out to But we did run some tests to try to find out about the energy prices, assuming that the run-up in energy prices in the summer and fall may have boosted core inflation temporarily as they worked their way through the economy The tests suggested that that was in fact the case   Yes And as the subsequent decline in energy prices starts to work its way back through, it seems to me we ought to be looking at better core inflation numbers rather promptly   I strongly support your proposal I think it's important that we go to a symmetric directive at this point, in part because I have an ongoing bias in favor of that largely to let evidence accumulate before we act But in these circumstances, as I suggested earlier, I think we do want to maintain a sense of balance and a perspective as we go forward here And I think the symmetric directive is appropriate   Is there something unusual in what we're seeing in personal income?   Mr Chairman, I would continue to characterize conditions in the District as mixed, but overall not bad Agriculture is looking pretty good The key word there, as usual, is moisture, and in much of the District it now appears to be adequate this year The livestock sector is really doing very well, as it has over the past several years as well In the paper industry and the forest products industry, again, conditions are mixed There is a lot of excess capacity at the moment in paper and even more coming on [stream], but the profits aren't there But that's a business where they tend to run at capacity almost no matter what, and they're still running at capacity, at least in our District The wood products business has come back a bit, and that's probably a consequence of an inventory cycle and maybe some optimism about the outlook for homebuilding Clearly, housing sales have picked up substantially, certainly in the Twin Cities It's my understanding that not only are houses selling but they are selling at pretty close to asking prices without any fancy financing so far as I can tell On retail sales, once again I haven't heard any horror stories Some people say business is tough and some say it's satisfactory, and that seems to be about the way that has been holding Only one state in the District has a significant budget problem with which they have not yet come to grips I don't know at this juncture what the pieces of that resolution might turn out to be  With regard to the national outlook, I'm pretty comfortable with the Greenbook forecast I also think, as several people have commented, that it pays to reflect on the risks a bit at this juncture The risks are probably symmetric in the sense that while a recovery by midyear is likely, I do think we're going to need to see a good deal more consumer spending In that regard, I have been under the impression, and Mike confirmed it, that perhaps disposable income has been somewhat weaker than I would have expected throughout this contraction, and that is certainly a source of concern in my mind On the other hand, as to the risks on the inflation side, I find the recent data encouraging and most of the anecdotal reports I'm getting encouraging as well But I must say I'm not persuaded yet that we have nailed down a significant reduction in the core rate of inflation I'm a little puzzled as to why the bond market has not responded at this juncture, not just to the inflation news but to the overall picture of what is happening domestically and abroad And I wonder if we don't have to be a little sensitive to that   No, I don't find that an adequate explanation   My question is really along the same line I'm trying to understand the process in these alternative strategies a little better than I do Where does this 5-1/2 percent money growth in the baseline, especially in the out years, come from?   You specify the economic characteristics and then you back into the money path?   Mr Chairman, I favor alternative III essentially for two reasons One has been discussed at some length and has to do with credibility I'm not sure that a 1/2 point move in the range gets us a lot of additional credibility In fact, in this environment and given our stated objectives, it might be kind of expected On the other hand, anything we can do to enhance credibility is important because there are costs involved in bringing inflation down; and to the extent that we can get credibility working for us and contain those costs, I think that's an advantage My judgment is that a reduction in the range at this point would help us at least a bit on that score The second reason I'm in favor of lowering the ranges at this point is continuity This has been commented on as well The fact is that M2 over the past 4+ years has grown at 4 to 4-1/2 percent or so It just seems to me that we shouldn't compromise that kind of performance I think continuity is important here, and we ought to act in that fashion   Thank you If you go through the District economy sector by sector, I think you conclude that conditions are mixed That is, you can find some sectors that are doing reasonably well and others that are not On the other hand, if you cut it differently and ask how the second quarter looks compared to the  -18-    7/2-3/91  first, almost universally I think people would report that the second quarter looks a good deal better than the first Some of that is undoubtedly seasonal but, even discounting for that, it is pretty obvious from the reports we get from our directors and advisory council members and so forth that the economy in the District clearly did better in the second quarter  With regard to the national outlook, I find myself quite comfortable with the Greenbook forecast, primarily for one important reason that I think some people were getting at earlier Presumably, the path of the economy isn't independent of the policies pursued Following the '81-'82 recession we had a massive tax cut and expansionary monetary policy for at least some time If memory serves me correctly, we had some of the same kind of policy mix coming out of '73-'75, and it wasn't surprising that we had a very strong expansion I think we will get a modest expansion this time, basically because I don't think we're going to see fiscal stimulus and I'm assuming we will not see much in the way of monetary stimulus So those things go hand-in-hand, and I think they give us the kind of path for the economy that the Greenbook suggests   I, too, support "B" symmetric I don't see any case here for changing anything I do have a little concern that things have worked out exceptionally neatly this time   I don't trust it But unless we get some major data revision or something, I guess we ought to just--  -51-    7/2-3/91  SPEAKER(?) Enjoy it   Enjoy it, right   Well, with regard to the national economy, I do think the incoming data taken together are consistent with a modest recovery of the type described in the Greenbook I would add that I'm also a bit more encouraged about our prospects for disinflation as suggested in the Greenbook as well  There's not much going on in the District that would make me doubt this general kind of forecast--I suppose that's not the most positive way to put it--except for some signs of strain and disappointment in some businesses that may have thought the recovery was going to be a little stronger than it has to date But if you look at the other data, nonfarm employment in the District is up    8/20/91  relative to a year ago and the agricultural sector outside of the dairy industry is in pretty good shape So, things seem to be continuing to move along reasonably well Having said that, as many have already commented, there are reasons to be concerned nevertheless Some comments have already been made about commercial real estate We know we had a drop there and values are in the process of adjusting But it seems to me that the spillover there is perhaps even greater than I, at least, had anticipated--not only for the financial sector and creditors in general, but for state and local governments on the revenue side And those governments are already stressed So, we're getting some restraint there in addition to all the other factors that we can talk about And assuming nothing terribly unusual comes out of the situation in Russia, we're getting some restraint from the Federal budget as well So, when I add all that up and couple it with the weakness in M2, I think there are reasons to be concerned as to whether this is going to play out in quite the positive way that the Greenbook would suggest   I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman It seems to me that whatever the explanation for M2 may be--and I don't know that we'll ever have a fully satisfactory one--this is not the time to let it either fall below the target path or deviate very significantly from its performance over the last four years or so So, I think we should pay some attention to it And we probably should go with the language in version II, giving M2 somewhat greater prominence in these circumstances, which I think is appropriate  -38-    8/20/91   At the national level, as has been the case for some time, I find myself quite comfortable with the Greenbook forecast The latest readings on the economy and its prospects suggest that a modest recovery is underway and I think it's likely to continue I would add that I'm also more confident than I have been for some time that we are finally going to see some progress in bringing down the core rate of inflation over the next year or two So, from that perspective, the outlook to me looks reasonably satisfactory  -15-    10/1/91  In the District, recent meetings that I've held have had a surprisingly positive tone But I think that's because they've been very District-specific By that I mean that they focused mainly on agriculture, which for the most part is having a good year; on tourism, which has had a good year; on residential construction, which in parts of the District at least is doing surprisingly well; and on retail sales, which have been boosted substantially by Canadian shoppers apparently flooding across the border and stimulating activity all across the northern tier So, from those perspectives, things really look quite positive On the other hand, if I talk to business people whose businesses are more diverse geographically and who do business nationally and internationally, attitudes really are terrible I've been trying to understand why, without a lot of success, because I don't think the aggregate data that we look at are as bad as the attitudes would suggest Part of the explanation may be that business people simply expect, and indeed want, stronger and more rapid improvement in activity than they are experiencing Part of it may be the pricing situation; my general impression is that it would be very difficult these days really to get any kind of price increases at all And that may be affecting them, of course, both directly and through the profit side of the business   "B" asymmetric   Yes, a couple of things, Mike I have the impression that one of the things that may be going on here is a lack of pent-up demand relative to previous recoveries, particularly in autos and in housing, in part because of the strength of the '80s Is there anything to that?   Autos   My second question Do you have a reaction to the report on the news last night and in The Wall Street Journal today about expected downward revisions in the payroll data?   Thank you   Thank you, Mr Chairman In the District, there is really little new to report; recent trends are continuing In the rural areas, activity remains fairly decent and attitudes are okay, I think, at least compared to what I encounter in the Twin Cities where, as I've reported before, attitudes are quite bad Of course, that's because there is a different mix of businesses both in terms of their diversification and their scope of operations And they pick up a lot of bad news from their other operations both domestically and internationally The Twin Cities situation is really rather interesting Unemployment in the Cities remains in the neighborhood of 4-1/2 percent as the computer industry [unintelligible] The problem with that was that the medical technology business has exploded, so the adjustment has all occurred without a great deal of dislocation But despite that, attitudes among the business community --or the preponderance of the business community that I have encountered--are quite negative And the Twin Cities do account for a good bulk of the nonfarm economic activity in the District In the Twin Cities we have come up with a couple of new forms, though not altogether new forms, of economic stimulus One is hosting major sporting events We still have the Super Bowl and the Final Four to go But in addition, more recently we have snow removal And that looks as if it's going to be affecting the economy for some time!  On the national outlook, I continue to think that a modest recovery is certainly the most likely outcome I have a suspicion that we might do marginally better than the latest Greenbook forecast But I think the real developments on the national level are on the inflation front or the disinflation front I've become increasingly optimistic that we really are making progress there The balance of the latest statistical evidence certainly suggests that, but I've also become more and more impressed by the anecdotal evidence that I get It's very hard to find any evidence of price pressures and wage pressures to speak of, at least among the people I've talked to That has been going on for a while and it has now gone on long enough that I think it really is significant There is, of course, some ongoing carping about health care costs and about the cost of [meeting] various regulations, but there's nothing new in all that And I don't have any sense that that situation is getting worse So, I do think there is clearly a positive development on that side   I find these unusually difficult circumstances, but on balance I come out in agreement with you It's not that I think a 1/4 point reduction in the funds rate, whether or not it's accompanied by a discount rate reduction, is going to do a lot quickly and directly for consumer confidence or [business confidence] or jump- start the economy And we know more about jumper cables and jump- starts in Minneapolis than most! But my expectations would be more modest I am concerned about the slow growth of M2, not so much in a strictly monetarist context but in the sense that going into this year I at least was looking for continuity in policy, not a sharp departure in M2 growth from what we experienced in the previous four years I think continuity is still a virtue I don't believe such a move at this point would weaken our credibility In fact, it might enhance our credibility and I think it's the responsible thing to do at this time And I don't think it would interfere with wringing out the excesses of the 1980s, a process which has to continue if we're going to restore economic health   Thank you, Mr Chairman As has been the case for some time now, District business activity is mediocre It really hasn't weakened much--and we seem to have been insulated from some of the major problems around--but it isn't all that strong either Unemployment remains uniformly low in the District; attitudes, nevertheless, are quite negative There are some positive signs, for what it's worth It really is true that you can't find a parking  -13-    12/17/91  space in the shopping malls on the weekends Retailers are quick to point out that people are looking for bargains and not buying as much as they used to, and so forth But we'll see if that plays out All I can tell you is that there's a lot of traffic The auto dealers report that sales are bad but traffic in the showrooms has picked up Perhaps people are looking for bargains or perhaps they're getting ready to buy something sooner or later In any event, there's at least a glimmer of hope there Sectors that have been in pretty good shape for some time include tourism, agriculture, and the retailers who are reachable from Canada Those areas of the economy continue to move along as they have been moving and really are quite healthy  With regard to the national situation, I agree with the comments that have already been made and, as the Greenbook forecast is currently depicting, that the risks are probably symmetric I was puzzling for a long time as to why attitudes, particularly business attitudes, are as bad as they are, given that the aggregate data don't look that bad But it seems to me that the aggregate data are starting to catch up with the attitudes, and that's reconciling that difference at least in my mind But what I would emphasize at this point is a comment that Mike Prell made earlier, which is that disinflation is in train And I think that's something that we can look forward to Anecdotally, it's very hard to find much in the way of price pressures I was struck by a meeting we had at the Bank recently during which a lot of private-sector employers in the Twin Cities reported [that they expect] wage increases of about 3 percent for the year ahead Of course, benefits are rising more rapidly than that, but 3 percent is the kind of number we haven't heard in the Twin Cities in quite some time There's a lot of concern looking to the future about aggregate demand; but we've been looking at supply, recognizing that that's somewhat of an artificial distinction But it looks to us at least as if the 1980s were characterized by unusually rapid growth in labor force participation and unusually large increases in hours worked If that is not repeated in the 1990s, and it doesn't seem likely, then the supply side of the economy's ability to grow seems to me to be constrained unless we get real improvement in productivity--which, of course, is possible, but hard to bank on-- or unless we believe that when the aggregate demand comes back the gaps are going to be made up by imports So, we may be looking at a situation where not only is aggregate demand likely to be subdued, but the growth in productive capacity may be as well   I, too, support your recommendation The only thing I would add at this point is that, while it's certainly understandable that there's some frustration around the table in terms of the results we've achieved to date--at least in terms of the real economy and its tendency to fall below expectations--I think we should resist the temptation to try to do something more dramatic and more heroic I believe the course we have been on has been the right one and I think we ought to continue with that As many people have already commented, a lot of the problems we face are structural and are not amenable to changes in monetary policy And I think, as you suggested, that we are not very far from where we want to be in any event So, I'm comfortable with your recommendation   I, too, favor alternative I On the question of where M2 ought to be within the range, I'm a little more conservative than some M2 growth over the last 5 years has averaged a little over 4 percent, if I read those revised data [correctly] If that's right, it seems to me that we ought to be careful about letting it veer very far from that on the up side lest we risk compromising what we have already put in place in terms of progress [toward] price stability I don't think that's going to dissipate very quickly, but I believe we need to be sensitive to that Clearly, there are some circumstances under which I would find more rapid M2 growth acceptable, but I'm urging a bit of caution at this point Just to state the obvious, we always, so far as I know, accept a wide range of incoming information before deciding those kinds of questions And as long as we continue to follow that policy, I guess I won't be troubled   I won't even try! For a long time, I've been reporting that the District economy is relatively steady, plodding ahead at a slow pace That continues to be a reasonable description of the situation Obviously, some sectors are doing better than others and some regions of the District are doing better, but none is really doing awfully So, in that sense, we seem to be doing okay On the positive side, as several people have already commented, recently almost wherever one goes, residential construction seems to be improving; that is underway And as other people have commented, attitudes clearly have improved in the sense that while they always seem to me to be worse than justified by circumstances some of the intensity of the gloom seems to have lifted, if I can put it that way So, slightly better attitudes at least seem to be emerging  On the negative side, some manufacturers have commented--and I think this is implicit in the charts that Mike presented--that inventories are excessive upstream and that has started to affect them in the sense that orders have slowed and so forth Although we're not a big textile district, our textile manufacturers are running pretty well full out, as Tom [Melzer also] commented So, there is something going on at least in that area  With regard to the national economy, I do think the stage is set for something like the Greenbook forecast I don't have a very different view as to how things will turn out I would reemphasize the point that has been made that it is by most comparisons a very conservative forecast, and it wouldn't be altogether shocking to me if the economy did somewhat better than that The one thing that does trouble me a bit, looking at the national circumstances at the moment, is the state of the long-term bond market where clearly nothing favorable has been happening in recent weeks Indeed, rates are at the levels they were before the discount rate cut back in December  -20-    2/4-5/92   I would support your recommendation   Mike, would you elaborate a bit on this issue of pent-up demand that you mentioned in passing with regard to the consumer spending situation?   With regard to the national economy first, Mr Chairman, I'm struck by how much better the readings on the national economy are relative to what we were seeing as recently as three months ago and relative to what we expected to see I think the Greenbook has the appropriate response to this I personally am pretty cautious A quite modest recovery by historic standards is still what I think we're most likely to get, and that's what is reflected in the Greenbook So, I'm comfortable with that outlook But the probability of achieving something like that looks to me to be a good deal higher than we might have expected just a few months ago  At the District level, we've seen modest improvement for some time That seems to be continuing Attitudes have improved I  -19-    3/31/92  wouldn't say that they're positive necessarily, but the gloom seems to have lifted And the expansion seems to be reasonably broadly based It's evident in housing, of course, retail sales, agriculture, and tourism, so that the District seems to me to be consistent with the national picture as well   Well, I certainly prefer alternative B, and I have a mild preference for symmetric language mainly because that's my usual preference I rather like the thought of just letting the evidence come in and analyzing it as the period unfolds And I think we have plenty of flexibility and have reacted quickly even with symmetric directives, but I don't feel all that strongly about it I don't know that I understand what is going on with M2 either, but I won't let that stop me from making a few comments! I think it's a little premature to get too worked up about it For one thing, I don't know what Don's numbers are precisely, but for the December through March period it looks as if M2 still grew at least as fast as we had expected at the last meeting or two So, while it bounces around a lot month to month, it's still coming in more or less as expected or a bit on the high side I'm not sure we're going to learn much more in April and May if the tax payments and so forth [distort] the data as they have in the past from time to time Finally--and I think you touched upon this in a way--if our objective is to achieve price stability, then I've been of the view for a long time that we want M2 growth at about the midpoint of its range or somewhat lower over a sustained period of time if we're going to get to price stability And that's certainly what I have in mind   With regard to the District, the modest but steady progress that has been in place for quite some time continues, and I won't go into details except that there are a few concerns around One is in agriculture where, of course, this time of year moisture is always the major uncertainty, and that is the issue in some parts of the District Beyond that, there is some concern in the timber industry where environmental issues are limiting activity, and we've seen some marginal mining operations go out of business But otherwise the District economy is in pretty good shape, I think Attitudes are also in pretty good shape  -16-    5/19/92  With regard to the national economy, my views do not differ from most that have been expressed so far As Mike Prell indicated, if anything, we've done at least as well or better really than we thought we would over the last couple of quarters That [improvement] does seem in my judgment to be continuing; I'm referring to the real side, and I don't see any reason at this juncture for renewed or additional concern in terms of real activity The disappointment, to the extent there has been some, has been on the inflation side, at least as measured by consumer prices or the employment cost index In talking to business people in the District, for the most part they continue to describe a very competitive environment and they don't give any impression that it's easy to raise prices or pass along cost increases or whatever But it's a little hard to know in light of all the data whether they simply mean by all this that they can live with 3 or 4 percent inflation and thus that's what they mean by a very competitive environment It's just hard to know what they have in mind as they describe that situation  With regard to commercial real estate, the situation is quite mixed as best I can judge it I have heard of some renewed activity in the construction of warehouse and manufacturing space; it's not a lot, but there do seem to be some signs of life there With regard to office space, one of our directors, with whom you're familiar, has been "bottom fishing" in terms of buying office space in various parts of the country for a couple of years now He also has bought some raw land in some locations I think he feels quite positive and comfortable about this On the other hand, I do come across investors and developers who tell me it's still difficult to find financing They're not talking about financing just for new projects but to refinance or to purchase existing buildings; although when I express a counter view and basically describe what one of our directors has done, a number of people will admit that they've been doing that too It leads me to believe that perhaps there is a little more activity around than we might appreciate, but perhaps it's a little subterranean Olympia and York has not been a topic of conversation in the Ninth District, but we have our own interesting situation The so-called Mall of America, a mega mall, is nearing completion The first part of it is supposed to open in August and now that it's too late there is growing concern about how successful it is going to be So, we'll just await developments   What's the sample period, Don, over which you estimate your standard model?   Well, following on your last comment, Mr Chairman, I too favor "B," symmetric In part, I think we have to be careful not to respond to what we already know--the sense that we continue to look at a modest recovery by historic standards Presumably, that's what we expect We continue to expect for the next six weeks anyway to look at pretty sluggish M2 expansion; that's what the Bluebook expects at least If that isn't acceptable, we ought to want to change policy With regard to M2, since I didn't weigh in earlier, I might try to muddy the waters a little further right now Governor Lindsey's point about the volatility of M2 velocity in the short run is undoubtedly correct I recall that we ran some simulations several years ago that said that if we really wanted to apply fairly rigorous confidence intervals to the annual M2 targets, then the ranges shouldn't be 3 or 4 percentage points wide; they really had to be 6 to 8 percentage points wide if we wanted to be reasonably confident of achieving them That tells you that there's a lot of short-run volatility in velocity As to whether M2 is going to or has to bounce back at some point, I must admit I'm getting increasingly skeptical I think we may need to devote a little more time to that question and the role of that aggregate If I think about what has transpired recently and what is different, it seems to me that customers of depository institutions today--customers broadly defined--clearly face a wider range of choices than they did certainly 10 or 20 years ago, the time encompassed in the estimation period of these models Clearly, banks and other institutions face a much wider range of choices when it comes to pricing and other policies than they did 10 or 20 years ago And we're also operating for the most part in a lower interest rate environment than we have over a sustained period of time Maybe we have to go back to the '60s to find something like this, at least for short rates So, as I think about all that, it's not clear to me that there's going to be some automatic correction in M2 or indeed that a correction in M2 is desirable in these circumstances A lot has changed   Right   I strongly support your recommendation At this juncture--and this has been said a couple of times already--our first obligation is to tell the Congress what we know and what we don't know about M2 I think we know a good deal more than we knew at the last meeting but we certainly have not resolved all the uncertainties In any event, we should share that with the Congress; and putting a great deal of emphasis on the ranges in this context just doesn't make a lot of sense to me So, leaving the ranges where they are is fine with me From an institutional point of view or a credibility point of view, being direct with the Congress is the way to go in an environment where it is widely recognized that there are some changing relationships and some mystery with regard to the aggregates and maybe other credit and financial variables as well That will enhance credibility rather than undercut it We're not going to fool anybody by pretending that we have some insights that we don't have, at least at this point   Thank you, Mr Chairman I personally agree in almost every detail with the outlook presented in the Greenbook The possible exception is the unemployment rate, which I think might be a little slower to come [down] than is indicated in that forecast I must admit I'm a little surprised at some of the comments I've heard around the table It seems to me that we're getting pretty much what we expected for the first half of the year or maybe doing even a little better If I look back at the Humphrey-Hawkins numbers that we put together in February or just think about the Greenbook forecast over time, it seems to me that the numbers have come in pretty much as expected I don't see any really negative surprises in what has unfolded We were expecting a modest recovery and what we're getting is along those lines For what it's worth, we run an exercise in updating our forecast with the latest evidence on the national economy that has become available since the last meeting, and we did it again this time, of course Our model, by the way, is purely statistical; there are no judgmental factors in it at all The evidence that has become available has looked rather mixed, but when we put it in the model we got pretty much the same forecast that we had before the latest data became available So, I take it from at least that one indicator that what we're getting is pretty consistent with what we thought we would get as we go along here  I might add, John, in regard to the question you raised about food inflation Talking to people in a couple of big companies in the food wholesale and retailing business in Minneapolis recently, they said they think we're overestimating food inflation at the consumer and wholesale levels We're going to be meeting with them further to try to understand what the difference is, but their view is that it has been pretty tough to raise prices in that business as well We will see if we can find out a little more about that  I would think that the risks, at least in terms of real growth, may be on the up side as much as on the down side at this juncture I say that on the basis of the anecdotes that have come my way recently in the District The obvious caveat, of course, is that the District is pretty thinly populated and may not have a big impact on national performance Just to give you a formula for this Tourism was at a record last year but all the tourist spots are way ahead of last year so far this year   I don't know; maybe we ought to secede and join Canada!  -19-    6/30-7/1/92   Highway construction has been strong; I take it that is tied to the highway program that was put in place at the federal level, but we're getting a number of reports along those lines Residential construction has been strong; auto dealers seem encouraged; and retail sales in general have been pretty positive It's not that everything is positive The military bases, especially the air bases in the District, are adversely affected by what is going on there And there is some expectation that the [influx of] Canadian shoppers, who have been streaming across the border for quite some time now, may slow In the past that kind of information would have led to some sense of despair; but this time people seem to be shrugging it off as something they can deal with  As for M2, I think I'll await Don's wisdom on that subject before I comment   At the last meeting were we looking for 2-1/2 percent M2 growth for the second quarter or something like that?   Did you run a simulation or anything with the experimental model for the second quarter?   I, too, would prefer a symmetric directive at this point mainly because I think we shouldn't be in too big a hurry to take any action in the near term and should be prepared to assess a range of incoming data I don't know which of your two models may be more appropriate in the current setting It seems to me that another way to describe what is going on--in terms of a sluggish recovery, small gains in employment, small gains in spending, balance sheet restructuring, and all that--is that it's part of the price that has to be paid to bring down the rate of inflation Perhaps if our credibility were higher, the price would be lower and we wouldn't have to endure some of this and we would see incoming numbers perhaps more to our intuitive liking But I've become convinced, unfortunately, that our credibility really isn't all that high and that a period like this is probably what we have to endure to make progress on that side   Dave, while we're on this What is your estimate of potential growth in the economy these days and how do you parcel that out?   Thank you, Mr Chairman With regard to the District economy, I don't detect any underlying change in activity; I think it's still expanding quite modestly There really isn't a lot of additional information to add to that I might comment on a couple of recent developments to flesh that out a bit I reported before on very strong sales along the northern tier of the District to Canadians coming across the border That currently is in the process of slowing down, apparently because the Canadians are making it more onerous to get back into Canada with everything that one has purchased But that was due to change for one reason or another eventually, and it has There is a significant expansion in the paper industry under way again A couple of new plants have been approved and construction will start shortly if it hasn't already Finally, you've probably heard about the so-called "mega mall" that has opened up in the suburbs of the Twin Cities It actually opened about a week ago So far, it has exceeded expectations--at least the expectations of those of us whose expectations weren't too high I haven't been out there, but the press reports that traffic has occasionally exceeded 100,000 people a day There have been lines to get into the restaurants and some of the other entertainment venues and so forth Whether anybody is buying anything beyond that I don't know, but at least by some measures it's off to a positive start  With regard to the national economy, I'm certainly comfortable with the contours of the Greenbook forecast It's always difficult in a circumstance like this, when you try to do bottom-up forecasting and look at consumption and investment and so forth, to talk yourself into believing that any of these sectors is going to be very strong in this environment Yet my experience has been that just when I've talked myself into that, the economy surprises me on the high side I have a hunch that isn't going to happen this time Bob Black gave a pretty good litany of the problems that are restraining growth, and I think those are in place For what it's worth, my guess is that it will probably take longer for those to diminish than we might expect So, the general shape of the forecast portrayed in the Greenbook looks like a pretty good estimate to me The good news, of course, is that the price and cost statistics are starting to come in more in line with the anecdotal reports we've discussed around here for quite some time It seems to me that we've commented for quite some time that we have talked to a lot of business people and don't hear much about price or wage pressures and so forth and so on It took quite some time for that to show up in the statistics But now  -24-    8/18/92  it is at least starting to show up in a more convincing way, which suggests that we're making some progress in a principal and significant area   I support your proposal for "B" asymmetric   I'd like to go back to long-term interest rates one more time You put a lot of emphasis on their decline Is that-- I just don't remember--a sharply different view than you've had before?   In the District there has been a discernable but I would say small improvement in activity since the last meeting Consumer spending has improved a bit; residential construction and sales of residential units have picked up; forest products seem for the most part to be doing reasonably well, getting a little additional kick from the hurricane It has been a good year for tourism both from domestic and foreign tourists And unemployment rates in the District have continued for the most part to be well below the national average Agriculture is mixed, depending on the weather Perhaps the only real sign of weakness is in mining where some recent layoffs have occurred up on the iron range in northern Minnesota Despite this further improvement, I'd say attitudes remain uniformly cautious I wouldn't describe them as particularly discouraged, but people are cautious I don't think anybody is expecting a sharp change for the better in economic activity  I came across the same sort of concern about interest rates that Ed Boehne expressed earlier There does seem to be a view that  -27-    10/6/92  interest rates are going to go back up, perhaps significantly, at some point in the not too distant future I don't think it's tied to any expectations one way or the other about changes in monetary policy I don't think it's tied, at least not very directly, to expectations about an acceleration of inflation It may in some instances be tied to people's assessment of the budget But it's mostly that people, in their business experience, view rates as unusually low today and they don't believe that these rates are going to be sustained The analysis essentially stops there It's basically a judgment about what is typical  With regard to the national economy, we are all emphasizing the very weak and disappointing statistics that we've received over the last month or six weeks That is reflected in the forecast and I think that's fully understandable On the other hand, if you go beyond the latest statistics--and, of course, we can't do anything about them--and look at the financial variables, if anything they look a little better M2 growth has moved back into the positive range Bank credit and business loans at commercial banks seem to have picked up a bit and we hear some anecdotes about greater availability and more aggressive searching for customers on the part of bankers and others If we look at bank reserves or narrow money, we see very rapid growth, and I would say that this is something we need to keep an eye on as we go forward   In general, Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation and would only add a couple of thoughts First of all, in assessing the question of asymmetry and timing, I hope we cast a relatively broad net I am concerned about the foreign exchange markets On the one hand, we seem to believe that the dollar is lower than is sustainable but the presumption is that it's going to go lower still; and that doesn't seem to me to be an equilibrium, let me put it that way On top of that, as we weigh the desirability or necessity of additional interest rate cuts to sustain or further the recovery, I hope that we will bear in mind its consistency with our long-run objective for price stability And I must say that I don't quite understand what we would have gained by lowering the monetary aggregate targets and locking in more tightly on M2 in these circumstances There's certainly some information value in M2 but there's also a lot of uncertainty surrounding both its behavior and its implications for economic performance in the future, and I don't see how we would enhance our credibility by focusing on something with that degree of uncertainty associated with it   I agree with what Ed just said, and I might elaborate a little It seems to me that there may be an organizing principle or continuum here; I don't know how far it gets us I  -55-    11/17/92  personally don't see any problem with a memorandum of discussion-- after all, these meetings are being held--and we used to do it But I do think there's a critical issue with regard to the process and how soon the memoranda are released Putting aside questions about what kind of protection we can get because of the Freedom of Information Act, it seems to me that we ought to be willing to release increasingly greater amounts of information with a longer lag The reason is, of course, that some things that are very sensitive at the moment may be considerably less sensitive or without consequence two, three, or more years down the road So, I personally don't see any problem with that If we go in the other direction, [looking at] the things we could release immediately, I think we do have to be more concerned about what's there Given that I feel an obligation to be forthcoming when we can be, I guess we should look at other ways--in terms of timeliness, in terms of content, or in terms of completeness --to enhance what we're doing to deal with some of the issues that are coming at us from the Congress   Thank you, Mr Chairman In the District, things seem to have taken a distinct turn for the better I say "seem to" because that comment is based mostly on anecdotal reports I've picked up in the last month or two Those really have had a very positive tone I mention that, of course, against a background in which [economic activity in] the District probably has been advancing modestly throughout this period Objectively, if you look at employment, which has continued to grow, and unemployment rates, which are almost uniformly low in the District, I think the numbers suggest a reasonably decent economic performance The anecdotes are also for the most part on the positive side, although I should acknowledge a couple that are not It looks as if has serious financial problems; how much longer it's going to stay out of Chapter 11 remains to be seen As for nonresidential construction, major projects in the Twin Cities at least are about to come to a halt, I think But aside from that, the reports we get with regard to much of the agriculture in the District, housing starts and sales, retail sales so far, and tourism activity--which apparently is spilling over into Montana at least with an inrush of Hollywood types and even some Easterners--have been pretty healthy I must say that on Saturday afternoon I heard something I didn't expect to hear and haven't heard before--I'm sure you're all on the edge of your seats--about the latest progress of the Mall of America, our so-called mega mall On the radio on Saturday they were basically telling people to stay away because the crowds were so big!    11/17/92   Well, I don't know that the mall's developers are making any money--that's a different matter--but [sales] apparently are running well ahead of expectations Of course, the developers had to offer such attractive deals to get the stores in that I suspect they aren't seeing much of this But the numbers apparently are very good, and it's not particularly at the expense of the other major shopping centers in the Twin Cities, if you believe what you hear The people at the mall have done a very good job of promoting it; they're bringing groups in from all over, domestic as well as international, and that's apparently translating into real spending Help wanted signs are popping up everywhere; a lot of that is seasonal, of course, but it's not confined just to retailers and fast food operations where one would expect to see it And it is consistent with reports of tight labor market conditions in the Twin Cities and in other metropolitan areas in the District So at least at the moment, based on the latest anecdotal reports, things seem to be moving along  With regard to the national outlook, I have no real disagreement at all with the Greenbook forecast I don't have the sense at this juncture that the expansion is all that fragile, but I must say I don't have any particular sense that it's about to take off on the high side either Coupled with the headwinds discussions that we've had in the past and a close look at demographics and related factors, it may just be that this is going to be a prolonged period of slow growth relative to what we have experienced in most of the postwar period and perhaps relative to what we had earlier expected On the margin, I'm not sure there's a lot to be done about it   With regard to the short run, I favor alternative B with a symmetric directive I don't see a case for a change in policy immediately or for biasing the directive one way or the other That still gives us lots of flexibility if the evidence comes in on one side or the other and a decision is made to move But to me the circumstances we currently confront suggest no immediate change  With regard to the long-run ranges, I have a slightly different take on that It's really the upper end of the M2 range that concerns me It concerns me because, given what we think we know about the outlook for nominal GDP and about the velocity of M2 over the next couple of years, that upper end of the range is clearly too high So, I would favor a new range of something like 2-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent I don't see any real need to reduce the lower end In fact, longer-run considerations, with trend growth in the economy of maybe 2 or 3 percent and assuming that M2 velocity ultimately returns to its stable, trendless state and price stability--whether inflation is actually zero or something above that given measurement problems and so forth or given what it takes to get expectations of inflation out of people's decisionmaking thoughts--suggest to me that we don't need to change the lower end of the range On the other hand, the upper end is too high, especially in an environment where I think we want to consolidate the gains we have made in bringing down the core rate of inflation and perhaps send a signal that that's our intent along the way here  With regard to timing, it's not an overwhelming preference, but I would agree with those who would prefer to do it now In February, as many have observed, there will be a lot of proposals out there and a lot of things on the agenda and we really could look like  -36-    11/17/92  we were snubbing, or worse, all sorts of proposals by deciding to lower the range at that point   I have reported for some time that the District economy was expanding, and it is certainly continuing to do so The tone of the anecdotal evidence suggests that there has been some further distinct strengthening In fact, in some ways the anecdotes sound like what one would expect early in a recovery, which of course is not [the case for] this expansion chronologically In some of the sectors, though certainly not all, people are turning ebullient; I'm talking about housing, autos, and retail sales more generally Whether this is just a spike or something that is sustainable remains to be seen But clearly, in the District at the moment things are going better in terms of expansion and there is still virtually a total lack of inflationary pressures, at least according to the business contacts we have So, in most circumstances, things look quite positive  With regard to the national economy, I don't have any problems taking the Greenbook forecast as a base If I were looking for downside risks, I would point to the foreign situation Business contacts in the Twin Cities that do any amount of business in Europe or Japan have reported exceedingly negative results recently They suggest to me that those economies are far worse than I at least had understood them to be Whether that is a precursor of things to come is much more difficult to say But clearly, they report very bad conditions and, at least as far as their own businesses are concerned, they are not optimistic [about the outlook for exports] On the other hand, though, putting that one risk aside, I would not be at all surprised to see the national economy grow somewhat more rapidly than the Greenbook suggests My reading of history in the postwar period at least is that once the economy develops some momentum on the up side--and I think that may be in the process of occurring--we tend to be surprised both at its duration and, for a time, at its magnitude While the Greenbook forecast for the most part has a rather nice, steady 2-1/2 to 3 percent growth quarter-by-quarter, if momentum is really building here, I think for a time we will see more rapid growth than that  -15-    12/22/92   "B" symmetric   Thank you, Mr Chairman I have some considerable sympathy for the position you've taken and for the considerations that go into it I'll only add two observations One, it seems to me that one consideration to lower the range, and particularly the lower end, is of course that we got 2 percent or so growth in M2 last year And to the people who want to attribute that to us it would be a rather strange commentary if we say that in some sense we are unwilling to have that kind of growth again this year So, I think that consideration suggests that the range ought to go down In listening to your discussion, it seems to me that what you're suggesting, and I certainly agree, is that M2 and the other aggregates are information variables We have a whole host of those variables that we look at constantly Having some sort of range, aside from the fact that it's required, is a good idea because we need to evaluate the incoming information against something If we were to follow that approach rigorously, we would establish a range that would be either centered around the midpoint of Don's forecast and/or would be centered around a growth that we consider consistent with a noninflationary environment in the long run I think both of those would imply lower ranges than we're talking about today, and I don't think this is the time to move that aggressively So, I'm comfortable with what you're suggesting   Why don't you just change the "could" to "would"   Most of what I would have said has been covered and I won't repeat it I agree with those who find at least some merit in a variety of these proposals and I think they deserve further consideration as a consequence But I am particularly attracted to your other possibilities under "F," in part for the openness reasons that we've been discussing But related to that--and I think Governor Phillips mentioned this--one of the things that has troubled me in recent years is that we seem to be in a position of either reacting to or not commenting on various press reports and interpretations of what we're up to and why That was a bigger problem when there were leaks than it has been recently Nevertheless, it strikes me that we can put some of that to rest through vehicles like press conferences, calling attention to things in the policy record, and so forth And I would give some serious consideration to doing that because I think it would benefit us as an institution   No, I would do it on an as-needed basis when we had something that we wanted to communicate   Well, there's always going to be a transition problem whenever a new procedure or a new rule is introduced Certainly the first couple times we announce a press conference I suppose people will sit up and take notice and cut positions and so forth But ultimately they will come to learn the circumstances under which we do these things   Well, they won't precisely know their content   One of my questions was along the lines of Wayne's on protectionism My second question relates to this issue of the liquifying of home equity Do we have evidence that that has an independent effect--independent of the normal wealth effect we might get as home equity rises? Is there something additional there?   Thank you, Mr Chairman Well, the favorable trends that have been under way in the District for quite some time are continuing and, if anything, probably strengthening a bit But rather than run down all the sectors, the one exception that stands out is probably commercial construction, which is quite mixed depending on [the area] Attitudes, I'd say, are generally good, although I continue to come across comments, as soon as GM or Sears or somebody makes a major restructuring announcement, such as "How can you consider this a recovery when that kind of thing is going on?" I think that does reflect some of the concerns that are still lingering  As has also been the case for some time, there really is not much, if any, sign of inflationary pressures Business people are increasingly resigned to price stability, I might say, and are willing to live with it! That may have to do in a way with what we're seeing in productivity; if so, it would certainly augur well for at least the longer-term outlook We're not a District that's particularly intensive in manufacturing, but I might mention that the manufacturers I have spoken with have generally been positive One report was a bit of a surprise and I'll just pass it on A businessman with operations in the Twin Cities as well as in the Seventh and Twelfth Districts said his business was improving in all three locations But in the Twin Cities he has difficulty hiring and retaining entry-level workers at $600 an hour There's an automatic bump in that to [a wage] in excess of $700 an hour after a year   Well, I thought it was interesting I don't know that it can be generalized, although certainly the help wanted signs-- at least in the Twin Cities--are popping up with greater frequency   I'm going to get to the winging it part, the part derived from our model! With regard to the national outlook, unlike Richmond, we run a big complicated VAR model For better or for worse, it also produces something quite comparable to the Greenbook forecast in terms of real growth in 1993 and is even more optimistic about inflation in 1993 My own views are perhaps a little more optimistic, at least as far as real growth is concerned My views are based in part on the tenor of the anecdotes I've been picking up and  -18-    2/2-3/93  in part just on the notion that I didn't see any great aberrations in the second half of last year and, of course, the economy grew at about a 3-1/2 percent annual rate I have a hunch that it can do something like that again in 1993   I agree with "B" symmetric I would just like to offer a thought on the earlier discussion about the disaggregation of M2 or looking at alternatives It's just a note of caution I think we ought to do that and see what we can learn But I would be very careful about making too much of anything at this juncture While we can undoubtedly find one or more adjusted aggregates that we might like the looks of at the moment, my guess is that in two or three years, unless we are very careful, we're not going to like the looks of them So I would be more than a little cautious about rushing to a proliferation of Ms at this stage  -56-    2/2-3/93   Thank you, Mr Chairman Well, economic activity in the District continues on the more or less steady upward course it has been on for quite some time At a recent meeting somebody used the phrase "silently successful" to characterize the District and I think that's a pretty good phrase There doesn't seem to be any change in inflationary pressures so far as I can detect, but there are a couple of areas of spot labor shortages I referred to this a little the last time; I've picked up a few more indications of it It doesn't seem to be very pervasive at the moment but the fact that it exists at all has surprised me There has been almost no discussion of the Clinton program that I've detected, certainly in its broadest terms What people are mostly concerned about, as you might expect, is what it implies for either the military bases in the District or for the agricultural programs I get the sense that whether they like  -20-    3/23/93  the program or not, they're willing to accept it as long as they believe it's affecting the country more or less across the board What they're worried about are the differential impacts that might affect the region  With regard to the national economic outlook, I have no problems with the Greenbook forecast both for growth and for inflation What does concern me are some of the same issues that Bob Forrestal alluded to I don't know, obviously, where the Administration is really going to come out with regard to trade policy or health care or industrial policy as it pertains to the airlines or technology or whatever But it seems to me that those things all work in the direction of resource misallocation While I don't know that they are going to be very significant quantitatively, they certainly cut in the wrong direction both in terms of growth and in terms of inflation, assuming that the Administration doesn't just go ahead and support NAFTA or GATT And I'm worried that there are some things going on there that may not help the economy in the long run Having said that, there's a question about why interest rates have finally come down I think, as several people have commented, that it is due to more favorable expectations about future inflation; it's really a consequence of the conduct and prospects for both monetary and fiscal policy, given the way those things have evolved over the last 6 to 12 months And I do think the credibility of monetary policy has probably improved a bit I doubt that we could demonstrate that in any convincing way; that's just my sense of things And I think that has been a principal factor in the decline in rates   I, too, support alternative B, symmetric language, and the alternative description of the monetary aggregates Like many others, after the discussion before the break I re-thought the price situation and went back to fundamentals a little, recognizing that we're probably not going to be very good at getting the timing precisely correct Most of these factors have been mentioned and I won't belabor all of them But it seems to me that [we are in] an environment where most of the other industrialized economies are either weak or contracting, where labor markets here are relatively soft, and where fiscal policy is probably going to give us at least some dose of restraint; that just doesn't strike me as an environment in which inflation is going to accelerate for any durable time I think we can certainly wait until at least May before acting   I admit I don't understand the inflation numbers very well but, in thinking about the discussion on profit margins, maybe there is something there telling us about the degree of slack After all, those price increases seem to have stuck for whatever reason And maybe part of that has to do with the international situation Maybe foreign competition isn't as vigorous as it was earlier; certainly something of that [nature] must be what is going on in autos I would think  -12-    5/18/93   The economy of the District continues to improve There are some signs of life now in nonresidential construction A lot of it is public construction, but it looks like that sector is poised for a pretty good year in many parts of the District Consumer spending appears to be continuing to grow and business out at the Mega Mall has held up very well In agriculture, the livestock business is very healthy and very strong With regard to crops, there is the concern about moisture but, of course, it's always either too dry or  -22-    5/18/93  too wet This year apparently it's too wet but I have a hunch they'll still [be able to plant] most or all of their crop There are also some renewed signs of life in the energy business Exploration and leasing activity in western North Dakota and eastern Montana are starting to show some signs of life, and iron mining activity in northern Minnesota is expected to pick up as a consequence of the improvement we're seeing in the domestic steel industry  The one thing I might comment a little further on is what's happening to employment It's something that, of course, shows up in the data, so I think we're aware of it But I've heard a couple of comments lately that have put this very directly Employment is up in the District And yet if we talk to business people, they say they're clearly trying to do more--or at least the same--with less when it comes to employment Part of that has to do with fringe benefit costs, such as workers comp and insurance and health care Part of it, I think, is expectations in that businesses that used to think they were going to make at least some of their higher incomes over time through expansion are revising down their expansion plans That has to do in part with environmental restrictions and other regulations I think they're concluding that the way to improve profitability is through very tight cost containment, and they seem to be succeeding And that has affected employment, certainly in the District, and perhaps nationwide as well  With regard to the outlook for the national economy, my principal concern, as many have commented, is the inflation situation I am not as sanguine as the Greenbook that inflation is going to decelerate from here I certainly agree that a lot of the fundamentals we typically look at--slack in the economy, money and credit growth, and so on and so forth--don't seem to suggest an environment where inflation ought to be accelerating In fact, they suggest an environment where further deceleration is likely Yet I remember from the 1970s that we're always pretty good at explaining away inflation but those [situations] don't seem to have happy endings So, I'm very uncomfortable with what we're seeing and I'm not convinced that what is going on now is simply temporary and will self-correct   In these circumstances I think we need at a minimum an asymmetric directive toward tightening A lot of the reasons for that have been covered and I won't belabor them But I would note that we have been shooting for further disinflation and indeed, ultimately, for price stability That is the long-run target that we have committed to, appropriately, and we seem to be drifting  -51-    5/18/93  away from it I don't think it's fatal if the drift goes on a little longer; and I admit that I don't know what the short run--the next month or two of data--may bring But it seems to me that we have to be very careful at this point because we're not getting the result we anticipated nor are we moving in the direction of our long-run objective So, at a minimum I think we need the asymmetric directive toward tightening   Don't those tend to have some sort of guaranteed component so we don't necessarily get big changes in net asset values?  SPEAKER(?) No   Well, I have some considerable sympathy for the position you described initially, especially for 1994, for the reasons that have been discussed In addition, if the staff is right and we're going to get M2 growth this year of about 1 percent, it seems to me that next year's range at least ought to embody that or we're making a rather strange commentary on the way things are turning out this year For 1993, I don't have a strong view about what to do with the ranges We've done it both ways in history; that is, we've either undershot or overshot kind of knowingly and haven't reacted--haven't changed the ranges But I wouldn't be troubled in this case if we did There probably is a pretty good case for changing the range Beyond those two years, 1993 and 1994, I must say at the moment that I'm not very confident about making any presumptions about M2 or its velocity In thinking about some of the work that was done with regard to M2+, if you believe that the stock and bond mutual funds really are good substitutes for some of those components in M2--and I guess I do--and we came to the conclusion that we didn't want to construct an aggregate at least at the moment that included those [funds], the logic of that is that M2 itself perhaps was not a very good aggregate in the first place It may be that in the long run this all will wash out; that is, all the substitution will have been done and we will get a cleaner, improved, or better M2 But I'm not in a position to reach that conclusion and I have a suspicion that wherever we end up three or four years down the road, it may be with  -57-    7/6-7/93  something very different from the concepts we are currently talking about So, I'm not terribly troubled by the long-run implications of whatever ranges we select at the moment   My preference was your initial suggestion   Well, you could say the same thing about prices if you really want to get into that and talk about lags After all, there's uncertainty as to how quickly things react to whatever policy moves we might make   Thank you, Mr Chairman First, with regard to the outlook for the national economy, just like about everybody else who has already spoken, I think the very modest recovery that we've had is likely to continue So I have no real disagreements with the central tendency [of the members' forecasts] or the Greenbook forecast That, in my judgment at least, is how things seem likely to play out I don't see a lot of vulnerability to [such a forecast] at the moment As far as inflation is concerned, I also agree with those who said that it doesn't look as if there's going to be a lot of further progress in bringing down the rate of inflation at least over this forecast horizon And that is my greatest concern I don't have a sense that expectations are working for us My sense is that expectations are that if inflation hasn't hit its low for this cycle, it's close to it So, that's not a favorable factor I have a sense that the general thrust of government policy is, if anything, going to add to inflation That just says that our job is not going to be made any easier by a variety of other things that I can contemplate over the next 18 months or so That's my greatest concern about the outlook at the national level I think progress on the inflation side will be tough  With regard to the District, again, there's not a lot of news to report The regional economy has been in good shape for an extended period That largely continues There have been more broad- based and frequent reports of banks becoming somewhat more aggressive in trying to meet their loan targets and finding some frustration in their inability to do so Of course we, too, have been affected by the floods And although that's [concentrated] in a rather narrow band, it has affected or probably will affect corn and soybean output in the District and will have some spillover effects for tourism as well Finally, there is ongoing concern about the fate of Northwest Airlines and their potential Chapter 11 filing I was told that they did reach agreement with the pilots today, but I haven't been able to confirm that The pilots are undoubtedly the key, but they're not the only union involved So that situation remains iffy at the moment   I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman   Thank you, Mr Chairman As far as the regional economy is concerned, it remains reasonably healthy, which is the report I have been providing for quite some time now In general, construction is quite strong; retail sales are pretty good; manufacturing is mixed; tourism, at least in the western part of the District, has been strong We did run a special survey of about 100 bankers in the areas of the District affected by the floods I guess it's reassuring to report that they didn't have anything very startling to say in the sense that while crop losses in some cases are substantial, they are not expecting major spillover effects on economic activity   Yes, spillover I'm glad you picked up on that; I was waiting for somebody to do that They were not expecting major spillover effects in many other areas of economic activity And, of course, we may get a little subsequent stimulus down the road from rebuilding and so forth  With regard to the national economy, we have been debating whether this sort of "slow motion" recovery was going to accelerate and turn into more rapid growth; that debate is continuing at least internally But for the moment I have concluded, as I have in the past, that the Greenbook has it about right That is, I don't see the seeds of an acceleration in place So I think this very modest expansion at the national level is likely to continue and, therefore, I find myself in agreement with what I guess is the consensus As far as inflation is concerned, maybe in part because of the publicity surrounding the asymmetric directive and your testimony or whatever, a lot of people have gone out of their way recently to tell me that they aren't seeing any inflationary pressures in their businesses at all And some people have gone beyond that to report that they've tried to raise prices and haven't been able to make those increases stick That suggests to me that people are still learning They are willing to go out there and send letters to their customers that as of a certain date prices on certain lines are going up, and I guess what they tend to hear in response is that their customers will not accept these price increases and that they don't care what the underlying rationale may be So, I conclude that people are still learning about the state of the markets and their inability to make price increases last, and that probably [augurs] well for the longer run   I think as a tactical matter this probably is the time to return to symmetry It strikes me that it would take some very surprising events to lead toward a change in the funds rate in the five weeks before the next meeting Having said that, I do have a couple of reservations about a return to symmetry, one of which already has been expressed And that is that when it becomes public, it may be subject to over-interpretation--not necessarily misinterpretation but a "Now what are they up to or what do they see?" kind of thing But also I'm a little troubled by the fact that we seem to be responding again to the latest price statistics Now, it's certainly true that they are better, but I have not heard anybody express a much more positive view about longer-run inflation The forecast for the balance of this year and for 1994 is pretty much what it has been for an extended period of time It seems to me that we really ought to be looking and thinking about that as we do this So, I would be careful about putting a lot of emphasis on the fact that the latest price data look better and that, therefore, we don't need the asymmetric directive   In terms of economic conditions in the District, the trends and patterns remain generally positive as they have for quite some time There are some concerns with regard to agriculture because of the weather, of course There's the concern that all the shoes haven't dropped yet with regard to military bases and possible closures And there are some strikes under way in some of the taconite mines in northern Minnesota and the upper peninsula in Michigan But with those caveats, conditions really are pretty good Employment is up in all District states and we are getting renewed    9/23/93  reports of pretty tight labor market conditions in some of the major markets in the District That does not seem yet to have translated into demonstrable wage pressures, but we are hearing reports of difficulty in hiring--and these are above-minimum-wage type positions --and retaining workers  With regard to the national economy, I don't see much that's going to break us out of this pattern of moderate growth and moderate inflation that we've been in for quite some time I've been surprised--Ed Boehne raised this point--that there has been as much patience, or maybe less impatience than I would have expected, with regard to the performance of the economy over the past couple of years Maybe that's about to change, but so far it seems to me that there certainly has been less impatience than I expected And I guess the Committee at least implicitly seems to be patient or satisfied with both the pattern of growth and inflation that we've been getting   Far be it for me to break the pattern "B" symmetric   Well, as several other people have commented, I start from the position that we really have nothing to hide So in terms of what we release, I don't see a lot of danger, at least going back, aside from privacy considerations Going forward, of course, we get into the issues of the deliberative process and I'll comment on that, but in general I have favored Memoranda of Discussion In listening to the conversation this morning, I think what we're talking about in looking at the distinction between MODs versus lightly edited transcripts is really a question of quality I think the quality of the Memoranda of Discussion is going to be higher and, therefore, the documents are in some sense more useful [It's higher quality] versus the openness, or at least the appearance of [greater] openness, if we confine ourselves to lightly edited transcripts And I must say the more I look at that, the less the issue seems to be very clear to me So I can live with either alternative going back And I'd have no problem if we wanted also to provide the raw transcripts, again with the appropriate lags People who wanted to do that kind of comparison could then see what [editing] work was done Going forward, I think--   Well, five years or more as far as I'm concerned I think that's sort of a tactical question Going forward, again I started with a presumption in favor of Memoranda of Discussion, but I must say I don't feel the distinction between those and the lightly edited transcripts is all that great I have a mild preference for the Memorandum just because I think the quality of the document is higher  I don't think this is the right time, frankly, to change our procedures with regard to taping and transcripts In a way I think that would be self-defeating in the sense that while we're trying essentially to be more open, that would give the appearance at least that we were becoming less open [The elimination of taping and transcripts] may be worthy of consideration down the road, but at the moment I don't think that's the way to go And I do think, though we ought not try to resolve this today, that we should consider the  -28-    11/16/93  question once again of when we release the directive or the policy decision because, as I consider that issue, I don't think our current practices are necessarily optimal   Or more   First choice would be lightly edited and second choice would be raw transcripts with annotation   Five and three   MOD first; edited transcript second   First with regard to the District, I've reported for a long that the District economy has been fundamentally sound, and that continues to be the case The one exception is the exception that has also been the case for some time now and that's the areas of agriculture that were affected by the flooding We did have a meeting in the Bank about a week or so ago with a group of business leaders from the Twin Cities representing a wide range of businesses I will comment on that briefly because they did hold some views with great conviction; they were very adamant about it Three themes emerged and I will just report to the Committee on those One was that they were pretty much of one mind that there is no inflationary pressure around whatsoever And they were quite vociferous about that Secondly, they were very concerned about the health care proposals, particularly from the point of view of what they meant for prospective employment and costs of employment I would say that they were almost universally negative about that Thirdly, while they agreed that in many respects the latest statistics on the aggregate economy and what they were seeing in at least some of their own businesses were more favorable--and maybe a good deal more favorable--than what we were seeing earlier in the year, they continue to think that the expansion is very fragile and could easily be disrupted The one exception to that was people in the real estate business, especially in residential but even to some extent in commercial Clearly, residential has had a very good year in the District, and commercial activity has started to show at least some signs of improvement But outside of those areas, I think it's fair to say that there was still a view that the expansion is quite fragile  With regard to the national economy and the economic outlook in the Greenbook, clearly this expansion has moved in fits and starts and it looks as if another start is under way But starts have been followed by periodic fits, and that's what the Greenbook seems to be envisioning again I don't know that I would take very strong exception to that but I do have some sense that maybe at this point the economy really is starting to build a little momentum And that, coupled with the anecdotes that we've been getting for quite some time about the lack of inflationary pressures, leads me to speculate at least that while we may get the same kind of path for nominal GDP in 1994 as envisioned in the Greenbook, we might have a somewhat more favorable split between real growth and inflation than is envisioned there I can't say that with any great conviction at this point but I do have a sense that it wouldn't take a lot for things to turn out that way But other than that, I don't have any sharp departures from the outlook as depicted in the Greenbook   I favor "B" symmetric I have some sympathy for the issue of how we are going to know when the right time to deviate from this path is But we can't avoid that responsibility, and my best judgment is that this is not the time   I can support your recommendation, although it seems to me that the real reason for doing this is that it will provide some comfort to our friends that we've gone ahead and taken this step toward openness I think your suggestion to have people from Mr Kanjorski's staff and Mr Leach's staff is a good one I'm wondering if it's possible to go even further In one of your letters you suggested that you did want to meet with Chairman Gonzalez or to testify, and I wonder if there's any way to tie that into this and get that done   Thank you, Mr Chairman With regard to the economy of the Ninth District, there has been further improvement; that's a trend that has been under way for quite some time The stronger sectors appear to be consumer spending and residential construction And some people have even used the language that the District economy is "strong" And that's about as ebullient as they get in the cautious conservative area of the Upper Midwest  With regard to the national economy, I think the Greenbook forecast is reasonable Our internal forecast is not very different from that, although I recall that we did not forecast the significant slowing we saw in the first half of '93; and that gives me a little pause as we go into 1994 Having said that, and assuming that the general tenor of the Greenbook forecast or our forecast turns out to be accurate, I don't think it matters very much whether real growth  -18-    12/21/93  turns out to be a little more rapid or a little slower than is indicated in the Greenbook It seems to me the critical factor, as several people have commented, is what happens to inflation Neither the Greenbook forecast nor our internal forecast has any further deceleration of inflation in it and that certainly is a cause for concern On the other hand, if you listen to the anecdotal evidence-- at least out our way--it appears to be very, very difficult to raise prices, and people are not seeing much in the way of incoming price pressures either And the international situation and the slack available in foreign economies might also tend to make one a little more optimistic about the situation One other thought--and this is perhaps heretical, but nevertheless--many of us have accepted as kind of a working definition of price stability [that inflation is not a factor] in economic decisionmaking, and perhaps we're a little closer to that than we realize At least talking to some of the business people out our way, I certainly have to think that they are adjusting to the idea that price increases are simply going to be few and far between   While I find it something of a close call, I don't think the evidence is persuasive that we should move now So I support your prescription Having said that, I do think that before too long we ought to try to come to grips with what we mean by effective price stability I also think we have an obligation to come to grips with some of the evidence in the work that Messrs Stockton and Beebe presented in terms of what are the empirical benefits of  -38-    12/21/93  further reducing inflation from modest levels I don't think we can gloss over that question with theory   I agree with what has been said I would keep the ranges as they are I don't see any point in calling any more attention to the aggregates at this time And I would not publish the 1995 forecasts   Thank you, Mr Chairman Business conditions in the District remain quite positive and the strength is widespread both by sectors of the economy and geographically I'm certainly hearing fewer comments of concern about the future or about the fragility of the current expansion; that has diminished One aspect of the economy that I have commented on before and I'll just reiterate briefly is that we have had steady employment growth and we have low unemployment rates in most of the District states now That tends not to be remarkable in heavily agricultural states, but we have low unemployment rates in most of the major metropolitan areas as well, which I think is a more significant way of looking at it And we are hearing a variety of reports of labor shortages now--not at the unskilled end of the labor market, but at levels above that clearly there are growing reports of labor shortages That does not seem to have translated into discernible wage pressures yet But that seems to me almost inevitable At some point along the line here one of the reactions is going to have to be some wage pressures both to attract, but maybe more importantly to retain, some of the workers who are in short supply  With regard to the national economy, in looking at the Greenbook and listening to Mike Prell's comments, I took the staff forecast to be a sort of "more of the same only less so" forecast What I mean by that is that the economy grew over the second half of the year somewhere between 4 and 4-1/2 percent in real terms If we  -23-    2/3-4/94  get away from disturbances because of the weather and auto schedules and so on, I conclude that we're going into 1994 with a good deal of momentum, more momentum probably than the Greenbook forecast seems to incorporate So I feel pretty good about the state of the economy, but that also implies that at least under current circumstances we're not going to bend inflation down further from here   I'm comfortable with what you are proposing I happen to agree with those who think this will turn out to be precedential and from my perspective that's fine because I think we've been in an awkward situation where we have kind of acknowledged that people in the markets get the news and the signal immediately, but for those who are not close to the markets the news kind of dribbles out depending on how quickly they read the financial press or consult other sources of information But I mention that now only to reemphasize the point that Bob Parry and Tom Melzer made, which is that we really do need to come to grips with this whole host of issues about what records we keep and what we disclose and when we disclose it, and so on and so forth  -38-    2/3-4/94   Yes   And I think we better get on with that discussion   I agree with all the comments that have been made about it being the appropriate time to move, and I won't go through the rationale for that On the question of magnitude, I have a mild preference for a 50 basis point move basically on the grounds that I believe short-term interest rates have to move pro-cyclically A 1/4 point increase at this point just doesn't seem to me to be an action of much magnitude at all My guess is not that it would get lost in the markets--that certainly won't happen--but that it's not going to turn out to be significant relative to the job ahead of us And if I'm right that short-term rates have to move pro-cyclically, it seems to me that we ought to get started Therefore, as I said, I would have a mild preference for a 50 basis point move   I agree with what Governor Kelley just said   Our reports on the Ninth District have been positive for a long period of time now and nothing has really changed In fact, it appears that there has been a further step-up in activity pretty much across the board both by region and by sector Attitudes are positive; employment has continued to increase; expectations about 1994 for the most part are positive, and this is a continuation of what has been going on for quite some time If we are looking for negatives, one thing that has become more pronounced in recent months is that the phenomenon of Canadian shoppers coming across the border to spend their money has diminished, in part because of changes in the exchange rate and in part because of changes in Canadian policies that have made that more difficult and more expensive One other factor that is of some interest relates to housing activity We have had brisk sales for quite some time now and we are getting reports from realtors both in the major cities and in some of the smaller cities as well that the problem they face is a lack of supply of unsold homes That ought to augur well for construction going forward So the news in the District certainly remains positive and if anything has improved even further  With regard to the national economy, our model, although its structure is quite a bit different from the one that underpins the Greenbook forecast, produces a forecast that's really quite similar My own view is at least a little more optimistic about the pace of real growth, which is to say that I think we might do a little better than those two forecasts But I think the more salient features of the outlook have to do with the lack of disinflation, the lack of further progress in bringing the rate of inflation down both in our forecast and in the Greenbook forecast, given the monetary policy assumption  On this question of slack, we have done some analysis of the past several years that confirms my impression that the labor force at least for a time in the 1980s grew more rapidly than might have been expected Participation rates rose; the rate of increase in participation rates appeared to be above trend at least for some time That's not a situation that is, of course, sustainable forever, so it does not particularly surprise me that we are getting slower growth in participation rates now And if all of that holds together, I think it does tell us something about how much slack or how much capacity we can expect from the economy going forward If one wanted to be a little more optimistic about all of that, one would factor in the international situation because it does appear that there is a good deal more slack elsewhere in the world, certainly in the other industrial economies, than there appears to be here at the moment Despite all this and despite the strength in the regional economy, while there may be a minor increase in reports of greater wage or price pressures, there is nothing very broadly based or very  -27-    3/22/94  significant there yet, at least as far as the anecdotal information that we are picking up is concerned There may be a smattering of it but there is nothing that leads me to believe we have seen any significant change in that arena at this stage   As most people have already stated, it certainly seems appropriate to act now How far we ought to go and how fast we ought to try to get there, are the difficult questions My best judgment is that we'll be at this for some time; it may well be that the funds rate has to go to 4 percent or more by the time we are done But I don't have a strong conviction about how far we will need to go As to the timing issue, it seems to me that we are probably going to be at this until we are either more confident than we are today that we have established an environment for renewed disinflation or until we actually see renewed disinflation It may surprise us and occur earlier or something else may happen that changes our view about appropriate policy But having said all that, I think we should bear in mind, and I'm certainly willing to be humble about all this, that the confidence interval around any forecast is very wide And I think that argues for caution So, I'm comfortable with your 1/4 point recommendation now I think that is the appropriate magnitude And I would prefer a symmetric directive with the understanding that if we need a conference call, we can have one   Thank you, Mr Chairman The District economy continues to be very healthy The only exception to that is the energy sector, which of course is not very large in the District; otherwise, things continue to do very well I think people are becoming increasingly optimistic, and that's starting from, at this point, a fairly optimistic base A few anecdotes, some of which I've reported before, which I think are interesting and relevant I've heard a number of reports over the last several months about lean inventories, with the clear implication that people expect some attempt to step up production and build inventories over the next several months I would expect that to occur Continued reports about labor shortages, particularly of skilled labor in many markets, do not seem to have translated into a broad-based increase in wage pressures, although in the Twin Cities market it does appear that wage increases--this is from the panel that we work with in trying to plan our own compensation--turned out to be larger in 1993 than those that had been planned Exactly what was going on there I don't know, although we face a pretty tight labor market  On the banking side, there are reports of increases in loan demand and some preliminary indications that banks are starting to bid a little more aggressively for funds through small time deposits-- something we haven't seen for quite some time As far as pricing and price pressures go, it's very hard to find any broad-based indications of acceleration of inflation, but what I am hearing is that discounts are diminishing and the frequency of sales is diminishing It's very hard to quantify, but that does seem to be occurring  With regard to the national economy, I must say the logic of the Greenbook forecast does appeal to me It seems to me that the increase in interest rates, particularly in long rates, may work as that forecast envisions, that is, growth in real GDP will slow once again--whether it occurs in the third quarter or somewhat later remains to be seen That may succeed in stabilizing the rate of inflation about where it has been Although I must observe that in the last couple of expansions--coming out of the 1980-82 recession and the 1973-75 recession--once the economy built up momentum, those expansions seemed to go on longer and to be stronger than we, certainly, had anticipated Now, some of that may be the fact that,  -21-    5/17/94  of course, the momentum is not independent of the policies we pursued; and maybe we just reacted too late But at least a naive reading of those expansions suggests to me that once the economy starts to develop some momentum, that tends to go on for a while  Some numbers that I was looking at raise questions in my mind about what we might be able to say about the inflation outlook These numbers suggest, though I guess it's a little too early to even call this analysis, that the relationship between labor market conditions and the performance of wages or compensation seems to have deteriorated in the early 1980s--around 1983 and 1984--and hasn't been reestablished This suggests that we can't conclude very much from labor market conditions and what that might imply for wage pressures Similarly, there seems to be deterioration in the relationship between utilization rates and consumer prices that occurred about the same time I don't take much comfort from that; it raises uncertainty in my mind, if nothing else, about the price outlook, and it forces me to rely a little more on my intuition My instincts at this point are that the risks of inflation certainly are on the up side, particularly because we're not indifferent to errors in that direction In other words, we're not terribly concerned if we undershoot inflation We might be a lot more concerned if we overshoot   I support the proposal in its entirety I am a little concerned--somebody mentioned this earlier--about the comments we get from time to time that we ought to take whatever actions we're going to take and then pause I don't think the statement gives the  -35-    5/17/94  impression that we're necessarily locking ourselves into that for any extended period of time I guess what I'm concerned about is a view in the markets now, and I don't know why it should arise now, that we are more clairvoyant than we are--that we somehow know where we're going and when we're going to stop And I think we ought to be careful and try not to convey that impression   I just want to comment on what we have been discussing I think one of the problems with an exercise using this approach is that there are no explicit costs associated with inflation That was implicit in Governor Lindsey's comments But if we continue to look at it this way, we are always going to say, at least at first glance, why not avoid a tighter policy or why not indeed go to an easier policy One of the things we have to try to find is a way of considering explicitly the costs of inflation in all this My impression is that there are some models around that do that But until we do that, it seems to me that these exercises are really of very limited value, because it always looks as if the best thing to do is either nothing or ease   With regard to the ranges for the monetary aggregates, I certainly agree with those who suggest just leaving them as they are, including the debt variable I don't see very much to be gained by fooling around with those right now for the reasons that have been cited  With regard to the question about Senator Riegle's request, I would be inclined to provide the information on the notion that more information is better than less, and also I am not too troubled by the fact that somebody might look at those and think that they are goals Obviously, we would want to emphasize that they are projections or forecasts and not goals, but some people could interpret them differently Presumably if we weren't responding to a variable in that set that looked unfavorable to Congress, say, we would have good reason or reasons for why we weren't We would explain in any event what policy was and why it was what it was So, I am not too troubled by questions that might come up about whether the forecast was acceptable to us or why we were not responding to it   Thank you, Mr Chairman The District economy remains in very good shape, and most of the indicators suggest that that may continue for some time, perhaps for an extended period of time Employment gains have remained sizable; job availability is good There are some shortages of labor--in construction trades clearly--as has been mentioned Despite this healthy economy having been in place for quite some time, there really are no widespread signs of building wage and price pressures Interestingly enough, the one place one can find wage pressures without looking too hard is in the entry-level jobs Firms have said they have had to raise starting wages in order to attract and retain people; otherwise, they move on pretty quickly as soon as there is an opening at the next wage level across the street Much of the agricultural sector of the District is in good shape, although the livestock and dairy industries are having a very difficult year because prices have declined We recently had a meeting of our Advisory Council on Small Business, Agriculture, and Labor The members were generally upbeat along the lines I have been describing, although they did suggest that there was a note of caution in the air as a consequence of the increase in interest rates But it didn't seem to have translated into any changes in plans or intentions or in what they were seeing in their businesses as yet  With regard to the national economy, my own view is that we might get a little more real growth and a little more inflation than is depicted in the Greenbook, but I don't view those differences as significant If I take a step back, my sense of things is--and maybe I am a little too sanguine or am overly influenced by what has been happening in the District for a long time--that we are on a path that we may well stay on for some period of time, that is, moderate growth and moderate inflation I personally have been surprised, given the performance of the economy over the last couple of years and given the diminution of unemployed workers and of unused capacity in manufacturing and elsewhere, that we have not seen more wage and price pressures I have asked myself about that development or lack of that development as it were, and I have tentatively concluded that perhaps  -30-    7/5-6/94  the economy is a little less inflation prone than I thought earlier In any event, my sense is that we may remain on the path we are on for some time   For the moment I am pretty comfortable with where we are as well as with the way I see things unfolding So I would favor alternative B with a symmetric directive, which is my usual preference Having said that, I do think we need to be careful here, though that is hardly new for monetary policy There has been a lot of talk--Al Broaddus touched on this--to the effect that we have moved quite a bit and we have moved early and so on and so forth, but my reading of the historical record suggests that this is neither a large move nor a particularly early move Now, other things are different, of course, that have to do with the economy--the stance of fiscal policy, and other things that we can enumerate But I think we ought not to believe some of the rhetoric that is out there about the way policy has acted so far We probably have not behaved as atypically as at least some commentators have suggested, and that suggests to me that over time we may well have considerably more to do   I have a couple of questions, Mike The first one has to do with the price forecast How much of that is empirical as opposed to judgment? I ask because some preliminary work we've done suggests that if you look at capacity measures versus measures of price or wage inflation, they look pretty good into the early 1980s but then the relationship seems to deteriorate rather significantly I'm curious what you see going on there   My second question--as I understand the forecast, you have long-term interest rates coming down next year, is that right? [Mr Prell Yes] How much precedent is there for a decline in long rates like that in circumstances where you have stable short- term rates and a continuing expansion? Obviously, we had some periods in the 1980s when long-term rates came down in the middle of the expansion but short-term rates were declining through at least some of that period as I recall So I'm trying to look for history and my memory isn't that good about all that   The Ninth District economy continues to be robust The strength remains broadly based whether you look at manufacturing, construction, natural resources, or to get the demand side, consumer spending and so forth Both the objective measures of activity and the anecdotal evidence, I think, are consistent with the kind of performance we saw in the national economy in the first half and suggest to me that we will see pretty good strength continuing in the second half of this year as well Jobs are plentiful in many, many areas both geographically and across different industries and skills I'm struck by--business people are usually anxious to share their problems when they come across a Federal Reserve official, but they haven't had a lot of problems to share apparently There are two exceptions to this generally positive picture One is that some of the wheat producing areas have a problem with too much moisture and that may affect things there and may back up into the condition of some of their lenders as well And home sales have slowed a bit, particularly in the Twin Cities, but that has to be put in the context of having come off two very strong years of home sales in the metropolitan area   In parts of North Dakota and Minnesota where they have had a fair amount of moisture, yes It's going to affect both yield and quality   I don't know With regard to the national economy, the incoming data haven't affected my view of things from the last meeting I think we do have continued strong growth in demand In the second half, I see the economy probably growing a bit slower than it did in the first half, but I'm not expecting a lot of slowing based on what I can see going on here As I hinted earlier, I'm uncertain what this means for inflation because the relationships between capacity and price or wage pressures don't seem to me to be as robust as they were in the early 1980s In those circumstances, I tend to fall back on a few things that I think I do know having to do  -16-    8/16/94  with what we might expect for labor force growth and for hours worked per employee When I go through that kind of arithmetic in my head, I come to the conclusion that we will have to be lucky to avoid a building of inflationary pressures here if I'm right about the strength of demand   I certainly support the recommendation and, as several people have already commented, I think the statement and any other discussion that occurs in the next weeks are very important The facts of the matter are that we don't know what is going to come down the road, and if and when we may have to move next I think we ought to make that clear to the markets, and I believe the statement does a pretty good job of that--that this is not a permanent position   Thank you, Mr Chairman First, with regard to the Ninth District economy, the objective measures of economic activity suggest that the regional economy remains strong The anecdotal evidence--of course there is always a danger of paying too much attention to that--suggests that activity has even picked up another notch, which is pretty remarkable because the regional economy has been operating at quite an accelerated pace for an extended period of time Nevertheless, business people seem quite positive about recent developments virtually across the board Labor markets have tightened further and jobs are certainly readily available Despite those circumstances, there is still no widespread evidence of building inflationary or wage pressures, but I think it is fair to say that there are more scattered indications of growing inflation and wage  -25-    9/27/94  pressures It is by no means widespread, as I suggested, but as we listen to people comment about input prices and about what is happening in specific labor markets and so forth, there certainly is more talk today about inflation than there was a few months ago Even some of the business people who have been quite skeptical of our concerns about inflation, thinking that we might be worried about a phantom, have started to acknowledge that there may be a little more to it than they at least thought earlier It's also true that when we talk to bankers--I think this came across in the FAC minutes but it comes across almost everywhere--if anything credit is a good deal more readily available today to small and medium-size businesses than it was a year ago or even less It does not appear that our moves toward higher interest rates have had any restraining effect in that sector  With regard to the national economy, it may be slowing, but not very much in my view, although I will admit that depending on how the inventory numbers play out, we could get some readings of real GDP that suggest a slowing My reading of the incoming data at the national level suggests there is a good deal of momentum in the expansion I guess the only way I can describe it is that it looks strong I do think this will be accompanied by some acceleration of inflation as the Greenbook suggests Bob Forrestal raised an interesting point that this may be just a temporary, cyclical spike that we need not get very worried about But it seems to me that identifying whether it's a temporary spike as opposed to something more durable may turn out to be exceedingly difficult, and certainly history doesn't provide very much comfort on that score   I find myself in substantial agreement with Al Broaddus and for many of the same reasons It seems to me that the economy has a good deal of momentum I'm not at all confident that we are moving toward a sustainable path at this point I think the banking system is in the process of supporting rapid growth, and this may well occur without any significant change in the size of its balance sheet, just a change in composition I think the evidence suggests that, so far at least, we have not moved particularly early or particularly forcefully relative to historical experience, so I'm not persuaded that we're ahead of the curve Finally, I hope I'm wrong when I say this, but I'm concerned about our ability to analyze the price data and come up with all these fine reasons why something unusual is going on and the rise in prices won't last We can tell those kinds of tales, but I must say that that kind of analysis has led to past policy errors, and I'm afraid I'm reminded of one of Yogi Berra's expressions about "deja vu all over again"   I used to comfort myself with the observation that since sterilized intervention really didn't affect anything, it probably really wouldn't harm anything either, a sort of a no-harm-no- foul kind of rule But I have come to the conclusion that sterilized intervention does have some cost Al just cited the credibility issue Also, I am observing that this Committee has a lot of discomfort with these operations I don't know where that goes beyond what we are already doing in the sense that we probably ought to keep these operations to a minimum to the extent we can, unless we believe that for monetary policy reasons we are going to do some unsterilized intervention; that's a different story Also, I would say that I think this discussion is helpful More communication about what we are doing and why would be helpful When we do get involved in intervention, it is very hard from time to time to understand exactly what prompted it on that occasion when it didn't prompt it on other occasions Sometimes, there doesn't seem to be any particular pattern or rationale I would certainly feel more comfortable with it all if I knew what it was about the circumstances in question that prompted the action   Mike, as I recall when the household survey was changed by the Labor Department, a lot of people anticipated that at some point there would be a significant bump up in the unemployment rate, which has not materialized Is that simply because it has been swamped by employment gains or what is the explanation for that?   Thank you   With regard to the District economy, there is not a lot new to report; it remains strong Manufacturing is robust Materials prices are going up Employment is high throughout the District In some of the metropolitan areas, the reports we are getting are that everybody who wants to work is working What seems to be restraining some further job growth in those areas is housing shortages; businesses would attract more labor from the rural areas in the region or maybe from outside the District, but there is no housing in some of these places Despite that, there are no widespread reports of wage or price pressures, at the retail level at least What wage pressures there are seem to be concentrated mostly at the lower end of the pay scales I think that is because of the difficulty of retaining workers there; they have so many easy opportunities to move out and up Elsewhere in the District, the agricultural situation is mixed It is a good year for crops, though prices are not entirely favorable It has been tough in the livestock industry at least outside the dairy sector Since they are coming off about 7 good years, I'm not sure there are any real problems emerging there We did hear some reports from our Advisory Council members about interest rates starting to bite in the housing and furniture markets It is hard to know exactly what to make of that in light of the national statistics that seem better But however that may be, it is clear that the paper industry has bounced back  -22-    11/15/94  With regard to the national economy, I don't have a lot to add to what has already been said When we go through our translation process that takes the labor market data, in this case for October, and turns them into a GDP estimate for the fourth quarter, we get about 4-1/2 percent growth in real terms at an annual rate In some sense, that's neither here nor there, of course It's history, but it does tell us something about the underlying momentum of the economy, which I do think is quite positive and quite strong There is always the danger of extrapolating the latest reading On the other hand, as several people have already commented, it seems to me our experience over the years has been that once momentum starts to build in terms of real growth, it tends to go on for quite some time and it probably takes more restraint than we usually anticipate, at least early in the game, to avoid an acceleration of inflation or indeed to make progress in reducing the rate of inflation  Finally, let me comment on the suggestion that Al Broaddus just made I may come out at a somewhat different place than he did, but I do think that the suggestion to consider the implications of longer-run inflation targets may be a constructive one   Well, you certainly wouldn't want to do it without considerable political support I agree with that   I also support your recommendation for 75 basis points on tactical grounds because it seems to me that the markets have been discomfited by our failure to respond recently I don't think that that has done our credibility any good I would reiterate, though, a couple of the dangers that other people have mentioned At some point, there is a danger of overkill I don't know whether 150 basis points in total is going to turn out to be too much or too little On fundamentals, I think there might be something to be said for buying a little time to see when the presumably lagged effects of previous tightenings start to bite, or if they do But because of the state of the markets and market expectations, my view is, as I stated, that 75 is fine for now   Thank you For the most part, the Ninth District economy remains very strong; much of it is operating at full employment or maybe even beyond Two interesting pieces of information have become available since the last meeting On the anecdotal side, I think there is some accumulating evidence that housing is slowing down, both sales and construction activity--that there has been some response to higher interest rates I wouldn't say that the supporting information is overwhelming, but I think there has been enough of it to indicate some effect in our area Secondly, we did have a meeting with a large number of Twin City business leaders several weeks ago, and I would say the general tenor of that meeting was that whatever we have here, we don't have equilibrium What I mean is that most of their talk was about labor shortages across the board, from the skilled to the entry level jobs That market hasn't cleared It has not resulted yet in a lot of wage pressures, although people talk frequently about raising wages in one part of the pay  -16-    12/20/94  scale or another But it sounded to me as if there is more to come, that we clearly have some disequilibrium The same thing was true when they discussed what they were seeing in terms of crude and intermediate materials prices and availability There obviously are pressures there It sounded to me as if there is more to come and that ultimately that will put pressure on final goods prices Now whether this results in simply a blip in inflation at the consumer level or something more sustained remains to be seen But clearly there is a lot of pressure If these people are representative, there is a lot of pressure coming  With regard to the national outlook, I guess what I found the most surprising part of the Greenbook forecast, something that people have already commented on, was the inflation outlook If I used the Greenbook type of framework, which as I understand it relies a lot on capacity pressures to drive inflation, and look at how the economy has performed and where we are in terms of the unemployment rate and capacity utilization and so forth, I think I would come out with a lot more inflation over the next several quarters than is there My concern is that we could get an acceleration of inflation--the 1/4 point or so that the Greenbook seems to envision is just noise That could happen or not happen depending on a lucky or unlucky break or two My judgment would be that if we get an acceleration of inflation, we will not need a magnifying glass to discern it   You can go from 02 to 03 of a point--   You can go from 02 to 03 percent per month and that gives you a percentage point right there On a monthly basis, it doesn't look like very much   I'd favor "B" with a symmetric directive I favor "B" because I do think we have applied some restraint and, given the lags, I think we ought to be patient and take some time to  -39-    12/20/94  see what effects, if any, they have I favor a symmetric directive for several reasons Part of it is my normal antipathy to, or discomfort with, asymmetric directives But more fundamentally on this occasion, I have trouble imagining what evidence we will get in the next several weeks that is really going to help us address what I consider to be one of the key questions What is the economy going to be like and what is the appropriate stance or policy actions that will influence things later in 1995 and into 1996? It just doesn't seem likely to me that we are going to learn anything in the next several weeks that is going to help us very much in addressing those questions I may be wrong, but we can have a conference call if significant new information does materialize Beyond that, the suggestion has been made, and I certainly agree with it, that there are a number of fundamental longer-run policy issues that the Committee should discuss and perhaps try to reach consensus on I noted a number of them in my recent communication [Secretary's note A copy of Mr Stern's letter to Chairman Greenspan, dated November 29, 1994, is appended] And I think the one that is on the table already about longer-run inflation objectives is a good place to start   Yes   My instinct is similar to that of many others in that I feel it would be a step in the right direction for us to adopt some sort of inflation objective As others have already observed, inflation is something that the profession and the Committee believe we can be held responsible for in the long run It is related to monetary policy, and controlling it may be the most important contribution we can make to economic performance in the long run  Having said that, I would be very careful about overselling this at this point on a number of grounds One that already has been referred to is that, without Congressional support, I don't know that our unilaterally doing this would buy us very much credibility Secondly, I come down on the side that ultimately we would need some sort of numerical objectives Otherwise, it is not clear to me how the proposal differs very much from what we already are doing Many of us already have spoken over the years in favor of some kind of price stability objective, recognizing that in the short run we may pursue other objectives Thirdly, I don't think this is an objective that we can adopt or pursue independently of fiscal policy Do we really believe that if fiscal policy were in some sense exploding, we simply would try to pursue price stability? I have real reservations about that Another issue is, do we need a penalty? If we fail to gain credibility, if we fail to achieve the objective, does there have to be some sort of penalty, as in New Zealand? I am not suggesting that particular penalty! [Laughter] Without that, what do we gain?  I would say the real sleeper issue--I touched on this earlier and Janet raised it implicitly--is that when push comes to shove, I'm not sure that we have very good evidence that going in this direction really makes a lot of sense from the point of view of economic welfare as opposed to, for example, stabilizing inflation at the current rate, if that is a feasible alternative We talk as if we do and we hope that we do, but the analysis that I see on that subject does not lead me to be very confident I think we have to hold ourselves to the highest standard on that issue because if the question is put to us in Congressional testimony concerning what benefits we can expect in terms of economic performance from taking inflation down from 3 to 2-1/2 percent or whatever over the next x years, we have to be prepared to address that question in a serious way It is a tough question   But you indicated that in fact that might not be the way it falls out  -69-    1/31-2/1/95   The Ninth District economy remains healthy Unemployment rates are almost uniformly low throughout the District Employment gains over the past year have been very substantial, and there are labor shortages in many parts of the District right now which over time certainly will slow the pace of expansion Not unrelated to what has been going on, there are also housing shortages in many parts of the District Apartment construction in some of those mid-size communities is very substantial, at least by their historical standards Obviously, that will help to alleviate the housing problem over time, but right now, even if employers in those communities could attract more labor, they would not have any place to house them Despite these circumstances, there is still no widespread  -87-    1/31-2/1/95  evidence of an acceleration of wages There are perhaps a few more reports than there were a few months ago of some pickup in wage pressures, but they still are not widespread That is not what I might have anticipated given the clear evidence of labor shortages  Overall, the District economy continues to do quite well Natural resource industries had a very good year We already have talked a little about paper and forest products; mining of iron, copper, and so forth also has done well The retail sales picture has not been much different than elsewhere in the country We have had a bifurcated pattern where hard goods have been selling well and soft goods, especially apparel, have not I don't pretend to have any insight into why that should be the case The weather has been mild and the lack of snow has affected tourism, which had been running quite strongly for a good number of years So, it has not been a good winter in many parts of the District as a consequence of the weather  The other thing I might mention about the District economy is that it seems to be widely, though not universally, expected that 1995 will not be as strong a year as 1994 I suppose there is nothing remarkable about that in the sense that 1994 was quite a good year as was 1993, and people just naturally are cautious that this can't go on forever and there may be a sense that we are bouncing off the ceiling These attitudes have been around for a while; there is nothing that has triggered them It may be that people simply have been taking another look at consensus forecasts that things will slow, but that does seem to be the prevailing attitude  With regard to the national economy, I must admit I am a bit uncomfortable about the inflation outlook I am particularly uncomfortable if I adopt the Greenbook framework, which emphasizes capacity pressures and a NAIRU of around 6 percent It seems to me that, in that environment, we will get an acceleration of inflation Maybe it will be modest and only cyclical but, of course, the outcome probably is not wholly independent of what we choose to do In my judgment, that is where the risk is   I support the recommendations   Thank you, Mr Chairman Let me comment first on the national economy I find myself a little more confident than I normally am about the general contour of the Greenbook forecast in part because, as many people have commented, the incoming data on the national economy are convincing evidence to me that the pace of growth has slowed Those data are also consistent with the tenor of the anecdotes that I have been picking up in the District lately I take some comfort from the incoming data and the Greenbook forecast and indeed from our own forecast, because as recently as a couple of months ago it was mostly a hope and a prayer that growth would slow to something more consistent with trend Now I think it is a little more than that I don't know where the risks lie, particularly; I do know that the confidence bands around these forecasts, if one does it rigorously, are very, very wide I think that is worth bearing in mind as we go forward  With regard to the Ninth District and the anecdotes there, first of all, I think it is worth saying that the District economy on balance remains very healthy But, and there are some "buts," there is no doubt that auto sales, housing activity, and retail sales generally have slowed perceptibly The sellers are disappointed and their attitudes have soured somewhat I think they attribute this slowing to the level of interest rates to at least some considerable degree On the other side of the coin, labor remains in quite short supply in most of the District This has not translated into any real acceleration in the rate of wage inflation, but it does seem to be affecting expansion plans and/or current production activity, simply deferring those plans or limiting output; I think it has made a difference The final comment I would offer is that I have a sense that we are in for some kind of inventory correction I say that not on the basis of a lot of rigorous analysis of how production has matched up with consumption or other spending, but mostly as I listen to stories about some of the disappointment that has occurred That suggests to me that there are some inventories around that people would rather not be holding, whether they want to admit it or not Certainly, the incoming production data on the national economy have  -30-    3/28/95  been stronger than the spending data, consistent with the same story That suggests to me that an inventory correction will occur   Don, in your discussion about inertia and what might or might not work, you did not mention the monetary base Is that principally because of the currency component, especially the currency held abroad, or do you have something else in mind?   Good  -40-    3/28/95   I think Don Kohn raised a couple of interesting points, and I would like to start with comments on those I do think this problem of interest rate inertia is a real problem, potentially at least It may be that what we are seeing in the financial markets now is a consequence of unsustainable euphoria for one reason or another But it may be on the other hand that the markets are telling us something significant I don't have a judgment about that, and I believe we should be careful about rushing to a conclusion about that While it is not fully convincing, it is worth noting that some work  -46-    3/28/95  that we have done suggests that the monetary base might be a useful indicator or maybe some sort of useful intermediate target, even recognizing the problems with the currency component I think that is worth pursuing down the road  With regard to the immediate situation, I certainly favor alternative B I don't feel all that strongly about the question of symmetry versus asymmetry, but I come out on the side of favoring symmetry Part of that is my usual reluctance to go to an asymmetric directive In these circumstances, as I suggested already, we don't know a lot about what the markets are telling us about recent interest rate movements, at least I don't But it is also true that the period between now and the next meeting is relatively long, and we are going to get a lot of incoming information We don't meet again until fairly late in May if I have the calendar right I don't have a feeling as to what the incoming information may tell us, and I would like to be in a position of simply judging it as it comes in Beyond that, and maybe I am just being a little too cynical here, I am certainly not pleased by the performance of the dollar, but I don't think we ought to put ourselves in a position where we might want to react to that I am not persuaded that that would be appropriate at this juncture or that it is something we can do very successfully So, I would be reluctant to go to asymmetry   The economy of the Ninth District is similar to what has been reported in virtually all the other Districts The pace of expansion has slowed But I must say the tenor of the information and anecdotes that have come in suggests to me that, relative to the numbers that we have seen for the national economy, the District economy remains pretty sound The strength is concentrated right now in basic industries Pulp and paper production is strong; iron and copper mining is strong; energy exploration has picked up I would describe sentiment as cautious but not negative There has been some concern expressed about what might follow from the battle with Japan on the auto parts issue, and whether that could inhibit some of our producers who currently export non-auto related goods to Japan But industry attitudes don't seem to be particularly negative Labor markets remain quite tight, especially for skilled workers, but as usual that does not seem to be translating into broad-based wage pressures A couple of mortgage bankers that I ran into recently have expressed growing optimism I gather their volume has picked up  With regard to the national economy, I don't have any serious problems with the soft landing pattern in the Greenbook forecast I would observe that it not only is a soft landing but it is a rather quick one It only takes a couple of quarters of below-trend expansion before we get back to what appears to be trend or steady state And I guess I am struck that even if things work out that well, that means in some sense that we are going to be looking at subpar numbers on the national economy for at least six months, that is, into October or November We probably ought to recognize that up front and gird ourselves to be patient if, in fact, we get incoming evidence on the national economy of that nature That's inherent in the forecast and that seems to be what we ought to be expecting, at least as the most likely scenario   I, too, agree with "B" symmetric The only comment I would add is that when I submitted my Humphrey-Hawkins numbers earlier this year, I was relatively negative about the inflation outlook, at least for this year Unfortunately, nothing has happened to change my view about that On the other hand, looking at all the incoming information on the economy, I am marginally more confident that this may turn out to be a temporary acceleration in the core CPI, and I don't see any reason to take action at this juncture   Mr Chairman, with regard to the aggregates, I certainly take your comments to heart In light of that, I would favor alternative II for 1995 and alternative I for 1996 I would not change the M2 range After listening to Don, the explanation for    7/5-6/95  changing the M3 range seems straightforward, and in that sense I would go ahead and do that I don't think that would cause any problems with your testimony   With regard to some of the issues that Al Broaddus raised, I think his points are well taken We ought to be looking at monetary policy as it relates to inflation My reservations have to do with my impression that a couple of his points in some sense jump the gun They have to do with two issues in particular Don Kohn raised a question about the quantification of the benefits of price stability and indicated--or at least I took his comments to mean--that the evidence was mixed and uncertain If we started doing present value calculations, depending on what estimates we believed, we might find significant benefits or we might find that the benefits are rather small relative to their cost I happen to believe that there are benefits there and that they are sizable, but I think it is incumbent upon us to make that case more compellingly than we have to date I don't see any way around the difficult research that probably involves  Another related and important issue has to do with public support for any objective that we adopt, whether it is mandated by statute or we do it ourselves To some extent, it falls on us to build the public support for a price stability objective I don't think that support is totally lacking, but I don't believe there is any great conviction among the public at large that price stability ought to be the preeminent objective of monetary policy Until we put together some of that evidence I was referring to earlier, I think moving way out ahead and trying to bring the public with us might be very difficult So, for the reasons that I stated, I would be cautious at this juncture about going down that path I do think there are issues there, and I suggested before that we ought to be discussing and looking at them and probably finding some research to do I am concerned about moving too far too quickly   Thank you, Mr Chairman The District economy continues to do reasonably well based on the available objective measures There are some problems in agriculture related to weather, but otherwise things seem to be moving along reasonably well A couple of bright reports have come in recently One is a firm with a large mortgage banking operation that says business has been quite good recently and the improvement is only partially related to refinancing activity And a large appliance and electronics retailer says that business has held up well Having said that, I think there is a sense of disappointment in some parts of the District, and it is not because activity has contracted in an absolute sense I think it has more to do with what people thought this year's business growth might turn out to be for their firms, what they took to be a trend as opposed to what economists might consider trend rates of growth and so forth Actual developments just have not lived up to those more favorable expectations I think there is some of that going on  With regard to the national economy, I do have some concerns First, I will talk briefly about some things that don't concern me Our model is also a VAR model We update it as new data become available and it is giving us a forecast not precisely equivalent to that of the Greenbook, but not very different--a continuation of modest growth and some slowing in inflation over time What strikes me about the forecast is that the most recent run of the model does not differ very much, if at all, from the run we did prior to the May FOMC meeting So, even though a lot of the data that have come in on the national economy in that intermeeting period were on the soft side, our model continues to generate the same forecast That says that either those numbers are consistent with what the model in some sense was expecting or there have been offsets The offsets, of  -26-    7/5-6/95  course, could be on the financial side because of the continued improvement in the bond and stock markets In some sense it is as if we almost have an automatic stabilizer working in the bond market, with interest rates declining as this has unfolded That, as I suggested, doesn't concern me  What does concern me are some other things First of all, like the Greenbook, when we interpolate the second quarter we get a contraction in activity; and if we go back and look at the preliminary GDP data--not the data that are finely smoothed and reported several years later--it's rare, though not wholly impossible, to find a contraction in GDP that isn't ultimately associated with a recession I just report that as a fact I don't know what its implications may be this time around What concerns me are a couple of things that have been mentioned One, I share Bill McDonough's concerns about the foreign situation I have a sense that we have looked at the sunny side of a lot of those economies for a time, and that things just are not panning out and have not for a while, and I am concerned about what that implies for domestic activity  I am also a little suspicious that we may have underestimated the effects of the 1993 tax increase It's not just that tax payments apparently were much higher than anticipated in April 1995, but I can see where the repercussions of that may be more important than I, at least, thought earlier  Finally, I am uneasy about this so-called inventory adjustment My experience is that those kinds of inventory adjustments never turn out to be as quick and as easy and as painless as we hope It is a truism that if demand holds up they do turn out to be relatively easy and relatively painless, but that is a big "if" In listening to the explanations about why demand might be expected to hold up, I agree that it might well But I don't know that I heard anything newly compelling about that, and so my concerns are not entirely assuaged as I listen to those explanations   It will be in five years! [Laughter]   I will make only a couple of points I think the decision does not hinge--some people have made this point already--on the current weakness in the economy or even prospective weakness, at least of the type we have been talking about In part that is because of the well recognized lags in policy; there is not much we can do about the economy at this point In part also, as people have commented, the reaction that has already occurred in the bond and stock markets and the anticipation that the inventory adjustment will be rather brief and rather shallow--those, of course, are not independent events--do not suggest to me that a decision today hinges on the immediate outlook What I think is important at this juncture is that the markets have essentially priced in an easing of policy We do not in my view want to peg the federal funds rate at any particular level Interest rates typically fluctuate pro-cyclically If we look at even the relatively optimistic path for real growth in the Greenbook or the model that we maintain, we get ceteris paribus a number of consecutive quarters of below-trend growth That is an environment in which I would expect interest rates to be declining It doesn't seem to me that we should stand in the way of that So, I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman For what it is worth, though, I would prefer a symmetric directive   I have a couple of questions First, Charlie, on the international side With regard to the other industrial nations, as I looked at your projections I couldn't discern the reasons you are expecting improvement in their economic activity Is that based on the general cyclical notion that those economies have been growing slowly, if at all, so they are bound to do better in the future or is there something more fundamental going on that has led you to believe they are going to do better?   Second question I don't fully understand it, but I gather that BEA is going to use the chain-weighted index to deflate GDP and that will lower previous estimates of real GDP, significantly in some cases Does that also mean that productivity estimates are going to come down significantly? If so, is that really credible?   Thank you, Mr Chairman The District economy remains healthy and activity generally has picked up over the summer That pickup has been reasonably widespread across industries and regions of the District There have been some further gains in employment At the same time, labor does remain in relatively scarce supply That combination is interesting because it still has not translated into anything resembling a broad-based-acceleration of wages or even growing wage pressures One interesting anecdote bearing on this--and I would not argue that this is a widespread development at this point--came from a fairly large employer in our District who indicated that he was having a lot of trouble finding workers He said he has gone to outsourcing some of his back office activities; he has contracted with a firm in Maine to do some of this work Apparently, labor is more readily available there and he can get the work done at a reasonable rate As I said, I am not suggesting that such outsourcing is widespread, but we may see more of it as time goes on  One exception to this general picture of economic health is the livestock industry; a second is manufacturing For whatever reason, manufacturers in our District feel business is soft and they are not optimistic They believe they are going to be cutting output further for some time I think that's a reasonable generalization of their views  With regard to the national economy, I am certainly in general agreement with the contours of the Greenbook foreast The major surprise to me has been that things seem to be working out so    8/22/95  well, and certainly a bit better than I might have expected a month or two ago I think we are moving toward a foundation for a resumption of sound economic growth I anticipate that wage and price pressures will remain relatively restrained That is based in part on what I see going on in the economy in terms of the difficulty of raising prices and the reluctance to raise wages or other forms of compensation I don't see anything that is going to come along soon to disturb that So, I think we are in pretty good shape   I support it as well   In general, I am in favor of this legislation I think it is the right direction to move for the reasons that a number of people, including Ed Boehne, cited This will get us toward our largest contribution to economic prosperity over time Having said that, I would agree--this may seem unusual--with both Tom and Alan If we start thinking about the implementation issues, they are rather daunting As Don Kohn mentioned, this would join the issue of whether we really want to achieve price stability in an opportunistic sense or whether we want to go with something like alternative C irrespective of how things stand at the moment My judgment would be that there would be no escaping those kinds of questions if this legislation were put in place So, I think that would likely be a very challenging environment That does not mean that we should not go this route, but I do think some issues that we have been able to finesse in recent years will be joined rather directly if we go down this path   Ted, would you elaborate a bit on the Daiwa situation and whether that's known in the market?   I heard something about it on the news this morning, but I didn't see any details   They are a primary dealer, Bill?   The Ninth District economy remains strong Labor markets are tight The rate of unemployment in Minnesota is at or near an all-time low Particularly bright spots in the economy are construction, both residential and commercial, mining and energy output, and forest products The only major exceptions to this generally favorable picture are cattle producers, who are being adversely affected by low prices--but that is coming off seven or eight pretty good years--and tourism, where apparently the summer season turned out to be mediocre; again, that is coming off several back-to-back very strong years  As far as the national economy is concerned, I have no problem with the general path of the Greenbook forecast, and I am hard pressed to identify a particular bias in the risks Our model forecast is more optimistic than the Greenbook--more optimistic in the sense that we have slightly more growth in 1996 and 1997 and slightly less inflation In fact, we have a deceleration of inflation Given our inability to be precise about these things, I would judge either outcome to be acceptable   I also favor "B" symmetric  -37-    9/26/95   Thank you We recently have had meetings with our directors and our advisory council, and several themes emerged from those discussions Many of them are not new, but I think they are worth emphasizing because they were universal The first of these themes was that labor markets are very, very tight across the District and across skill and experience levels--everything from unskilled, inexperienced workers to college graduates, MBAs, and so on While that was reported by virtually everybody who commented on it, they also commented that despite the fact that those labor markets have been tight for quite some time, there is no real sign of any acceleration in wage increases or price increases across the District Also, credit is readily available There has been a striking lack of reports of difficulty in finding credit Real estate construction markets have strengthened and are continuing to strengthen The  -26-    11/15/95  manufacturing sector, in contrast, is pretty sluggish outside of the paper industry If there is one group that is concerned about current industry conditions and where the economy is likely to be going, I would have to say it is the manufacturers Those we have talked to who do business internationally say that outside of Japan they are seeing improved business Japan appears to be, as we know, largely a case unto itself at the moment Finally, those who commented on this issue indicated that capital spending today is being driven by technological change rather than interest rates They would not argue that interest rates are altogether inconsequential, but they seem to feel that they really have to continue to introduce new technology in order to remain competitive  With regard to the outlook for the national economy, I share the view evidenced in the Greenbook that we will see a continuation of respectable real growth from here It will not be at the pace of the third quarter, but I don't see any reason to doubt that the economy will continue to grow at a pace in the neighborhood of 2 or 3 percent on average over the next several quarters With regard to the inflation outlook, I must admit to a fair amount of uncertainty If I had to write down a number, I would probably write down something like the 3 percent in the Greenbook But if there is one thing that really has surprised me in the past year or maybe two, it has been the fact that despite tight labor markets, rapid growth in demand, and tight product markets we have not seen any acceleration of inflation I have a tinge of optimism regarding the inflation outlook, and if I were to err I would guess that we might do a bit better on the inflation side than that number I would write down   That's almost enough!   I favor "B" symmetric at this meeting I might say a word or two about what we might consider going forward from here It seems to me that the degree of sogginess in the economy in the meeting five weeks from now will be one issue, but I think an equally important issue will be the path we want to put inflation on One way of looking at the work on the Taylor rule is, of course, that policy is overly restrictive Another way of looking at it is that it's appropriately restrictive because we want to bend inflation down further from here Where that leads me is that we need to have a discussion and try to get agreement at some point on whether we want to try to move toward lower inflation deliberately as opposed to opportunistically I think that's a key issue and I don't have a way of judging what we ought to do in December without coming to some understanding about that   Thank you, Mr Chairman Let me start by saying that I agree with Mike's comment that the expansion at the national level has not run out of steam and that it will continue  As far as the Ninth District economy is concerned, it remains in pretty good shape, although the anecdotes this time around are perhaps a bit more mixed than they have been in a while, and I will comment on that Retailers, of course, express concern That goes with the territory to some extent I think the concern also reflects the fact that there are simply more of them, and they are getting smaller shares of a growing market That is part of what is going on here Certainly, some of the large auto dealers in our District point out that a shortage of sports utility vehicles in particular is restraining sales from what they otherwise would be I happened to be at a meeting with a variety of real estate and construction tycoons whose business is concentrated, but not exclusively, in the Twin Cities metropolitan area They were all smiles, because 1995 was a very good year for these people, though not a record year This included everything from single-family and multifamily developers on up through commercial construction, large-scale projects, and so forth They seem very comfortable with the outlook for 1996 I would say that they were confident that they were going to have another good year  As has been the case for quite some time, labor markets in the District are tight There are shortages of skilled and unskilled workers in various parts of the District As Tom Melzer mentioned for his District, I think the shortages are constraining expansion in some parts of our District That also has started to translate into more signs of wage pressures than formerly was the case It's by no means universal, but I did hear more about sizable wage increases recently than I had earlier The principal area of concern is in manufacturing Even those manufacturers who have had a pretty good year in 1995, and there is quite a number of them, say that orders have slowed, and they express some concern about 1996 I have a sense that inventories are higher in a large part of manufacturing than managers would like them to be They intend, of course, to pare those back, but that implies that the manufacturing sector could remain soggy for some time That seems to me to be the principal area of softness at the moment  I think Mike Prell's commentary about inflation and the risks on the up side is well taken But I wonder if there isn't an equally good case to suggest that maybe we are going to do better on inflation than the published forecasts suggest If I wanted to make that case, I would point to the following factors They are not additive; I will just throw them out as factors One is a number of consecutive years of modest growth in the money supply measures The second is my sense that productivity has done better than anticipated and probably better than measured in many cases This is something that may well continue Third, I think we are going to get a continuation of restrictive fiscal policy It may be back loaded and all of that, but I think it is still likely to occur Finally, I have a sense that more and more central banks around the world are committed to low inflation policies Ultimately, that matters So, I think one can  -18-    12/19/95  make a case that the inflation outlook based on those factors may be a bit more promising than we might otherwise expect   Thank you, Mr Chairman First of all, Don, let me say that I appreciate your effort here in looking at opportunistic versus deliberate strategies I found this very helpful I understand better what I meant! [Laughter]   Maybe I'm the only one Just to talk a minute about that, I do think the opportunistic approach is the one we ought to follow I say that because as I understand the evidence and given the quality of the evidence, and both may be flawed--that is, my understanding and the evidence [Laughter]--it doesn't suggest that there are big gains in taking inflation from 3 percent to 1 percent or something like that If that's true, we should not want to pay a very big cost to do that I think that comes out in favor of an opportunistic approach Having said that, it may surprise you to  -44-    12/19/95  learn that I favor no change in policy at this meeting As I commented earlier, while I believe that we may get a soggy quarter or two because of the inventory situation, there is nothing at the moment we are going to do about that with a policy change As I look out further into 1996 and 1997, I am hard pressed to see cumulative weakness in the economy I am hard pressed to see a significant problem that I can identify Yes, there can always be shocks; yes, I recognize that there are risks, but I think there is a good possibility that something like the Greenbook forecast will be realized Maybe real short-term interest rates are on the high side but I guess I am not entirely persuaded of that Even if they are, perhaps that will reveal itself in lower inflation rather than anything else So, at this juncture, I would favor "no change"   I think most of the relevant points have been made It seems to me that we can't have it both ways The issue is  -36-    1/30-31/96  what we want to communicate Do we want to set up ranges consistent with the baseline Greenbook forecast or do we want to set up ranges consistent with our long-run, low inflation objective? I prefer the latter, which is Alternative I It also seems to me that, putting Dave Lindsey's magic aside, any rigorous confidence interval around a model-based M2 or M3 forecast is going to be quite wide; it probably is going to encompass all of these ranges So, I don't see it as all that big a deal even statistically   Thank you, Mr Chairman I have some sympathy for Al Broaddus's suggestion It would be a small step toward helping us achieve our ultimate objective, which I view as maximizing living standards Price stability is the means that we have at our disposal to achieve that Having said that, I think Al's suggestion, like a lot of relatively provocative ideas, raises at least as many questions as it addresses For example, if we were to go down this path, what are the right numbers? Is this going to have any operational significance? If it does, don't we have to worry about instrument instability and maybe economic instability as we start to implement this? So, there are a lot of things we would have to think through in  -43-    1/30-31/96  a serious way if we are going to do something like this, at least for me to be comfortable with it  In terms of trade-offs and loss functions in some of those numbers that are in the Bluebook, I certainly don't take those numbers at face value, but I question how big the credibility effects may be I think the burden of proof is really on those of us who think that we can make further progress toward price stability without some short- term loss in the rate of economic growth I say that based on economic history I am not aware of periods in this country where we have made progress toward price stability without some episodes of subpar growth One could counter that by asserting that our credibility was relatively low That may be, but it seems to me the burden of proof, based on history, is still on those who want to argue that we can do this without some short-term loss of growth   I have a question for Dave Stockton relating to Chart 17 It concerns this issue about compensation and labor market tightness In the middle panel, you make an adjustment that, if I understand the red line correctly, raises the help-wanted advertising index I would think the implications of that are to deepen the mystery a bit The chart seems to be suggesting that, after the adjustment, help-wanted advertising was somewhat greater than it would have been measured otherwise, and that would seem to put more pressure on compensation than we got   I understood you to say the reverse   Okay   Right, thank you   Thank you, Mr Chairman The economy of the Ninth District remains fundamentally healthy, and some parts of the region are very strong Overall, growth has moderated and there are more crosscurrents than had been the case until recently One area of the District economy that continues to be relatively soft is manufacturing For example, the paper industry, which had been very strong, is showing signs of appreciably weakening prices And that seems likely to continue for some time, given the capacity in that industry which, if anything, is expanding Retail spending has been lackluster except for the consumer electronics area where sales are quite good On the more positive side, labor markets remain tight, but there are only scattered signs of more rapid increases in wages I would say that in general housing activity is good; housing around the District clearly is benefitting from the current level of interest rates  With regard to the national economy, I find myself in general agreement with the contours of the Greenbook forecast Because of the inventory situation, I think that the first quarter or perhaps the first half of this year will be on the soft side I have commented on that before, and I don't see anything that changes my assessment of that situation Once the economy gets through the inventory adjustment, I don't see any major obstacles to a resumption of growth at a rate in the neighborhood of potential Tom Melzer made an important point when he talked about staff expectations of future net gains in employment of about 100,000 or a little more per month The  -22-    1/30-31/96  reason I feel that is important is that if we get the projected employment increases, while they may be what we ought to expect, the press is going to play such gains as very disappointing as they did with the December employment report That may create misleading expectations that we ought to be careful of  With regard to the risks to the expansion, I think they include the export situation on the down side I am not persuaded that major foreign economies will live up to even our modest expectations for them It seems to me that more often than not in recent years we have been disappointed by their performance As far as the consumer is concerned, I don't see a vulnerability there that in and of itself is going to trigger a disappointing economic performance If we get some weakening there, it will be endogenous My reading of consumer incomes, debt burdens, asset distributions, and so forth, is that if some development does trigger a downturn, there probably is some vulnerability in the consumer sector that may add to the downside momentum, but I don't detect a lot of weakness coming from the consumer  On the up side, one can point to a couple of sectors The first is housing, which I think will benefit from low interest rates The other is investment in producers durable equipment; my impression is that such capital investment will turn in another healthy year in 1996 and perhaps in 1997 I noticed when I got to part II of the Greenbook that most of the fundamental determinants of PDE looked positive in historical context So, we may do a little better than the forecasts in a couple of sectors  As far as the inflation outlook is concerned, I don't think we will do much worse, and we may come out a little better, than the Greenbook forecast because of some dynamics that seem to be occurring which I don't quite understand When we look at traditional measures of capacity use and what they ought to mean for wage or price pressures, we just don't seem to be getting that translation in the good old-fashioned way I think that is actually a plus   Thank you, Mr Chairman The current situation gives me some considerable pause As I try to look at the real interest rate situation, Charts 4 and 5 in the "Financial Indicators" package don't suggest to me that real rates are particularly high, at least relative to history There may be an opportunity here, were we to do nothing, to do a bit better on inflation The mechanism that I have in mind would be through a stronger dollar than we now anticipate and what that would mean for inflation--recognizing, of course, that we can't really forecast exchange rates They are far more a hope than a certainty On the other side of this coin, I am certainly convinced that we cannot halt turning points in the economy, or at least I can't As I said before, I am pretty convinced that the current quarter and perhaps the next quarter will be rather soggy  -57-    1/30-31/96  based on inventory considerations and the time it will take to work through the inventory adjustments Moreover, something that looks soggy could turn out to be something worse The bottom line is that in this environment, and recognizing that I can't halt turning points, I find your insurance argument persuasive and I would go along with a 1/4 point reduction in the federal funds rate at this time   Thank you, Mr Chairman Our District economy has outperformed the national economy for a number of years, but I do not have the impression that that is continuing If anything, District growth certainly has been less than that of the national economy in recent months The principal areas of concern are the manufacturing and cattle industries All the cattle producers with whom I have talked describe their industry as an unmitigated disaster Having said that, I think the District economy in general is still fundamentally sound Part of the reason for the slowing growth is a factor that I have mentioned before, namely, labor supply constraints Labor markets remain very tight There are a few more, but still scattered, indications of increasing wage pressures and a somewhat more aggressive attitude on the part of labor In addition, I would say that consumer spending on both goods and houses has been healthy in the last couple of months  With regard to the national economy, as has been the case for some time, I remain generally comfortable with the contours of the Greenbook forecast I do think that the risks to the outlook may have shifted a bit recently, and I say this because as I look at the real side of the economy today, it strikes me as being in better shape than I had earlier expected it to be at this point Therefore, I think there is probably less risk of prolonged weakness or even prolonged stagnation on the real side By the same token, as I look at some of the potential indicators of rising inflation and in particular think about conditions in labor markets and labor attitudes, I sense that the risk of somewhat more inflation than at least I had earlier anticipated may also have increased   I, too, support your recommendation   This is an idea that we ought to pursue I don't know if Don's suggestion is optimal, but we have to start somewhere  -45-    5/21/96  I also think that we need to start with at least some structure In this case I don't think it's critical whether we use a 1998-type goal or push the goal out a little in time We have to start with some structure and some process because many of the questions that have been raised around the table have suggested, at least to me, that there are a lot of very difficult issues involved here While we might agree that we are all in favor of price stability, we need to get beyond that general notion and decide what price stability means and, practically speaking, how we should go about implementing it, over what timeframe, and so forth Those are difficult questions They will get even more difficult as we really start to contemplate them, and it seems to me that we ought to get our feet wet somehow What Don is proposing strikes me as a reasonable way to get started We will see what kind of issues surface; we will see what we learn from this; and we may see how we can address issues like an opportunistic versus deliberate approach to disinflation   Thank you Mike, one of the themes that came through in the Greenbook, and you alluded to it briefly today, is the deterioration in inflationary expectations You seem to think that inflationary expectations are going to rise, and I would like you to elaborate a little on that It seems to me that one could tell a story that a lot of what is happening here stems from one-time supply shocks, and it is not obvious to me how that translates into inflationary expectations So, I would like to know a little more about your thinking Do you have some sort of COLA mechanism in mind or exactly what?   So it is a sort of preservation of real wages story?   I gather that you think it's consistent with historical experience; we have had these kinds of shocks before   Thank you In the Ninth District, while there was some pause in growth earlier, activity has once again picked up Most of the news has been on the positive side, and I would say that the regional economy is now advancing more strongly than I, certainly, expected just a few months ago To give you a flavor of some of this, housing activity is strong and as best I can judge will remain so There is a lot of activity in major metropolitan areas and housing shortages in some parts of the District Manufacturing activity is strong and improving; state tax revenues have been running above expectations; and energy exploration activity has picked up Perhaps the one obvious sign of difficulty is in agriculture where some livestock producers are having severe problems and where grain producers say they may or may not harvest a crop Our problem is not drought; it is too much ice and too much moisture Farmers have been getting out into the fields late, among other problems  As far as wage increases and price pressures are concerned, I would say there has been no pronounced change, but there are scattered indications that labor is getting a little more aggressive and wage increases in some instances are turning out to be a little higher than we were hearing earlier On the price side, the anecdotal news does not indicate any pronounced change, but I sense that, if anything, there is perhaps a little more inflationary pressure than was the case just a few months ago  With respect to the national economy, I certainly agree that there are increased risks of more inflation than I expected earlier We are going to get more inflation than I anticipated It is difficult for me to assess the degree and duration of these risks It was not very many months ago that the concerns were focused more on the down side, appropriately in my view That was the case in late 1995 and early this year Those concerns have obviously diminished, and diminished rather quickly I can imagine that some of the upside concerns prevailing at the moment could diminish quickly as well, but my sense is that it would take a favorable combination of events for that to happen as quickly as it did earlier on the down side   As I think about the economy and how it is likely to perform from here, my suspicion is that housing still has some momentum that will carry it beyond the next quarter or two That would also be my judgment about capital spending As far as the consumer is concerned, I do not doubt the significance of the wealth effect, but we have had sustained gains in employment as well So, I don't think that what is going on in that sector is entirely a wealth effect That leads me not to be terribly concerned about the outlook for the real economy It looks satisfactory, or maybe even better than satisfactory, to me going forward Is this going to translate into the kind of inflation performance that is forecast in the Greenbook or something even worse? You have pointed out, Mr Chairman, that we do not fully understand what is going on there, whether it is job insecurity or other things I agree with that I think it may only be with the benefit of some considerable hindsight that we will understand that fully  From another perspective, if I look at real interest rates and the real federal funds rate and ask myself whether monetary policy is too stimulative or too restrictive or too whatever right now, my judgment is that it is not very far from where it ought to be I do not have a strong conviction as to which direction it may be off When I couple that consideration with what I believe about the real economy and what I think I know and do not know about inflation, that tells me that anything we do ought to be quite cautious I just do not have the sense that I know enough with enough confidence right now to come out strongly on one side or the other So, for this meeting I am prepared to stand pat But I must say that I am getting increasingly concerned about the inflation situation While we can always explain it away with special factors--grain prices or energy prices or whatever--it is always true that if we take out the most rapidly rising components we get something that we like better I think we have to be very careful about pursuing that very far   I prefer symmetry on philosophical grounds   Thank you, Mr Chairman I have a few random, hopefully not inconsistent, observations about all this For me, the issues that we have been discussing are largely empirical issues Janet knows the literature better than I do, and I certainly am willing to take her estimates If she believes there are net benefits in going to 2 percent, then that makes sense to me The only thing I would add to that is to go slowly to 2 percent   Right Go slowly to 2 percent, probably I would add that Bob Lucas currently has a paper that also estimates significant gains from bringing down the rate of inflation So, I would throw that into the thinking here I would not do this with the hope or expectation that we are going to get a lot of benefits from credibility, especially in the short run I just am not aware of any evidence of significant credibility effects I will not get into it right now, but I think what we are talking about is going to involve some challenging implementation issues Even capping the rate of inflation at 3 percent, while it sounds simple, may not turn out to be quite so simple at all In fact, we may be confronted with that issue before too long But what really concerns me about all this and why I am coming out where I am is that I want to avoid something that puts us back in the late 1970s and early 1980s kind of situation I would like to institutionalize our anti-inflation effort to a greater degree than we have been able to do up to this point because I think an increase in inflation could really be costly I would not be so  -56-    7/2-3/96  worried if it increased from 3 percent to 4 percent for a short period of time We really get into trouble it seems to me when inflation goes from 3 percent to 6 percent to 10 percent and higher I think we would benefit from institutionalizing something that would help strengthen the process to prevent such a rise from happening   Another big deal would seem to be, though, that if we want to calculate the real funds rate or something like that with a different price variable, we need a time series to put it in perspective It is not just how it has performed over the last couple of quarters, but where it stands relative to history   Exactly It seems to me that there is another issue we have to think a little about, and this is not a defense of the CPI My guess is that to the extent that labor contracts,  -65-    7/2-3/96  government pensions, and the like are actually indexed to something, they are indexed to the CPI or some variant of the CPI   I understand that, but there is still some of that around The social security cost-of-living measure still uses the CPI, I believe   No, I was not trying to defend the CPI I was trying to acknowledge that it has an institutional role It may not be as important as it once was, but it is still there It may have something to do with the estimates that Janet cited about what the Phillips curve is like if inflation is at a very low level because some of the institutions are tied into the CPI That is my point   I agree with those who think that the case for leaving the ranges unchanged at this point is a strong one I  -74-    7/2-3/96  certainly would welcome renewed usefulness of M2, but I do not think the evidence, while it may be encouraging, is sufficient yet As a consequence, I don't think we ought to raise its profile or prominence We are not getting any questions about growth around the top of the ranges, and there is something to be said for letting sleeping dogs lie   Mike, we recently had an auto industry consultant drop by the Bank He had a couple of things to say that I, at least, found interesting and I want to get your reaction to it First, he was quite sanguine about the outlook for light motor vehicle sales extending over a number of years; basically, he saw them continuing to run at 15 million units or so at an annual rate It was largely a replacement story that he was telling Having provided us with that, he also talked about what he perceives to be a great deal of excess productive capacity worldwide Even allowing for further sales growth    7/2-3/96  in Latin America and parts of Asia, his view is that there is a lot of excess capacity around I wondered if that was in fact right, because that would have some implications for the labor negotiations coming along later this year   Thank you, Mr Chairman The regional economy continues to do well Most sectors are healthy Construction in particular is strong, housing is very strong, and home prices are rising significantly Those conditions have prevailed for quite some time now, and I won't elaborate Exceptions to this generally favorable set of conditions are weather-related problems adversely affecting tourism and agriculture The cattle industry continues, of course, to have serious difficulties  I have commented on this before but I think it is worth mentioning again that labor is scarce in the District There seems to be a shortage, especially of entry-level workers, and we see signs of wage pressures at that level When we talk to some people about that, the attitude seems to be that, of course, the entry-level labor force is mostly young and inexperienced, very mobile These people are anxious to get some training but they do not care at all about the benefits that might go with the job So once they get the training or if they get an offer of somewhat higher earnings across the street or across the city, they will move on More experienced workers seem to be a good deal less mobile They put a higher value on benefits, and they are concerned about the obsolescence of their skills labor leader  At a meeting that he attended a couple of weeks ago, he was using a lot of language like "labor isn't very comfortable,"  -26-    7/2-3/96  "labor isn't very confident," and so on I did not have the sense that he was choosing his words that carefully just to influence us I think what he was saying is an accurate reflection of attitudes in a fairly well organized, fairly highly skilled labor force  As far as the national economy is concerned, my view of current conditions is that they are too good to last Relative to our expectations of late last year and early this year, the economy certainly has done better, perhaps considerably better, than individual Committee members expected The Greenbook forecast has aggregate demand slowing just perfectly to the trend growth of aggregate supply We achieve equilibrium and in some sense we ought to close up shop! My experience tells me that such a very smooth adjustment is highly unlikely and that may be putting the best face on it Things are unlikely to work out that favorably I do expect that aggregate demand will slow, but not so much and not so rapidly as in the Greenbook, in part because I think the expansion has a good deal of momentum right now and in part because I do not see any corroborating evidence at the moment that such slowing is in train This leads me to the conclusion that sooner or later the growth of the economy will strain capacity, and so I am concerned about prospective inflationary pressures   Thank you, Mr Chairman I think you focused the discussion appropriately on the underlying inflationary process and on the questions of what we know or do not know about it I certainly would admit that I do not know as much about it as I would like The world may indeed have changed, but even so, if I understood you  -91-    7/2-3/96  correctly, the change involves a transition having to do with concerns about job security and so on Some other things that strike me about the economic environment at the moment are that financial conditions seem to be what I would describe as generally permissive Credit is readily available on attractive terms Wealth effects stemming from the run-up in stock prices ought to be sizable I guess we have been cautious in terms of how we have built that into our model as have some other models as well It seems to me that bond market participants clearly are not convinced at this point that inflation is dead or even dying I think there is still a significant inflation premium in long-term interest rates Having said all that and having looked at the available information, my judgment is that the economy and its momentum are likely to be relatively strong My preference would be to raise the funds rate 1/4 percentage point now I view that in part as taking out a little insurance that the old model will reassert itself more quickly than we expect Certainly, a 1/4 point move is not going to trigger any tailspin in economic activity It also seems to me that under all the circumstances at the moment, such a move could be at least a start of a policy to bend inflation down a bit further, and it may be just the right thing to do   I have just a couple of comments I think swaps have outlived their usefulness My recollection is that one of the problems we have encountered with them is that foreign central banks have wanted to draw on their swap lines at times we did not think it was such a good idea I remember some balance sheet window-dressing on the part of a country whose name has already been mentioned a couple of times here That places us in a dilemma They come to us with the expectation that they are going to be able to make the drawing Do we want to say no, given that the facility is in place? It gets to be very difficult So, I would think that we ought to try to extricate ourselves, as gracefully as possible, over time from these arrangements  In terms of where we might go, I have some sympathy in the abstract for the flexible approach based on personal relations that Bill McDonough was talking about But this is politically sensitive stuff There is no escaping, it seems to me, that these arrangements and transactions are politically sensitive Where that leads me is to the view that we need some principles with regard to what we are prepared to do, under what circumstances, with whom, when, and so on It may be that, in extremis, we will need to interpret those principles flexibly, but I assume those situations would be rare   Do you have a date for that testimony?  Mr COYNE It's scheduled for Thursday, July 18   Mike, I agree with your characterization of the productivity data, but I think the business community would take sharp exception to it Everywhere I go they talk about the tremendous productivity improvements that they are achieving I must say that I am increasingly uncomfortable about our ability to reconcile the two sources of information I wonder if you have given that some further thought and have any new information?   Thank you   Thank you, Mr Chairman The District economy remains healthy I have been impressed most recently by strength in many of the natural resource industries Labor markets continue to be tight and if anything they have tightened a bit further They are so tight in fact that my kids have found jobs! [Laughter]  As far as the national economy is concerned, I read the situation much like the Greenbook Wage increases clearly are more rapid They are not offset currently by improvements in productivity, and I think increased price pressures are likely to result  I would like to comment briefly on an issue that has intrigued me recently, though I must admit it is something that is hard to quantify It is the use of personal credit cards by small businesses, by entrepreneurs, for business purposes There is no question that this is going on, and I strongly suspect that it is increasing in volume and breadth I say that because of the anecdotes  -22-    8/20/96  that I have been hearing; one just has to raise the subject to hear from almost anybody in the small-business arena how they use their credit cards for business purposes It is not surprising given the teaser rates that are available and the ease of credit card applications as opposed to applications for small-business loans at banks I think the consumer credit data are being affected by this phenomenon because the small-business people I talk to do not tend to pay this borrowing down; they tend to roll it over from one teaser rate to another and indeed to build up an increasing volume over time It does not mean that we ought to be sanguine about credit-quality issues Of course, that depends on whether we believe small businesses are more likely to repay this type of borrowing than consumers I do not have any convictions about that But I think it does mean that when we look at consumer credit data relative to something like disposable income, we may be getting a misreading of credit exposure because the denominator is not quite right What we want to include in the latter is business revenues, business income, or cash flow, or something like that I have discussed this with Don Kohn and I do not think we have much data on it, but it is something that we may want to bear in mind as we think about some of these credit versus income issues   No I really do not   No, not on the teaser rates These are 59, 69, 8 percent rates, and they are available without any effort Applications just show up in the mail   Thank you, Mr Chairman I believe that the risks to economic performance are on the high side in the sense that the stage is set for more wage and price inflation than is desirable and perhaps than market participants expect To be sure, the price data so far this year can be read favorably, but I know I am preaching to the converted in saying that we have to be forward-looking There has been a lot of discussion of productivity and, of course, productivity is important; it matters for a lot of things But the productivity performance notwithstanding, whether we have mismeasured it or not, we do know for sure that output growth so far this year is unsustainable because employment growth thus far this year has been roughly twice the sustainable growth of the labor force Initial claims data suggest that this may be continuing There are also signs that aggregate demand, in fact, is moderating But the evidence is preliminary on this score, and it is not at all clear that it will moderate to a degree that will significantly change the labor market conditions I just described Given the risks as I perceive them,  -39-    8/20/96  waiting to act might damage our credibility, and more importantly in my view, might well make it more difficult for us to contain inflationary pressures This could ultimately produce circumstances that would threaten the ongoing expansion of the economy Moving modestly toward restraint now would seem to entail relatively little risk to economic performance and moreover could start us down the road that over time would not just contain inflationary pressures but could set the stage for some reduction in them I would think that would be a prudent course of action and favorable for the long-term health of the economy   Thank you, Mr Chairman By almost all objective measures, the economy in the Ninth District remains very healthy Labor markets continue to be tight and, given the quality of new hires, businesses report spending increasing amounts on training new workers Our District is one of those where the local measures of housing activity would be consistent with the surprisingly positive national statistics Housing through most of the District has been better this year, whether we are talking about sales or new construction, than it was in both of the preceding two years and has continued to hold up as the year has progressed This also turned out, somewhat surprisingly, to be a satisfactory summer tourism season even though it got off to a slow start Despite these positive objective measures, business attitudes appear to be a bit on the cautious side at the moment based on our recent conversations I am not exactly sure about the source of this disconnect It may be that businessmen are in fact expecting the slowing that has been widely advertised for the second half, or it may be that they are influenced by their continuing inability to raise prices and the continuing virulence of competitive pressures  With regard to the national economy, I certainly agree with the spirit of the Greenbook forecast, so I will make only a few comments I think the economy is on solid footing It appears that demand is moderating, but it is uncertain if this moderation is sufficient to relieve pressures on resources in a meaningful way I share the concern that resource pressures will lead to a modest acceleration of inflation We went back and looked in a little more detail than usual at the experience of the mid-1960s and the late 1980s Those years involved long periods of labor market tightness that in our judgment were perhaps comparable to what we have been experiencing recently What we saw was that those periods were associated eventually with an acceleration of inflation Of course, what happened back then is not independent of the policies that were pursued, and we have to be careful about causality and all of that Nevertheless, the data suggest the risk that more inflation is in train and that it will emerge eventually   I agree that it is a close call At the broadest level, the performance of the economy has been favorable It has been characterized by growth at or above trend and by low inflation In recent months, it appears that the pace of the expansion and demand are slowing as anticipated and inflation has been quiescent If I stopped there, it might be easy Yet, I feel uncomfortable and I suspect that comes as no surprise The bottom line is that I feel uncomfortable because of what I perceive is going on with resource utilization, particularly in the labor market, and what I think history tells us about the implications of that sooner or later for inflationary pressures I would add that, should we get some acceleration of inflation, I believe that will bring with it some further disruptions and perhaps require a policy response that will jeopardize what has been a very favorable economic performance  Before I came in here today, I was thinking a bit about the institutional issues that the Vice Chairman raised But I have to say that I am not smart enough to know how things are going to play out on November 15 when the vote at this meeting is released The bottom line, at least for me and I do not mean to be a purist about this, is the integrity of the process here I continue to favor some policy tightening now, and I personally think a 1/4-point increase would be appropriate You may be right that it is going to take more, but in my view it pays to be humble about our ability to forecast with accuracy in these circumstances, given the lags in policy and the uncertainty about the magnitude of the effects of policy I conclude that a small response is appropriate at this juncture   As far as the District economy is concerned, there is little to report because the very healthy trends continue, as has been the case for a long time Labor markets remain very tight, and I have no doubt that there are outright labor shortages that are restraining activity and expansion in some parts of the District Anecdotes of wage pressure have increased and while we are hearing more about that, the pressure does not appear to be showing up in any of the broad measures of wages I am not in a position to reconcile the anecdotes in one direction and the data in the other Part of the explanation would appear to be a greater reliance on variable pay, which seems to be both larger and going deeper into organizations than we earlier thought But the evidence in support of that explanation still is very fragmentary at this point, and I would not put a lot of emphasis on it Whatever one might say about wages and wage pressures, business people remain adamant, as a number of people have already commented, that they cannot raise prices and that inflation is not something they are confronted with or that they contemplate  As far as the national economy is concerned, I would characterize developments in recent months as generally pleasant surprises Inflation has turned out to be less of a problem than I feared earlier, and demand does seem to be slowing along the lines that we anticipated I am not particularly worried about the third- quarter slowdown in consumer spending That story looks to me like the dog that does not bark or did not bark What I mean is that retailers are prone to complain and in fact do complain almost no matter how good things are The fact that I do not hear them complaining suggests to me that sales remain satisfactory  I clearly do not understand some of the dynamics in the labor market If we work our way through the data, there are some signs of an upward creep in the rate of wage increases But given that we probably have been underestimating the rate of growth of productivity, it may be that cost pressures have been offset to this point Having said that, we know that businesses are relying increasingly on less skilled, less experienced workers because they are the only ones available to fill vacancies, and we may be at the point where we are about to run through the good news as far as being able to offset somewhat higher wages with productivity improvements That is, we may start to see real increases in labor costs and the pressures that follow from that I do not know how much to make of that at this point because, as I said earlier, it seems to me that most of the surprises in recent months have been pleasant   Thank you, Mr Chairman As I commented earlier, recent developments have been favorable, and I believe there is something to Ed Boehne's observation that we ought to take the good news when we can get it However, it still seems to me that the principal risk that we face is that of more inflation than we have forecast I laid out my basic concerns having to do with taut labor markets, and we may be at the point where we are starting to run out of good news on productivity, if we can in fact accurately measure it or observe it But having said all that, I do think that the risk of a meaningful acceleration of inflation has in fact diminished It looks to me as if expectations of future inflation also have diminished among market participants, judging by what has been happening in the bond market If that is right, then for a given nominal short-term interest rate, a given funds rate, the real short- term interest rate is at least a bit higher today than it was earlier  In sum, I believe that at least for now the risk of an acceleration of inflation has been addressed, hopefully adequately, by higher real short-term interest rates, and I am prepared to support your recommendation   Thank you, Mr Chairman The Ninth District economy is still characterized by favorable business conditions almost throughout Perhaps the most noteworthy thing to report relates to a recent meeting that we had with about 30 business leaders The most striking thing they had to report is something I have commented on here but they certainly emphasized it, namely, how tight labor markets are and how difficult it is to find both skilled and unskilled workers This is translating into higher wages The wage pressures are by no means pervasive, but I think it is fair to say that larger wage increases are becoming more common The business leaders talked about new hires being increasingly expensive, both because of the skills or lack of skills they bring and because they are finding that at least in some cases they have to offer more generous benefit packages, especially to attract part-timers Those conditions have been in evidence for some time and I think they probably have intensified a bit  As far as the national economy is concerned, I am generally comfortable with the path of the Greenbook forecast I am hard pressed to think of something that would materially change that pattern going forward, at least through 1997 To be sure, there are risks that aggregate demand could either fall short or turn out to be somewhat stronger than envisioned in the forecast, but it is hard for me to assess those risks with any degree of confidence Without being very rigorous about this, the risk that I, at least, can identify most clearly is on the supply side With labor markets in the shape they are in and with what we are seeing in wages and are starting to hear about compensation more generally, there is clearly a risk that those pressures are going to build We need to keep our eye on the implications for inflation going forward, at least in the short term   I support your recommendation   I, too, support alternative I for the reasons that have been cited, and I do  not have anything to add there But let me comment a little on a couple of other issues  First, with regard to a more explicit inflation target that we would go public with, I  would tread very cautiously in that direction and not just because of the political risks that have  been identified I also see operational and economic risks What I am referring to is the risk of  announcing an objective that, of course, we would be obligated to try to achieve In my view,  which is supported by some work done at our Bank, that could result in serious instrument  instability and have adverse consequences for the real economy unless we are very careful about  how we spell out what we intend to do That suggests the need for a proposal that we have  thought through very carefully, and I have not seen such a proposal I do not believe we have  done the analysis that would be required  My second comment relates to the question of whether we can have more of these  kinds of discussions What I would suggest may not be quite as diplomatic as most of the  discussion around this table, but I believe that what turns out to be a rehash of the Beigebook at  the beginning of our economic discussions could be shortened or dispensed with so that we could  spend most of our time discussing what I would describe as more fundamental policy issues   Well, my suggestion would be that we not dispense with our District  reports altogether, but I think we could highlight things that are different or outliers   All right   Mike, a couple of technical things The principal surprise to me in the  fourth-quarter data was the employment cost index, and I know you looked into that My  question is whether you are satisfied with what you found out because there were a couple of  characteristics that looked a little out of line to me   My second question What is your estimate now for fourth-quarter  productivity? Is it up 1-1/2 to 2 percent or something like that?    2/4-5/97   2-1/2 percent?   Thank you I am hard pressed to report anything new with regard to the  Ninth District economy Overall, the economy is healthy, labor is in short supply, and the  weather is lousy even seasonally adjusted [Laughter] One interesting anecdote came from a  couple of business people who reported that they have postponed expansion plans because they  cannot hire laborers That implies, of course, that they have been unwilling to pay the higher  wages that presumably would enable them to hire those workers They have not articulated the  reasons why they have been unwilling to pay those wages I assume it has to do with their  estimates of the cost implications and what they think they can get in terms of pricing In any  event, a labor shortage clearly has been a factor for some time, and we have had some further  reports of that  As far as the national economy is concerned, I do think the growth of the real  economy will slow to trend in 1997 From my perspective, however, that is perhaps not as  favorable an outcome as it seems because my suspicion is that aggregate demand will continue to  rise more rapidly than trend I have what is essentially a supply-constrained forecast That is, I    2/4-5/97  do not think productivity will rise rapidly enough in 1997 to offset slower growth in the labor  force and employment If my assessment that demand will continue to increase more rapidly  than supply is correct, then the risks of more inflation clearly are there and will intensify   I agree with your recommendation Let me just take a moment to  elaborate In my view, circumstances have not changed significantly in recent months, so I  continue to think there is a reasonably high probability that we are going to want to adopt a more  restrictive policy over the course of 1997 But if I ask myself why now, I think we do not have a  reason that we can use that will garner any amount of support for acting at this juncture I then  ask myself the further question What are the consequences if your soon-to-become-famous  inflation dragon does start to nibble a little sooner than we expect and we find ourselves behind  the curve? It seems to me the implications of that are that either we would have to move a little  further at the end of the day than we otherwise would or maybe we would move by the same  amount but in a more concentrated period of time than otherwise Those costs do not seem to me  to be very great So, I am comfortable with your recommendation    2/4-5/97   Thank you, Mr Chairman Most measures of economic activity in  the Ninth District remain positive In particular, labor markets are still tight, and there are  widespread labor shortages But we are at the point that this is so familiar, so much a part of  the landscape, that people mentioned it only in passing Wage pressures are there but they    3/25/97  are scattered and by no means overwhelming With regard to other District developments,  construction activity is positive, the manufacturing sector is doing well, and state tax  revenues are running well above what had been anticipated A major potential negative is the  weather Widespread flooding is anticipated in the spring, but for better or for worse, the  snow and ice have not started to melt yet  As far as the national economy is concerned, I certainly agree with the significant  upward revisions in the Greenbook forecast, and I think, if anything, they may be  conservative My sense of the dynamics of the situation is that the economy will probably--  and will certainly without a change in policy--grow at the higher pace of the latest forecast or  maybe even faster I would point to a couple of factors My sense of the inventory situation  is that there is considerable room for some significant spending on inventories going forward  and that such spending will probably add significantly to aggregate demand  As I think about financial conditions and the broad range of variables that one  might throw into that bucket, it seems to me that financial conditions remain very  comfortable whether we look at interest rates, growth in the broad measures of money, equity  prices--even though they have waffled a bit recently--or credit availability in general As I  see it, we have financial conditions that are consistent with further substantial expansion in  demand  Finally, as far as inflation is concerned, I agree that a variety of temporary factors  has worked so far to restrain inflation to a pace that is certainly lower than I would have  expected at this point in the expansion I think that may continue for some time In  particular, I would point to the state of many of the other major industrial economies around  the world where there is considerable slack In my view, that has been an important factor in    3/25/97  what has been going on here But having said that, I would emphasize that the factors that  have been restraining inflation are certainly temporary and that the inflationary risks are  clear   I am generally comfortable with your recommendation, Mr  Chairman I do not want to dwell on too many nuances, but let me just make a couple of    3/25/97  additional comments Like President Broaddus, if I interpreted him correctly, I guess I am  somewhat less confident than you that we are not behind the curve My concern is that there  seems to be a lot of momentum to demand in the economy, and that momentum could  translate into rising inflationary pressures While I agree with your assessment that we  probably have been underestimating productivity growth for some time, I wonder how  widespread that mismeasurement is and what the prospects for productivity are going  forward Mike Prell's report on the dichotomy between the views of the banker and the  industrialist is perhaps a little indicative There is no doubt that the productivity increases  have been substantial in manufacturing, but people in the financial services industry at least  implicitly suggest that they have not achieved the same kind of gains I think that is one of  the reasons they have not quite bought into the "new era" story the way others have  Having said that, I think that when we make policy adjustments like this, it pays to  be cautious We are uncertain about the outlook; we are uncertain about the effectiveness of  policy; and because of those uncertainties, I think we ought to be cautious As I said, I am  comfortable with your recommendation   Thank you, Mr Chairman The economy in the Ninth District  remains healthy The expansion is continuing; it remains well balanced and broadly based  both geographically and by industry There are three or four developments of relatively  recent vintage that are worth commenting on First, there was a very severe flood in the Red  River Valley that runs between Minnesota and North Dakota and on into Canada This flood  has been very disruptive in that part of the world, but it probably will not have any broad    5/20/97  ramifications for the national economy or even for the District economy as a whole Of  course, part of its effect will be reversed because, while wealth has been destroyed, economic  activity tends to pick up as replacement activity occurs There also were significant losses in  some of the cattle herds around the District due to the severe winter this year, and that is a  double-edged phenomenon as well because, for those people who did not lose cattle, prices  have improved recently  At our recent directors' meeting and also at a meeting of our advisory council, a  couple of things of interest came up One is that we have further confirmation of the tautness  of the labor markets in the District If we look at the District data, as best we can get a  handle on them, employment gains over the past 12 months outpaced the increase in the labor  force by a significant amount Our directors and advisory council people are very explicit  about labor shortages and about very, very tight labor markets That is not new; it is just a  confirmation They also indicated, and I think it is fair to say, that there have been some  signs that wage and now price pressures are becoming a bit more generalized than formerly  was the case Business people are still very wary and talk a good deal about how competitive  the business environment is, how difficult it is to raise prices, and how cautious they are  about doing that At the same time, I think they will admit that price increases are perhaps  becoming more commonplace than was formerly the case in the District  With regard to the national economy, I will strike a couple of familiar themes I  am sympathetic with the general pattern of the Greenbook forecast and with Mike Prell's  description of where the risks lie That is, I think they lie in the direction of our possibly  getting a more rapid increase in aggregate demand than the Greenbook envisions, and that  will lead to greater price pressures In part, I feel that way because I am not entirely    5/20/97  persuaded that aggregate demand will slow as appreciably as is indicated in the Greenbook  There are a couple of reasons for that First, the increase in wealth over the past 2-1/2 years  or so has been enormous, and it seems to me that the implications for consumer spending are  quite straightforward It is just a question of degree Secondly, I have a sense that the  outlook for BFI is quite positive So, it seems to me that the risks, in terms of how demand is  likely to perform, are more on the high side We may continue to get some very favorable  developments on the supply side We all have spent a lot of time trying to analyze exactly  what is going on there and the extent to which that will continue I do not have a conviction,  but I would not place a large bet on favorable supply side developments continuing much  longer; at least, I would not make such a wager without very favorable odds   Thank you, Mr Chairman I have to admit that I feel a little like  Dr Watson to your Sherlock Holmes You wove together all these strands and reconciled  the various puzzles that I have been worried about Whatever else may be going on, we  know that as the period of economic growth has lengthened, gains in employment have  outpaced what would seem to be consistent with what demographic trends normally would  generate in terms of labor force growth and any reasonable long-term trend in participation  rates and hours worked So, I am still a little cautious about where we are and how the  economy is performing    5/20/97  I would add that I continue to agree with the basic concern that the risks here are  that demand will outpace supply and that we will experience a buildup of inflationary  pressures I do not feel that it is absolutely urgent that we act on that concern at this meeting  But having said that, I ran through the same chronology that Jerry Jordan referred to earlier  in the meeting and arrived at close to the same conclusion That is, I think that if we delay  action now, we may not find ourselves confronting circumstances where we are convinced  and confident of the need for a policy tightening move and have a persuasive explanation  until perhaps November Now, I do not know if waiting until November would turn out to be  a fatal error, but why find out? It does seem to me that circumstances today ought to  persuade us not to wait that long or run the risk of waiting that long So, I would certainly  prefer a modest tightening now   Let me make several brief observations In terms of the general  question of the overall value of low inflation, it seems to me that we actually have developed  some evidence If we think about the performance of the US economy in the 1960s, much of  the 1980s, and much of this decade, those have been periods of very favorable economic  performance and periods of relatively low inflation This does not prove causality, but if we step  away from the rigor that economists might want to apply and think of the general public, it seems    7/1-2/97  to me that we are in the process of developing some very practical evidence That does not get to  what I think is the tougher question--and I agree with Larry Meyer and Cathy Minehan on this--  of demonstrating that there is a significant payoff to reducing inflation further from, say, 3 or  2-1/2 percent I think that is a very significant challenge I don't think we have the evidence that  would convince skeptics that that is a sensible and sound thing to do  Finally, and I raise this only as a question, I wonder whether it is preferable to have a  basket of inflation measures as opposed to one measure This paper suggests that as long as we  pick a broad index, we are not in any danger of going significantly off course over an extended  period of time It seems to me that when we were working with the monetary aggregates, we  really were doing something a little different We were trying various combinations and  permutations of bank and other liabilities, knowingly changing the concept Here I think we  know the general concept and that it does not make a lot of difference empirically what specific  measure we choose   I, too, would support alternative I There are ways to improve this  aspect of the policy process, and I look forward to discussing them in future meetings   Thank you, Mr Chairman The Ninth District economy remains  remarkably healthy overall and rather than go into details about that now familiar story, let me  report on a breakfast meeting that we had last week with some 20 or 30 business and community  leaders from the Twin Cities They were representative, I think, of the Twin Cities economy,  although certainly not a perfect reflection of it Several themes came out of this breakfast One  is that the degree of tightness in our labor market cannot be overstated There were widespread  reports of great difficulty in finding workers, and some of these firms, of course, are employing  people District-wide and in some cases nationwide I think it was clear that this tightness is now  being reflected in wage and benefit increases, and that incentives like signing bonuses, retention  bonuses, early qualification for participation in 401(k) plans and so on are becoming increasingly  commonplace A second theme was the importance of international trade to many of these  businesses There were generally favorable comments about such trade The protectionist  sentiment that rears its head from time to time in the District was not evident There seemed to  be a general appreciation of what trade can do for an economy Certainly, most of these business  leaders feel and believe that globalization is a big issue, and it may be the single biggest factor in  their minds as to why it is difficult to raise prices in the current environment That is a summary  of what came out of that meeting  As far as the national economy is concerned, my view is generally positive in the  sense that I think real economic growth will continue at a satisfactory pace My own numbers  are not very different from those of the Greenbook, maybe a bit more optimistic as far as real  growth is concerned Where I become concerned is that if we believe the Greenbook forecast,  then it seems to me that an acceleration of inflation is increasingly likely at some point Our    7/1-2/97  forecasting model, which is a VAR model unencumbered by judgment, [laughter] produces the  same result In listening to the staff presentation on the outlook in conjunction with the  prospective inflation situation, I found two things particularly discouraging As I understood the  presentation, were it not for a projected decline in the markup of prices over unit labor costs, we  would get a more discernible increase in inflation So, in part the staff is banking on a factor that  to me seems by no means to be a foregone conclusion The second thing that I found  discouraging about the forecast is that after some analysis and thought, the staff concluded that  potential growth on the supply side is no more rapid than they thought earlier This means that  despite the business community's view that productivity is rising rapidly, there apparently is not  much evidence that that is the case   I think I agree with Tom Melzer's reservations   Yes   Thank you, Mr Chairman I too support your recommendation  essentially because I agree with you that we do not have a credible basis for tightening at this  point  Let me comment on your description of the situation in which we find ourselves I  agree with that description, but I am not sure that it is as much a departure from past experience  as you suggest The reason for my view is illustrated by a chart of the relationship between  unemployment and inflation going back over a long period of years This is perhaps not the most  rigorous way to go at it, but I find it a useful way to start the analysis Several things pop out as  we look at that chart First, the relationship between unemployment and inflation is nonlinear  Secondly, if there is a NAIRU, it bounces around a lot Thirdly, there is a variable lag between  when low unemployment is achieved and when inflation accelerates noticeably Because we  have had the benefit of analyzing this relationship over a number of years, we may find our view  of its history to be simpler today than it was earlier Now, there obviously are several caveats  about getting into the analysis in this way One, of course, is that the history of this relationship  was predicated on policy at the time, and I am not analyzing it with contemporaneous data and so  forth But I think the chart is instructive because it suggests that the kinds of discussions and the  kinds of uncertainty that we are facing today do not differ greatly from past experience    7/1-2/97  Where that leads me, at least tentatively, is that I think the risks remain in the direction of an  acceleration of inflation, and I worry that we may be ill prepared to address it properly   Mike, I understand that you are assuming a significant decline in equity  values next year How important is that to your view of how things are going to transpire?   Thank you, Mr Chairman Conditions in our District have not changed  much in years in the sense that the moderate and steady expansion that has been under way  continues Employment has continued to grow and there are some anecdotal indications that    8/19/97  employers are going to new extremes to find workers Construction activity is healthy, both  residential and commercial, and certainly the major contractors in our District, of whom there are a  decent number, are quite optimistic about the outlook Perhaps the only prominent soft spot in the  District is tourism, which is experiencing a disappointing season I don't have an explanation for  that It may be partially weather related, but that is the one sector that jumps out as a departure  from a generally healthy economy Wage and price pressures are generally absent People have  been commenting particularly favorably about nonlabor costs because they are not seeing increases  in input prices The one exception is in the health care area where we have had a very competitive  market for some time and have enjoyed small increases or even declines in costs People in the  health care industry have been suggesting with more force than usual that the favorable trend may  be over  As far as the national economy is concerned, my impression of the Greenbook forecast is  that it is very finely balanced It projects modest growth and what I would describe as relatively  low inflation In my view, it would not take much to tip the economy off that generally positive  course one way or another Abstracting from fluctuations in inventory investment over the next  quarter or two, my view is that we will see somewhat more growth in the real economy than the  Greenbook envisions and somewhat more inflation as well But whoever is right about that, it  seems to me that the risks in the outlook have not changed significantly in recent months; they  continue to lie on the side of greater inflation, given where we are cyclically Thank you   I agree   Thank you The Ninth District economy remains quite healthy, and I have  asked myself what has changed in our area that might provide a clue as to the future performance of  the national economy The short answer to that is "not much," but let me comment on a few  aspects of the situation in any event District agricultural conditions are mixed Livestock  producers find themselves in better shape than they expected and are having their best year in some  time On the other hand, producers of wheat and other small grains are finding themselves in even  worse shape than they anticipated, both in terms of the size of their crops and the prices they are  going to get As Mike Moskow commented, the paper industry is doing better and probably better  than it expected at this point in time The scramble for labor continues in the District and, if  anything, it has intensified I would say that there is more commentary among business people  about wage pressures than I was hearing a few months ago For the most part, that has not  translated into price pressures or price increases yet I have come across a couple of reports of  firms that, after not raising prices or at least not making price increases stick in recent years, have  done so recently, and it appears that those increases will stick So, there may be something going  on there, but I would say it is premature to conclude very much  As far as the national economy is concerned, given the momentum that appears to be  underlying what is going on, I have some sympathy for the changes to the Greenbook forecast We  are looking at more real growth and lower inflation, and that is sensible But it does strike me that  changes to the forecast could almost as easily have been made in the opposite direction on the  grounds that the unemployment rate has fallen more rapidly than we anticipated, capacity  utilization rates have risen, employment gains have been larger than can be sustained in the long  run, and all of that might lead us to believe that we are going to see more inflation and less growth  in the future, even in the relatively near future, than is envisioned in the Greenbook    9/30/97  However that may be, my concerns are heightened a bit by some analysis we have done  on what I would describe as proxies for imbalances Of course, these variables are not infallible,  but they all have moved into ranges where they are beginning to flash some warning signs In  particular, we have been looking at the quit rate, capacity utilization in manufacturing, and the term  structure spread Based on historical performance, all these indicators are now in ranges where we  might anticipate slower real growth and/or more inflation than in the Greenbook forecast some time  in the next 12 months Again, I would not want to make too much of that at this point, but for those  of us who still have some faith in the old time religion, I do think that there may be some warning  signs out there   Thank you, Mr Chairman I, too, accept your recommendation largely  because I think there is still sufficient uncertainty to warrant caution While it is tempting to take  the attitude that we ought to sit back and enjoy this economy, I see a danger in that The danger is  that we will wait too long before acting, as has occurred on occasion in the past We ought to  remain sensitive to that possibility, and that leads me to view November with a good deal of  interest   Peter, I have a couple of questions on the primary dealer situation Is it  your impression that the performance of some of the dealers has deteriorated over time?  Secondly, what do we know about the profitability of their current operations?    11/12/97   I assume that you get a sense of what is going on by talking to them   I will try to be concise As far as the District economy is concerned, I  can say the same thing that Mike Prell said about the national economy virtually all sectors are  strong Labor continues to be in very short supply I think there has been some upcreep in the  rate of wage increases, but it certainly has not been dramatic, and it does not seem to have  affected pricing as yet  Just a couple of other comments about the region Hotel occupancy rates in  Minneapolis are quite high We know first-hand that they are high not only currently but  prospectively as well We have been trying to book dates next year for director and other  meetings, and we are running into difficulty There are two new hotels under construction in  downtown Minneapolis and two or three major commercial office towers, so we clearly are  seeing some step-up in commercial construction activity in the largest metropolitan area of the  region The other comment I would make is that retail sales recently have been quite healthy,  and if traffic in the malls is any indicator, the holiday spending season looks promising  As far as the national economy is concerned, if I assume that the Greenbook has the  various repercussions of what has been happening in Southeast Asia and elsewhere about right,  then it seems to me that we face greater risks than are indicated in the Greenbook numbers Let  me explain what I mean by that I think the immediate risk is for more of an acceleration of  inflation than is projected in the Greenbook I say that because it seems to me that there is a  good deal of momentum to aggregate demand There are gathering cost pressures Labor is in    11/12/97 70  even more short supply than was the case earlier, and credit availability is ample But longer  term, I think the risks may be on the other side I say that because it seems to me that if we carry  out the policy envisioned in the Greenbook and we get the assumed decline in stock values and  associated negative wealth effects, the resulting sluggish growth in real GDP in 1999 and  perhaps beyond will occur according to the Greenbook forecast in an environment where the  saving rate stays at a quite low level I can imagine circumstances where that saving rate may  bounce up, if not in 1999 then certainly thereafter If so, it seems to me that the higher rate of  saving would add to the risks of an even more sluggish economic performance So, my sense of  the situation is that perhaps we are facing, both near term and longer term, greater risks than the  Greenbook numbers suggest   I, too, support your recommendation, Mr Chairman It seems to me  that financial markets are too sensitive at this point for an action on our part Having read  recently about some previous financial episodes in Southeast Asia and elsewhere, I also have a  suspicion that that circumstance may turn out to be a bit worse than we currently expect, with  implications both for financial markets and perhaps for somewhat greater spillovers to the real  economy  Having said that, though, if we were in more normal circumstances--and clearly we  are not--I think I would want to get started with a little more restraint today I say that because  as I assess the risks, as I discussed earlier, it seems to me that the value of some restraint today  would be that we would get a more favorable inflation performance than the one we are  otherwise risking and perhaps a smoother path for the economy as well   Thank you, Mr Chairman The District economy continues to grow at  a healthy pace as usual I will not dwell on much of that in detail; it is not an unfamiliar story  We recently had a couple of meetings with business leaders, and I would say the general  information gleaned at those meetings indicated no major surprises Business people are  uniformly positive about the 1998 outlook Construction is a particularly bright sector They  clearly expect economic growth to continue All in all, I would say the forecast is generally  favorable It is also clear now, at least in our region, that wage pressures have become pervasive  both geographically and by job and skill categories It is very, very hard to find workers, and    12/16/97 42  there are more reports of larger wage increases Some business people believe that they can  offset the higher wages with productivity improvements or other actions Some say that they  expect profit margins to be squeezed in 1998 and presumably beyond That was the general  thrust of the commentary at those meetings All in all, the District economy continues to  perform very nicely  As far as the national economy is concerned, my view is that the risks are on the  downside at this stage But in making that statement, I would not start with the current  Greenbook forecast If we compare that forecast with, say, that in the September Greenbook, we  do not have any tightening of policy in the current Greenbook in contrast to the staff assumption  in September While I certainly recognize that Asia and its repercussions represent a significant  shock that was not anticipated in September, we also have had more sustained aggregate demand  than was anticipated We now have tighter labor markets We have an economy that displays a  good deal of momentum So, if I were going to write down a baseline forecast based on all of  this, I would put in more real growth and more inflation than is in the Greenbook  Against that background, I think the risks are on the downside I say that because if  the Greenbook is right that there will be no appreciable acceleration in inflation, and if I am right  that wage pressures are now pervasive, which is pretty well baked in the cake, then it seems to  me that the implications or at least the risks for profit margins, stock prices, and ultimately real  activity are on the downside   Thank you, Mr Chairman I support your recommendation both in  terms of alternative B and a symmetric directive I do so principally because I believe there is  more than enough uncertainty to go around We do not know how severe the Asian problem is  going to be We do not know how far it is going to spread We really do not know what it  means for the United States in terms of quantifying it In light of all that, it seems to me that no  change in policy and a fair amount of flexibility are appropriate at this point   I'm afraid I am going to belabor this a little further The income  effect is one thing We discussed that and we may come out at slightly different places  about the importance of Southeast Asia or at least the countries affected so far and how  well integrated our economies may be Let me ask about the relative price effect and the  effect of the exchange rate appreciation Maybe you answered this and I missed it, but I  am struck by the sharp change in the international outlook, which was evident in the last  Greenbook as well as this one, and the fact, of course, that the dollar has been  appreciating since the spring of 1995 I guess that is the heart of my question I don't  have a sense of what is going on in your forecast   I am trying to say that it is not news that the dollar is higher   Thank you, Mr Chairman With regard to the District economy, it  is hard to imagine that conditions can get any better, with perhaps a few minor  exceptions I have described much of this to you in recent years, and I will not go over  this terrain again A particularly bright spot at the moment is construction activity It is  strong in much of the District and probably would be stronger if it weren't for the fact  that there is a labor shortage in the construction industry and some projects are not under  way or are going more slowly than planned as a consequence of that Another favorable  development is that there continues to be virtually no evidence of a broad-based  acceleration of inflation But having said that, wage pressures have continued to  intensify, and I would expect that to continue as we go forward It is perhaps also worth  noting that the unemployment rate in the Minneapolis/St Paul metropolitan area has now  dropped below 2 percent That is probably a record low, and it is also significant given  the Twin Cities' dominant position in the nonagricultural sector of the District Finally,    2/3-4/98  Asia is not yet a significant issue in the District, although clearly people in agriculture and  some other natural resource industries are, I guess it's fair to say, at least a bit concerned  about it  As far as the national economy is concerned, I certainly agree that there may be  even more than the usual amount of uncertainty about the outlook But, net, I am more  optimistic about real growth than the Greenbook, and I get there mainly because of  productivity considerations To some extent, based on statistical judgments but more  importantly on the anecdotes that we have heard over and over, I have become convinced  that productivity is on a more favorable trend and therefore capacity is as well I believe  aggregate demand will grow sufficiently to equal that capacity All in all, I am more  optimistic than the staff about the potential growth of the economy   I too favor alternative I The only thing I might add to our  discussion is that I think it is worth paying some attention to the aggregates, at least in the  long run   I agree with your recommendation as well I also want to endorse  the comments made by President Broaddus and Governor Meyer They were implicit in  some of Don Kohn's comments as well Now that inflation has come down a good deal, I  think it is important that we focus more specifically on what we view as our price  objective I say that not only because it may help us to communicate to the public what  we are trying to do, but I believe it will help the inner workings of the Committee over  time So, I would agree that we should spend some time on that issue in July   Thank you, Mr Chairman Let me start by commenting on three or  four characteristics of the District economy, some of which are by now familiar and some  perhaps less so I will then talk a little about the national economy  With regard to the District, nearly all sectors of the regional economy remain very  strong For example, District employment is up about 3-1/2 percent from early 1997 to early 1998  In Minnesota it is up over 4 percent What is really remarkable, if not startling, about those  numbers is where the new workers are coming from We do not exactly get Sunbelt immigration  rates in our District! [Laughter] It is a very impressive performance   I think part of the explanation is that people are taking second and even  third jobs I wasn't going to get into the anecdotal competition on this [Laughter] We do hear    3/31/98  stories about places like Mall of America that are sufficiently desperate that they will hire a  worker, if they can find one, who for whatever reason is willing to work only from 400 in the  afternoon until 800 in the evening three days a week These are people who obviously are doing  other things much of the time We hear that some of them may be in the process of taking their  third job  On the other hand, we are seeing something that we have not observed since probably  the mid-1980s I don't want to exaggerate this, but we see some indications that a two-tier  economy is developing where the urban areas are doing better than the rural areas The principal  problem in the rural areas is agriculture There it is partially a question of commodity prices--  and Asia may be having some effect--and partially a question of growing conditions, which right  now are not terribly favorable Having said that, there is always a problem with every  generalization, and the energy sector, which is of course rural, and the iron ore industry, which is  also rural, are both doing very well at the moment  The third and final regional characteristic I want to comment on relates to shortages I  will not comment further about the labor situation, but there is a related shortage of housing,  particularly in those rural areas where employment has gone up In the metropolitan areas, I  think housing construction has been sufficiently strong to more or less keep up with housing  demand There has been a shortage of office space, but that is in the process of being alleviated  and it probably will disappear in the next several years There are now five significant office  projects under way in downtown Minneapolis and at least two in downtown St Paul  Developers report uniformly that they have no problem finding financing  As far as the national economy is concerned, overall I must say conditions look very  good to me Real growth, both current and prospective, seems secure, and I believe inflation will    3/31/98  remain low at least for some time If I wanted to worry, I think I would worry about the  following things, especially in the context of the Greenbook forecast One is that the Greenbook  seems to have a very favorable nominal wage adjustment in the face of very tight labor market  conditions I worry a little about whether we really ought to expect that to happen I also worry  about the role of a stock price decline in that forecast I do not have a conviction about stock  prices, and I would not premise a forecast on it I guess, like Larry Promisel, I'm not quite as  negative as the Greenbook about the foreign trade situation, at least longer term I must admit  that growth in M2 is starting to concern me a little  In my view, the kicker here is productivity I don't want to get caught up in how we  measure productivity, but all of those adverse factors can be offset if productivity is on a  fundamentally more favorable trend Certainly, business people have asserted for a long time  that it is and they continue to do so They also continue to indicate that it is very hard to make  price increases stick Indeed, a more favorable underlying or fundamental trend of productivity  would help to rationalize stock prices I think I will stop there   1, too, support your recommendation, Mr Chairman, and I share Bill  Poole's concern about the timing of the release of the asymmetry We now release it at a point  when it does not do us any good, and I think the implication of that is what Ed Boehne was  talking about You can give a policy speech that elaborates on our current attitudes   Thank you, Mr Chairman The preponderance of the evidence that has  become available since our last meeting is generally consistent with the path that the District  economy has been on and also with the path that the national economy is currently on That is,  much of our regional economy remains sound and healthy Labor markets remain very tight  Wages are going up more rapidly than formerly, but not as rapidly as I might have expected given  the tight conditions in our regional labor markets Some of that wage restraint may be due to the  fact that there are more and more unconventional ways of compensating people that we may not be  picking up in our reports and part of it may be consistent with the thought in the Greenbook  forecast that people recognize that they are in fact better off in real terms The one exception to this  is in the natural resources industries and in agriculture in particular I commented at the last  meeting about the reemergence of a two-tier economy in our District--something that we saw in the  1980s--and it is reappearing, particularly among wheat producers and some livestock producers  who clearly are having a very difficult time A combination of wheat disease and reduced prices is  affecting output and incomes It is hard to convey the sense of despair that some of these producers  currently feel, but there will undoubtedly be further contraction in the number of producers in parts  of our agricultural economy The land is likely to remain in cultivation, but the trend is toward  fewer producers That, of course, is something that has been under way for decades in the District,  but it is now occurring in a period of accelerating economic activity  As far as the national economy is concerned, abstracting from short-term fluctuations  in inventory spending, I am convinced that aggregate demand will continue to grow at a fairly  healthy clip There is a wide variety of reasons for that One set of reasons has to do with financial  conditions, and they have been commented on Credit seems to be readily available The monetary    5/19/98  aggregates have been growing rapidly There are many implicit signs such as the number of  mergers and so forth that suggest there is not much monetary restraint In my view how things play  out will depend on what happens on the supply side There, I think productivity is a key Of  course, productivity is very difficult to forecast It might grow rapidly enough for supply to keep  pace with demand, and we could get a very favorable inflation outcome I would be inclined to  leave it at that were it not for what I take to be quite accommodative financial market conditions I  referred to a few things there My reading of real interest rates, as I look at the charts labeled  "Financial Indicators," is that while they are not low, they are not exceptionally high by any stretch  of the imagination If we think about how the interest-sensitive sectors of the economy have been  performing, we certainly would not conclude that real interest rates have exerted much of a  restraining influence One could always argue, I suppose, that those sectors would be growing even  more rapidly if real interest rates had not risen somewhat, and that probably is true But they  certainly have been doing well under current circumstances So, my concern is that we have a set  of financial conditions that is setting the stage for a rate of expansion of aggregate demand that is  going to exceed what supply is capable of accommodating   I come out much where you did, Mr Chairman I talked earlier about  what might be called the tension between the strength in aggregate demand and accommodative  financial conditions and what clearly has been rapid growth in aggregate supply The latter is    5/19/98  premised, I think, on favorable productivity conditions, and the question is whether that will or will  not continue If it does, of course, we could get a favorable resolution of all this Another possible  resolution is that productivity will fall short but businesses, because of competitive market  conditions, will not be able to pass along their cost increases and profit margins will get squeezed  That would lead to the long anticipated correction in equity values that would cool demand over  time So, that is another potential resolution I do not have a conviction as to how all this  ultimately is going to play out I think this is a case where there is, at least in my mind, so much  uncertainty that I conclude we should not do very much In that environment, I am comfortable  with your recommendation   I, too, thought this was a useful study, especially in terms of getting us  to think more concretely about our objectives We do have a lot of talent available within the  System We could spend time profitably with some further analysis and discussion of all of this  I did have a couple of reservations about the study at least with the way I interpreted  what we have here One is a point that Don Kohn touched on that I would emphasize It is that  if we think there are significant long-term benefits to low inflation in terms of productivity and  growth and so forth, then worrying about what we might do in terms of countercyclical policy  seems to be a second order question It almost has the flavor of saying that while we have a    6/30-7/1/98  distortionary tax in place we want to leave it in place right now even though it adversely affects  the economy because it gives us something to do if conditions turn bad I suspect that there is  some problem with that, and I would like to think this through more fully   Thank you, Mr Chairman I, too, favor what is being called the price  stability approach to these ranges, so alternative I is certainly fine with me It seems to me that  at the abstract level, there is a potential problem with going to something like alternative II That  is, if we allow for the normal lags between money and nominal GDP or money and inflation, we  might inadvertently set ourselves up for a situation where we would be prepared to tolerate or  accommodate or perhaps even produce more inflation than we wanted in the future as a  consequence of raising those ranges So, at the abstract level, I would not be comfortable with  that  At the practical level, if we were to raise the ranges, that might be seen as acceptable  in the unusual situation where we would explain that inflation had been low It is certainly our  perception that the public views inflation as being low But to say that inflation will be low and  therefore we are going to raise the money ranges just does not intuitively make any sense to me   I'm sorry, I didn't follow   I guess part of my view of this, Larry, is that I don't think we have the  ability to be all that precise in forecasting M2 or any of these other variables We just are not  that precise I am not troubled by two facts One fact that does not trouble me is that next year's  projection of 4 percent M2 growth is not right in the center of our range I would not be    6/30-7/1/98  astonished if M2 wound up growing 3 percent next year, say, as opposed to 4 percent But also  we have not had any trouble explaining those ranges to Congress in recent years I'm not even  sure the issue has come up in recent years, but we certainly haven't had any problem when it has  come up in explaining why money growth deviated from the ranges Congress seems to have  been fully satisfied with those explanations, at least as best I can read the situation   Thank you, Mr Chairman The regional economy continues to do very  well consumer spending is strong, construction activity is strong, and business attitudes are  generally upbeat The only exception to those favorable patterns is in the natural resource  industries--agriculture, energy, and paper--where conditions are clearly a good deal less  favorable and there are some concerns  Our labor markets remain very tight The unemployment rate in the Twin Cities  metropolitan area has now dropped to 17 percent This has led to some acceleration in the rate  of wage increases but it's spotty It's by no means generalized As a consequence of discussions  we have had with a variety of business and labor people, one development that seems to have  restrained at least overt wage increases is a greater emphasis on what people are calling  quality-of-life issues That is, labor is increasingly interested, at least in our area, in things like  more flexible hours, more flexible vacation time, relaxed dress codes, and so forth Employers  seem willing to trade those kinds of things for what we think of as traditional compensation  increases Whether those always lead to cost increases or not depends, of course, on what  happens to productivity There, we do not have very good statistics, although business people do  report what they consider to be very favorable results in terms of the application of technology  and their ability to raise productivity So, that seems to be ongoing, at least in our part of the  world  All this is hardly news at this point, but I do think productivity is one of the keys to the  economic outlook and will be a principal determinant of how the economy plays out I tend to    6/30-7/1/98  be relatively optimistic in that respect I think something like the Greenbook forecast is certainly  possible, although my own view is that we will get more real growth both this year and next than  in the Greenbook forecast I believe domestic aggregate demand will continue to expand  substantially I expect aggregate supply to benefit from the productivity improvement that we  are seeing, but I also think we probably will see more inflation next year than is anticipated in  the Greenbook My view is not based so much on a conviction that more inflation is inevitable  but simply on the notion that I would not want to bet the whole ranch at this point on sustained  productivity improvement above and beyond what the trend might be So, I am a little cautious  when it comes to that  As far as Asia is concerned, we obviously don't know how much of an adverse effect  developments there might ultimately have on the US economy Even if we did know, I think  we would have a good deal of difficulty unraveling the implications and ramifications for our  economy My own guesstimate is that we should not exaggerate the effects of Asia The reason  is, as we have seen repeatedly over the years, that our economy is very resilient We have seen  major domestic disruptions to various regions of our economy from time to time--I'm thinking  both of the East Coast and the West Coast--and yet overall activity continues to march ahead  rather nicely   Thank you, Mr Chairman I certainly share most of the concerns you  expressed and it seems to me, given the trends that I believe are in place and at the risk of some  oversimplification, that how things play out domestically largely depends on what productivity    6/30-7/1/98  does Some outcomes are going to be much more favorable than others depending on  productivity I don't have a strong conviction on what productivity might do over the next six  quarters, so I'm left to fall back on patience I think patience has served us well to date There is  a danger of overstaying that hand, but at the moment I am prepared to stick with it and I support  your recommendation   Thank you, Mr Chairman Let me start by saying what I am not in  favor of I am not in favor of releasing the tilt, the full directive, or the operating paragraph of  the directive I believe there probably is more noise than value in doing any of the above  Having said that, I do think that increased disclosure and increased communication have served  us well on balance over the years I do not conclude that we have somehow, or at least I'm not  entirely convinced that we have somehow, stumbled into optimality here [laughter] and are doing  just the right thing So, I am giving thought to what we can do incrementally, what I would  describe as another small step toward providing additional information  What I am attracted to, and I think this comes largely from the discussion we had a  meeting or two ago, would be a statement of our thinking after every meeting For the most part,  this statement would be retrospective rather than prospective, but it would help to explain why  we came out where we did not only in the cases where we changed policy but also where we did  not change policy As Don Kohn already has suggested, drafting something like that is probably  not going to be easy On the other hand, those of us at the Reserve Banks all have some  experience with that when we communicate the discount rate discussion and decision of our  boards to the Board of Governors So, I don't view that as an entirely impossible task I do  think it would be another small step toward improving communication My judgment is that it  would be received well in the marketplace and elsewhere and would help people understand  what we are thinking about, what we are concerned about, and some of the difficult tradeoffs that  Governor Rivlin referred to    6/30-7/1/98   You could well be right I suppose we could, if we wanted to, try it out  internally before deciding to go public with it to see after a meeting or two whether we could  craft a statement that people agreed with Presumably, you would want to have something in the  back of your mind before the meeting began, so you could proceed from there That is a way of  approaching it and seeing how difficult it might be   Thank you, Mr Chairman District economic conditions remain  positive, but they are perhaps a bit more mixed than they were formerly I previously have talked  a little about the emergence of a two-tiered economy in our District, and the gap between the  urban economy and the rural economy appears to be widening  On the positive side, consumer spending remains strong Real estate markets are  healthy Construction activity is buoyant Most recently, markets for rental apartments have    8/18/98  become very, very tight in the urban areas of the District Rents are moving up significantly  Construction will undoubtedly follow once labor becomes available Labor markets are tight  Just one anecdote on that issue The Minnesota State Fair, which is a major activity in our part of  the country as you might imagine, gets under way in about 10 days They are short about 600 or  700 temporary workers that they need to hire to open the Fair There is, I would say, widespread  upward pressure on compensation, and I think it is fair to say that labor is becoming more  militant, at least in our area  On the other hand, in the rural parts of the District the problems in agriculture are  serious, as Tom Hoenig just mentioned Mining activity is softening Energy exploration is  slowing Some executives from the paper industry told me recently that their industry is not doing  well They are talking a lot about the trade situation and the need in their judgment for a lower  dollar  As far as the national economy is concerned, I have talked before about what I perceive  as the tension between the pace at which domestic aggregate demand is growing versus the  growth in aggregate supply and how the two might ultimately be reconciled At the moment, it  looks as if the reconciliation is occurring through the serious and sustained weakness in Asia and  the squeeze on domestic profit margins, with their attendant effects on equity prices and  ultimately their wealth effects on the economy If those trends remain in place, I think the  Greenbook forecast is more likely to materialize than I thought formerly I also think that  however this plays out, the risks look to me to be very large The Greenbook forecast may be a  good central tendency, but the risks that I see on both sides are significant   Thank you, Mr Chairman I, too, favor alternative B and I also support  symmetry I almost always am in favor of symmetry It has the advantage in this case of being  appropriate [Laughter]   Thank you, Mr Chairman I certainly favor earlier release of the  minutes and clarifying the language with regard to the tilt or the lack thereof Like Bob Parry, I  have a mild preference for something like Option 2, but there doesn't seem to be a huge  difference between the two versions as I read them  I share Ed Boehne's reservations about the immediate release of the decision on the  tilt Historically, it seems to me that it has been a very noisy signal because we frequently have  had a tilt or changed the tilt and nothing followed That gives me some pause I'm not sure we  are going to have the intended results from that kind of release, at least at this point in time So,  I'm not in favor of immediate release at least for now, and I would prefer to hold off making a  decision   Another form of collateral!   Thank you Ted, I would like you to elaborate a little on Brazil and the  risks there because I have the sense that at least some in the international financial community  are trying to draw a line in the sand with regard to Brazil Yet, while you said you were  expecting the Brazilian real to depreciate, you are expecting that to proceed in an orderly way  Obviously, it is not hard to imagine something much worse happening   Yes    9/29/98   Thank you, Mr Chairman As far as the District economy is  concerned, general conditions remain favorable, although I think it's fair to say that the trends  are a little more mixed than was the case earlier in the year Attitudes have not changed  dramatically, but I do think there is a little more caution and a little more concern now than there    9/29/98  was earlier On the positive side, labor markets remain very tight The unemployment rate in the  state of Minnesota has dropped to a new record low, and this must be the third or fourth record  monthly low established this year Housing activity and nonresidential construction activity in  general remain strong Auto sales are healthy The weaknesses are in agriculture, where I think  the problems are well recognized and are quite severe in at least parts of the District, in parts of  the manufacturing economy, and in mining activity Trade issues, especially with Canada, have  become a matter of concern, and several of the governors in the District are taking actions at  least to show the flag with regard to trade  As far as the national economy is concerned, I started by assuming that the national  economy would grow at trend, which is not too different from the model forecast Then, I asked  myself where the risks lie Like others, I concluded that the risks at this juncture are mostly on  the downside relative to trend growth I don't know exactly how I would parcel that out on a  quarter-by-quarter basis, but that is what I concluded Having said that, I think we have to be  careful not to get carried away with the downside risks I am not at all sanguine, but I think it is  worth reminding ourselves that there has been a lot of discussion around this table in recent  months, indeed in recent years, that the equity markets have been overvalued The implication  was that those prices had to come down Indeed they have! In some sense, we are getting what  we expected or what we hoped I think there has been a similar discussion that quality spreads  were far too narrow They have now widened out Again, that seems to be something that we  expected would happen and hoped would happen in the context of a necessity for domestic  demand to slow to a pace more consistent with the growth of aggregate supply We were  concerned about the excessive availability of credit Those conditions seem to be changing  Again, that is something that we anticipated and to some extent hoped for In my view, what we  are seeing here to a great degree is developments that we either expected or hoped for, and while,    9/29/98  as I said, I think the risks are on the downside, I believe we should be careful not to lose sight of  the fact that these developments were anticipated, at least in part What I conclude from all this  is that it is very hard to see any inflationary momentum building in the current environment So,  I think we are in for further periods of modest inflation   I, too, support the recommendation for a 1/4 percentage point reduction  in the fed funds rate It seems to me that that is the prudent thing to do given the risks as I  perceive them I view such a policy adjustment mainly as on the margin of our effort to insulate  the domestic economy from the series of negative developments that has engulfed the world in  recent months  As far as symmetry and asymmetry are concerned, as I have commented before, I have  a long-standing preference for symmetry most of the time This is one of those times, mainly for  the reasons you cited, Mr Chairman I think events will determine what happens and I do not  feel that asymmetry buys us very much in this setting   I think Option 2 would be a distinct improvement and I favor that I  think dropping that sentence about "any potential changes" is probably a good idea because it  seems redundant to me, but I don't feel very strongly about it   Thank you, Mr Chairman As far as the Ninth District economy is  concerned, there has been no appreciable change in recent months Labor markets remain very  tight If anything, they have tightened further because we are getting the normal increase in  seasonal part-time demand for workers Consumer spending has been strong and that appears to  be continuing My unscientific survey of mall parking lots suggests that they are operating close    11/17/98  to capacity, or in some cases even beyond Construction remains strong Banks are seeing  strong loan demand in part, no doubt, because other investors and lenders have disengaged to  some extent My impression is that bankers are both willing and able to accommodate the  demand that they are seeing  Less favorably, conditions in both manufacturing and mining are mixed, depending on  their exposure internationally, and agriculture has problems of one degree or another throughout  much of the District largely as a consequence of both crises If you're looking for change in our  District, you have to look to the governor's office in Minnesota! [Laughter]  As far as the national economy is concerned, I would use the phrase "broadly  acceptable" to describe what is going on I am referring to recent developments and conditions  in the economy and the outlook, as I see it, for both economic growth and inflation I certainly  would say that recent trends in financial markets are broadly acceptable, and better than I might  have guessed a month ago, or certainly six or seven weeks ago No doubt part of this is due to  the policy changes we made, and there is now a danger of overreacting to the last six or seven  weeks of readings on these various things But taking a step back, all this reminds me of  something that I think we have known for a while, and that is that our economy is fundamentally  very resilient I believe that is what we are seeing   Mr Chairman, I have a mild preference for alternative B for two  reasons First, I consider the case for alternative A far from overwhelming Secondly, I think  there is something to be said at this stage for patience, not necessarily for patience's sake but  because the next meeting is only five weeks away and because we want to make sure that any  action we take will be consistent with our long-run objectives   I think the suggested approach is an excellent one It gives us the  opportunity to provide more information in a timely way when appropriate, and we can learn  from that experience   Thank you, Mr Chairman At the broadest level, the District economy  remains healthy There is very little question that it is continuing to expand But that  generalization applies principally to the major metropolitan areas where construction, both  residential and nonresidential, is strong and consumer spending is robust Labor markets remain    12/22/98 35  very tight and there are clear signs of wage pressures, especially for entry-level jobs where firms  have to bid up salaries in order to attract people  On the other hand, parts of the District that have been struggling for some time  continue to struggle Agriculture, and especially livestock, is one example of that; mining and  the energy sector are a second; and parts of the manufacturing economy are a third I would say  that in those sectors, if anything, the problems have become more significant and attitudes have  deteriorated a bit further Of course, most people and the bulk of the economic activities are in  the major metropolitan areas, so in trying to put this together one doesn't want to exaggerate  some of those out-state problems, as it were  As far as the national economy is concerned, two aspects of it have struck me for some  time One is its resilience If you think about the events that have buffeted the national economy  over the last 10 or more years and counterpose that with its performance, there is no question that  resilience has been a characteristic of this economy The other somewhat related aspect is that  while we clearly have had a lot of turmoil coming from abroad, principally in the last 18 months  or so, the economy seems on net to have weathered that well Of course, when you cut through it  all, those developments are not entirely negative either in terms of their implications for interest  rates and inflation or for the interest-sensitive sectors of our economy  I think the outlook for the economy in general is positive in terms of sustainable real  growth There are a couple of significant downside risks that people have commented on One  is the Brazilian situation and another is, at least in some people's judgment, an excessively  elevated equity price But I don't know what probabilities to attach to possible corrections in  those situations In fact, it is my view that we probably will get more real growth or at least  more growth in aggregate demand than is indicated in the Greenbook over the next year or two    12/22/98 36  Taken by itself that is certainly positive The question is what rate of inflation is likely to  accompany it So far at least, the surprises in the inflation numbers have been on the downside  and that is to the good And the weakness in commodity prices suggests that that may continue  On the other hand, I must say that the rapid growth in the monetary aggregates and  generally accommodative credit conditions do give me some pause They are a source of at least  some potential concern At a minimum we need to monitor that closely   I, too, support "B" symmetric   I prefer option 3 I think the last sentence on the monetary aggregates  should be retained I don't feel that strongly about the debate over "in coming months" versus  simply "during the intermeeting period" On balance, I'd keep the sentence the way it is and  leave it in   We can make some changes without changing the Act    Thank you The bottom panel of Chart 13 shows a set of   projections, one of which uses the capacity utilization equation I believe you   commented that recent history would seem to be a bit more consistent with this view of   the world That raises in my mind the fact that manufacturing capacity focuses on a   relatively narrow part of the economy Have you thought about other factors that this   measure might be picking up? Is it a proxy for something?  If you wanted to explain why   it seems to work, what explanation would you offer?    Thank you, Mr Chairman The economy of the Ninth District   remains strong outside of some parts of agriculture and mining But aside from that,     2/2-3/99 60   consumer spending is continuing to expand, construction is very strong, and labor   markets remain very tight The Twin Cities economy without question is booming, and   that is a term I do not use often As just one indication of that, the unemployment rate in   the Twin Cities metropolitan area is now about 1½ percent, which obviously means that   everybody who wants a job has one or probably several So that area is going along very   well There are wage pressures but selective ones They tend to be for some entry-level   positions, for some information technology professionals, and so forth, but they by no   means seem to be generalized When we ask business people whether they are seeing   inflation or deflation, the answer we get back most frequently is “neither”   The one thing that gives me real pause about the District economy--and it is a little   disconcerting--is that bankers still seem to be chasing deals very aggressively That is   my general sense from conversations with them and with some of their customers   As far as the national economy is concerned, let me say first that I was impressed   with both the number and the variety of the scenarios presented in the Greenbook, the   Bluebook, and in this afternoon’s presentation I believe they help us think about the   risks and about how we ultimately might want to be positioning monetary policy But an   equally intriguing question is the reasonableness, or the accuracy, of the baseline   forecast In that regard, I would say that I am a bit more optimistic about real growth in   1999 That is as a consequence of both the momentum behind aggregate demand as we   go into the year and also because I am more positive about productivity trends and,   therefore, the supply side So, I think we might see somewhat greater real growth than in   the Greenbook Another reason for being positive about the real outlook is that our VAR   forecasting model is quite positive It has been reasonably accurate in 1996, 1997, and   1998, so it is harder to dismiss the model forecast than it used to be since it is building up   a bit of a track record   I agree with the Greenbook’s view of a modest uptick in inflation mainly because   I think there will be some unwinding of the effects of the favorable shocks that we have   experienced in recent years But I must say the anecdotes about essentially no inflation   give me some pause as I think about that    I certainly support your recommendation, Mr Chairman Let me   make a few somewhat random, but hopefully not too random, comments First of all, I   enjoyed your analysis, especially the point about the importance of global capacity and   the arbitrage between the manufacturing and service sectors It is something I have been   trying to convince my staff of without a great deal of success to this point, and perhaps   you have aided in that effort   I must say I am a little puzzled by the fascination with NAIRU I thought work   done by Stock and Watson and others suggested that if there is a NAIRU, it lies   somewhere between 4 to 7 percent or some range like that, which is quite wide If that is   right, it is not a terribly useful concept for policy So, I have been reluctant for some time   to go down that path very aggressively   Let me also add a thought about wages and compensation At least as far as our   employees are concerned, and this is confirmed by the labor leader on our board as well,   the issue we hear most about is the scarcity of time What many employers are doing--I     2/2-3/99 113   know we are--is offering more flexibility in work hours to make it easier for people to do   the routine tasks of running a household and taking care of family obligations that   obviously take a lot of time My guess is that at the end of the day this is probably   productivity enhancing If it shows up in wages or compensation at all, it may not affect   unit labor costs adversely if it has a positive effect on productivity   I am a little suspicious about attributing a lot of the recent favorable inflation   performance to special factors Back in my youth when I was doing bottom-up   forecasting, one could always find special factors to explain virtually everything It   seems to me that this subdued inflation behavior has gone on long enough now that it   probably reflects a lot more than special factors  And I am struck by the fact that most, if   not all, of the major central banks around the world are committed to a low inflation   policy The fact that we are getting low inflation and some surprises on the downside is   perhaps not so surprising, if you get my drift That to me is the policy regime that we   probably have in the world today   The one thing that concerns me in the current situation is a communications issue   I have the perception that financial market participants and others feel that we cannot   change policy in either direction in the current circumstances and that we will not I   certainly don’t feel that we should any time soon, but I do think we should make an effort   to communicate that indeed we are prepared to change policy if and when it is   appropriate to do so As for what we might point to as a rationale for changing policy in   either direction, right now I don’t think there is any such rationale, which is why I came   out where you did But it seems to me that we would want to put people on notice that   indeed we are prepared to move under some circumstances We might want to call   people’s attention to money growth, exchange rates, nominal interest rates, the bond   market, and so forth, and say they have informational content and that we are going to be   paying attention to those variables among other things in assessing the appropriate stance   of policy going forward    Thank you, Mr Chairman With regard to the District   economy, overall conditions remain quite favorable and, if anything, activity has picked   up a bit Retail sales have been strong in recent months, manufacturing activity for the   most part has been positive, construction activity has certainly been healthy, and labor   markets of course have remained tight In the interest of balance, I should note that   agricultural and other natural resource industries are continuing to struggle Home sales   in the Twin Cities metropolitan area have slowed a bit, although realtors tell us that it is   due to a lack of supply rather than a lack of demand And bankers are expressing a little   concern about the credit quality of their commercial loan portfolios--or rather the other   guy’s commercial loan portfolio [Laughter]   As far as the national economy is concerned, I find myself in agreement with   the general pattern of the Greenbook forecast By that I mean that the current quarter is   turning out very well once again and that the moderation in real growth going forward,   certainly relative to last year and maybe to the last three years, is something with which I   agree--without getting into details about the precise magnitudes I also would expect, as   does the Greenbook, some modest acceleration of inflation   Having said that, my feeling is that the risks to the forecast, if anything, have   diminished recently Or maybe I was simply too pessimistic earlier On the upside, of   course, the concern is not the rate of real growth but the rate of inflation that might   accompany it And certainly in recent years I have been reducing my inflation forecast   with some frequency My sense is that many of the rest of us have been doing the same   thing, or have been reducing the level of the federal funds rate that goes with any   inflation forecast, or both     3/30/99 35   On the downside, I have been impressed at the lack of repercussions from   events in Brazil on the rest of Latin America and elsewhere in the world My feeling, for   what it’s worth, is that we are in a better situation than I anticipated and that the risks   going forward have diminished, if anything    I support your recommendation of “B” symmetric I will   elaborate very briefly by saying that if I were a betting man, given initial conditions, I   would bet that our next move is more likely to be an increase in the federal funds rate   than a decrease But I don’t have any conviction about its timing and I don’t see   anything significant to be gained by adopting an asymmetric directive now or by   becoming more aggressive now So I am comfortable with your recommendation I   would add, with regard to the actions we took last fall to reduce the funds rate, that   nothing I have seen in subsequent developments has led me to believe that things have   gone wrong in the wake of those actions So I see no reason to want to undo them at this   point    Thank you The District economy remains robust, which is not   a change in conditions That is true virtually across the board, whether one looks at   consumer spending, tourism activity, or manufacturing activity Construction is very   strong, both residential and commercial, and houses are selling as soon as they hit the   market The one obvious exception is agriculture, which remains in the doldrums   Despite the problems in that sector, I think it is worth remembering that they are not   nearly as severe as they were in the mid-1980s nor do they have the implications for the   banking system, at least at this point, that they had back then   I had a meeting recently with a range of representatives from the financial   services industry in the Twin Cities, and generally they confirmed this very positive view   of regional conditions as well as broader conditions There was a sense in their   conversations about the economy that is a bit different this time from past experience     5/18/99 37   One might expect that from some of the financial people, at least those who are close to   the equity market I think one reason they feel that way relates to the international   situation They see the US economy as being able to tap into capacity abroad, both   traditional manufacturing capacity as well as labor They also feel, of course, that the   United States is playing a particularly critical role at the moment in the global economy   As far as the national outlook is concerned, I believe the prospects for real   growth are favorable I don’t think there’s much question about that Aggregate demand   is strong and I am relatively optimistic about aggregate supply I agree that we have a lot   of problems in measuring productivity, much less forecasting it But I ask myself what I   think determines productivity If one approaches the analysis in that way, there is reason   to believe that productivity is on a more durable and positive trend And I think it is   worth bearing in mind that business people have been saying for quite some time--well   before it started to show up in the statistics--that they were getting sizable increases in   productivity   As far as inflation is concerned, that CPI number captured lots of attention, I   think justifiably It is worth reminding ourselves, though, that we have been anticipating   a modest acceleration of inflation In my judgment the problem with getting too   comfortable with that observation is that that modest acceleration may depend crucially   on monetary policy assumptions Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman I support your recommendation   The most important thing to me in all of this is that we make an announcement because I   believe it is very important at this stage that we give the public some sense of our   thinking in the current environment I would second Mike Kelley’s emphasis on   inserting some thoughts in that statement about longer-term trends as opposed to focusing   on the latest CPI number    I, too, agree with the recommendation, although I do think this   raises an interesting question, mostly for the longer term As a matter of logical   consistency, if we do become convinced at some point that trend productivity and   therefore trend output have accelerated, I think we are going to have to make an   adjustment But I don’t think this is the point    Karen, I would like to go back to the baseline forecast on the   bottom of Chart 12 that Tom Hoenig mentioned As I understand it, in those baseline   numbers you have the dollar depreciating mildly in real terms If I understood Peter’s   litany of things that might come back to haunt us--having to do especially with the euro   and the yen--they seem to imply that the euro and the yen might both depreciate relative   to the dollar once market perceptions change That is, the attitude right now may be that   the Japanese are succeeding in stabilizing the yen, but we don’t expect that to last If that   is right, these numbers would look even worse, presumably    No, I understand that That’s fine     6/29-30/99 31    Thank you, Mr Chairman The District economy continues to   perform very well Indicative of this, the unemployment rate in the Twin Cities   metropolitan area is now 16 percent Actually, it has been at that level for several   months, so I don’t believe it’s an aberration Estimates of the District unemployment rate   are harder to come by, but that rate is probably 3 percent or lower   Residential construction activity is very strong This probably will be a record   year for both homebuilding and sales in the Twin Cities area Commercial construction   is also strong Some of the national developers based in the Twin Cities tell us they are   seeing good business basically throughout the country Consumer spending remains   healthy, tourism is doing fine, and manufacturing for the most part is doing fine   Agriculture remains the blight on the landscape   As far as the national economy is concerned, not surprisingly our VAR model   remains quite optimistic My own view is similar I might briefly comment on where I   think the risks don’t lie I don’t think there is a risk of a precipitous slowing of domestic   aggregate demand; that seems very unlikely to me The risks abroad relative to what we   thought six months or more ago clearly have diminished; indeed, we’ve already talked   today both about better performance materializing abroad and forecasts for economies   abroad being marked up So I think in this environment we can concentrate on sustaining   the economic expansion by keeping inflation low    Thank you, Mr Chairman I, too, favor a ¼ point increase in the   fed funds rate I think it’s appropriate economically and the markets are prepared for it   As far as the question of symmetry is concerned, I am on this issue where I usually am,   which is that I have a deep-seated, built-in bias toward symmetry So, I feel that way this   time My preference is simply to assess the incoming information and act if action is   appropriate If we want to accompany that with some semi-hawkish language about how   we view the prospects, that’s fine with me But I must admit I’m not at all sure how the   market will take that or any other statement   It seems to me that it’s shorthand to say that the market is simply trying to   psychoanalyze the Fed and guess what’s going to happen next Another way of saying   that, along the lines Bill Poole talked about, is that they’re looking at the same   information we’re looking at and they’re trying to piece it together and understand what it   means for prospective economic performance, monetary policy actions, and so on   Maybe the effort to do that has become more intense But even if that’s true, this won’t   be the first time there has been a lot of intensity in that effort    The question is what they are going to charge their customers for this    Thank you, Mr Chairman Most of the major economic trends in our   District remain in place or have intensified recently Consumer spending is healthy   Housing and nonresidential construction activity are strong The manufacturing sector is   doing well; the agricultural sector is not Labor markets remain tight and I think it is fair to   say, at least based on the anecdotal evidence, that wage increases have notched up a bit I   would not say the same thing about inflation, although I do have the impression that   discounting has diminished, and that is the other side of the price coin I suppose   As far as the national economy is concerned, the outlook is good My principal   concern in the current circumstances has to do with aggregate supply and productivity I   think aggregate demand is growing at a satisfactory pace at least and is likely to continue to   do so We all know that we have very tight labor markets and it’s clear that the rate of     8/24/99 62   increase in compensation has been accelerating I believe there is a chance that it will   continue to do so This may all play out fine as long as aggregate supply and, in particular,   productivity grow rapidly enough to offset that acceleration and keep demand and supply in   balance The risk is that that won’t happen And if it doesn’t, the inflationary consequences   concern me    I favor both aspects of your recommendation, Mr Chairman--that is,   the increase in the federal funds rate objective and the symmetric directive I would add that   I will be mildly surprised if we don’t wind up deciding that we need to move the funds rate   up a bit further before too long But I think a symmetric directive permits us to do that, and   I’m comfortable with what you are proposing     8/24/99 82    Speaking of prospects for Japan, what is the current and prospective state of   play of policy in Japan these days, including their attitude toward intervention, either unilateral or   joint?    Thank you, Mr Chairman The major trends in the District economy remain   intact, which is to say that outside of the agricultural sector the District economy is very healthy   Consumer spending is strong; auto sales are particularly strong My casual observation, for what   it’s worth, is that one of the things going on in the automobile area is that an increasing number of   households now have more cars than drivers There seems to be specialization; people are buying   cars for particular purposes Some of that might be weather-related in our District; nevertheless,   that’s clearly occurring   Housing activity is also strong Home prices in the Twin Cities metropolitan area have   been rising significantly and home improvement activity is robust I suspect it’s limited only by   the availability of contractors because in any neighborhood I drive through I see evidence that   people are improving their homes by remodeling or adding to them   Employment growth in the District has slowed I think that’s basically because we’re   running out of workers Apropos that, the unemployment rate in the Twin Cities metro area has   dropped below 2 percent again, and there is a mid-sized city or two where the unemployment rates   are even lower than that The only other thing I would pass on about the District is that I expect to   see some deterioration in credit quality at the banks, which is partly related to agriculture, of   course But beyond that, in talking to bankers it seems to me that they are still chasing the   marginal customer And sooner or later I think that will come home to roost   My view of the national economy is similar to my view of the District in the sense that I   think the trends that have been in place for some time will continue It seemed likely that the     10/5/99 33   second-quarter slowdown in growth was an aberration and that turns out to be right Inflation has   remained modest As we all know, if we take a step back and think about the last several years, the   national economy has performed remarkably well We’ve had rapid growth and modest inflation,   which is quite consistent with what our VAR model was forecasting over that period of time If   this keeps up, I’m going to have to develop some confidence in that model! I would note that the   model continues to forecast essentially more of the same But I think the Greenbook raises the   right question Is inflation going to accelerate from here? Several people have commented, and I   agree, that it depends a lot on how productivity performs in the future I’m relatively optimistic   about that, but I’ll reserve the rest of my comments until later    Thank you, Mr Chairman I, too, favor alternative B Let me take just a few   seconds to say why First of all, as I said earlier this morning, I am relatively optimistic about   productivity, and that gives me some confidence going forward Secondly, that optimism assuages   some of my concerns about inflationary pressures I simply don’t think the case for a significant   acceleration of inflation is all that convincing at this point And thirdly, I do believe we have a   little time We have moved the funds rate up The markets, especially long-term markets, have   moved rates up even more I think we can wait to see what all that brings So, I favor “B”   On the symmetry versus asymmetry issue, normally I favor symmetry, and that’s true today   But it’s not a big deal to me If we go asymmetric, given the procedures we have set up, we have   to say something about it I would come out about as Ned Gramlich did Probably the least bad   alternative under these circumstances is just to publish it Also, I think the markets--or some   participants in the market--are probably expecting asymmetry Several people have commented   along those lines And it’s probably not a bad idea to remind people that the door is not closed as   far as the November meeting of the Committee is concerned    I really agree with Ed Boehne’s point, but I can’t resist! [Laughter]    So, let me make a couple of constructive suggestions One is with   regard to that reference to the pool of workers in the second paragraph I would just drop that   sentence Whether we’ve said it before or not, I don’t think really matters; I don’t know why   we’d want to raise it again My only other comment is on the next sentence, the first sentence of   the next paragraph I think there should be a way to qualify that phrase “appears likely” a bit so   that the markets don’t get carried away    With regard to the alternatives on symmetry or asymmetry, I strongly   favor alternative I as well for the reasons that the other advocates have cited With regard to   recommendation number nine and the Chairman’s authority, I’m in favor of something like what   is proposed here I’m willing to leave the decision on the exact language to others, but I   certainly favor something like that    Thank you The District economy remains healthy If anything, it has   improved even further because a couple of the sectors that were lagging--namely, iron ore   mining and oil exploration--have picked up recently, albeit in the case of oil exploration from a   relatively low base Otherwise, manufacturing is strong and construction activity is uniformly   strong Retail sales are robust and in general retailers are quite optimistic about the upcoming   holiday season Labor markets remain very tight But interestingly--and I have no explanation   for this--if you ask retailers about the availability of temporary part-time workers for the holiday   season they say it’s no problem finding them How they are managing that I don’t know, but   that’s the report   The exception to all of this is the same old exception, which is agriculture The   principal problem there, of course, is commodity prices There is no question that problems in   agriculture per se have spilled over to the rural economy more generally if one looks at   employment measures in the rural areas Those people don’t have any trouble finding jobs in the     11/16/99 32   cities, so they don’t remain unemployed for long But, of course, they do have the adjustment of   moving or commuting from the farm to the city   As far as the national economy is concerned, it seems to me that we are in a   circumstance where substantial real growth is assured and the question is what inflation will   accompany it What can we say about inflationary prospects? The Greenbook has what I, at   least, consider to be a major new look at productivity and comes out, I think, with a significantly   more positive picture And the Greenbook forecast now is in many respects a lot like our VAR   forecast One might think that the more favorable path of productivity, other things equal, would   lead to a diminution of concerns about prospective inflation and inflationary pressures But the   Greenbook basically has the same old song as far as inflation is concerned And I guess I have to   say that I’m just not entirely persuaded Our model has for some time been more sanguine about   the inflation outlook and it remains that way I think it’s very clear that a lot is happening on the   supply side of our economy, perhaps more than we know If we calculate productivity from the   income side rather than from the output side, we continue to come up with significantly more   favorable numbers So, if anything, my uncertainty about the inflationary outlook has increased   rather than diminished at this point    I can accept your recommendation, Mr Chairman Although I think   there is some chance that this action may be unnecessary, I doubt it will be harmful Let me just   reiterate my own uncertainty about what the appropriate model is in this environment It seems   to me that many of the conventional models that we’ve been looking at over the last several   years have simply been wrong on the critical issue of the acceleration of inflation I think we   need to bear that in mind   An alternative explanation, undoubtedly also oversimplified, is that what we’ve seen   in the last several years has been a series of positive supply shocks, presumably related to     11/16/99 53   productivity, that have given us more growth and less inflation than we otherwise would have   expected It was just a movement along the demand curve I don’t know whether this will   continue I’m not sure what the appropriate policy stance is in this environment I’ll go along   with the recommendation, but I think we are a bit at sea here    Thank you, Roger Let me comment first on the intermeeting   authority issue that Bill McDonough just mentioned I share Al Broaddus’ concerns and   perspectives on this, but I am persuaded when I look at this language that it is satisfactory I   think it does protect us adequately and I am not troubled by what has been proposed   With regard to the bias language, originally I was in favor of the recommendation in   the memo, Option 1 As I’ve thought about it some more, I have to say--and I realize this is   not the world’s most constructive observation--I’m not entirely happy with either option   The reason is that staying with something close to the asymmetry wording we have been   using does imply I think some presumption about a move at the next meeting, which history   suggests often has not materialized In Option 1, the option in the memo, I don’t think this     12/21/99 74   is necessarily a fatal flaw But my reservation is that we could find ourselves from time to   time in a somewhat awkward position of having changed policy but not changed where we   think the risks lie That is quite likely and in some cases appropriate But it may also raise   the question  If the Committee thinks that’s where the risks are, why didn’t we move more   aggressively?  Maybe that can be handled in subsequent statements or in other ways If I   had to vote, I would vote in favor of Option 1 But I must say I have some reservations   about both options    Thank you, Mr Chairman The District economy remains in good   shape and I will only comment on a few things that have changed relative to previous   discussions Agriculture, it turns out, has had a somewhat better year than many had feared   A lot of that is due to government payments But in addition crops turned out to be large,   which helped, and the cattle market has improved a bit Commercial construction has been   strong in the District for quite some time and a number of new office buildings will be   coming on stream in the Twin Cities market over the next one to three years It is now   anticipated that as a consequence vacancy rates will probably double or triple in the Twin   Cities But that really doesn’t seem to have caused any alarm  It is, I guess, the other side   of the coin when a lot of buildings are built in a short period of time  Employment gains in   the District have slowed; that appears to reflect mostly just a lack of unemployed workers   Labor markets remain very tight Wage gains start at 3 or 4 percent and go up from there;   but the distribution is skewed and most of the increases really are in the 3 to 4 percent range   But, of course, that leaves out all of the other extras that might go into compensation There   is still a general lack of broad inflationary pressures And overall I would say that most of   our contacts are quite positive about the economic outlook for the year ahead   As far as the national economy is concerned, I have a fair amount of conviction   about the outlook for economic expansion Our model forecast is for growth of 3½ to 4     12/21/99 33   percent in real terms over the next two years  That’s actually a little below the Greenbook   forecast but it seems to me that conditions are right for a continuation of pretty solid real   growth   I have a lot less conviction about the inflation outlook The Greenbook, of course,   has a story of accelerating inflation This is a familiar story and it has a certain logic to it   But the surprises to inflation over the last several years have been on the downside There is   a danger in extrapolating that kind of performance On the other hand, we have been trying   to do some serious statistical work on the unemployment/inflation/NAIRU relationship, and   it looks as if that relationship really deteriorates a lot beginning in the mid-1980s We are   skeptical that there is any real relationship between unemployment and inflation if one   concentrates on the period since about the mid-1980s Now, I wouldn’t bet the farm on this   work just yet We have more analysis to do But our work thus far does suggest that we   may want to look elsewhere for insights about inflation    I have a mild preference for the symmetric version I’ve been struck   in recent weeks by the fact that market participants seem to have been tracking right along   with us They have been interpreting the incoming data pretty much as we have I doubt   that anybody will be misled or surprised by the language of the symmetric directive and I   think they will continue to do what they have been doing And given that we do face   uncertainties associated with Y2K and have invested a lot in avoiding Y2K-related   disruptions, I don’t see any particular advantage to an asymmetric directive at this stage     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Well, I don’t have a lot to add  As many   people have already observed, we have discussed all of this before  In my own case, unlike in   previous discussions, I do think that today both arithmetically and substantively the case for   raising the ranges is pretty strong  But I don’t feel very strongly about it because I think there is   a communications challenge  Having said that, my guess is that the communications challenge   can be dealt with  I think market participants would get the message pretty directly if we used   the vehicles available to us  But that is just a guess or a judgment  I could be wrong about that,   so I don’t feel all that strongly about raising the ranges     Thank you  I have a question about the simulations as well, Mike  The   Greenbook shows a baseline simulation and a flat funds rate simulation  As I look at the   analysis, it seems to imply a sacrifice ratio of about one  In the Bluebook the sacrifice ratio is   much worse  I am trying to understand what causes the difference  Is it different assumptions   about credibility or about how expectations are formed?  I don't know what it is     Really?  But it involves a difference of  8 percentage point --a 1   difference in the unemployment rate and a 7 difference in the PCE price number     All right  Then let me ask about the Bluebook sacrifice ratio  I don’t   know what your credibility assumption is, but it seems really high     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The District economy remains very strong   and I won’t go into the details except to comment on a few things that have changed or are in the   process of changing in the District  There are five things that I want to mention briefly   First, on the banking side, bankers report that they are continuing to compete   aggressively for loans but--and the “but” is that they are tightening credit standards  And they   report that they are encountering examiners who are encouraging them to tighten credit   standards  Second, a glut of office space is coming  It may be a year or two or three off but, at   least in our District, I think it’s pretty well baked in the cake right now  Third, labor markets, of   course, remain tight but we are starting to see some upcreep in the rate of increase in wages and   the frequency with which wages are going up  Fourth, as far as inflation is concerned, we run a   survey annually and this year’s results versus last year’s results show a deterioration in the   inflation outlook  More respondents expect inflation of 3 percent or more this year than was   formerly the case and more firms report that they are planning to raise prices than was the case   last year  Whether those pricing plans reflect wishful thinking or whether these firms will make   their price increases stick, of course, remains to be seen  Finally--and this is the first time I’ve   heard this comment--developers, especially residential real estate developers, are expressing          67  concerns about interest rate levels and are starting to believe that the higher rates will affect their   business both this year and beyond   At the national level, my views really haven’t changed for quite some time  I think we   are well positioned for further significant growth in the real economy  Whether it will turn out to   be 3-1/2 percent or 4 percent or even more, I don’t know  But growth in that range looks to me   to be a pretty good bet  I’m much less confident about the outlook for inflation  We may see a   meaningful acceleration of inflation but I have to say, as I’ve said before, that I’m not entirely   persuaded that labor market indicators are good precursors of likely developments on the   inflation scene  And, of course, one of the reasons for that, though not the only reason, is that we   really can’t say very much about the outlook for productivity     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support your recommendation in its   entirety  It seems to me, given the kind of technology or productivity shock that we have had,   that real interest rates need to rise  To some extent, that has occurred  My judgment is that they   need to go up more  I do not see any way we can accomplish that other than by raising the funds   rate  So, a ¼ point increase is certainly acceptable to me  I would not go beyond that and be   more aggressive, principally for considerations of uncertainty  It seems to me that we are   uncertain about the future path of productivity and we are uncertain about NAIRU  I personally   am uncertain whether the latter is a useful concept at all  And we are uncertain about the   implications of the increase in real rates that has already occurred and what the effects may turn   out to be  So, I think what you are suggesting is what we ought to do       Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Ninth District's economy remains   healthy  Construction activity is strong as is consumer spending  We have a couple of auto   dealers on our two boards of directors and we asked them whether energy prices were affecting   auto sales  Their answer was not so far as they could tell; auto sales continue to be robust    Labor markets, of course, remain very tight  And there is a bit of an unusual inventory problem   developing; by that I mean that the problem is getting the inventory from the back room or the   basement to the shelves  In some retail stores, the shelves are only partially stocked, and   retailers tell us they just can't hire the staff to keep up with shelf stocking  A couple of our   directors have reported that they see signs that inflation is stirring  These are people who sit on a   variety of corporate boards, and they are bringing to us reports that input prices are going up and   also that to some extent those companies are starting to implement price increases on their own   that so far are sticking   As far as the national economy is concerned, I really don't think there is very much   new  I continue to believe that the expansion of aggregate demand is secure and that, therefore,   the outlook for real growth is positive  I continue to be relatively optimistic about future   productivity gains, but I don't have a conviction about whether that will lead to domestic   aggregate supply keeping pace with aggregate demand or not  In my view, what might be the   decisive factor here is financial conditions and how accommodative or restrictive they turn out to   be  We did ask several of our directors to check with their sources to see whether the higher   interest rates that have appeared in the marketplace over the past year or so have had any effect              - 62 -     on spending or on future investment plans or other such decisions  And in general the answers   we got back were “no, not to this point”     I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman, because virtually any   reasonable framework that I can think of implies that in current circumstances real interest rates   should go up     Mike, I have a question about the simulations  If you carried these   out to 2002 or 2003 and beyond--maybe you did or maybe you didn't--what would you get for   inflation?  I'm particularly interested in the baseline case and its flat funds rate scenario after   this year     What I am trying to get a handle on is how much more inflation we   ought to anticipate in another year or two in the baseline case and the flat funds rate  I   certainly believe you that the tighter policy may produce the kind of reaction you're talking   about  But in those other two scenarios--     Three percent?  Okay     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Ninth District economy remains   very strong for the most part and, if anything, we've seen an intensification of existing trends    Employment gains have been sizable  At the same time, people report that it has become even   harder to find prospective employees across the skills spectrum  Help wanted signs   proliferate virtually wherever one goes  Discretionary spending continues strong  The most   recent anecdote of this has to do with activity in the second home market in the resorts and   retirement areas in the District, which are clearly thriving  Existing homes tend to be selling      54  very rapidly throughout the District at rising prices, and inventories of homes for sale are low    We are also seeing some improvement in the natural resource industries, including mining and   agriculture   On the other side of the coin, I am hearing of some signs that construction financing   is getting harder to find for both residential and commercial construction  I take that to mean   that rates have gone up for those kinds of deals or that in some cases people are getting turned   away  And at least one of the large developers based in our District has indicated that his   company is taking a much more cautious stance now and is cutting back on activities in some   of the hot markets in which it has been operating around the country     There has also been some anxiety throughout the District about what might happen   at this meeting  That anxiety is hard to characterize  It ranges from people who are afraid we   will do too much to people who fear we will do too little  So, there is no telling where the   right button may be as far as that audience is concerned   At the national level, I think prospects for real economic growth continue to look   good  The incoming data suggest that to me; the Greenbook forecast suggests that; and our   own model forecast, which is a bit more conservative than the Greenbook, still has very   acceptable real growth  On the inflation outlook, I continue to be uncertain, perhaps even   more uncertain than usual  I, too, have been watching the incoming data and listening to talk   about pressures here and there  Obviously, taken at face value, those developments all raise   concerns  On the other hand, we have been doing some serious empirical work on that issue,   and that work suggests very modest increases in inflation from here on out  I will defer   further comments on that perhaps until later in the meeting      55  Finally, I think there is a chance that we may be seeing something significant going   on in the stock market  Dave Stockton commented on the flattening of the Wilshire 5000    Obviously, some of the air has gone out of the NASDAQ  That means the IPO market is a lot   less receptive than it was a couple of months ago, and that seems to me a potentially   significant development if it persists  I have no conviction about whether it will or won’t    Thank you      Thank you, Mr Chairman  I'm fully comfortable with your   recommendation in all its aspects and I share the thinking that real interest rates should be   going up from here  Let me just add one other thought, which is that I assume we will be   open-minded about where we are going to go next and at what pace  One reason I think we   want to maintain that stance is the point I alluded to earlier, namely my own uncertainty about   the inflation outlook  I'm not persuaded, especially with this action, that we're going to   confront a significant acceleration of inflation  I say that in part because we in Minneapolis   have been looking for the effects of labor market tightness and its correlation to future   inflation--not only in the last several years but we've taken this back empirically for quite   some time, and we can't find evidence since about 1984 that labor market variables make a   significant contribution to forecasting inflation  I'm not entirely sure what we ought to   conclude from that, but one thing we certainly ought to conclude is that we should be cautious   as we think about what has happened in the economy and its implications for the future     Thank you, Mr Chairman  As far as the Ninth District economy is   concerned, the objective measures of economic activity remain very positive  Let me just give   you one fairly familiar example of this  Over the past year employment gains have continued to   be substantial; and unemployment rates in virtually all District states are at the same levels or   lower than they were a year ago--and they were quite low a year ago  Furthermore, this has   occurred with some sizable gains in the labor force  Other objective measures, whether we look   at manufacturing, construction, or consumer spending, all remain quite positive  The anecdotal   evidence is a bit more mixed, I think, and the doubts or concerns are coming principally from   the business community  I would not characterize the consumers in this way, but a number of   business people I’ve talked to recently have expressed some concern about financial market   developments  They obviously know that interest rates are higher  They know the course that   policy has been on  They know that equity values have leveled off and in some cases declined    I think that has injected a note of caution into parts of the business community that I at least   didn’t detect a few months ago   As far as the national economy is concerned, it seems to me that the outlook for real   growth remains at least satisfactory  For what it’s worth, our VAR model predicts real growth   of 3-1/2 to 4 percent over the next several years which, if anything, is a bit below the   Greenbook forecast  We also calculate the probabilities of a recession with our VAR, and the   probabilities are all very low  So, its take on the “hard landing” scenario is the same as that   presented by Dave Stockton and Larry Slifman            59  As for the inflation outlook, I’m not sure that NAIRU is the right framework for   assessing that  I’ve been struggling with that concept and have been expressing some   reservations about it for some time  It certainly has not distinguished itself recently and I’m not   sure that it has distinguished itself much over the past 15 years or so  But I don’t have another   framework to offer at this point except to say that, presumably, what’s going to happen to   inflation over the next year or two is largely baked in the cake already, apart from whatever   further sharp gyrations we may see in energy prices or something like that  What will happen to   inflation over the next four to six quarters at least is largely baked in the cake and, though it   may not be popular to say this, beyond that it seems to me that the money supply ought to   matter increasingly  That may not have any unusual policy implications  That is, if one thinks   about what rate of monetary growth is appropriate with this kind of economic outlook, the   interest rate implications may be about the same as they are if one believes in the NAIRU   framework  But I haven’t worked out that exercise, so I suppose I have to leave that as a   question rather than a conclusion     I don't see any reason to deviate from the pattern!  [Laughter]  I   support the recommendation     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Sifting through the recent data and anecdotes   on the District economy suggests that it remains quite healthy but that some changes are occurring   beneath the surface  First of all, employment gains remain substantial  That is not a change  Labor   markets are very tight and there is some continued upward pressure on compensation  On the other   hand, our contacts say that significant price competition persists  Overall manufacturing activity is   strengthening, although some producers are expressing concerns about higher energy bills, and if   that persists, I think it is a factor that probably will affect output going forward  It appears that   consumer spending and residential construction activity have slowed a bit, but at this point those   adjustments appear to be modest in magnitude  In any event, nonresidential construction remains   quite strong   We have made some inquiries recently about productivity and its prospects because some   of our business contacts have expressed the view that the large gains--maybe the largest gains in   productivity--are now behind us  While some people adhere to that view, I would say that the   majority of our business contacts remain quite optimistic about the outlook for productivity and   believe that further large gains are in store  So, overall, we are hearing a pretty positive, optimistic   story in that regard   As for the nation, it looks to me as if the US economy is on a favorable course  I think   the outlook for real economic growth remains positive  As far as inflation is concerned, our VAR   model has no acceleration of inflation over the next four quarters; it has inflation running a bit below   2-1/2 percent at an annual rate  Obviously, there is a lot of uncertainty surrounding that kind of       44  forecast, but if it's more or less correct, it suggests that we at a minimum have some time before we   have to take further steps to address that issue  Thank you     I, too, support your recommendation, Mr Chairman, including the bias   toward concerns about heightened inflation going forward  As I indicated earlier, I do think we have   some additional time to assess that situation, and given current real interest rates I believe we are not   too far from where we need to be even over the longer run     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The economy of the Ninth District remains   healthy, but I think there are signs of moderating activity  On the positive side, labor markets   continue to be very tight  The agricultural sector is doing better than expected, mainly because crops   are turning out to be very large  The mining and energy sectors are expanding  And while the   picture in construction--both residential and nonresidential--is mixed, overall I think activity in that   sector has probably leveled off at a relatively high level  The major area of slowing appears to be in   consumer spending, and I’ll come back to that in a minute   As far as the nation is concerned, I think the outlook remains positive  Our projections are   for a continuation of significant real growth through 2002, although at a pace somewhat below the   Greenbook forecast  And we have inflation stabilizing, albeit at a bit higher rate than our former      61  forecast  What is new, at least to me, is what I’ve been hearing anecdotally from retailers and from   analysts who follow retailers  They are reporting a significant slowing in consumer spending or at   least disappointing sales over the last several months  Now, this information is anecdotal; it’s not a   scientific sample  There may be a lot of noise in it, but I don’t doubt the sincerity of the reports, in   the sense that retailers do seem to be greatly disappointed with what they have seen recently  And   this is from some fairly significant players in the retail sector  Thank you     I do, too!  [Laughter]     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Overall business conditions in the Ninth   District are generally consistent with what we've seen for several years now, although there are a   few changes on the margin  First, employment gains continue and labor markets remain very   tight  That's a familiar story  I think it's fair to say that the natural resource industries, including   agriculture, had a better year than was anticipated  In agriculture, that's due mainly to very large   crops and favorable weather conditions and so forth  But a couple of the taconite mines in   northern Minnesota, although they have been operating at capacity, have announced prospective   cutbacks in output and employment and, of course, have attributed that to foreign competition in   the steel industry               40      Construction activity probably has leveled off, but lots of major projects are under   way  I don't think we will see any change in resource utilization in that sector for some time   because of the large number of projects in the pipeline  And as I commented last time, it does   appear that consumer spending has slowed across a wide range of products and retailers, and that   trend has continued as well  We’ve picked up a lot of anecdotes about a slowdown in consumer   spending, certainly relative to expectations and relative to the performance earlier in the year   On a much more positive note, anecdotes from a variety of business contacts have   been very positive about prospective productivity gains  Of course, this is not a scientific   sample, but the people we've talked to recently seem very optimistic about their ability to extract   further large gains in productivity through the application of a wide range of technologies  So,   we may continue to see very favorable news on that front if that turns out to be an accurate   assessment   As far as the national economy is concerned, we're looking for real growth over the   next couple of years of about 3-1/2 percent  That will be accompanied, in our view at least, by   continued tight labor markets  I agree with those who have indicated that the incoming data at   the national level have clearly pointed to a slowing in the rate of economic growth  Presumably,   all that involves is an economy adjusting from growth in excess of 5 percent over the first half of   this year and something better than 4 percent in the three previous years to this more moderate   pace   On the inflation side, as others have commented, there has been an uptick in both   headline and core inflation  If energy prices cooperate, presumably headline inflation will be   more favorable next year, but I'm not as optimistic that core inflation will be  Thank you               41        Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support your recommendation    For some time I’ve believed that our policy is positioned about where it should be  That   continues to be my view  We obviously haven't had to take any action in the last several   months, and that's fine I would have trouble changing the balance of risk statement   because in my view not enough has changed in the past several weeks  I think we would   have a real problem explaining and justifying the basis for such a change  Some of our   discussion has been couched in terms of future growth of the economy below potential    Putting aside what we really know about potential with any confidence, obviously our   ability to forecast the economy reasonably accurately is limited  One thing we do know   is that the economy has tended to the very, very resilient in recent years  Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I would describe economic conditions in the   District as steady, but sentiment has changed recently and significantly so, as best I can judge    Clearly, people are becoming more cautious and more concerned about the outlook  I think financial   market developments have something to do with that, with the flight to quality in the debt markets   and the decline in equity values   As far as evidence on activity in the District is concerned, it's a mixed bag  Labor markets   remain tight and employment does continue to increase  Commercial construction is a distinct bright   spot--it's very strong--and home building has held up well  And, as I’ve commented before,   agricultural conditions turned out to be better this year than earlier anticipated, and farm incomes   and credit conditions were better as a consequence      47  On the less positive side, I would say that consumer spending has to be described as no   better than mediocre  Traffic in the malls and other places seems to be high, but spending doesn't   seem to be commensurate with the traffic  As for the auto industry, of course, auto dealers are   having a tough time  It's not hard to prompt them to use the word "fear"  Clearly, inventories of   new cars are high; we are also hearing that inventories of used cars are quite high as well   Higher energy prices have adversely affected some manufacturers, forcing them either to   curtail activity or in some cases to shut down because of profitability concerns  In general, I would   say that profit margins are being squeezed in a variety of businesses  Price pressures in the District   seem to be confined mostly to the services sector   As far as the national economy is concerned, I think Dave Stockton did a good job of   summarizing the current economic situation  Specifically, it seems to me that a slowing in real   growth has occurred more rapidly and with more severity than I had earlier anticipated  This may   turn out to be temporary, as both the Greenbook and our forecasting models suggest, especially if   one interprets the slowing as simply a reduction from the 5 to 6 percent range we experienced part of   last year and this year to something more like 2 or 3 percent  But I must admit I am not entirely   comfortable with that interpretation, partly because of what I perceive to be the breadth of the   slowing and partly because I remember painfully from my forecasting days that one doesn't   recognize excessive inventories and high inventory/sales ratios until after the fact  The imbalances   become evident after sales turn out to be more disappointing than expected  However that may be, it   seems to me that going forward inflation is likely to level off and perhaps even abate a bit over time    Thank you     I generally support your recommendation  Let me briefly make two other   comments  First, I do share some of Bob Parry’s concerns that a statement about risks weighted   toward economic weakness is going to raise the question of why didn't we act now  Hopefully, we   will have some language in the announcement that will at least give a sense of our reasons   Secondly, and this is a point I’ve made before, I think we soon ought to consider putting at   least one nail in the NAIRU coffin  Not only has the economy failed to perform according to that   framework in the last five or six years but, so far as I'm aware, going back 15 or 16 years there just is   no evidence of an empirical relation between labor market conditions and inflation     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I must admit that I’m still trying to   digest this material and our resulting discussion  But let me just state a few of my   thoughts and preferences at the moment   To me the most promising alternatives are the discount window alternatives,   particularly the ACF  A combination of practical and other considerations go into that   assessment  One is, if I understand the material, that it wouldn’t require legislation    Two, the infrastructure is already in place, although obviously it would have to be scaled   up and may have to become more sophisticated over time  But it’s not as if it would be   brand new  Third, it seems to me that we would still be leaving a lot of the initiative with   the private sector  Certainly with the ACF, we’d be setting the volumes with the auction     1/30-31/01 37  but the private sector would still have the option of choosing how else they wish to fund   themselves  And clearly we would not be getting involved with the ultimate borrowers    That would be up to the financial intermediaries to whom we were lending  So we would   be one step removed, it seems to me, from that taint of credit allocation although,   obviously, one might argue that we were favoring financial intermediaries of a particular   kind at the expense of some others, depending on who has access to the ACF    Nevertheless, I see a lot of promise there in addressing many of the issues that we   confront     I would also be relatively comfortable looking carefully at expanding the   collateral we would take on RPs  The final observation I would make is that as we start   considering a wider range of instruments in which we might operate over time--whether    RPs or assets for what we might think of as a more permanent part of the portfolio--I   would be very uncomfortable getting anywhere near equities  If we were to get into that   arena, that’s the place I would expect political pressures to arise  If equity markets were   not performing as somebody hoped, the “incentives” to lean on the Fed to do something   about it could become significant in my judgment  So I would prefer, if we start to   consider a wider range of instruments, that we not look that wide       Mr Chairman, at our Bank we’ve run a lot of regressions over   the years on these consumer sentiment surveys to see whether they’re leading indicators    It has been our experience that it’s very hard to get any predictive power out of them       Thank you, Mr Chairman  Overall, the District economy has   evolved recently largely as has the national economy, as best I can judge  Consumer   spending was lackluster both during the holiday season and since then, and sales   promotions and discounting have been intense  Employment gains have decreased and   labor market conditions appear to be a little less tight than they were earlier, although I   don’t want to exaggerate that  In the services sector today in our District it seems easier   to get a job than to get service!  [Laughter]  The manufacturing sector is clearly in   difficulty  The mining sector is weak and natural resources for the most part--outside of   the energy sector--are struggling  And anecdotes, mostly coming from our bankers,   suggest that higher energy prices are greatly stressing both households and businesses    The bankers expect delinquency rates to rise  They are seeing some plant shutdowns as a   consequence of the higher energy prices and seem to expect more of that       1/30-31/01 146  Not all is negative; there are a couple of regional bright spots  Maybe the most   obvious and distinct one is commercial construction activity, which is quite strong    Residential construction activity also has held up well      As far as the national economy is concerned, I’m in general agreement with   the contour of the Greenbook forecast  But I seriously doubt that we will avert a   recession  I say that for several reasons  One is my sense of the inventory situation  The   other is my experience with the type of consumer spending forecast in the Greenbook    As I look back over the data for the postwar period, we’ve seen consumer spending as   soft as depicted in the staff's outlook for the next four quarters only in recessionary   periods  Of course, consumer spending is only part of the economy and historical   patterns aren’t always repeated, but that pattern of consumption expenditures really raises   a flag in my mind  I recall that back in 1990 we at the Minneapolis Fed had prepared   internally a forecast with a very similar pattern of consumer spending--a type of pattern   we typically see in recessions, although we weren’t forecasting a recession  One of our   economists observed that if we got that path of consumer spending, we were going to get   a recession  He turned out to be right  So it seems to me that the probability of recession   at this point is uncomfortably high     I fully support the recommendation  Let me comment briefly  I   remarked yesterday that I thought the probability of recession was uncomfortably high      1/30-31/01 183  But what I would say even more strongly is that I recognize that I at least can’t forecast   turning points  And while I would like to base policy going forward on a forecast, I have   so little confidence in forecasting how the economy will perform over the next two, three,   or four quarters that I’m reluctant to do that  So, in trying to get another perspective on   policy, I’m thinking about real interest rates and the real federal funds rate  And it seems   to me that the funds rate does need to be lower at this stage, certainly by 50 basis points   at least  I think that’s the appropriate move now and I agree that a bias in the language   toward weakness is appropriate         Thank you, Mr Chairman  Sifting through the variety of   anecdotal reports we’ve been hearing on the region, it appears that our District economy   has performed about in line with what the national statistics have indicated for the   country, namely that growth has stabilized at a low rate  If we look at the District by   region, conditions are very mixed  The parts of the District that are doing well are   generally the metropolitan areas; the more rural areas that are dependent on natural   resources and manufacturing are struggling  If we look at the District by various sectors   of the economy, we see a similarly mixed picture, with some sectors doing quite nicely   and some having a difficult time  In general, one bright spot clearly is construction   activity, which remains healthy pretty much throughout the District  Another bright spot   is employment, with the continuation of tight labor markets  But those taut labor markets   are accompanied in some locations by reports of accelerated upward pressures on   compensation     3/20/01 49  At the national level, as I’ve already indicated, I have no disagreement with the   Greenbook’s estimate for growth in the current quarter  It appears likely to me that   growth will turn out to be around 1 percent plus or minus, very similar to rate in the   fourth quarter  That is, economic growth has stabilized at a low rate  Our model has the   economy gradually improving from here, quite similar to the general pattern in the   Greenbook forecast  I am concerned about the inventory correction process still ahead of   us, but presumably that is reflected in the Greenbook numbers  In addition, it seems to   me that significant risks stem from potential developments abroad  The list of foreign   economies that are facing difficulties of some kind seems disconcertingly long, and it   doesn’t seem likely to me that we will skate through all of those potential difficulties   without some reverberations     On the other hand, the US economy has proven quite resilient in the last 10 to   20 years  I think that is an important and fundamental characteristic, especially when   monetary policy has been providing support, which it seems likely to continue to do     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support your recommendation    I'm coming at this largely in the way Ned Gramlich described earlier  It seems to me that   the real federal funds rate should be moving lower, and a 50 basis point cut seems   appropriate  I don't know if that will turn out to be sufficient but I do think it will prove   to be constructive   I share your concerns about the potential of a false dawn here, though   obviously none of us can see the future very clearly  But another possibility--and perhaps   a better bet at least in my mind--is that rather than a V-shaped recovery we will get   initially just a very, very modest recovery  It may be similar to the type we had in the   early ’90s, when for a time there was a lot of concern about the fragility of the economy   and the sustainability of its performance     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The latest evidence and anecdotal   information suggest that the District’s economy is not terribly different from what we’ve been   hearing for some time, nor does it differ from the situation the national statistics have depicted    The picture is rather mixed  The manufacturing sector continues to contract  Labor market   conditions appear to be easing and, as one looks around the cities and the countryside, the   prevalence of help-wanted signs has clearly diminished  On the other hand, construction activity,   both residential and nonresidential, remains strong  If anything, it has probably picked up a bit   recently, with the announcement of another major project or two in the Twin Cities metropolitan   area  Consumer spending appears to be growing modestly  The agricultural sector also would be   described as mixed, depending on weather and, of course, on prices  In fact, it may be a little   better than I would have expected because we are hearing scattered reports of some pickup in   capital spending by producers; they are buying new equipment such as pickup trucks and so forth    And, of course, the energy sector has benefited from higher prices   As far as the nation is concerned, my view of the prospects for the national economy is   roughly similar to that of the Greenbook  I think the next couple of quarters will be slow as   business firms continue to work through the inventory correction process  After that, I would   expect a gradual improvement in the rate of growth but certainly no sharp acceleration, as best I   can judge the outlook at the moment  If this pattern materializes, I would expect the   unemployment rate to continue to move up gradually  And my view of the outlook for inflation is   that it could well stabilize, with consumer price inflation in the neighborhood of 2-1/2 percent and   the PCE a little below that       5/15/01     48   I think the risks at this stage are roughly equally balanced  I say that because I don’t   consider the outlook all that ebullient and it’s not difficult to imagine it being better than my   forecast  On the other hand, I do believe there is some risk that we may encounter more inflation   than I, at least, expect and hope for  In the short run, my concerns are focused on my reading of   the compensation and ECI data for the last couple of years  But in the longer run, it’s really going   to depend on what policies we pursue  Having said that, I’ll resist the temptation to say anything   further about policy until later     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I share many of the general sentiments that   Presidents Broaddus and Minehan expressed  In fact, I think I could go a bit further and make a   reasonable case for why we ought to pause today  But given the tide, I won’t belabor that issue    Nevertheless, a key issue for me is the lag question  It’s certainly well acknowledged that there is   a lag between our actions and their effects on the economy  At some point we’re going to have to   remind market participants, probably in a relatively forceful way, of those lags  And at some   point we’re going to have to take that pause, probably well before there is altogether convincing   evidence that the economy is stabilizing and improving  I think that day is, if not here, not all that   far away  As a consequence, I believe we need to be quite cautious at this stage    I'm interested in the following issue  It's my impression that we have   not seen this acceleration in trend or structural productivity in any other large industrial economy,   at least so far If that's true, I think that’s potentially important because that would suggest that   something unique is happening in the United States  I'm certainly inclined to believe that the   US economy is on a new and more favorable productivity track and I would become even more   convinced if I understood why other economies have not joined in that progress  So the question   is Have you looked at that issue and if so, what can you tell me about it?    Yes, I remember the conclusion and several of those conjectures as   well I guess my question really is  Subsequent to the publication of that article, do we know   anything more that we can say about it?    Yes, that's part of my explanation, too  But rather than rely on my own   intuition, I was hoping that we had some more hard and fast evidence of what either has or hasn't   been going on    Well, I hate to depart [laughter] from this general satisfaction, but I   would take out that reference to profitability and just say “declining business capital spending”    My guess is, given the trend in labor costs and so forth, that declining profitability may be with   us for a while I don't know why we’d want to single that out    Well, but there are some interesting issues involved, having to do with   profit share and labor share, and so on  You know, it may be that all we're seeing is a return to   more normality  I guess that is my thought    Well, I was going to raise it at our last meeting  [Laughter]    Well, I don't know  Is there a law that says once profitability is in here   it has to stay forever?    Okay, I will find that a compelling argument  But I would also hope   that at some point we can find an excuse to get it out of there    Maybe even before then    Thank you, Mr Chairman   I've commented for some time that the   District economy has been performing much like the national economy, and that continues to be   the case  The weakness and problems are concentrated in the manufacturing and mining sectors   where activity is clearly declining Labor market conditions are easing, although net job creation   remains positive  On the other hand, the construction sector, both residential and nonresidential,   is healthy Consumer spending has held up and tourism could probably be described as   mediocre--no better, no worse   The one thing that has changed is attitudes, which clearly have deteriorated according   to the anecdotal reports I’m receiving  I think they’ve deteriorated principally because of what   has happened in the labor market  The easing conditions in that market, the layoffs and job   losses both regionally and nationally, have captured a lot of attention and I think have convinced   a lot of participants in the economy that indeed the economy’s performance has stalled or perhaps   even worse     6/26-27/01 102   At the national level, my view isn't all that different from the view expressed in the   baseline forecast in the Greenbook I do think the inventory correction process still has some   considerable way to go, and as a consequence I expect the reacceleration in growth to occur a   little later and initially to be a bit more modest than in the Greenbook forecast  Nevertheless, I   am confident that a reacceleration will occur and that next year economic growth will be a good   deal better than it is going to turn out to be this year   I believe the risks at this stage are reasonably symmetric  Of course, it's possible that   the contraction in capital spending could be more severe than we currently expect or that   consumer spending could weaken as the unemployment rate rises  But it seems to me that   monetary policy has largely allowed for this already and, of course, we have fiscal stimulus in   train as well In any event, I think we need to bear in mind, as I’ve said before, the lags between   our actions and their effects as well as our responsibility to promote sustained economic progress   by keeping inflation and inflationary expectations low    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I guess the best way for me to put it is that I   do not disagree strongly with your recommendation  I am concerned that we’re making a little   too much of the incoming short-run data on the economy  Early in the year, as you know, there   was a debate about whether the economy was going to follow a “V” shaped versus a “U” shaped   pattern of reacceleration  I think what we've learned is that the “U” shaped proponents have   turned out to be correct, at least so far  And if we are honest, we have to admit that we don't   know how long the bottom of that “U” is going to last  As I said at the last meeting, some   patience is going to be called for along the way here, especially because the logic of our policy is   that we've been easing fairly aggressively because we think it matters  So we've got to give it   some chance to see whether in fact that's going to work or not  Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  As I’ve commented before, and it continues   to be the case, the District economy for the most part is moving in lockstep with the national   economy  The District’s economy has slowed further, I would judge, but the slowing hasn't been   sharp As for labor market conditions, reported job vacancies are still considerable but they are   shrinking, and meanwhile layoffs are increasing  The weakness is most visibly concentrated in   the manufacturing and mining sectors, and participants in those sectors are not expecting any   material improvement until sometime next year   Both housing and nonresidential construction activity in our District remain healthy   and positive at the moment, although I think the seeds of some slowing are clearly visible now    Vacancy rates in commercial space are rising  So while there is a lot of current activity, the   rising vacancies will weigh on prospects for future projects  And while homebuilding activity   and sales also remain healthy, at the upper end of the market the pace of sales is clearly slowing   As has been the case for several months now, consumer spending and tourism activity   are at best mediocre  One exception, where things are a little better, is apparel sales  Why that's   the case, I’ve been unable to determine  But people in that business seem to be pleasantly   surprised with the sales they've been experiencing   One of the two bright spots in the District is the energy sector which, of course, has   benefited from price changes  The other is agriculture, where--in parts of the District that have   not been plagued by drought--farmers clearly are going to get both good crops and better prices   than they had earlier expected And we are hearing some scattered reports about spending on   durable goods by producers in those sectors for which prospects are looking up   As far as the national economy is concerned, I don't know that I would use the term   glum, but I find myself in substantial agreement with the Greenbook forecast  I believe that real     8/21/01 27   improvement in the pace of economic activity is still some time off and I think the improvement   is likely to be anemic, at least initially, when it occurs  I'm hard pressed to identify any   significant positive surprises in the latest batch of macroeconomic data that we have received    And the international situation is worse than I had anticipated earlier both because growth abroad   seems more sluggish than I had expected and because the recent decline in the dollar raises at   least a yellow flag in my mind  I agree that it's too early to reach any firm conclusions about   what that might portend but it does suggest to me that we should be paying at least some   attention to developments on the international front   I've commented before and I think it's still the case that the inventory correction   process has a ways to go As best I can judge with the benefit of hindsight, we clearly had a   capital spending bubble that has now collapsed  And that's not something that monetary policy   is inherently well positioned to deal with     If I wanted to be a bit more positive--and I think there's something to this--there may   be reasons to believe that consumer spending will hold up as long as the rise in unemployment   from this point is not too drastic  In that regard, I take some comfort in what's going on in the   housing market  Sales of both new and existing homes have been quite healthy for a long period   of time and, after all, the purchase of a house is a long-term commitment that people are willing   to make  Now, this may involve some asset reallocation, and obviously interest rates are   favorable Nevertheless, the fact that people are willing to undertake those kinds of long-term   commitments at the pace that has prevailed in recent months is a development I view as positive   Finally, I am comfortable with the Greenbook's relatively favorable inflation outlook    But in my view, what we now know about both productivity and compensation suggests that the   profit outlook is clearly negative     8/21/01 28    Thank you My interpretation of the course of policy is consistent with   what Don Kohn said at the outset That is, as best I can judge the situation, we’re trying to prop   up components of aggregate demand that are interest-rate sensitive until the inventory correction   process runs it course and until conditions and attitudes change in a favorable way for capital   spending I don’t think that’s an unreasonable policy and it’s probably the best available policy    As I’ve indicated before, I’m concerned about the lags and what they mean for our   future course of action But let me add that I’m not opposed to a quarter point reduction in the   funds rate at this stage I won’t get into the lag issue at any great length except to say that I     8/21/01 73   believe we are going to have to change course and adopt at least a policy of stability before   there’s totally persuasive evidence that the economy is reaccelerating in a major way  I say that   not because I think we’re going to be reluctant to change course when it’s appropriate but   because of what I would call the recognition lag  It’s very unlikely that the evidence will   accumulate in such a way that it will be entirely convincing that it’s time to stop easing policy    My experience with these situations in the past is that the evidence comes in mixed for an   extended period of time, so we’re going to have to make the best judgment we can as that   happens In addition, if we think about the timing of the published data--the anecdotes, of   course, may help--we won’t know if the economy has rebounded until well after the fact  Let’s   suppose, just for illustrative purposes, that the economy really starts to reaccelerate in the first   quarter Well, we won’t get all that much data on the first quarter until well into the second   quarter and the data are unlikely to be convincing until well into the third quarter  So I’m   concerned about that recognition lag going forward    Well, I sincerely hope you’re right but the proof is in the pudding    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Let me start with a quick rundown   of what’s going on in the District economy  Much of this was in the written report we   submitted earlier, although I do have some updates  Production was largely unaffected   by the events of September 11th, and that is still the case today  On the other hand,   consumer spending in the first few days following the attacks was essentially stopped in   its tracks But reports from large retailers in the District suggest that sales bounced back   quite quickly Now, I’m not talking about big-ticket items  This is exclusive of autos   and homes and so forth  But activity at malls--at discount stores and even department   stores--came back rather quickly to normal levels  I guess it’s also fair to say that   restaurants in the District have been surprisingly busy, at least in the last couple of weeks    Housing activity, which had been sound, remains sound  But as I reported at the last   meeting, sales at the high end of the market certainly seemed to be slowing, and that     10/2/01 41   continues to be the case My sense is that there is growing caution in that area and I   would be surprised if next year’s housing activity in the District came anywhere close to   the pace of the last two or three years   For the most part, nonresidential construction activity has continued unabated    There was, of course, a major expansion of the airport under way and that project has   slowed if not been put on hold  I don’t think that situation will go on for too long unless   people are prepared just to let the project rust as it sits there  There have been a lot of   cancellations of prospective conventions September and October are very big   convention months in Minneapolis, so that matters a good deal  The hotels are running   with low occupancy rates and other travel-related businesses are similarly affected  The   airports that I’ve been in at least have been very quiet, although Northwest Airlines has   reported some improvement in future bookings  I’m not sure exactly what to make of   that, but the airline people seem somewhat surprised about what’s coming down the pike     Obviously, the business community is of the opinion in general that aggressive   action both on the fiscal side and on the monetary policy side is appropriate here  I don’t   have to go very far out the door to hear somebody in the business community offer that   opinion One other development is that in the wake of all this, we lost one medium-sized   brokerage firm that was involved in an ill-advised securities lending transaction   As far as the national economy is concerned, in thinking about the outlook and   in listening to the staff discussion, the key word here is obviously uncertainty  I happen   to think that the near-term outlook is for more weakness than projected in the Greenbook,   but I wouldn’t put too much stock in any forecast  As many people have already said,   we’re in an environment that we really don’t know a lot about  Normally, when     10/2/01 42   uncertainty goes up, that implies to me the need for policy caution so as to avoid   significant errors  But in the current situation we can be fairly certain--or at least I am of   the opinion--that the downside risks have magnified and that the inflation risks have   diminished  In any event though, I’m not sure that economic policy is going to be key to   the relatively near-term future  I think what we need is tranquility at home and success   abroad    I support your recommendation    I’ve been thinking about what we might see in some of the data that will be   published over the near term, in particular payroll employment and the impact of seasonal factors  I   assume, other things equal, that the seasonals anticipate an increase in employment in December and        11/6/01 25   probably in November, although I’m not sure, and then some runoff in the first part of next year  Is   that right?    Right So even if we don’t get further substantial employment reductions,   the seasonally adjusted numbers are likely to look fairly lousy    Okay, thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  As has been the case for some time, the District   economy is tracking closely with the national economy  There are some oases of strength but I don’t   think they are particularly representative, so I won’t spend a lot time on them     Overall labor market conditions have eased and layoffs and initial claims for   unemployment compensation are up  Office vacancy rates have begun to rise  That was certainly   anticipated Vacancy rates for other commercial properties are also rising and apartment vacancy   rates are increasing as well The expectation is that that will feed back on activity as projects   currently under construction wind down  It has been a very strong year for single-family   construction in the District but in that area, too, the outlook is less promising  Sales, especially at the   upper price end of the market, have slowed and I anticipate that the region will have a lot of trouble   next year duplicating the residential construction performance of the previous two or three years     There has been some tightening in credit conditions overall, but my impression from   talking to a variety of people is that decent quality credits can still be accommodated on reasonable   terms  So I don’t sense a huge amount of tension or a problem there     By way of a few more specific anecdotes, I talked to the leaders of a couple of national   retailers They described their business over the last four or five weeks as okay relative to reduced   expectations One cited same store sales as running about 1 percent ahead of a year ago; that’s   down, of course, from what typically had been the case  But retailers generally seemed to think that   things could have been worse, perhaps significantly worse  So that was their take on the situation   They also added that the discount business was doing better than the full service department store   business, which is not particularly a surprise   I talked to executives of a couple of large paper companies who also described their   business as okay relative, of course, to subdued expectations  That has been a business in which it     11/6/01 38   has been tough to make money for several years  Those executives were quite cautious about capital   spending going forward and didn’t put a lot of weight on whatever programs Congress might gin up,   but perhaps that view is specific to their industry  Finally, I talked to an official of a full service   financial services firm who said that their sales of a wide variety of investment products have been   quite robust recently   As far as the national economy is concerned, I’m in general agreement with the contours   of the Greenbook forecast I suspect that the contraction in the current quarter may be a bit deeper   than is projected in the Greenbook and it may take an extra quarter before we see a recovery   sometime next year  Those are pretty much guesses on my part  Talking to business people in the   community, their views are along the same lines  They expect business conditions to get worse   before they get better and that the recovery will occur later rather than sooner  But having said that,   we do know that the economy is very resilient even without the stimulus in place or in prospect    And, of course, we do have a lot of monetary stimulus in place and it appears to me that more fiscal   stimulus is likely  This resilience is something that I think we need to bear in mind  Its implication,   to me anyway, is that we want to calibrate policy very carefully from here on out so that we give   ourselves at least a chance of winding up in the right place for a sustainable period    I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman, although I think Don did   make good arguments for both of the alternatives he described  I am a bit concerned that if the tenor   of the economy doesn’t change until sometime in the spring, say, we’re going to run the risk of   either overdoing it or at some point having to disappoint market expectations  That risk may not be   huge in this environment; it is there nevertheless     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’m not sure I have a lot to add at this point, so   let me be brief  I’ve reported for a long time now that the District economy has been tracking the   national economy rather closely  As a generalization that still is the case, but let me make a few   comments about things that are a little different or new     Clearly, labor market conditions in the District have eased--that is not new--but the   unemployment rate has actually risen very little to this point And I would have to say, as best I can   judge from anecdotal reports, that holiday hiring was better than I had anticipated earlier  The major   retailers I’ve spoken with seem satisfied so far with holiday sales--relative to their subdued   expectations let me add  Nevertheless, they are not complaining inordinately about what they are   seeing The pattern in sales that has been evident for quite some time--with discounters doing better   than full service department stores and specialty apparel people somewhere in the middle--seems to be   continuing, based on same-store sales data and discussions with these retailers  The large retailers also   indicate that they have made no adjustments to their capital spending plans for the next year or so    History tells them that if they cut back, they will find that they’ve done it just as the economy starts to   improve and will wish they had proceeded with the additional stores  So, on those grounds, they   haven’t changed their capital spending plans     In conversations with some people from several large financial services firms, we hear that   their business with consumers remains very active both in terms of demands for credit and sales of   financial instruments, though demands from the business side are slow  And finally, while     12/11/01 48    commercial construction activity is slowing in the District, housing activity as measured either by   construction or sales continues to be reasonably robust  It certainly has held up longer and better than   I would have expected by this stage   As far as the national economy is concerned, I’m more confident than I have been for some   time that something like the Greenbook forecast will materialize  The basic story as I see it is that the   strength in consumer spending is restraining the weakness this quarter  There will be some payback   for that next quarter but then a more sustained improvement will get under way  The latest data   indicate to me that, if nothing else, the economy is clearly in a process of stabilizing  It is not falling   off a cliff And as I said, I find the Greenbook story reasonably convincing, although I would   certainly not be astonished if it took another quarter or so for the recovery to get under way  I think   timing is always a matter of considerable uncertainty     As I’ve commented before, housing activity is a measure we might consider in thinking   about the mindset of the consumer  After all, the purchase of a house is a long-term commitment    When people are willing to buy a new home, that involves a 15- or 30-year commitment, even   allowing for sales and refinancings and so forth  And the housing activity numbers continue to   suggest to me that consumer confidence remains reasonably healthy      I would also note that whenever economic activity starts to pick up, it’s likely to take us   some time to recognize that upturn unless all series turn positive at once  My experience is that that   rarely, if ever, happens So even if the economy starts to improve in the second quarter my guess is   we won’t recognize that with much confidence until the third or the fourth quarter  I would think, by   the way, that the unemployment rate is going to continue to go up for some time  That seems to me to   be almost baked in the cake     Finally, I will restrain myself and not discuss policy preferences at the moment     12/11/01 49     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I would prefer to leave policy unchanged today    Let me quickly sketch out the elements of my reasoning  Part of it I touched on earlier  I do think that   the story in the mainstream Greenbook forecast is a reasonably convincing one and I’m certainly more   confident about the outlook than I have been for the past several meetings  Is it a done deal?  Of   course not, but that I think is too high a bar We’re not going to know that for quite some time  It   does seem to me that the recent spate of data suggests that the economy is stabilizing  Not only do the   data suggest that but a lot of market participants are expecting that, based on the way financial assets   are being priced And at least in my view our economy has a history of being resilient and largely   self-correcting Beyond that, I think policy has been very expansionary  I’m not talking just about   aggressive reductions in interest rates, although we have done that  We have also had very rapid   growth in the monetary aggregates and it would be a shock to me if we got deflation, given the kind of   growth we've had in money for some time now  I don’t know how fiscal policy will play out, but I   would guess that we will get some added fiscal stimulus  And while it’s certainly true that if this   further reduction in rates turns out to be a mistake we can reverse direction when needed, it’s possibly   destabilizing--though I don’t want to overstate this--to embark on that kind of policy path  So for that   combination of reasons, recognizing that perhaps no one of them is convincing by itself, I would   prefer to stay where we are    Second    I have a couple of comments by way of expressing some reservations or   uncertainties When I first looked at Marvin’s work, I was reassured  It seemed as if there was a                                                                January 29-30, 2002 Page 43 of 194  long list of options we might try and sort of roll on our own  But quantitatively I don’t know the   significance of any of this, and I don’t know if there are any estimates around  I suppose not,   given the circumstances  So I guess I’m less reassured than I was earlier   However, my major point is that the other paper seems to suggest that one way to avoid   trouble is not to set the inflation target too low  Of course, if we phrase it that way, that makes   good sense But if I think about it a little more intuitively, I’m not quite sure I buy that  There is   respectable literature that says optimal policy should aim for low interest rates and low inflation    I admit that, at least in my world, the economy is largely self-correcting  I also agree with the   comments that we can’t learn much from looking at Japan  And what I think we can learn from   looking at the major depression in our own country is that a series of policy mistakes were made,   and if we avoid those mistakes, we’re likely to avoid those kinds of problems again   My final observation along those lines, and I wouldn’t push this too far, is that if we look   at the performance of the US economy in the second half of the nineteenth century, at least   superficially, we see a mild deflation accompanied by fairly steady increases in per capita GDP    That suggests that overall the economy could operate in that kind of environment  I think I’ll let   it go at that    I’ll await the next round of discussion on this    Thank you, Mr Chairman  The latest readings on the District economy   are consistent with what we’ve been seeing and saying about the business news more broadly    Consumer spending has been strong, particularly for home furnishings, electronics, autos, and at   bars and restaurants Housing had a very good year in 2001  Construction activity was strong,   and home sales were at record levels  And realtors are optimistic; they think 2002 will be even                 January 29-30, 2002 Page 90 of 194  better than 2001 On the other hand, layoffs have continued  But the unemployment rate   Districtwide and in the major metropolitan areas such as the Twin Cities remains in the   neighborhood of 4 percent That suggests that a lot of the laid-off workers either have been   absorbed elsewhere in the economy or perhaps have chosen to spend a few months in Florida or   Arizona, as Minnesotans are wont to do this time of year, and wait things out there    Manufacturing is struggling but does appear to be stabilizing  And I would say that the tourism   business has been adversely affected by the weather  The weather has been too good But the   other side of the coin is that the mild weather has had a very favorable effect on household utility   bills, which are running well below last year’s   As far as the national outlook is concerned, I think the prospects for the economy are   favorable I don’t have any significant quarrel with the Greenbook forecast  My own view is   that the first half of the year will probably be a bit slower than in the Greenbook and that the   second half may be a little stronger, but overall the difference is not significant  Our VAR   forecasting model, which has a pretty good track record except perhaps at turning points,   [laughter] has the same general path as the Greenbook, although a bit more subdued  Certainly   there is some possibility that the consumer will be a cause for concern, especially if labor market   conditions deteriorate further or don’t even stabilize  But I’m wondering whether there isn’t less   of a mystery about consumer behavior than one might otherwise think  After all, disposable   income has risen consistently over many years now and household net worth, while down from   its March 2000 peak, is still considerably above where it was five or ten years ago  Against that   background, I don’t find the ongoing strength in consumer spending all that big a surprise    I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman, including the balance of   risks statement, although it seems to me that most of the time at the trough or very early in an   expansion that’s almost stating the obvious in terms of where the risks lie  Let me make a   comment on one other thing I certainly don’t know how the profits picture is going to play out    But the Greenbook does have rather modest productivity gains over the next several quarters  If     January 29-30, 2002 Page 122 of 194  we get just a percentage point or so better than that, that may not be great for labor market   conditions but it may show up in improved profit margins, other things being equal  And I can   easily imagine that occurring    Oh, cyclically adjusted that’s a remarkable number  But if we look at the   Greenbook numbers going forward from this point, they are still rather modest    Thank you, Mr Chairman  My issue was similar to Bill Poole’s  I’m   concerned about getting involved with GNMAs because of what that may lead to with regard to   the pressure to make outright purchases of  Fannies and Freddies, which I think would be a huge   mistake  So despite all the imperfections, if I had to vote, I would vote in favor of looking at the   foreign RP pool first    Well, I can be very brief  I agree with the comments that Al and Jack   made  And as far as the TV camera is concerned, I suspect the ratings would be disappointing, to   say the least! [Laughter]    Thank you, Mr Chairman  While the news on the District economy is still   somewhat mixed, I would have to say that in general it has been on the positive side, perhaps   surprisingly positive  Hiring has resumed  Activity in the manufacturing sector has stabilized   and begun to expand Mining activity on the iron range in northern Minnesota and the Upper   Peninsula of Michigan has started to pick up, and that was true even before the tariffs on   imported steel were announced  And for the most part, the economies in the western part of the   District are reported to be doing well  Residential construction is a particularly bright spot    Some builders have indicated that they are booked out into 2003, although cancellations are   always possible I’m hearing very little about inflationary pressures, though of course one can   find particular items about which people have some price concerns  Business attitudes are the   one thing that continues to concern me because I think business people are still uncertain and   quite cautious about the economic environment I suspect that is largely because of their   concerns about profits going forward And I suspect that some at least are still adjusting with   some difficulty to an environment of price stability  Retailers have generally done well in the   District and, as Bill Poole mentioned, inventories in the retail arena are low  So if positive sales   surprises continue, that will lead to substantial ordering and presumably to increases in   production   On the national scene, I have few comments to make  For some time, there have been   reasons to be optimistic, and now I don’t think it’s going out on a limb to say that the recovery is   at hand I’m impressed by the size of the upward revision to the Greenbook forecast  I, too, was     March 19, 2002 Page 49 of 117  earlier thinking that growth would be in the neighborhood of 3 percent this year  I’m not   inclined to change my view on that just yet, partially because there’s noise in the data and   partially because I think there may be some payback effect yet to come from the consumer side    But if we do get growth of something like 3 percent, which is below the Greenbook forecast, I   would still consider that to be a very satisfactory, or maybe better than satisfactory, year    I, too, support your recommendation, Mr Chairman  Let me just make   one additional comment  We’ve been looking recently at what I suppose I would generously call   some low inflation policy rules  While recognizing that beauty is frequently in the eyes of the   beholder, the implication of these rules, at least at the moment, is that there is no need to move   today    You’re the boss! [Laughter]    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Overall the tenor of the anecdotes in the Ninth   District has improved recently Let me just give you a quick rundown of that  Housing and   residential construction, which has been a bright spot, remains a bright spot  Activity is strong,   and sales of upper-end homes, which had slowed for a time, have picked up dramatically   recently  Auto sales remain healthy  Consumer spending overall seems reasonably strong, and   people are quite optimistic about the outlook for the upcoming tourist season  Reports in the   mining and energy sector are mixed, but reports in manufacturing have improved recently  And   there are some signs of a modest amount of hiring going on throughout the District  In response               May 7, 2002 46 of 81  to the issue that arose earlier, I have heard no anecdotes whatsoever about stress stemming from   demands by employers on those currently employed to work longer hours or whatever  That   kind of anecdote just doesn’t seem to be around  I would say that there is little anticipation of an   acceleration of inflation But there are lots of concerns about some prices, particularly insurance   premiums  And finally, I’d say that the outlook for nonresidential construction has in general   deteriorated; on the other hand, this will probably be a record year for highway construction   activity and some related transportation construction   As far as the national economy is concerned, I think we are at the point—we’re already   seeing this—where we’re going to hear a lot about the fragility of the recovery  This tends to go   with the territory, in my recollection  Part of it is just a response to the nature of the incoming   data And partly, of course, it reflects the fundamental fact that not all sectors of the economy   pick up or pick up robustly in the same period of time  I think we should recall that the economy   tends to be very resilient, as demonstrated by the length and persistence and durability of the last   two expansions despite some significant shocks along the way  Having said that, I think the   Greenbook forecast is a pretty good place to start as far as the outlook is concerned  If I had to   make a bet, I might reduce the second half of this year and take a bit off the first half of next year   just because my instinct is that capital spending will be a little slower to come along than is   anticipated in the Greenbook But I wouldn’t make a big deal of that  In my view the outlook   for growth is satisfactory as is the near-term outlook for inflation      I agree also    Thank you Karen, the commentary in the Greenbook seems to suggest   that foreign economies in general are expected to do a bit better going forward than we had   earlier anticipated My question is, Does that reflect something fundamental going on abroad, or   is it primarily just an extrapolation of the most recent information, which looks a little better than   at least I would have expected    Okay    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Beginning with the District economy, we have   under way a gradual but what I think is by now a broadly based improvement in economic   activity  Residential construction and sales, which have been a continuous bright spot, remain a   distinct bright spot pretty much throughout the District  Consumer spending continues to hold   up reasonably well And tourism in the District seems to be enjoying a good spring and early        June 25-26, 2002 90 of 179  summer so far Bankers report that consumer credit quality is in good shape  Their reports on   business credit quality are a little more mixed, but as far as the consumer is concerned, the   bankers seem fairly comfortable  We are seeing improvements in manufacturing activity and   along with that some general improvement—though I don’t want to make this too broad a   statement—in business attitudes  I have been, if anything, a little pleasantly surprised recently   by reports from business people that they are seeing some pickup in activity  I’d say that there   has been no significant change in labor market conditions for at least several months now    Commercial construction remains probably the principal area of weakness in our region  There   has been some improvement in mining and energy sectors in the District   As far as the national economy is concerned, for the most part I think the economic   fundamentals are positive  So I find the case for continued expansion convincing, especially, as   other people have mentioned, with the policy stimulus in place and with signs of improvement in   many foreign economies at least for the moment  For the near term anyway, I do believe   inflation will remain subdued  And the productivity situation continues to look quite positive to   me  As others have commented—and I may lean even a little further on this side—the expansion   going forward is likely to be modest, which we recognize to a large extent is due to the fact that   the recession was modest  We would not have been better off if we had had a deeper recession   just so we could have a sharper snapback Finally, though I don’t want to overstate this, I do   think that the current accounting issues are potentially a very big deal because I believe they   could have an extremely adverse effect on confidence  We used to be able to take the accuracy   of accounting for granted We assumed that these kinds of problems, to the extent they existed,   were characteristic of developing economies or at least of economies other than our own  That is        June 25-26, 2002 91 of 179  proving to be less and less true And I’m afraid that there is real potential for that to adversely   affect the economy, and not just in the short run    I also support the recommendation    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Most, but not all, of the anecdotes and   readings on the District economy have been positive  Retail sales and consumer spending   continue to advance That’s true of autos, but it’s also true outside the auto sector as well,   according to the reports we get  Spring and summer tourism has been pretty good in most parts   of the District  The agricultural situation actually has improved  To the extent that there were   drought conditions in our District, for the most part that has been relieved The energy sector in            western North Dakota and eastern Montana is operating at a relatively high rate  The   employment situation is mixed, with no change in white-collar employment but some    improvement in hiring of production and temporary workers  And while there certainly are no   broad-based signs of inflation, some materials prices are reportedly moving up     August 13, 2002 48 of 92  Nonresidential construction activity is slow, and vacancy rates, especially for Class B and   lower-rated buildings, are high and rising Residential construction activity and all that   surrounds it, including sales and permits and so forth, remain very favorable  Reportedly, for   example, home prices in the Twin Cities are up 15 percent over the past year  Meanwhile,   though, apartment vacancy rates have increased, and I think rents are stabilizing and perhaps   even weakening a bit  And at some point the relative price shift will feed back into relative   changes in activity  But I think that’s probably some time off   Let me offer a few thoughts about the national economy and outlook  We’ve already   talked a lot about that Obviously, I don’t want to dismiss the disappointing nature of the   incoming aggregate data we’ve seen, the revisions, and the weakness in equity values  But I   don’t want to exaggerate it or overreact to it either  I haven’t changed my forecast of the   economy over the next six quarters or so  My forecast was a little lower than the Greenbook’s as   of the last meeting, and now we’re closer together  We really don’t know whether the economy   is going to grow at a rate of 2½ percent or 3½ percent, just to throw out a couple of numbers,   over the second half of this year But it seems to me that the outlook remains basically   satisfactory As many people have commented already, policies, both fiscal and monetary, seem   to be expansionary  I do think that we will see some material improvement in spending on   equipment and software next year, and I believe consumer spending will continue to advance    And as I’ve noted before, when we see the activity we’re seeing in housing and homebuilding         August 13, 2002 49 of 92  and people’s willingness to make fifteen- to thirty-year commitments, which is inherent in most   purchases, it seems to me that consumers remain relatively positive about their circumstances   and about the outlook Finally, history is on our side in the sense that the economy has proven to   be resilient in the past and I think it’s proving to be resilient again  After all, we’ve had three   consecutive quarters of growth, albeit modest growth, following September 11  And if you had   told me back in September or October that that was the performance we were going to get, I   certainly would have been pleasantly surprised    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I can support your recommendation  As Vince   reminded us, earlier in the year market participants had priced in a significant and relatively early   tightening of policy As it turned out, I think we were well advised not to act on that  Now they   are pricing in some easing of policy soon if not immediately, and personally I think we are wise   today not to react to that either  I would offer one caution about changing the bias in the risk   statement, although I can certainly go along with it  It’s one thing if we want to whipsaw   ourselves a little by changing the forecast as the numbers come in  But I think we should be   careful about having that feed into the financial markets and potentially the real economy  Now,   obviously what we’re talking about doing here is not likely to have a profound impact    Nevertheless, I think there is a potential for trying to overanalyze the incoming data and to   exaggerate the possibility that somehow a new trend has been established            August 13, 2002 80 of 92   Thank you Dave, you mentioned along the way that the initial claims   data seemed more consistent with small declines in employment rather than small increases, and   yet you’ve maintained the small increases in the Greenbook forecast  Could you give me a sense   of your thinking that has led to that more optimistic conclusion?    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be brief because in my view very little has   changed on balance since our discussion at the last meeting  As far as the District economy is   concerned, perhaps one way to characterize it is to distinguish between the consumer and   business sectors The consumer sector continues pretty much as we have been discussing around   the table for a good number of months now  Spending at retail has been strong—autos, of        September 24, 2002 52 of 115  course, have done very well—and tourism activity has been good  Housing continues to do well,   and home improvement spending is another notable bright spot     The agricultural sector has picked up in many parts of the District where the drought has   been alleviated Problems still persist in a few places, but geographically the drought area has   diminished, so in fact agriculture is doing a little better  And based on anecdotal reports, it   appears that the labor market is showing a few more signs of activity across a broader range of   job opportunities, so that’s a plus On the other hand, in manufacturing and related businesses,   activity is pretty quiet, as it has been for some time  Little has changed there   As far as the nation is concerned, I guess it’s repetitious to say, but I think an economy   with modest growth and low inflation is the most likely outcome and an acceptable one  We ran   the incoming monthly and quarterly data through our VAR forecasting model, and it produced   basically the same forecast for this meeting that it did for the previous meeting  I take that to   mean that the model didn’t interpret the incoming data as providing any large surprises or that   any surprises were offsetting My point is that the outlook doesn’t seem to have changed very   much based on what has happened over the intermeeting period   I do continue to think that a significant and broadly based expansion in business spending   is probably still some time off  There has been some discussion, of course, of the jobless   recovery, and that is not a preferable outcome  However, if we look back at 1990-91, as I   recall—depending on exactly how one interprets the data—it took a year and maybe as much as   two years before we saw some really significant and sustained increases in employment    Nevertheless, that expansion turned out to be a very long lived and healthy one  One   observation, of course, doesn’t make a trend, so I don’t think we ought to draw too many   conclusions from that except to say that we may be well served by some continued patience         September 24, 2002 53 of 115   I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman, and I would remain open   minded about whether we will need to react in the intermeeting period or not  But I would   caution against responding to what are inherently noisy data—we’ve had a lot of experience with   that—and also against holding ourselves to a standard of previous Greenbook forecasts  I say   that because, as Bill Poole mentioned, for the most part the results this year have come out pretty   much as expected if one were to put any realistic confidence interval around those forecasts    They certainly have been largely consistent with what I expected for the year as whole when I   submitted my forecasts in January and July    I agree with him, too; more communication is better than less        September 24, 2002 105 of 115   Let me start with recent changes in District economic conditions, which   generally have been modest—and not all of them have been negative  The housing sector         November 6, 2002 45 of 122  continues to be a very bright spot, and even homes priced at the upper end of the market seem to   be continuing to move fairly rapidly  Labor markets are steady, I would say, but not strong    Manufacturing appears to be stable  We participated in a survey with the Minnesota Department   of Trade and Economic Development, and I at least was somewhat surprised by the reports  I   wouldn’t say the tone was one of optimism, but most manufacturers seemed to feel that their   businesses were stabilizing and that the outlook, at least for the second half of the year, wasn’t   too bad Now, that survey was completed in September, and conditions may have deteriorated   since then But that was the message we got at the time   I talked with a couple of senior executives from large firms in the paper industry who   pretty much confirmed that sense of the business outlook  Certainly, they weren’t in despair  I   would characterize those conversations as reports that business was tough but not awful  It was   possible to make money  They were profitable but, of course, not as profitable as the business   executives would have liked A similar conversation with a couple of senior executives in the   publishing business had the same tone and tenor   Consumer spending has been mediocre at best recently, although one remaining bright   spot outside of housing is tourism activity, which has been pretty good during the fall, and   reportedly early inquiries for next summer have been fairly strong  Finally, I would say that   commercial construction has taken another turn down     As far as the outlook for the national economy is concerned, I don’t have a significant   alternative to the Greenbook forecast to suggest, but I will distinguish between what I think I   know and what I think I don’t know I’m very uncertain about whether growth in real GDP will   pick up next quarter or sometime later next year; it may not happen until 2004 or perhaps beyond   that What I think I know, or at least what I’m less uncertain about, is that productivity is on a         November 6, 2002 46 of 122  strong and favorable trend, inflation is low and likely to stay low, and inflationary expectations   are low and likely to stay low Thank you    Mr Chairman, I support the 50 basis point reduction in the funds rate   target I think there’s a good chance that it’s the right thing to do  But even if it’s not, as you   already suggested, the risks of taking this action seem low basically because of the situation in   which we could find ourselves with regard to productivity and current and prospective inflation     As far as the balance of risks is concerned, despite the nature of the disappointing news   coming in, I suspect the risks aren’t all that unbalanced to begin with  So I have no problem with   moving to a balanced risk statement    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I would describe District economic conditions   as mixed  Somewhat surprisingly, at least to me, manufacturing does appear to be improving   modestly and the improvement seems rather broadly based  We see it in the production of basic   materials, in some industrial equipment, and in some higher-tech products as well  I don’t want   to overstate this, but I’ve been a bit surprised at what we’ve been hearing and seeing in the   manufacturing sector    Residential construction and residential real estate in general remain very healthy  That   trend, of course, has been in place for a long time and is consistent with most of the information   that we’ve been getting at the national level  Labor markets I would describe as relatively stable;   they haven’t been improving, but they haven’t been deteriorating further And if anything, local   unemployment rates have drifted down a bit  Consumer spending appears to be mediocre, as   best I can judge I don’t know how holiday sales are going to turn out, but I don’t have the sense   at the moment that the year is going to be all that exciting in that regard     Despite these conditions, which I would characterize as mediocre, I think business   attitudes remain quite sour  What I hear from a lot of business people is that conditions are no   better than they were a year ago  From their perspective I think there’s a sense of frustration that   no demonstrable improvement has occurred over the last several quarters                                                     As far as the national economy is concerned, I’m reasonably comfortable with something   like the Greenbook forecast for the next four or five quarters, for several reasons  I won’t go   through all of them, but I’ll mention a few  One is that I do think we’ll get more fiscal stimulus;         December 10, 2002 45 of 87  and monetary policy is stimulative as well  That, in my view, augurs well for future economic   performance  Moreover, I think the economy is fundamentally quite resilient  Jerry Jordan   already commented on that, and I won’t elaborate  But that resilience has been demonstrated   repeatedly in the last twenty years  I also believe that productivity is on a favorable trend that is   likely to persist   I would reiterate a point that was touched on in the earlier discussion of deflation  It   seems to me that, with strong productivity improvement under way in two very, very large   economies, the United States and China, and given what that implies for pressure on producers in   some other countries, downward price pressure around the world should not be unexpected  If   deflation were to materialize in this circumstance, when productivity is growing very rapidly, I   wouldn’t be at all surprised if it didn’t turn out to be relatively benign if not constructive  Thank   you    I, too, support your recommendation  My only concern is whether you   intend to bank that hour and a half that you didn’t use!  [Laughter]     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I had just a couple of comments  Starting with   a point that I think Brian made, for me there’s a difference here between inertia and timidity  As   far as inertia is concerned, I find Glenn’s story pretty convincing  So that’s not what interests me   particularly  On the other hand, both papers seem to at least allow for the possibility that,   relative to some sort of optimal rule, the Committee has been too timid  To the best of my   knowledge, by the way, most of the reaction function literature going back to the 1970s and   maybe even before seems to come to the conclusion that the Fed has been overly timid  My   intuition is to be rather suspicious of that conclusion for reasons that other people have already   mentioned  Perhaps the most important one to my mind is that, while the Taylor rule is a useful   approximation, I think it’s a misspecification in that it omits a lot of important variables  After   all, our actions are conditioned not only on things such as how we think the financial markets   might react but also on forecasts and all sorts of other variables that are not going to be picked up   with a Taylor rule  Having said that, I would admit that I would feel better if we had some   empirical work that brought those other variables into play and demonstrated that we got   reasonable results  As far as I know we don’t have that  So, that’s where I am on these issues     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Let me begin with a quick rundown of what   has been happening in terms of the readings on the District economy  All in all the reports   remain mixed, but I would say that on balance they may be a bit better  A couple of sectors   aren’t better  One is agriculture, where the combination of unfavorable weather conditions and   lower prices for some commodities probably has worsened the situation, so attitudes among   many producers are quite negative at this point  Another sector that isn’t better is tourism   Again, weather seems to be the principal problem there, especially the lack of snow     Moving beyond those two sectors, for the most part commercial construction is soft, but   retail space in the Twin Cities is quite tight, so there is a substantial amount of new retail   January 28-29, 2003 124 of 195    construction under way  Labor market conditions appear to have stabilized; the changes in   employment and unemployment in recent months have been trivial  And the manufacturing   sector appears to be improving  The improvement is small, but we’ve had better anecdotal   reports and better readings out of that sector for the last several months now  Consumer   spending, as most people have commented, is mixed, depending on the region and depending on   the retailer  As the retail space additions in Minneapolis suggest, some people are optimistic in   that arena  Of course, optimism certainly pertains to virtually all measures of housing activity—  single-family construction, multifamily construction, and sales across the board without regard to   price levels  Finally, let me say a word about credit quality  The bankers I’ve spoken with   certainly seem comfortable with the credit quality of households but less so with that of   businesses today     As far as the national situation is concerned, I wrote down numbers very similar to those   in the Greenbook  I don’t know if this will make anybody feel better or not, but I went and   looked back at last January’s Greenbook to see what the Board staff had forecast for 2002, and   they got it just about exactly right  It’s really remarkable  So I hope that between the staff and   myself we’re right again, at least as far as 2003 is concerned  I do believe that there are some   fundamental reasons that the Greenbook forecast is not a bad one  These reasons aren’t meant to   be additive because the phenomena are interrelated  One is the fundamental resilience and   flexibility of the US economy, a point that somebody touched on a little earlier  I don’t think   we want to lose sight of that  I would add that monetary policy is, of course, accommodative    We are anticipating further fiscal stimulus, and some of that will lead to sustained growth in   disposable income  Finally, there’s the favorable productivity outlook  If I ask myself where I   might be missing something that would jeopardize that forecast, one area is the state and local   January 28-29, 2003 125 of 195    government budget situation, for which the consequences may turn out to be more severe than I   expect  Another is the labor market  I’m not sure that labor is as stretched as some people seem   to think and that employment will pick up rapidly any time soon  So that weakness may be   extended  Another possibility is that we may be a little optimistic about productivity  But in the   end, I think this is one of those situations in which all of that is probably dwarfed by how the   geopolitical developments play out, and I don’t have any special expertise there       I support     Not issuing a statement would attract a lot of attention     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I would describe the District economy as   stable, and I do think that’s probably the right term  There doesn’t seem to be any appreciable   deterioration at this point, but at the same time there’s little net growth  Employment for the   most part is flat, although at the far western and eastern ends of the District we do have   somewhat more favorable reports  But those are relatively thinly populated areas, with relatively   small economies  If one talks to our directors and other business people about their hiring plans,   fundamentally they don’t have any, which is to say that they’re not intending to add to their   employment levels anytime soon  There is still a lot of optimism surrounding the housing sector,   but I have the sense that in at least some of the larger markets the builders now have gotten   ahead of demand, and that will obviously have implications for activity as time goes on    Consumer spending ex-autos appears to be close to flat, and of course, auto sales have been   softer recently as reflected in the national numbers   As far as the national economy is concerned, I would make several maybe semi-random   points  First of all, the downward adjustment to the Greenbook forecast for real growth in the   current and subsequent quarter looks right to me  I think that’s consistent with the tenor of the   incoming national data and is certainly congruent with the anecdotes that I’ve been picking up as   March 18, 2003 41 of 101    well  At the same time I don’t have the sense that the longer-term outlook in the Greenbook has   changed any as we get to later this year and into 2004  I also think that’s appropriate  I haven’t   changed my longer-run view  To be sure, there’s a tremendous amount of uncertainty  But those   of us who’ve been at this for a while also know that there’s a great tendency toward getting   whipsawed if one puts a lot of emphasis on the last observation or two and not so much on the   evidence regarding underlying fundamentals  I think the fundamentals underpinning the longer-  run outlook, which looks pretty favorable to me, are still in place  I won’t go through the entire   litany, but I will point to the productivity numbers that some people have already cited and to the   continued growth in disposable income     I do believe, and this is the view in the Greenbook as well, that employment is going to   be slow to pick up  We saw that following the 1990-91 recession  But my reason for expecting   that is not just historical precedent  For businesses there’s a lot of pressure on the top line and on   the bottom line  In that environment, adding to employment is just not a change that’s going to   come very quickly  Further, I do suspect that the near-term risks to the economy are probably on   the downside  That’s a suspicion, not really a conviction  But whether it’s right or not, I think   we’re already positioned for that possibility  Policy has reacted, and interest rates are clearly   low  I’m not sure that we’ll necessarily get a great deal of clarification regarding the outlook   even if the conflict with Iraq goes very well  I’d like to think we would  But there are a lot of   other problems around the world, some of which could even be exacerbated depending on how   the situation in Iraq plays out  Finally, in my view this is the time to avoid over-guessing and   acting as if we know more than we do  There’s a tremendous amount of uncertainty, and it’s   probably going to pay to be patient and cautious and see how things unfold     I support your recommendation     Thank you, Mr Chairman  As far as the District economy is concerned,   we have the usual mixed bag of readings on activity  But overall I would say that the recent   tenor of the incoming information has been perhaps a bit better  What I’m going to discuss is   based a little on data but comes mostly from anecdotes heard at a recent meeting of our Advisory   Council on Small Business, Agriculture, and Labor and at a meeting with the leaders of the Twin   Cities financial community   Housing has continued to be a bright spot, at least through March  All indicators of   housing activity in the District have been quite favorable  As far as the industrial sector is   concerned, I would say that, at worst, conditions have stabilized, and some small manufacturers   are suggesting that activity is picking up  The trucking industry in our part of the world seems to   be quite busy, although the large amount of consolidation in that industry may be a contributing   May 6, 2003 37 of 115    factor  But I would say that overall there is certainly some optimism among small manufacturers   and others in industry that the next six months will be better than the last six to twelve months    Consumer spending for the most part has held up, and credit quality doesn’t seem to be a   concern among the vast preponderance of banks  On the negative side, there certainly has been   no discernible improvement in labor market conditions, and no dramatic increases in hiring   appear to be under way  Pressures on state and local government budgets persist, and we haven’t   seen all of the ramifications of that yet  The major airline based in Minneapolis is suffering, as   are most of the other major airlines, although to date its problems aren’t quite as severe as some   of the higher profile ones that we are all aware of   Finally, based on conversations with our contacts, there doesn’t seem to be any reason to   expect a quick acceleration in capital spending  The story I got on that really has three parts,   some of which are related  One is clearly what I would call a productivity story  Businesses   simply have found ways to produce more with the same inputs  They were quite explicit about   that, and they seem to feel that it has some way to go  Related to that, there is very little pressure   on capacity so there’s no stimulus to business capital investment coming from capacity   pressures  Moreover, some businesses, as others have commented already, have been busy   restructuring their balance sheets and want to get that completed before they contemplate sizable   capital spending projects     As far as the evidence on the national economy is concerned, I read it the way others   have done, I think  Clearly it has been on the soft side, which has produced what I would   expect—caution among forecasters and among the business community  I share that caution at   this stage  But I try to remind myself that there’s always the danger of getting whipsawed here   by marking down the forecast just as conditions are about to get better or vice versa  One thing I   May 6, 2003 38 of 115    know for sure from the days when I was doing a lot of bottom-up forecasting is that, in sluggish   circumstances such as this, it’s very hard to convince yourself that economic activity is actually   going to pick up  It’s just the nature of the beast  Today, outside of defense spending, it’s hard   to envision an acceleration in most of the components of aggregate demand Yet we know from   history that sooner or later the economy does pick up, especially when the fundamentals—and by   fundamentals I’m talking here about productivity and the stance of monetary policy and fiscal   policy—are favorable     But in addition, I view Dino’s description of financial market developments, with   essentially a rise in equity prices in many parts of the world and declining credit-quality spreads,   as confirming what we already know, which is that in the past several weeks the big things have   gone right  By that I mean that the war ended successfully and quickly, energy prices came   down significantly and rapidly, and earnings have been at least no worse than earlier feared or   expected  All of that gives me some comfort, but it doesn’t help me answer the question as to   when we might actually see some acceleration in economic growth     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Let me start first by commenting on the   statement, which I like a lot  It may not be perfect, but I consider it a distinct improvement so I   think we should go with it  As for policy, on balance I agree with you that we’re probably better   off not acting today  Not only are financial markets fragile, but they can also be fickle  We   don’t want to do anything that will set them off unnecessarily  I think Bill’s and Don’s argument   is right that this statement conveys much the same sentiment as a funds rate cut  But it’s still   different from taking an easing action because people in the market know that we’re going to be   reading the incoming information on the economy, as are they  So I feel more comfortable   deferring any action until June depending on the nature of the incoming information      Thank you, Mr Chairman  I came out pretty much where you did with   regard to the four questions—so I’ll attenuate my remarks—but let me briefly explain why    We’re having this conversation, at least from my perspective, because of our concerns about the   possibility of deflation  If I ask myself why I might be concerned about deflation, exhibit 1 is   one answer—the Depression  While there may not be a consensus as to the causes of the Great   Depression, people usually cite a crisis in banking, inappropriate monetary policy, wage   stickiness and collusion in the labor market, and maybe the Smoot-Hawley Act  None of those   conditions seems to be particularly prevalent or relevant today in my judgment  Another answer,   exhibit 2, is Japan  There again people cite serious problems in the banking industry, stop-and-  June 24-25, 2003 31 of 211    go policies, and serious resource misallocations having to do with trying to preserve dying or   uncompetitive industries, and so forth  Again, as in the case of our own Depression, those   conditions seem to be largely absent in our economy today     The third possible reason I come up with for our concern today has to do with   disappointment about the rate of growth in the economy  Depending on what time period one   selects, the economy has been growing at 1½ to 2½ or 3 percent over the last group of quarters    My suspicion is that, if it were growing at 4 or 5 percent or more, we wouldn’t be very   concerned—even with price indexes going up at a rate of 1 percent or so, plus or minus—about   the possibility of deflation  If that judgment is right, then what we’re really concerned about is   the pace of economic growth  So what it seems we should be involved in, at least for the   moment, is a fairly traditional exercise of economic stimulus in an effort to further boost   aggregate demand  That suggests to me that for now our primary focus should be on our   incremental policy changes, if any     Thank you, Mr Chairman  My sense of the District economy is that an   improvement is under way and that it is broad but not deep  By that I mean that the   improvement is broad in that a number of different sectors or different components of aggregate   demand are participating in it  But it’s not deep because for every positive reading or every two   positive anecdotes we get on the District economy we can find a negative one  So to that extent   the situation is still mixed     June 24-25, 2003 100 of 211    Homebuilding, home sales, and home improvement spending remain the foundation of   growth  There’s no question about that  Those numbers not only have held up but have   continued to surprise participants in that industry on the upside  Consumer spending overall has   been expanding, but slowly  One gets that same sense of the situation on average whether one   talks to major retailers and hears their year-over-year comparisons or to managers of large malls   in the District  Of course, it’s not universally true    Our survey of capital spending suggested, as did many others, that there is some   improvement in train and that some of the orders have already been placed  That’s clearly   positive  Anecdotes from bankers, which I think reflect the attitudes of their customers and   particularly their business customers, are clearly more upbeat than they were six or twelve   months ago  That’s also true for the most part of activity in the energy and agricultural sectors of   the economy  Putting all that together, I think things are improving    As for the national economy, I’ll be very brief  I think the trajectory of real growth as   reflected in the Greenbook is a reasonable representation of what may happen, although I   personally couldn’t bring myself to write down numbers as strong as those in the Greenbook    Nevertheless, to me the general Greenbook profile is a reasonable picture  Our VAR model   shows much weaker growth; but because it puts a good deal of weight on the last nine or ten   quarters, it’s not surprising that we get something weaker out of the VAR  To me, though, the   really distinguishing characteristic of the forecast is low inflation  Not only are domestic   conditions right for a continuation of low inflation, but if we look beyond our borders and   consider the global situation—what is happening in places like China and India and so forth—it   seems to me that an environment of continued low inflation is a very good bet  I have a very   June 24-25, 2003 101 of 211    difficult time constructing a credible story that has any appreciable acceleration of inflation in   the next year or two  Thank you     I, too, support your recommendation, Mr Chairman  It seems to me that   this additional stimulus is very low cost at this point, so I think it’s the right thing to do  I also   support the idea of reinforcing the signal that we sent to the market the last time about our views   on interest rate levels and so forth  I’m not sure about the best way to do it  Maybe when the   draft statement is available, that will clarify it, at least for me  I have one other, perhaps   somewhat gratuitous, comment  It seems to me that when inflation is running at 1 percent plus   or minus—and it may be more minus than plus—there’s not much of a distinction between being   concerned about further disinflation or about deflation  We’re just not very far from deflation    So I’m not sure that trying to make that distinction in our public comments is going to turn out to   be very productive     Yes, speaking of productivity, the numbers in the Greenbook forecast for   next year that jumped out at me were the very large employment gains and the very slow   August 12, 2003 19 of 110    productivity improvement  I’d like to know the intuition underpinning those projections because   I’m not sure those are the numbers I’d write down if I were trying to forecast them     Thank you, Mr Chairman  As far as the Ninth District is concerned,   overall economic activity is stable to improving  Let me just cite a few examples of that  On a   year-over-year basis, employment is stable in virtually all District states, but I’d say that the   undertone of the labor market has improved  There clearly are stirrings of net hiring, in   August 12, 2003 44 of 110    particular for some higher skilled positions  I can probably make the same set of statements for   manufacturing  Most measures indicate that activity in that sector has been stable in recent   months  But again there seem to be some hints of a greater level of optimism among at least   some producers  Residential construction, which of course has been a bright spot, is still up   significantly on a year-over-year basis  The same is true for sales and prices of houses  So that   sector continues to do well  Of course, that was the situation before the recent increase in   mortgage rates, but I’ll be surprised if that increase has a material effect on activity in the   housing sector, in the short run at least   Surprisingly, there are some new projects under way in nonresidential construction   activity, mostly expansion of hospitals and other health care facilities and some office building   construction in a few of the medium-sized cities in the District  Finally, after a slow start,   tourism activity seems to have picked up in many parts of the District, and that apparently has   brought with it some improvement in retail sales as well, mostly in the tourist centers  So overall   I would say that the situation in the District is improving, although probably not at a rapid rate    As far as the national economy is concerned, many people have observed already—and I   agree—that the latest actual data are clearly on the more positive side  But I would sound a   somewhat cautionary note here  We know that those data are unreliable; they can be subject to   significant revisions; and one or two months don’t make a trend  Nevertheless, given the   improvement in the data and given that the stimulus we’re all anticipating and have talked about   is now upon us, I do think some acceleration—probably significant—in economic activity going   forward is likely  That said, the precise timing remains open to question, at least in my mind     Clearly there is no real inflation or inflationary pressure in front of us, as best I can judge,   and that prospect could be reinforced if productivity is better than the Greenbook forecast   August 12, 2003 45 of 110    suggests for next year  Part and parcel of that scenario is the likelihood that employment will be   slower to pick up as we go forward or that employment gains will be more modest than is   typically the case  But with real growth continuing, an acceleration in growth in prospect, and   inflation low, it seems to me that overall the economy is in pretty good shape     I, too, support your recommendation, Mr Chairman  I would comment   that what struck me about your remarks was the discussion about who has the right model—  whether the Federal Reserve does or the market does  Of course, there are lots of other   possibilities  In that regard I have to admit that I’m less concerned about further disinflation or   even deflation than perhaps many others around the table  It’s true that we’ve had a positive   productivity shock in the United States, China, India, and probably parts of Central and Eastern   Europe, and I’m no doubt leaving out some important places  But it’s not clear to me that we   ought to be as concerned as I think we are about further reductions in the rate of inflation     August 12, 2003 80 of 110      Thank you, Mr Chairman  First of all, I count myself among those who   don’t think that our current policies are all that bad and in need of a major overhaul  I agree with   most, but not all, of the comments that President Moskow just made  So let me offer a few quick   suggestions and express a couple of concerns  As I understood your conversation with Bob   Parry, one suggestion is to use the Bluebook more extensively to spell out some alternatives and   give at least a rough idea of the language that would go with them  Whether that’s alternative 4   September 15, 2003 52 of 78    in Vincent’s material, I’m not sure  In any event, I think that’s a constructive suggestion, and we   ought to think about trying to implement that over time     Second, I think we should try to accelerate the release of the minutes whatever we do   with the statement  In other words, I don’t think moving up the publication of the minutes is   contingent upon what we put in the statement  I believe the minutes are an underutilized asset    We spend a good deal of time and go to a lot of trouble to prepare them as it is, and then we   release them at a time when people are no longer interested in them  It seems to me that they are   an accurate representation of what has been discussed at a meeting, and we ought to try to get   them out while they’re still relevant  In my view they would do a better job of providing a   description and conveying the nuances of what was going on at the meeting than anything else   that we could do  So if I would urge anything strongly, it would be the earlier release of the   minutes  I personally believe that whatever added resources it would take to accomplish that   would probably be well worth it     Yes     That could be  But if Jack is right, I won’t take him fishing again!    [Laughter]     I have a couple of concerns, and one of them Michael just expressed  I   don’t know what it means to say “the risks to economic growth are weighted toward the upside”    Presumably what we mean is that higher growth could lead to higher inflation  But that ought to   be captured by the inflation statement  Now, maybe some other meaning is intended  If so, I   must say that it’s not obvious to me what that would be  If we stay with the language we have   here, sooner or later it’s going to come back to haunt us  So I’m concerned about the   connotation of the word “risks”     My final thought is a response to one of the questions that Vincent raised  Can we sum   up the risks to inflation or price stability and the risks to the real outlook?  I’m a little   uncomfortable with that  We’ve been doing it, and I don’t think it has caused any serious   problems yet  But Ned and a few others have raised some concerns about that at previous   meetings, and logically I’m just not sure that it is the best of all possible approaches   September 15, 2003 54 of 78      Right     I thought that was a very good idea at the time  But we might want to   reflect earlier rather than later on how we may want to change this going forward because I do   believe that it could get awkward     Right      Thank you, Mr Chairman  Overall, the data on the District economy and   the anecdotes that have come in indicate that, as usual, it is tracking quite closely with the   national economy  So the regional economy is improving  Consumer spending is strengthening   pretty much across the board, and some auto dealers report that this clearly will be their best year   ever  Residential construction spending remains strong  Commercial construction for the most   part remains rather soft, and I’d say the leaders of the large commercial construction firms in the   District continue to be concerned about the outlook, although there has been a pickup of   construction activity in some of the midsized cities in the District  Manufacturing activity is   improving overall, particularly for firms that make products related to housing  There are some   signs of improvement in employment there as well  Although I’d say that overall employment is   probably stable in the District, there are signs of some net hiring under way  Perhaps the only   reservation I’d note about the signs of improvement we’ve seen lately is that overall business   attitudes still appear to be very cautious     As far as the national outlook is concerned, the general contours of the Greenbook   forecast—namely, reasonably rapid growth over the next two plus years and subdued inflation—  seem to me to be fairly well grounded and justified at this point  If I have any reservation about   the forecast, it relates to the productivity/employment split  Clearly there will be a cyclical   improvement in the labor market at some point  But the gains in employment forecast for a good   chunk of next year and into 2005 strike me at this stage as somewhat unlikely, in part because I   think the productivity improvement we’re seeing is going to prove to be longer-lived than the   Greenbook forecasters apparently anticipate  As far as manufacturing is concerned, I think that   at some point there will be a cyclical improvement in employment in that sector as well, but I   September 16, 2003 51 of 106    believe it’s worth bearing in mind that manufacturing employment in this country actually   peaked in 1979 and it hasn’t surpassed that peak since     One for 28!     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I certainly support leaving the federal funds   rate target at 1 percent  As for the other issues, the overriding concern in my mind is the   potential reaction in the marketplace  I will say a bit more about that in a minute  Because of   that I feel rather constrained as to what we can or should do at this meeting  So I will certainly   accept your recommendation on the balance of risks statement, although my instinct is to agree   September 16, 2003 87 of 106    with those who feel that the risks on the inflation side are moving in the direction of balance  If   they’re not balanced yet, I think they may well be shortly  Also because I feel constrained, the   language you’re proposing here on fostering the containing of disinflationary forces is okay with   me  But presumably the reason we want to tread slowly and carefully here is that we’re   concerned about creating all sorts of turmoil in the financial markets  The likelihood of that is   hard to gauge  I’m certainly prepared to go along with this, but I do think that concern is the   reason to proceed cautiously  And it’s not just the question of the reaction of the financial   markets but what that reaction could do to what we think is a gathering momentum in the   economy     No maybe about that!     Dave, I have a couple of questions related to the labor market and other   variables  For quite some time you’ve forecast a very strong improvement in employment   beginning relatively early next year and extending through 2005  I assume at the end of the day   that it must be intuition rather than a purely model-based result  Do you have any anecdotes or   other information that would give me greater confidence than I have at the moment that   something like that result is likely?  Of course, it’s accompanied by well below trend growth in   structural productivity for that whole period     Well, let me pursue this one step further  Obviously, we can get this path   of real GDP growth with almost any combination of hours and productivity growth  If we got   employment gains of, say, 200,000 to 250,000 a month rather than 300,000 to 340,000 a month   going forward and the difference was made up by productivity, to what extent would that mix   give you a different inflation forecast?  I don’t know the interworkings of your model that well,   but I assume it would give you even lower inflation in a more or less base case environment than   the scenario you presented     It would give us deflation?     Well, I think some improvement is under way  I question whether it’s   going to reach the magnitudes you have projected in the Greenbook   October 28, 2003 24 of 126      Okay     Thank you, Mr Chairman  A preponderance of the reports on the District   economy have been positive, but before I quickly summarize those findings let me just identify   the sectors that are still soft  One, of course, is commercial construction, where activity is quite   subdued  The second is tourism  Tourism has improved over time, but it has still been a   mediocre year for that industry in the District  And although business attitudes are certainly   better than they were nine or twelve months ago, I would have to say that they are still cautious    Other than that, though, I think the District economy has tracked the national economy   reasonably well, as it typically does  We have seen gains in employment in the private sector   over the past several months, but since state and local governments are still reducing   October 28, 2003 59 of 126    employment, those gains have not shown through to any great extent in the overall job numbers    Strength in consumer spending has been sustained, and housing activity and related measures   have strengthened further  I would judge, based on anecdotes, that manufacturing has improved   in the District over the past several months  One final piece of information on the District comes   from a contact who is knowledgeable about freight shipments through a variety of modes—that   is rail, barge, and truck—and he has reported that both volumes and prices have increased   perceptibly in recent months   As far as the national economy is concerned, like the Greenbook I am optimistic  If I   have any reservation, it’s the one that I alluded to earlier, namely that I would expect to get   something like the Greenbook forecast but with greater increases in productivity and somewhat   smaller increases in employment, acknowledging that forecasting productivity in the short run is   probably close to impossible  But if that scenario were to come to pass, that would reinforce my   conviction that inflation is going to stay low  If one adheres to gap analysis, though, I suppose   one would have to allow for the possibility that inflation could go even lower  Personally I think   that would be a benign development, but I realize that many people around this table have come   to a different conclusion about that     I’m comfortable with your recommendation     I was part of the working group, but I certainly agree that none of the   alternatives is perfect  Confining myself to the risk assessment, if I were going to select   formulaic language, I would select the “levels A” alternative—for very practical reasons  When   I ran through the stress tests, that alternative seemed to me to do the best job of conveying to the   public the situation and the prospective stance of policy given what we knew at the time  Others   may disagree, I realize, but that’s where I came out  However, I would have no trouble—as you   know, Roger—going with gradual evolution  Indeed, if you look at the criteria on page 5 in   Vincent’s memo, I think that approach may well do a better job on items 2, 3, and 4  So I have   no problem with that approach and would be very comfortable with it     I’ve long been relatively enthusiastic about releasing the minutes earlier,   and that continues to be my view  I think Tony’s suggestion for doing some dry runs is a   constructive one  I’ve basically thought that the minutes are an underappreciated asset  They   contain a lot of information, but people don’t pay any attention to them because of the timing of   their release  So I’m interested in having them taken seriously  I’m making what is perhaps a   naïve assumption that the substance wouldn’t change  After all, the minutes are based on a   transcript of the meeting, so to some extent I think that’s a reasonable but not foolproof   assumption  Your comment, Roger, about hitting the market a second time and perhaps creating   more chaos than being helpful gives me a bit of pause  My ultimate reaction to that, though, is   that there’s bound to be some learning period that’s going to go on for I don’t know how long—  months, quarters, or maybe even a year  But I would think that over time market participants   would come to understand what’s going on  And in my view, the better communication is worth   the price       I’m not in favor of changing the way we currently deal with the forecasts    When the idea first surfaced, I thought it was intriguing  But the more I thought about it, the   more I thought it would raise more questions than it would answer  We would get into the   business of trying to explain or trying to qualify what all these numbers meant  And that would   not be likely to turn out to be a productive exercise; or at least, as I tried to go through that   exercise for the moment, I couldn’t come up with a satisfactory way of doing all that  So I   would put this idea on the back burner     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The District economy is doing reasonably   well, and most indicators of economic activity are positive  Let me summarize that situation   quickly, starting with household demand  On balance, auto sales continue to be fairly strong,   and tourism is having a good year in the District  Overall consumer spending is growing   moderately, aided in part apparently by the return of Canadians to some of the northern border   cities—I presume mostly as a result of changes in the exchange rate  Residential construction   and related measures like housing sales remain another bright spot; 2003 was a record year in   many parts of the District  Most people in the marketplace expect another good year in 2004—   perhaps not up to 2003, but quite strong nevertheless     Manufacturing activity is improving, and the outlook for capital spending is clearly a   bright spot  We have the benefit of the survey that was done by the staff, but the most   impressive report on the capital spending outlook came from one of our directors who surveyed a   January 27-28, 2004 137 of 238    number of large firms in Minnesota  Almost uniformly these firms are planning double-digit   increases in capital spending for the current year for a variety of interrelated reasons having to do   with capacity expansion, replacement demand, cost reduction initiatives, and so on  That was   clearly a much more positive report than we had been getting previously and more optimistic   certainly than I would have anticipated, at least until recently  Mining activity has also picked   up, and that is mostly taconite mining in northern Minnesota, which probably reflects what is   going on in the steel market  The situation in commercial and industrial space is diverging    Absorption of industrial space in the Twin Cities market was quite substantial in 2003—the best   absorption in three years or so—but office vacancies remain at an elevated level  I think we are   seeing some modest improvement in labor market conditions in the District, and wage gains   generally remain in the 3 to 4 percent per year range   As far as the national economy is concerned, I think the outlook is positive, and I am   reasonably optimistic in that regard  My own forecast isn’t quite as strong as the Greenbook’s;   but basically, whether I adhere to mine or I take the Greenbook baseline, I’m pretty comfortable   with the outlook  I do think the uncertainty around the forecast has diminished  One issue I   would point to that has been talked about by others is the labor market  I remain skeptical that   we will see overall employment gains of the size indicated in the Greenbook  There is no doubt,   at least in my judgment, that employment will come back and probably come back substantially    But I am a little skeptical that we will achieve employment gains in the next couple of years as   large as those anticipated in the Greenbook  Having said that, I don’t think that is going to have   any profound effects on the way the economy performs because the difference is likely to be   made up by productivity  Finally, I think the inflation outlook is benign not because of the gap   but because inflation has been low, and I expect it to remain low   January 27-28, 2004 138 of 238      Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support your recommendation on the rate and   on the change in language  I would reiterate one point I’ve tried to make before—apparently   unpersuasively—that further disinflation or even a touch of deflation, if it’s stemming from rapid   productivity growth, is not necessarily a cause for concern     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The trends that have been evident in the   District economy for some time are continuing, so economic activity is expanding further  Let   me just start with inflation where, at least in our District, to date there seem to be few signs of   any broad-based price pressures and no real concern about inflation, although there are some   March 16, 2004 50 of 107    concerns about prices of particular products and services  I’ll say a bit more about that in a   minute   One distinct bright spot in the District is spending on equipment and software  That has   become evident over the last several months, and based on the anecdotal reports we’ve been   getting, the strength in such spending continues  Interestingly, the state and local government   budget situation has not turned out to be quite as dire as earlier expected  That is due in part, of   course, to policy changes that were made and in some cases to the fact that revenues are running   above earlier projections  There is, however, a transit strike under way in the Twin Cities, and   the principal issue there seems to be benefits—especially who is going to pay for the cost of   health benefits   Both manufacturing and mining in the District are expanding, and employment is going   up modestly in those two sectors  Maybe more important in terms of the labor market situation,   there really is little talk from our sources these days of further large reductions in payrolls    That’s certainly consistent with what we’re seeing in the initial claims data  So at worst,   employment is stabilizing; at best, it’s growing in some industries  Consumer spending has been   reasonably strong thus far this year, but people are getting more concerned about higher energy   prices, and the implications of that for home heating and gasoline bills may curtail discretionary   expenditures going forward  So far, though, there doesn’t seem to be any significant evidence of   reduced spending, as best I can judge  And finally, in construction, housing does remain a bright   spot in our area     As far as the national economy is concerned, I have only a few comments to make   because I haven’t changed my outlook for the national economy at all  I believe the outlook is   quite positive, and the incoming data haven’t provoked me to reassess that view  While I would   March 16, 2004 51 of 107    describe the incoming data on the national economy as positive, they perhaps are not as positive   as some expected earlier  But I do think there’s a danger in over-emphasizing high-frequency   data  There’s a lot of noise in them  We’ve all had a lot of experience looking at data that seem   to tell one story one month and a different story two or three months later, after some additional   observations and revisions  Fundamentally, I think that the national economy is in good shape   and that we can look forward to good growth both this year and next   I have one final comment, and that is on the productivity issue  I’ve been suspicious for   some time about the deceleration in productivity projected in the Greenbook  It has been pushed   off a bit  But to the extent that what we are seeing turns out to be more fundamental—more   secular rather than cyclical—the implications are either for the same growth in GDP and smaller   employment gains or for more-rapid growth in real GDP  In any event, though, I for one hope   that rapid productivity gains continue     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I, too, would have at least a mild preference   for going to balance on the inflation risks  The reason is that, as I listened to the discussion   today, it struck me that we heard more anecdotes that seemed consistent with the possibility of   building inflationary pressures  So on that basis, as well as other factors, balance seems   genuinely appropriate to me  That’s where I would come out on the issue     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Much of what I plan to say is going to sound   familiar by now  I will start by observing that the trends that have been apparent in the Ninth   District for some time have accelerated and we have a rapid expansion ongoing  Recently we’ve   had meetings with our Advisory Council on Small Business and Labor as well as with leaders of a   variety of Twin Cities’ financial services firms and our board of directors, and almost all of the   anecdotes have been distinctly positive  Let me run through some of those quickly   The manufacturing sector is expanding substantially  Employment is growing in that area,   exports are up, investment in equipment and software is growing, and firms in general are seeing   top-line growth and are quite pleased with that, needless to say  Labor is generally available in the   District, but hiring has picked up, and there is some discussion of the skills mismatch issue that   Dave Stockton and others alluded to  Housing remains quite strong, and a number of large projects   have been started recently; so at least on the construction side, people are still optimistic    Construction of office space remains weak, but absorption has begun to pick up, and if that   continues, it will probably lead to some renewed activity in that arena  Consumer spending has   been and continues to be strong     May 4, 2004 48 of 112       The really significant change is the one that others have already identified, and that’s on the   pricing side  The anecdotes are almost universally along the lines that companies are finding the   ability to raise prices now and that those price increases are sticking  It’s happening across a wide   range of goods and services, and I think that has done something positive for business attitudes and   confidence  But it is quite widespread, and I must say it gives me a bit of pause   As far as the national economy is concerned, I have only two or three comments  First of   all, from my perspective the situation and the outlook that we’re confronting haven’t changed very   much  I’ve thought for a long time that the outlook is positive, and the recent data have served to   confirm that  As Dave said, the economy does appear to be firing on virtually all cylinders now    On the inflation side, I’m not predicting a significant acceleration of inflation from here; but based   on the data and the anecdotal information, there’s clearly more action on that front than I would   have expected as recently as two or three months ago  Something is going on  It may turn out not   to persist, but I do think the likelihood of further declines in inflation—or even a leveling off at the   recent pace—has probably diminished  And finally, I can’t resist the temptation to add that I   question the value of trying to go from the output gap, however measured, to resulting inflation  I   just don’t think it is in the data     I, too, support the recommendation  I think the language does give us   adequate flexibility at least for the next two or three months, as best I can read the situation  And   I’m hard pressed to suggest any better alternative  So I support your proposal     Dave, one thing that surprised me about the baseline forecast and also about   most of the simulations was the flat ten-year Treasury rate  If I want to take, say, the market-based   funds rate scenario and assume that the ten-year rate goes up about half as much as the funds rate   over that period, then as a first approximation should I just extrapolate or interpolate the real growth   and unemployment numbers based on that?  Or do you think there’s more going on there?     Right  I was speculating that it might be more than that  Presumably you’ve   got a greater impact on the ten-year rate in the market-based scenario     Okay   June 29-30, 2004 88 of 203            Thank you, Mr Chairman  The expansion in the Ninth District is broadly   based  It has accelerated recently, and we’re hearing scattered reports of labor availability issues in   select locations  With the improvement in employment, conversations and concerns about offshore   outsourcing have diminished, as one would expect  Among the sectors that are strong are   manufacturing, mining, energy, and agriculture  Housing construction remains a source of strength   as well, although the inventory of unsold homes appears to be building in some major locations; and   nonresidential construction is starting to improve, albeit off a low base  Consumer spending was   strong earlier in the spring  Recent reports have been more mixed, and that has been attributed   essentially to lousy weather  We will see whether or not that in fact turns out to be the case as we   get additional information  As far as prices are concerned, reports are continuing to come in about   both current and prospective price increases  Clearly, as I’ve said before, there’s more going on   there than I had anticipated earlier   As far as the national economy is concerned, like almost everybody else I think the outlook   for growth in the national economy is unquestionably favorable  My own forecast is for modestly   higher real growth both this year and next than in the staff forecast  The differences aren’t large  It   seems to me that the fundamentals for growth are clearly positive  Maybe equally important or   June 29-30, 2004 111 of 203          even more so, earlier uncertainties about employment gains have diminished, as have earlier   uncertainties about the global recovery     I do expect inflation to remain low, but not as low as I previously anticipated  And I do   think there is an obvious danger in attributing the acceleration we’ve seen in inflation to temporary   or one-off factors  In any event, given the confidence intervals that were presented in the chart   show and in the Greenbook, it doesn’t seem to me to be a stretch to expect core inflation to be   2 percent this year and even a bit higher next year     Thank you, Mr Chairman  There has been little change in the District   economy recently; that is, a broad-based expansion is under way and is continuing  Labor demand   appears to be strengthening  Manufacturing has been a particularly bright spot recently, especially   for larger firms that operate and sell internationally  We have seen the anticipated improvement in   tourism activity  In talking to contacts in the hospitality industry, including some people who   operate a chain of upscale, upper-end hotels around the country, they say they’ve seen steady   improvement throughout the year  Finally, I would reiterate Bill Poole’s comment about   bottlenecks in the railroad industry and, for that matter, in other forms of transportation as well    That is something that was called to my attention some time ago, and it apparently persists today   As far as the national economy is concerned, there are two issues on my mind  One is   energy prices  The other is equity prices, although my concern about equity prices is offset at least   to a degree by the decline in intermediate- and longer-term interest rates that we’ve seen  But the   August 10, 2004 39 of 103          primary question to me is, have recent developments fundamentally altered the economic outlook?    Or put another way, would I disagree substantially with the Greenbook forecast?  My tentative   answer to that question is, no, I wouldn’t  I’m fairly comfortable with the fundamental outlook   expressed there, and for reasons that have already been cited here—the expansionary stance of both   monetary and fiscal policies, the persistence of a significant advance in productivity, and improving   economies around the world  All those factors continue to give me some confidence that the US   economy will continue to perform reasonably well    Let me make one further comment about energy prices  At least according to the anecdotes   that I’ve been getting, higher oil and gasoline prices seem to be having mostly what I would call   “second-order” effects  That is, nobody is saying that they have laid off people or ended a second   shift or something like that because of higher energy prices  The effects are all showing up in either   explicit surcharges or, more implicitly, through pass-throughs  So whatever effects those higher   prices are having are coming through those channels     It has a nice ring   August 10, 2004 73 of 103            Thank you, Mr Chairman  I, too, support the ¼ point increase in the funds   rate at this stage  Also, I think that the “measured pace” language and the conditional clause have   served us remarkably well so far  I believe that people in the marketplace pretty much understand   what we’re trying to do and where we’re going  The question for me was whether we wanted to   expand that last conditional phrase  There may be some value to doing it, but I agree that it isn’t   August 10, 2004 82 of 103          essential  I don’t think it unduly constrains us  My guess is that we would pause only if the   economy seemed to be going substantially off course     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’m going to take your admonition seriously   and say about the District economy that it continues to track the national economy quite closely,   as it has throughout this recovery  I’m tempted to let it go at that, except there was a   development yesterday that went largely unnoticed and is a cause for celebration  I’m sure you   noticed it; the Minnesota Twins clinched the Central Division for the third consecutive year—  demonstrating once again that a small market team can succeed  [Laughter]   When I think about the national economy, it seems to me that the evolution of the   forecast this year has not been all bad  That’s not a ringing endorsement, I understand  We’re   certainly looking at somewhat slower growth than I had anticipated earlier, but we’re also   looking at a bit lower inflation than I had expected  Beyond that, it seems to me that, if we think   about broad trends rather than meeting-to-meeting fluctuations in the data, changes in the   forecast, and clouds that appear from time to time and then dissipate, we see the following    Growth last year was 4½ percent in real terms and is likely to be something like 4 percent this   year  The unemployment rate has declined—perhaps not quite as much as measured, but it has   declined  Inflation is low—and it’s certainly low in the historical context of most of the postwar   period—and it seems likely to stay there  Moreover, I think the outlook is positive, and I say this   for essentially two reasons  One is productivity, and the other is history  Although history   obviously doesn’t repeat itself precisely, I think there is a message in the long expansions of the   1980s and the 1990s, which is that the economy is fundamentally resilient and fundamentally   September 21, 2004 50 of 100          flexible  Expansions, once established, don’t terminate quickly  And from that perspective, I   think we’re in good shape overall   On the employment situation, the staff probably recalls that I’ve been skeptical about the   employment forecast for some time  Now I find myself skeptical about the explanation pointing   to a reluctance to hire  I guess I’m an outlier in this regard, but I must say that for quite some   time no business person I’ve talked to has expressed anything special about his or her   willingness or unwillingness to hire  My sense of the situation is that they’re making the same   kinds of decisions they always make with regard to these kinds of issues  Now, if we mean by   “reluctance to hire” that we can’t explain the slow improvement in employment, I agree with   that  But I really don’t know that there’s anything special there   Finally, with regard to our earlier discussion on exchange rates, I certainly don’t object to   thinking about how that might play out and what our role might be  But as I think Karen   observed, it doesn’t have to play out in a disorderly fashion  And it seems to me that, if we want   to avoid the risk that movements in exchange rates could turn disorderly, we’re going to have to   adhere to sound policies in any event      I’m not sure  That move may be necessary but not sufficient  [Laughter]      I, too, support your recommendation, and I would largely echo Bill   Poole’s remarks     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Let me start with just a few comments about the   District economy  Recent reports on consumer spending have been mixed; we had one relatively   strong month of spending on autos and in non-auto retail sales, followed by a much more modest   pace of sales in the next month  An area that has picked up, though, has been tourism, where better   weather late in the summer and in the fall has clearly benefited that sector  Manufacturing has   continued to expand in the District, and agriculture appears to be having a good year for the most   part   A little over a week ago, we hosted at the Bank a meeting on housing and residential   construction activity  There were several reasons for this  One, of course, was the fact that we hear   periodic discussions of a potential bubble in house prices  But second, I’ve been struck, as I’ve   watched developments in the Twin Cities and as I’ve traveled around other cities in the last several   years, by the absolutely high level of construction activity that seems to be occurring  It’s not only   new building, but conversions of all sorts of warehouses, schools, and former office buildings to   residential property  A change in mix seems to be occurring as well, with more of the construction   and renovation yielding townhouses and condominiums rather than the standard single-family   home   I thought it would be a good idea to try to get some other people’s perspective on this, so we   had at the meeting a group of developers, lenders, consultants, and economists  They brought a   national perspective, although they did have special expertise in the Twin Cities market and a few   other particular markets across the country  In general, I would say that their comments were   positive and largely unsurprising  There was little overall concern about a bubble in house prices   November 10, 2004 48 of 107    and little anticipation of a major correction in house prices in the near term  There was, however,   fairly widespread agreement that the pace of increase was likely to slow going forward   Let me just note three specific issues that came up because I, at least, found them of interest    The first, which it won’t surprise this group to hear, is that they attributed a good deal of the   strength in housing to very favorable financial conditions  In this regard they talked not only about   low interest rates but also lower down-payment requirements  I might add that a couple of the   lenders did say that they thought the credit pendulum had swung too far  They felt that credit   conditions had become too easy, and they were anticipating some potential difficulties going   forward—presumably in somebody else’s shop!  [Laughter]  Second, they reported that at least in   some markets a significant percentage of the purchases of new units were by investors, where the   term “investors” means people who don’t intend to occupy the property, at least not immediately    As best they could judge, in some markets investors were buying up to 30 percent of the new   additions to supply  And finally, they noted that there seemed to be some acceleration of purchases   by first-time homebuyers who were concerned that they were going to be priced out of the market if   they waited longer  The implications of that, of course, are that at some point such sales will slow   because people will have acted if they could  So that’s a summary of that meeting   Let me turn to just a few comments on the national economy  To me, the outlook for the   national economy continues to remain favorable  I’d like to think that I would have made that   statement even without the October employment report, but of course that’s a counterfactual, so we   won’t be able to observe it  But I do believe that growth is on a favorable trend  I personally think   that the economy will grow a little more rapidly next year than the projection in the Greenbook, and   I expect inflation to remain low   I’ve been asking myself this question  What is the neutral real federal funds rate?  I find   that a challenging concept, but I’ve tentatively decided to think about it in terms of what the rate is   November 10, 2004 49 of 107    that would be consistent with our price or inflation objective over time  Now, of course, we haven’t   formalized an inflation target, so I’m using the working definition of price stability  That’s what I   have in mind  And it seems to me, without going out on any limbs here, that it’s safe to say that the   funds rate continues to be lower than it will need to be in the long run, so the trajectory we’re on   seems to me to be appropriate  Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support the recommendation of B′  It seems to   me that there is no need to change the language, at least at this point, because I think market   participants understand the conditional nature of what’s going on here  So in that sense, I think   we’re positioned rather well  I remain open as to when we may want to change the language and   how we may want to change it, but for now I think we’re still reasonably well positioned     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ve felt for a long time that the minutes, given   the way we currently handle the timing of their release, are an unappreciated or at least   underappreciated asset  So I continue to strongly favor moving up the release date  I think Don   basically made the case, so let me just quickly summarize things as I see them     In my experience, the minutes are accurate, they are comprehensive, and they are valuable    They illustrate the thinking of the Committee, and they get into the issues that we discuss when we   consider policy  I think all of that is important to communicate to the public  In short, I believe it   would improve communication to release the minutes earlier, when people would have an incentive   to take a real interest in them  And that, to me, is the reason for doing it     I agree that there are some potential downsides, and I don’t want to overstate or exaggerate   the benefits  But I do believe that, on balance, the benefits are rather compelling  I also think that   it’s certainly possible from time to time that market participants will read something in the minutes   that we believe is innocuous and make a lot more of it than we would  But in my view we shouldn’t   be so paternalistic and worry that, if market participants don’t get it right every time, something has   gone seriously wrong  Most market participants are smart, sophisticated people, and I think, on   balance, they will get it right most of the time; and when they don’t, that’s their business     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Comments from directors and from a wide range   of contacts indicate further improvement in the District economy—indeed some acceleration   recently—and the improvement is quite broadly based  Given that, let me just comment on a couple   of developments that seem particularly relevant  There have been in the District sustained, albeit   moderate, gains in employment for better than a year now  Hiring plans are positive, according to   our most recent survey, and some skills are now in short supply  The investment outlook appears to   have improved recently  Some projects that were on the back burner, according to business   contacts, have now been moved forward  In general, I think businessmen are feeling a bit more   upbeat, and that is fueling some enthusiasm for further investment  The final point I would mention   about the District economy is that, despite tightening labor markets, wage increases remain   subdued—generally in the 2 to 3 percent range—and price pressures are modest as well   As far as the national economy is concerned, I think it’s perhaps at least worth noting that   the current expansion is now into its fourth year, and recently at least things have been turning out   pretty much as we expected  Now, that might be a reason to worry, but I prefer to look on the bright   side of that  I agree with a point that Dave Stockton mentioned—that the fundamentals supporting   further economic growth from here forward are distinctly positive  If I were writing down a GDP   December 14, 2004 39 of 118           forecast at the moment, I might write down something a little stronger than the Greenbook forecast   for both 2005 and 2006   On the inflation side, I do expect inflation to remain low, but I must admit that I’m a little   less confident about that than I was a few months ago  If I ask myself why, I think it has mostly to   do with the dollar  It’s not so much that I’m concerned about the pass-through, narrowly defined;   it’s really more a concern about the changing nature of the competitive environment implied by the   declining dollar  And that gives me a bit of pause as I contemplate inflation prospects  But I think   that’s a pretty slim reed to hang all that much on, so I personally would stick with a low inflation   forecast for now   Having said all that, it seems to me that the policy course is pretty clear here  We should   continue with the policy path that we’ve been on  Thank you     I, too, support your recommendation, and I agree that this is not the time to   try to fine-tune the signal  I don’t think the case is sufficiently compelling to do that    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Let me make just a few broad comments    Normally, when I start thinking about these kinds of issues, I ask myself what is broken that we’re   trying to fix Here I ask myself Do we want to be more explicit about a price or inflation objective?   My answer to that is “yes,” but it’s not because I’m trying to fix something  I view it as the next   logical step in more or less formalizing what we really have been doing over the past decade or   more—what I would call trying to lock in past successes  So to me that’s the most compelling   rationale for seriously considering taking this step   As I said, I’ve already come down pretty favorably on it, but I have two reservations that   give me some pause  Let me just mention them  They’ve already come up  One is Will we send   the wrong signal about our dual mandate?  I think Tom Hoenig already addressed that in suggesting   that we can clarify that through communication  Many of us already address that when we’re out in   public by emphasizing the significance of price stability or low inflation, but indicating that the   underlying reason for our commitment to price stability is how it affects economic performance           February 1-2, 2005 25 of 177  The second concern that gives me a bit of pause is Would this inappropriately tie our hands   under certain circumstances?  There I concluded that, first of all, if there were a legitimate crisis, we   wouldn’t have any difficulty explaining why we were deviating from whatever inflation objective   we had announced If we were concerned about deflation, I don’t see any conflict because people   would see what we were doing and the reasons for it would line up So it seems to me that would be   a concern only if we had a strange confluence of circumstances where inflation was an issue but   simultaneously we were experiencing subpar growth or something like that  In such a case, I think   Bill Poole’s comments about the 1970s are relevant  First of all, I don’t know what the probability is   of the confluence of those kinds of events It’s probably going to be low  But secondly, I think it is   worthwhile to have our hands tied at a time such as that    Thank you The broad-based expansion in our District continues    Employment gains have been modest but persistent  In talking to employers, the general impression   I get is that they are finding labor availability to be ample, although occasionally they’ve expressed   some concern about the shortage of particular skills  At the same time, they have mentioned some   apprehension about labor supply going forward And I’ve noticed that a couple of large employers                                February 1-2, 2005 97 of 177  recently have returned to running job fairs—something that we haven’t seen in recent years  Outside   the labor market, the manufacturing sector in our District is strong  Housing continues to operate at   a high level Mining, energy, and agriculture, outside of the areas that were affected by drought, all   had good years and appear to be in good shape   We recently queried some of our directors and other business leaders about inflation,   particularly inflation over the past three months—essentially, the fourth quarter of last year  The   reports we got back were uniformly along the following lines  There has been no detectable   acceleration of inflation, and, if anything, there has been a diminution of inflationary pressures   As far as the national economy is concerned, my forecast is very close to the central   tendency reported in the chart show I took the tenor of the chart show to mean, as I thought about   it, that there’s not really very much wrong with the economy at the moment—depending on the   significance one might attach to the current account deficit  Beyond that, it seems to me that   inflationary expectations remain essentially very well anchored  All of this suggests to me that the   policy path we’ve been on is appropriate and that we should continue on that path    I support the recommendation    Dave, I’m interested in your work on labor force participation  We’ve   been looking at that a bit, too Can you give me a sense of what’s driving the new forecast of a   leveling off in labor force participation rates of women?    Thanks    Thank you, Mr Chairman  The broad-based expansion in our District   economy persists  Employment is continuing to increase  The manufacturing sector is a standout,                    March 22, 2005 50 of 116  growing rapidly Demand for construction equipment reportedly is very strong  Backlogs are   building in that sector, and there are long lead times  There is an emerging scarcity of some skilled   labor The mining and energy sectors, not surprisingly, are strong  Housing construction activity   remains robust, although sales have slowed a bit year-over-year  The concerns expressed by   business leaders are the usual suspects medical insurance costs, rising raw material prices—   including energy, of course—and rising transportation costs   Turning to broader issues, based on the tenor of the incoming information on the economy   and on my earlier forecast, the national economy continues to look quite good to me  It’s still early   in the game, of course, but 4 percent real growth this year looks like a reasonable forecast  It would   not be a stretch but simply a continuation of what we’ve experienced in the previous two years   As far as inflation is concerned, I do not expect a material acceleration in core measures of   inflation this year Nevertheless, I do see signs that there is some buildup in price pressures    Therefore, it seems to me that the risks we are confronting are in the process of shifting, mostly   because the risks of a subpar or disappointing performance of the real economy have diminished but   also because the inflation pressures have perhaps ticked up a notch   I think the policy implication of this is that we can continue for now with the program that   we have been on of ¼-point increases in the funds rate But I do think we need to modify the   language in the announcement to reflect changing circumstances and to preserve internal   consistency    I, too, favor the 25 basis point increase, and I’m comfortable with the   language of alternative B Looking forward, I do think we have an obligation to communicate   clearly about policy prospects, to the extent that we can And if this involves from time to time   sharing our uncertainty with market participants, then so be it    Thank you Well, two issues have been weighing on my mind  They’re   really the two issues that Dave Stockton addressed First, is the recent reduction in the Greenbook   forecast roughly appropriate, or will the economy do appreciably worse or possibly significantly   better than that?  Second, is the forecast of modest inflation still tenable in the face of the increase in   most core measures that we have seen?   I must say that I think there is a danger of over-interpreting and overemphasizing a batch of   statistics, all of which became available within several weeks in April, given their reliability or   unreliability and given that not all of them seemed to me to be a particular surprise  Still, I wouldn’t   totally dismiss them, so I am inclined to reduce my forecast of growth, although it’s perhaps still a   bit above the Greenbook projection of 3½ percent Plus, for what it’s worth, our internal forecasting   model grinds out about 3 percent growth quarter after quarter  I’m more optimistic than that and                                 May 3, 2005 37 of 116  maybe a touch more optimistic than the Greenbook for three sets of reasons one, the fundamentals;   two, the nature of the anecdotes I’ve been getting; and three—and perhaps most importantly—   history   As far as the fundamentals are concerned, we have the usual suspects that we’ve been talking   about at this table for several years now continuing comfortable financial market conditions,   underlying expansion in productivity, a general lack of supply-side constraints, and still healthy   consumer and corporate balance sheets on average   As for the anecdotes, discussions with business leaders in our District and an examination of   District economic data for the most part yield positive conclusions  Manufacturing is clearly   continuing to advance, employment is increasing, and labor markets appear to be gradually   tightening, especially in areas where mining and energy activity are strong  Consumer spending   activity is continuing to expand, and reports on capital spending and commentary associated with   capital spending from directors are really quite strong overall  All of this is balanced a bit by a note   of caution, which has crept in among firms with large exposures in the transportation sector, but I   would have to say that the anecdotes preponderantly have really been quite positive   As far as history is concerned, I consider particularly relevant the long expansions of the   1980s and the 1990s In my view, those expansions were not particularly dependent on good luck   nor on astute policies conducted with exquisite precision, although I do believe that policy made a   positive contribution But I think the real lesson of those expansions was that the economy is   fundamentally sound, flexible, and resilient  And I don’t think those traits have been altered or have   diminished just because we’re in a new decade  So that gives me a fair amount of confidence that   the outlook remains favorable and that the expansion remains well grounded                                 May 3, 2005 38 of 116  As to inflation, I continue to think that moderate inflation will prevail, with the performance   of core prices probably at a pace comparable to that over the last five or six years on average  Still,   there is no denying that core measures of inflation have been increasing persistently since late ’03,   and this does give me a bit more concern  And it makes me a little more cautious than I was   formerly about the inflation situation currently and about the outlook for inflation  Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I, too, think the ¼ point increase in the funds rate   target is appropriate, and the language in alternative B is fine with me today  I don’t think it’s   essential to make any major changes in the language at the moment, and it’s probably not a good   idea                                    May 3, 2005 100 of 116  I do agree with President Yellen and others that the balance-of-risk statements should   probably be jettisoned at the earliest opportunity But I would also say that I think there is value in   providing some forward-looking guidance to the markets  More generally, among other things, it   helps to assure a certain consistency in policy, and I think that is of value as well    Yes  I have a question for Karen about a couple of the charts  One of the   things that struck me in looking at the charts for the United Kingdom—whether you look at price­  to-rent ratios or real house prices—is that they obviously have gone through several very sharp   swings If you look at the US historical charts, they’re pretty benign  Dave was just talking about   the possible fallout of sharp swings in those measures here, and I was curious whether we could   learn anything about the macro consequences or the macro conditions associated with what has   happened in the UK    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Anecdotes from our directors and others,   incoming data on the regional and national economies, and the results from running our forecasting   models all appear to me to be consistent with real GDP growth of 3 percent or more  Personally,   like many others, I expect growth of around 3½ percent—the kind of expansion we have been   experiencing   I’ve been struck most recently, as I reviewed the latest anecdotes and the incoming evidence   on the economy, by the breadth of the positive reports, though of course much of what we have   been seeing is a continuation of what has been going on for some time  So I’ll just cover the   positive things very, very quickly sustained strength in home prices, sales, and residential   construction activity; incipient improvement in nonresidential construction activity; expansion in   manufacturing in the aggregate; moderate gains in employment; continuing increases in consumer   spending; and a positive situation with regard to capital spending     As Sandy Pianalto just noted, there are parts of our economy—what I guess I would call   “old industrial America”—such as domestically owned automobile producers and their suppliers,   and though not industrial, the hub-and-spoke airlines, where there are lots of problems  But it seems   to me that the forecasts adequately allow for those circumstances already  So, to me, the economy   and the economic expansion appear to be on solid footing    As to inflation, I have not changed my forecast, but I must admit I am a little less   comfortable about the situation than I was formerly  That’s partly because we’ve gotten a little   more inflation this year and last year than I had earlier anticipated  But also, as I listened to Dave   Wilcox’s attribution analysis, I got a little nervous  I’ve had a lot of experience doing those kinds of   things, and one can always parse the numbers that way  What I think it misses from time to time is                         June 29-30, 2005 131 of 234  the underlying dynamics or interactions of the price performance  So I’m a little more concerned   than I was formerly that inflation, if not tilted to the upside, is at least getting locked in at a   somewhat higher rate   Having said all of that, it seems to me that as far as policy is concerned we have been on the   appropriate course and we should continue on that course  I think the policy implications are really   rather straightforward    I, too, support the recommendation and the language, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  The District economy continues to track the   national economy quite closely, as it has for a long time  And as I commented at the last   meeting, what is striking about the District economy right now is the breadth of the economic   expansion Virtually all sectors are either strong or improving, and I won’t go through a review   item by item  I will say that with the growth in economic activity in the District and with                   August 9, 2005 46 of 110  improving employment conditions, wage increases still remain quite modest, as best I can judge    And inflationary pressures haven’t changed, as best I can assess the situation   As far as the national economy is concerned, we’re now almost four years into the current   economic expansion and, overall, things look quite good to me  That in a way is remarkable in   and of itself, as I think of the conversations we’ve had around this table over the last four years   and the variety of concerns and issues that were raised  To be sure, policy has played a role in   supporting this economic performance but, as I’ve commented before, I think once again we are   observing the fundamental soundness, resilience, and flexibility of the economy   The situation is starting to resemble in broad terms, in my mind at least, the long   expansions of the ’80s and ’90s  In fact, without stretching too far, I think one could perhaps   make the case that the situation is even a little better than a few years into those expansions    After all, today we have low interest rates, low inflation rates, well-anchored inflationary   expectations, for the most part a fairly well-balanced domestic economy, and what I might call a   promising international economy  I call it promising not because I’m thinking about Europe or   Japan, but because I’m thinking about China and India and some of their smaller brethren   There are some issues, to be sure  One is oil prices, which have already been mentioned   today The federal budget situation is another one, although I think that’s more a secular than a   cyclical problem  And then there are housing prices  All I would say there is that even if there is   a bubble, and even if it bursts, the quantitative significance of that remains quite unclear, as far   as I’m concerned   I do think we need to pay considerable attention, as we have been, to the inflation   situation, but my sense of the situation is that there is no significant deterioration under way or   imminent at the moment  And I’m inclined to stick to my random walk methodology for                       August 9, 2005 47 of 110  forecasting inflation It has worked remarkably well for a good number of years now    [Laughter] Having said that, I do think it’s appropriate to continue with the policy path we’ve   been on That seems, given the way the economy has evolved, fully appropriate to me    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I, too, am comfortable with your   recommendation, and I’m also happy to resist the temptation to change the language any more   than necessary at this point Going forward, my preference would be to continue, where   possible, to provide some guidance  But that’s an issue for another day    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Let me start with a few pertinent facts about   the District economy, both pre- and post-Katrina  Overall, the District economy remains healthy    Employment is continuing to advance modestly; and in at least a few geographic areas, it seems   likely that employment gains are being constrained by a lack of available labor  Construction   activity, both residential and nonresidential, is strong and/or improving  And one of the large   credit card issuers in our District has reported—and I think this is reflective of national   conditions—that repayments on credit card debt are up and charge-offs are at a 10-year low     Higher fuel prices so far have not led to production cutbacks or plant closings in the   District Where possible, firms are switching to less expensive sources of energy, and surcharges   are, of course, common Higher energy prices do, though, seem to be particularly adverse for   local governments and for farmers, who are also adversely affected by the infrastructure   destruction and disruption in the Gulf area   As for the effects of Katrina on the national economy, at the qualitative level I think we   actually have considerable experience in analyzing these kinds of shocks, and in my view the   Greenbook at that level has it essentially right  It seems to me, as others have commented, that   in the short term we will get a disruption to growth followed by a rebound and presumably   ultimately a resumption of trend growth  And, as far as inflation is concerned, I think we will get   an acceleration ultimately followed by a return to trend, assuming that policy adheres more or   less to the path that it would have followed   At the quantitative level, though, it seems to me difficult to say anything precise with a   lot of confidence But I would venture that in these circumstances—because of the concentration   of the population, the number of people affected by the disaster, and the affected area’s location                         September 20, 2005 65 of 117  relative to the energy and transportation infrastructure—the amplitude of the swings, both in   terms of growth and inflation, and perhaps the duration of the adjustment, would be extended    There’s a temptation, I suppose, to exaggerate this  After all, a relatively small part of the   economy is affected  But it seems to me that, in any event, uncertainty has increased  And if   this overall description is roughly appropriate, then I find thinking about monetary policy more   complicated than it was formerly  Moreover, I don’t think the situation is going to get clarified   in the near term, because the incoming data, of course, will be difficult to read, given that they   will be affected in one way or another by both the disruption and the recovery efforts as they   proceed   In these circumstances, I feel most comfortable falling back on fundamentals—namely,   the flexibility and strength of the underlying economy, which I don’t think are affected by this    So I come out with a view that it’s appropriate to continue on our path of removing policy   accommodation, and I would favor a ¼ point increase in the fed funds rate  Having said that, I   think we are getting to the point where we’ve removed a lot of accommodation  And one of   these days we need to consider that and also think about how that ought to affect the language in   the statement    I, too, support your recommendation, Mr Chairman  I have some   sympathy with your warning about the 1970s and the way things gradually kind of got away   from us  Having said that, I’d like to think that we’ll succeed in conducting policy in a more   effective way this time around    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Changes in District economic conditions have been   small recently and seemingly largely offset each other  So the economy overall continues on a   positive path   Housing activity, especially the pace of sales, has been slowing recently, although to some   extent that is seasonal  But I think it’s fair to say that overall some of the vigor in housing is in the   process of diminishing  In contrast, commercial real estate development has been picking up   modestly and in a number of locations throughout the District, and developers seem more optimistic   than they have for some time  Manufacturing activity is continuing to advance  The mining and   energy industries are operating at high levels of capacity, as you would expect  And employment is   increasing, except at Northwest Airlines   I don’t think the underlying fundamentals of inflation have changed recently, but there are a   few more reports in the District of the ability to pass through cost increases—more reports than I   had been hearing formerly  Also, at a meeting of our Advisory Council on Small Business and   Labor, there were more reports of products on allocation than I had expected to hear  While there   are ready substitutes for some of these products, for others, like concrete, that’s not quite the case    And that will be, without question, constraining activity relative to what otherwise would have   occurred   As far as the national economy is concerned, I don’t have any material disagreement with the   Greenbook assessment of the outlook although, if left to my own devices, I might write down a little   more real growth in the next several quarters  My sense is that the economy has a good deal of                               November 1, 2005 58 of 114  positive momentum to it, as others have observed, and spending associated with recovery from   Hurricane Katrina will add to that  I am also encouraged on balance by the modest reports on core   measures of inflation for the last couple of quarters  So, overall, both the current state of the   economy and its prospects look favorable to me  Core inflation may tick up a bit, as depicted in the   Greenbook, but I would expect that to be temporary  And as far as the risks of stagflation are   concerned, while I certainly wouldn’t dismiss that as a possibility—and I would acknowledge that   the episode in the mid- and late-1970s initially, as I recall, snuck up on policymakers—it’s hard for   me to develop a stagflation scenario without serious monetary policy errors  And that’s in our   power to avoid   Against that background, I would favor another ¼ percentage point increase in the funds rate   at this meeting  I would also endorse the comments of President Yellen about the need to review   and make some significant changes to the statement accompanying our decision  And I think there   may be some urgency to that  One way of viewing that, at least as I’ve been thinking about it, is   that if we continue on the path we’re on, we’ll be looking at a nominal federal funds rate of 4½   percent before long and a real rate north of 2 percent  At that point, are we still going to be willing   to talk about removing policy accommodation?  Will we be willing to do it at 4¼?  Today we’ll be   at 4 percent, so I don’t think the time is far off when we’re going to have to confront these issues     I support all parts of the recommendation—the change in the funds rate, the   existing language, and the possibility that we will alter the familiar language at the next meeting    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Let me try to restart this discussion by saying, first,   that I largely agree with the Greenbook assessment of the economy and, in particular, with the overall   positive economic outlook it presents  This is consistent with the incoming data on the national   economy that we’ve received recently and with the preponderance of recent reports on the District   economy as well  Notably, the District is benefiting from an overall good year in agriculture,   sustained improvement in the manufacturing sector, and what I would call positive substitution effects   stemming from hurricane-related disruptions elsewhere, which have led, for example, to more   shipping out of the Port of Duluth-Superior than otherwise would have occurred, more volume for   local trucking firms, and so forth   One minor difference I might have with the Greenbook outlook pertains to the labor market   and the unemployment rate It seems to me that the forecast for economic growth in 2006 overall is   not terribly different from what we’ve had in ’04 and ’05  And cumulatively, the unemployment rate                         December 13, 2005 50 of 100  dropped nearly a full percentage point from the end of 2003 to the end of 2005  Using that as a rough   guide or rule of thumb, I would think we’d get at least some modest further decline in the rate of   unemployment next year  I would hasten to add—and I think this is potentially a more important and   maybe also a more controversial point—that even if we get that drop in the unemployment rate, it   wouldn’t affect my inflation forecast  In fact, looking at the totality of the information available, I   don’t think that the risks to the core inflation outlook are skewed one way or the other, and I’m   inclined to agree with Dave Stockton’s assessment that inflationary pressures are close to topping out    I say this because incoming data on core inflation have been relatively favorable, bond markets   suggest to me that inflation expectations remain well anchored, and a lot of policy accommodation   has been removed     Indeed, summing up these factors as well as the results from most versions of the Taylor rule   presented in the Bluebook, calculations with Fisher-type interest rate equations, and the Greenbook   forecast itself, it seems to me that after this meeting we will at least be very close to the point where   we will have raised the federal funds rate sufficiently for now  Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I agree with the recommendation to raise the   federal funds rate target by ¼ percentage point, and I can accept the language in alternative B as it is   drafted here   If I were the policy czar on this, I would make an argument to take out “measured” on the   grounds that we want to at least alert market participants to the prospect that we’re getting close to   ending the more or less automatic ¼ percentage point increases, because we’re getting close to having   removed all of the policy accommodation that we need to remove  President Moskow made the other   side of the argument for removing “measured,” and I took your comments as implicitly working in the   same direction  So I think “measured” ought to come out, if not at this meeting, soon; it seems to me   that it certainly has about outlived its usefulness   I would also, if I had my druthers, replace “likely” with just “may” or “may well”  But as I   said, I can accept this language as drafted, because I don’t have any special insights as to whether   market participants are going to like one word better than another  But of course, however the market                                   December 13, 2005 78 of 100  happens to react, the relatively prompt release of the minutes will help because the market will get a   more complete picture of our thinking within a relatively short period of time     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Let me start with one anecdote about housing   activity in the District  I don’t know how representative this is nationwide, obviously, but there are   signs of slowing in both housing construction and, more dramatically, in sales recently  And this   winter in the Twin Cities, several hundred unionized construction workers are not working  Last   year 100 percent were  But they’re all expected to be back at work in the spring, and that suggests   January 31, 2006 53 of 106    to me—and this is more a question than a conclusion—that the ultimate correction in housing may   occur later and be more severe than I was earlier expecting   As far as the national economy is concerned, like others, I am inclined to discount the fourth   quarter  I find the Greenbook story about the outlook reasonably convincing  I personally think that   we will see pretty good growth in both ’06 and ’07  I tend to rely, as you know, on the underlying   fundamentals and the resilience of the economy, and those things seem to me to be sound and in   place  And so I think the overall outlook is pretty good   I do think that there was a disconnect in the fourth quarter between the supply or output side   and the demand side  If you look at the numbers for employment and hours, you would have   certainly come up with a stronger forecast  Now, you may plug in a negative productivity number    That’s one way of reconciling it  Maybe the November and December employment data will get   revised down  I guess that’s another way of reconciling it  Perhaps some of the aggregate demand   components will ultimately be revised up a bit  But there does seem to be a disconnect there,   nothing that I find all that troubling, but something I think worth bearing in mind if we want to think   about the fourth quarter   I think the key to the outlook and to policy going forward, though, is inflation  And I went   and looked at what has happened to the core PCE over the past eight or nine years  And the range   of increases in core PCE inflation over that period was about 1¼ to 2¼ percent, and I think the   average over the past eight or nine years was something like 1¾ percent  I don’t cite those numbers   just to prove that I can look them up  I cite them because I would characterize that whole period as   a period of low inflation, maybe something resembling price stability  And if I ask myself, “Is   inflation likely to break out on the high side of that range in the relatively near term?” my answer to   January 31, 2006 54 of 106    that is “no”  And I think most bond market participants, at least the way they are pricing things,   would also answer that question with a “no”   Part of that is, of course, that we have been moving policy, and it seems to me that policy,   measured by the real federal funds rate, is now certainly in the ballpark where it needs to be  I   anticipate that we’ll move again today, as I think we should, in part to validate market expectations    Is policy perfectly positioned within the ballpark?  Well, I don’t know the answer to that, but I do   think it is well positioned within the ballpark, and I think we need to bear that in mind as we go   forward     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I find myself in agreement with, I guess,   everybody who has already spoken  The ¼ point increase seems appropriate to me  I’m   comfortable with the language as proposed, and I think we should defer the discussion of ownership   of the statement until March
