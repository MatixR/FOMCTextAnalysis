7525,2005-06-29," The top left panel of exhibit 11 presents our outlook for foreign  real GDP growth We forecast total foreign growth to move back up this quarter from  a soft first-quarter pace and to rise a bit further going forward  The pickup is modest  and reflects our assessment of the balance between some opposing forces  On the one  hand, higher oil prices, while supportive for some economies, are expected to damp  activity, on balance, for our foreign aggregate, which is weighted by US exports   On the other hand, financial conditions appear to be more uniformly supportive of  growth abroad Many foreign currencies have depreciated against the dollar since the  beginning of the year and, as shown on the right, stock prices in emerging-market and  industrial economies have moved up since the middle of last year  Emerging-market  bond spreads, shown in the bottom left panel, backed up a bit from their lows earlier  this year but are still tight by historical standards  And benchmark long-term interest  rates abroad have moved substantially lower, as shown by the red line in the bottom  right panel   The widespread decline of long-term rates has been a prominent topic of  discussion recently, and many hypotheses have been offered to explain it  I do not  propose to resolve that debate  [Laughter] However, the extent to which rates have  declined has varied across countries  Why this might be so is the subject of your next  exhibit As shown in the top left panel, the yield on the German government bond  was essentially equal to the 10-year Treasury yield in October 2003, a date that falls  before any of the central banks discussed on this page began tightening monetary  policy Since then, the bund yield has declined about 120 basis points and is  currently just off its record low of 310 percent  The yield on the Canadian bond,  shown in the next column to the right, has declined nearly as much, at 110 basis  points over the 20-month period  These developments contrast with the smaller net  decline of 80 basis points in the United Kingdom, and the much smaller net declines  of 40 basis points in the United States, and 20 basis points in Japan  The size of the  decline may have been more limited in Japan than in the other economies because of  the proximity of the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates   As shown in the middle row of panels, most of the decline in foreign long-term  yields appears to be related to a slide in real interest rates  Inflation compensation, as  measured by the spread between these nominal and inflation-indexed interest rates,  has not changed appreciably on balance for these economies over the past 20 months                               June 29-30, 2005 89 of 234  The relative size of these real and nominal yield movements appears to reflect  monetary policy actions taken during the period as well as expected future actions   With the exception of Japan, long-term rates have fallen more in economies where  tightening has been the least  None of the major foreign central banks has tightened  monetary policy as much as the FOMC has over this period  As shown in the first  panel of the bottom row, monetary policy in the euro area, where the largest decline  in bond yields occurred, has been on hold since June 2003  Market expectations that  the ECB might soon raise rates, a view heavily promoted in ECB rhetoric of only a  month ago, have all but vanished In Canada, where bond yields have declined  substantially also, the Bank of Canada has lowered policy rates on net since October  2003, but markets appear to expect the tightening that occurred in September and  October of last year to resume in future months  In contrast, the Bank of England, the  first of these central banks to start tightening, in November 2003, has raised its policy  rate 125 basis points over the period, and at this point markets appear to expect that  the next move for the Bank will be to lower the policy rate  Nonetheless, long-term  rates are down whereas short-term rates are up  Monetary policy at the Bank of Japan  (BOJ) has not changed significantly The BOJ has continued to pursue quantitative  easing, and reserve balances stepped up over the period   The low level of real long-term interest rates in the euro area and Japan should  help smooth the way for more robust expansion of activity in those economies  Other  financial factors, presented in your next exhibit, should also lend support  Positive  equity earnings forecasts, shown at the top left, should help lift stock prices and  reduce the cost of equity finance for firms  Forecasts of earnings per share, drawn  from surveys of equity analysts in mid-June, put earnings this year above last year’s,  and forecasts for 2006 show further increases BBB corporate bond spreads, shown  to the right, are relatively low, which implies that corporate bond financing costs have  generally followed government yields down  And the recent depreciation of the euro  and yen in foreign exchange markets, shown in real effective terms in the middle left  panel, should provide some boost to net exports going forward   Despite these positive financial conditions, higher oil prices, firms’ reluctance to  invest, and worker concerns about wages, pensions, and employment are restraining  growth, especially in the euro area  As shown by the black and blue lines in the  middle right panel, confidence in the euro area has taken a beating, with industrial  confidence dropping sharply and consumer confidence remaining low  All told, we  see euro-area growth, shown in the bottom left panel, slowing some this quarter  before eventually edging higher, to about 1¾ percent in the second half of this year  and next year The outlook for Japan, while not much stronger, at least has a slight  upward trend, driven by a slow but steady further increase in employment and  incomes  As shown at the right, Japanese GDP growth rebounded sharply in the first  quarter, led by strong gains in consumption and investment spending  Inventory  accumulation also contributed positively  We expect growth this quarter to drop  back, as inventories are run down and as consumer and business spending growth  moderates                              June 29-30, 2005 90 of 234  Your next exhibit examines the potential implications of recent changes in the  behavior of Chinese trade The top left panel shows a 12-month moving sum of  China’s merchandise trade balance over the past 20 years  In recent months, the  Chinese trade surplus has jumped to record levels  As shown on the right, exports  have continued to grow along trend, but imports appear to be decelerating  The  counterpart of the lower import growth is showing up elsewhere in Asia as a slowing  of exports to China As shown in the middle left panel, the growth of exports to  China from Taiwan, Korea, and Japan, three of the region’s largest economies and  also three of China’s top trading partners, has dropped from very rapid rates to near  zero We see two developments that are consistent with this shift  One is that  economic activity in China is decelerating  Policy measures adopted a year ago to  restrain runaway investment spending, which had increased more than 40 percent  over the four-quarter period immediately prior to the implementation of the measures,  may be beginning to show through to GDP  Our forecast for growth in China, shown  in the middle right, has growth stepping down to 7½ percent by the end of this year,  as we regard the double-digit GDP growth rates of the recent past as unsustainable   The other development is that China may be turning inward for some items that it had  been importing, including heavy industry items like iron and steel and road vehicles   As shown at the bottom left, exports of road vehicles have ramped up since 2002, and  exports of iron and steel rocketed up last year, as capacity to produce steel internally  came on line   As shown in the bottom right panel, China’s extraordinary growth does not seem  to have triggered broad-based inflation pressures  The consumer price inflation bulge  in 2004 came almost entirely from increases in food prices, and they have not  persisted   Your final exhibit presents our outlook for commodity prices and the US  external accounts As shown by the black line in the top left panel, prices of nonfuel  primary commodities have increased substantially in the past three years, boosted in  part by global growth but lifted also by the depreciation of the dollar, shown at the  right The metals price component of this index (the red line) has registered the  largest price gains Over the next year and a half, primary commodity prices are  forecast to change little, as world demand is expected to stay strong and supply  response comes on line   The spot price of oil, shown in the middle left panel, has continued to rise, as has  the price implied by futures contracts maturing about six years out, shown by the red  line Increasing doubts about future supply from Russia, Venezuela, Iran, and Iraq  have apparently cooled expectations that oil prices will retreat much from their  current, elevated levels  Potential supply shortfalls are of particular concern because  OPEC has little spare capacity and world oil demand is expected to continue to be  strong   Our outlook for the US current account deficit is shown to the right  The deficit  is projected to widen from about $780 billion in the first quarter of this year to                        June 29-30, 2005 91 of 234  $960 billion, or about 7¼ percent of US GDP, by the fourth quarter of 2006  With  the dollar projected to depreciate only modestly from its current level, US GDP  growth on a par with or above aggregate foreign growth, and oil prices remaining  high, the trade balance, shown at the bottom left, deteriorates $113 billion further  over the forecast period The projected decline in net investment income is almost as  large, at $79 billion The growing negative contribution of net investment income to  the deficit reflects expanded net holdings of US liabilities and an assumed increase  in US short-term interest rates   The dollar?    It depends on how far into the future you want to go  It’s an unsustainable   path   I think we’re seeing attempts now in some parts of the Middle East, such as   Saudi Arabia, to try to expand capacity for oil  As for these alternative sources, I don’t know if   we’ve reached the trigger points yet where expanding their production has become profitable   I’m not sure   In part it is the supply response in some of the metals and presumably in   food and other—                                June 29-30, 2005 104 of 234  These forecasts are based on the futures quotes  There may be some   differences in view between our forecast for China compared with what the futures markets are   thinking They might be a bit more upbeat about the outlook for China But we do have a little   downward tilt here, and I think it’s consistent with some slowing in China    Is the question about the import prices or about going from import prices to   the inflation measure?   Well, our forecast, obviously, is for import prices to decelerate  That’s based   on forecasts that the dollar will flatten out, roughly, or decline only moderately going forward, and   that commodity prices will also be relatively flat  So, to the extent you put a lot of confidence into   those forecasts, I think you could transfer that to our outlook for import prices  That’s how we do   the forecasts   I think forecasting asset prices has a high standard error around it; it’s not a   very precise art   Well, we’ve certainly been hearing a lot about so-called speculative players   in the market With respect to oil markets, inventories actually have been trending up a bit even as   prices are going up  So, there’s some kind of speculative activity going on currently, it would   appear But as for parsing out exactly how much reflects the traders on the exchange, I don’t know  "
7907,2007-06-27,"  As you know from the Greenbook, recent news on foreign   economic activity has been generally upbeat, supporting our view that growth abroad  will continue at a solid pace  The top panel of exhibit 10 shows our weighted average  of total foreign GDP growth and our outlook  If our forecast is borne out, foreign  growth will soften slightly over the forecast period, to about 3½ percent, which is also  our current best guess of the rate of foreign potential growth  As you can see from  the chart, rates of growth of 3½ percent (the thin horizontal line) or better are not  unprecedented, but a stretch of five consecutive years, like that from 2004 to 2008,  would be unusual  The chart also shows foreign growth maintaining most of the  momentum it developed over the past couple of years even as US growth has taken a  more substantial step down  This is also a bit unusual  However, as shown in the  middle left panel, foreign domestic demand gained strength throughout the current  expansion, leaving foreign economies less dependent on demand from the United  States  Foreign investment spending, in particular, has been picking up As shown to  the right, fixed investment spending as a share of GDP has moved up a couple of  percentage points since 2003     With foreign activity expanding slightly faster than potential, it is not surprising   that we are seeing signs in some foreign economies that labor market slack is  dwindling  The unemployment rate in Japan, shown in the bottom left panel, is at a  nine-year low; in Canada, the rate is at a thirty-year low; and the euro-area rate is also  at a multiyear low  Tight labor market conditions are less apparent in emerging- market economies, although we are hearing stories of labor shortages in certain  sectors in China, where growth has been extremely rapid       What is more apparent is that in markets for oil and other primary commodities,   shown in the bottom right panel, demand has outstripped available supply, driving  prices higher  Supply capacity is expanding, however, and we are projecting,  consistent with futures markets, that commodity prices will flatten out by the end of  the forecast period  Before they do, our forecast calls for oil prices to rise a bit  further over the remainder of 2007 and 2008  Food commodity prices are projected  to move slightly higher on average as well, in part as energy-related demand for  grains remains strong  If this forecast is realized, oil and energy prices should impart  in coming quarters noticeable but only moderate upward pressure on headline  consumer price inflation abroad  In part this is because the projected increase in oil  prices is relatively modest, at least compared with what we’ve seen in recent years   In addition, the direct effect of oil prices on consumer prices in many cases is damped  by tax structures or more-active government intervention in energy markets     The top panels of exhibit 11, which examine the pass-through of crude oil prices   to gasoline prices, provide some evidence of how such pass-through varies across  countries  These panels present local-currency prices of unleaded gasoline and  imported crude oil over the past couple of years or so, plotted on a ratio scale so that  vertical distances correspond to percent changes in prices  Looking across the panels,  you can see that the price of imported crude oil in local currency—the black line at   June 27-28, 2007 21 of 261    the bottom of each panel—moves similarly across countries  In contrast, the prices  that consumers pay at the pump—the red lines—are less volatile in the foreign  economies shown than in the United States and have moved up more slowly  In part,  this reflects some differing movements in refinery and distribution margins, which are  represented by the gap between imported crude oil prices and retail gasoline prices  excluding taxes (the blue lines)  This is most noticeable for Japan, where margins are  proportionally higher and more of the increase in crude oil prices was absorbed than  in the United States and the other countries  In addition, higher gasoline taxes abroad  have inserted a greater wedge between the pre-tax price and the retail price of  gasoline—the difference between the blue and the red lines  Accordingly, increased  crude oil prices have pushed up retail gasoline prices proportionally less abroad than  in the United States      The middle left panel presents some calculations of the rates at which the changes   in crude oil prices were passed through to the retail gasoline prices between  September 2004 and March of this year, the most recent observation I have for these  countries  During this period, rates of pass-through were lower abroad, particularly  for Japan and Germany, the countries with relatively high taxes  The smaller pass- through of oil prices to retail gasoline prices abroad has also shown through to  broader measures of consumer energy prices  As shown to the right, consumer  energy prices in Canada, Germany, and Japan have increased less than those in the  United States over the past four years  An extra factor holding down energy price  inflation in Canada over this period was the substantial appreciation of the Canadian  dollar, which made imported energy relatively cheaper  Overall, this suggests that the  effects of past increases in global energy prices on headline inflation, as well as on  consumer sentiment and inflation expectations, were likely smaller abroad than in the  United States      In many emerging market economies, gasoline and other retail energy prices are   controlled or subsidized, so that energy-related fluctuations in consumer prices, if  they occur at all, tend to be gradual  For this group of economies, what has left a  bigger imprint on headline consumer price inflation in recent months is the global rise  in food prices  The black line in the bottom left panel shows that food price inflation  in Mexico has been heavily influenced in recent years by enormous, weather-induced  swings in domestic tomato price inflation, shown in red (of course)  [Laughter]  This  year, however, food price inflation has not followed tomato price inflation down   Rather, it has been sustained in part by a sharp acceleration in prices of tortillas and  other corn products, shown by the green line, which are responding to the fuel-related  surge in the global price of corn  Food price inflation in China, shown to the right in  black, has also been boosted by higher grain prices, as higher feed costs, along with  an outbreak of swine flu, have driven up meat and poultry prices  Prices for corn and  other grains are forecast to level out by the end of 2008, after they have increased  enough to align supply and demand growth  A risk, of course, is that further rapid  expansion of demand might continue to outstrip that of supply, making food price  inflation more persistent and more likely to spur inflation in other sectors  The Bank  of Mexico cited such a risk following its policy tightening in April, and China’s   June 27-28, 2007 22 of 261    authorities have raised concerns that food prices may exert upward pressure on  wages     Evidence for emerging market economies that inflation pressures might already   be spreading outside the food and energy sectors is limited so far, however  The top  left panel of exhibit 12 shows core inflation rates in four of our largest emerging  market trading partners  China’s core rate (in blue), which excludes only food, shows  no sign of wider inflation pressures  In Brazil, inflation has declined substantially  over the past few years, despite a slight uptick recently  Core inflation in Korea has  been trending upward, but it is still low  Mexico’s core inflation rate has edged up  toward 4 percent, a rate that concerns Mexican authorities, but this upward trend may  merely reflect the fact that core inflation in Mexico does not exclude processed food  such as corn tortillas  The advanced foreign economies appear to be exhibiting more  broadly based inflation pressures  As shown on the right, in Canada, the euro area,  and the United Kingdom, core inflation has been on a rising trend since the middle of  2006 or earlier  In response, the central banks in all three economies, as well as the  Bank of Japan, are expected to tighten policy in the near term  Core inflation is still  in generally acceptable ranges, however, except perhaps for the Bank of Japan, for  which it might be too low, and market sentiment does not indicate concern that  inflation pressures are going to rise substantially  As you can see from the middle left  panel, ten-year government bond yields in the major markets have all risen since the  beginning of the year  Except for Japan, most of the increases in nominal yields (the  first column) can be attributed to higher real yields, shown in the second, which is  consistent with stronger prospects for growth  The table to the right shows that  survey measures of inflation expectations for the year 2007 rose moderately for  Canada between December and June and a bit less for the United Kingdom, whereas  the measures fell off some for the euro area and Japan  Longer-run inflation  expectations as of the most recent survey date in April were still locked in at rates  consistent with inflation targets in Canada, the euro area, and the United Kingdom   Our outlook for headline inflation abroad, shown in the bottom panels, reflects a  diminishing inflationary impulse from oil and other primary commodity prices as  they flatten out over the forecast period  It also incorporates the view that some  further monetary policy tightening will be needed to restrain domestic demand and  guide inflation in each economy toward its price stability objective by the end of the  forecast period     Your last two international exhibits focus on the extent to which external   adjustment is under way  A little more than a year ago, in May, was the last time we  forecast that the US current account deficit in 2007 would exceed $1 trillion  Since  then, as shown in the top left panel of exhibit 13, our outlook for the current account  has improved substantially, so much so that currently we don’t see the deficit  reaching $1 trillion within our forecast period  As shown to the right, much of the  improvement has come through an improved outlook for the trade balance  What  surprised us?  Two likely suspects fail to provide the answer  Given the recent  strength of foreign growth, one might have thought that a year ago we were perhaps  too pessimistic on foreign activity and consequently undershot on US export   June 27-28, 2007 23 of 261    performance  However, as shown in the middle left panel, our outlook today for  foreign economic activity is very similar to what we had in mind a year ago   Similarly, the decline over the past year in the broad real dollar, shown to the right,  which has helped curb the deterioration in the trade balance, has turned out to be not  much different from our forecast a year ago  Part of the answer, it turns out, is that,  even though the assumptions we fed our model for exports have not proved much off  the mark, our model forecast for core exports, shown at the bottom left, failed to catch  the unusually strong growth of exports in 2006  We attribute this miss to the  composition of foreign demand rather than its overall magnitude  As shown in the  table to the right, the largest contributors to growth of US core exports in 2006 were  in the categories of capital goods (line 2) and industrial supplies (line 3)  With capital  goods making up a large fraction of core exports, the rise in foreign investment as a  share of GDP (mentioned earlier) likely provided a boost to core exports above that  indicated by our aggregate measure of foreign GDP  Similarly, the global commodity  boom likely favored US exports of industrial supplies      Additional factors behind the improved outlook for the US current account are   described in exhibit 14  One is the lower path of US real GDP, shown in the top left  panel, which prompted real imports of core goods, shown to the right, to expand  along a shallower trajectory than we had predicted last year  A third factor, illustrated  in the middle left panel, is that we did not forecast the dip in the price of oil in the  second half of 2006, which reduced the value of oil imports substantially  These  three factors explain the bulk of the upward adjustment in our forecast for the trade  balance in 2007  In addition, the improved outlook for the current account reflects an  upward revision to net investment income, shown in the middle right  This  adjustment results from a number of factors, including new data on US holdings of  direct investment abroad, new procedures for determining interest payments to  foreign holders of US Treasuries, and a change in the methodology used to record  interest flows on cross-border holdings of other fixed-income securities  As a result  of these surprises, the external accounts have clearly improved  Going forward, we  expect the current account deficit to resume widening nonetheless as interest  payments on the net external debt mount  But the combination of solid, demand- driven foreign growth and weaker US growth has led the external accounts to make  a more positive contribution to US GDP growth in the near term, as shown in the  table  In our current forecast, shown in the rightmost column, we project that the  arithmetic contribution of real net exports to GDP growth should be roughly neutral  starting in the second half of this year, as strong foreign growth helps sustain real  export gains that match those of real imports      Aircraft are an important factor in this  In the fourth quarter of   last year, Boeing was essentially exporting all the aircraft it could produce; so coming   into the first quarter, we didn’t get much more because there weren’t any more to sell    But that issue has been important  I don’t know to what extent Boeing has benefited   from the fact that Airbus has had some hard times, but I suspect it has gotten some   benefit from that    No, that is just goods    They are a possible source  They were my fourth factor, if I had   gone on longer  [Laughter]  They were neck and neck with the oil imports in terms of   their contribution to the improved outlook for trade    I would say it hasn’t affected our view in the sense that we haven’t   changed the elasticities that we are using on the basis of this one year’s observation, but it   points in the right direction  I mean, we are getting a little bit more “umph” from foreign   June 27-28, 2007 31 of 261    growth than we thought before  Whether it is going to be a one-time miss related to   aircraft—there was some temporary investment surge in foreign economies, and we are a   capital goods exporter, and we are just taking advantage of that, and it is going to go   back—or whether it persists is a little too early to tell  But it is possible  "
8841,2010-10-15,"  The second note we prepared for this meeting, “Strategies for   Targeting Interest Rates out the Yield Curve,” examines ways to provide additional   monetary stimulus through targeting or capping market interest rates  It looks at three   possible approaches that would use outright purchases of Treasury securities to   achieve interest rate targets  These three vary chiefly in terms of how far out the   yield curve they seek to target rates  They also offer different combinations of   expected benefits that might be achieved in terms of economic stimulus and risks to   the Federal Reserve balance sheet  Other variations and approaches are possible, of   course; we briefly consider one of those, the use of options, at the end of the note   One approach to targeting interest rates that we discuss, the policy-signaling   approach, seeks to cap at low levels interest rates on all Treasury securities that   mature during the period over which the Committee expects to keep the federal funds   rate near zero  For example, under this approach, the FOMC might seek to target   interest rates at, say, 25 basis points for all Treasuries that mature on or before June   2014, or whatever other date the Committee anticipated would be the liftoff date for   the federal funds rate  This approach is self-extinguishing in the sense that, if   monetary policy unfolds as anticipated, the range of targeted interest rates shortens   October 15, 2010 8 of 62             with the passage of time, terminating just as the Committee anticipates that it would   begin raising its target for the federal funds rate  The approach might be used if the   Committee sought to clarify its expectations regarding the “extended period” over   which the federal funds rate was likely to be at an exceptionally low level   The second approach described in the note, the incremental approach, begins with   setting interest rate targets at the short end of the yield curve and moves out in steps   at the discretion of the Committee  The first step of this approach might be to set a   cap of 25 basis points for interest rates on Treasury securities that mature on or before   October 2012, the maturity date of the current two-year note  As the targeted rates   decline in response to the policy, rates on Treasuries further out the yield curve   should also move lower  If the effects on the yield curve and the economy were seen   as sufficient, no further steps need be taken  If the effects were seen as desirable but   insufficient, the horizon of targeting operations could be extended  Like the policy-  signaling approach, this approach terminates with the passage of time   Like the policy-signaling approach, the objective of the incremental approach is to   cap rates on Treasuries at low levels  However, the intent under the incremental   approach is not to signal the length of the “extended period”  This approach might be   preferred if the Committee feels more comfortable setting explicit targets for near-  term rates, and moving incrementally may be viewed as a prudent way to discover   how far out the yield curve targeting operations would need to occur to achieve the   desired effect on the economy   The third approach described in the note is that of targeting a longer-term   Treasury yield  For example, the FOMC could announce a cap that is 100 basis   points below the current yield on the 10-year Treasury security  The Committee   might prefer this approach if it believes that targeting longer-term interest rates is   likely to stimulate economic activity more directly than targeting short- and   intermediate-term rates  Unlike the other approaches discussed, the expiration date of   this approach is not tied to the maturity of the assets targeted   All three approaches work to lower yields through two channels  the signals they   send about the expected path of the federal funds rate and the compression of term   premiums  The policy-signaling approach would deliver the most explicit signal   about expected future short rates, although the other two approaches might also   influence expectations about the Federal Reserve’s commitment to low interest rates    To the extent that such signaling shifts expectations, the increase in the size of the   SOMA portfolio needed to keep rates near the desired targets can be smaller  Term   premium effects may be largest in the case of long-term interest rate targets, where   the scope to lower term premiums is the greatest   The three approaches offer a range of benefits and risks  A key benefit of   targeting a long-term interest rate stems from its capacity to affect directly the part of   the yield curve most likely to influence economic activity  The incremental approach   is likely to be weakest in its ability to influence long-term rates, at least initially  The   policy-signaling approach might influence longer-term interest rates significantly if it   October 15, 2010 9 of 62             prompts an adjustment of the expected future path of short rates, which may work to   lower a broad range of interest rates across the yield curve   The balance sheet risks associated with each of these policies are lowest for the   incremental and policy-signaling approaches and highest for the policy of targeting   long-term yields  The differences reflect the maturities of the securities likely to be   purchased under each program  The note discusses ways to mitigate balance sheet   risks, all of which involve limiting the degree to which interest rates are controlled    However, none of these means eliminates balance sheet risk entirely   Finally, the note offers a few thoughts about the possibility of selling put options   on Treasury securities  The Federal Reserve could impose an interest rate target by   selling options with a strike price consistent with the target  Moreover, by aligning   financial consequences with rate objectives, selling options could reinforce and   clarify the Federal Reserve’s communications about interest rate targets and the   expected path of the federal funds rate  Selling options also withdraws risk from the   market, which should reduce term premiums and so reduce interest rates via that   channel as well  Against these benefits, there are balance sheet risks related to   uncertainty about the quantity of options needed to achieve a measurable effect in   markets and about the extent to which options sold would be exercised  The use of   options could also pose communications and operational challenges  "
9040,2011-08-09,"  Thanks, David  As Brian and David have already described, the  prospect of slowing economic growth has been an important factor behind recent  financial market developments, with disappointing news from the United States and  the euro area dominating the formation of sentiment  Elsewhere, however, the news  has not been so bleak  In aggregate, our outlook for foreign economic growth was  revised down some from our forecast in June but still calls for solid growth going  forward   The drama in Europe has shared center stage with the US fiscal debate in recent  weeks  When you met in June, markets were awaiting votes on Greek fiscal austerity  measures needed to secure EU–IMF disbursements and avoid a disorderly default on  upcoming debt payments  With the passage of those measures, peripheral European  spreads narrowed in early July and financial markets rallied, but they soon turned  down again as European leaders publicly debated the extent to which private creditors  should contribute to a new financing package for Greece   August 9, 2011 21 of 162              Markets rallied temporarily once again around the time of the European leaders’  summit on July 21  The plan announced at the summit provides some additional  financial support for Greece, but it ultimately fell short of turning the tide of market  skepticism, largely because it fails to provide for the much larger risks presented by  Spain and Italy  The plan offers Greece €109 billion in new official funds and calls  on private creditors to contribute as much as €106 billion, on net, via debt exchanges,  debt buybacks, or rollovers of maturing debt over the next nine years  If implemented  in full and if Greece’s fiscal and privatization targets are met, Greece’s need for  market funding should be minimal until 2014  In addition, the package substantially  lowers the interest rate on official loans, thereby easing Greece’s debt service burden   And finally, by pressuring private creditors to extend and/or reduce their claims on  Greece, the plan crosses the line into selective default but does so in a manner that  avoids triggering CDS default clauses and adding that disruption to financial markets   Notwithstanding these strengths, however, we do not believe the plan will secure  a lasting reduction of financial stresses in peripheral Europe  For one, the plan fails  to reduce Greece’s debt service burden sufficiently to ensure sustainability, meaning  that further restructuring will likely be needed sometime down the road  More  importantly, however, the plan stops short of a measure widely viewed as crucial—an  enlargement of the euro area’s emergency lending facilities sufficient to provide a  credible liquidity backstop to Spain and Italy  This shortcoming is particularly  worrisome, as over the intermeeting period, sovereign spreads on Spanish and Italian  debt rose very substantially, indicating a clear spreading of the crisis beyond Greece,  Ireland, and Portugal  As Brian has mentioned, these worries have now drawn in the  ECB, which yesterday began purchasing Spanish and Italian sovereign debt in the  secondary market, to help contain those yields, at least for now   With financial stresses in peripheral Europe now much deeper than in June and  unlikely to abate substantially anytime soon, we have further downgraded our outlook  for economic performance in the euro area  The expansion of euro-area GDP slowed  from an unsustainably fast 34 percent pace in the first quarter to an estimated  1½ percent rate in the second  With credit conditions still tight, consumer confidence  sliding, and governments tightening fiscal policy in response to investor concerns, we  now see euro-area growth falling further, to about 1 percent over the remainder of this  year, and moving up only anemically thereafter   By contrast, we are cautiously optimistic about most other regions of the global  economy  To be sure, total foreign growth slowed markedly in the second quarter to  an estimated 2¼ percent from 4¼ percent in the first  But this slowing, while a bit  more pronounced than we had anticipated in June, appears to reflect in part some  transitory factors  Many economies were growing well above a sustainable pace in  the first quarter—for example, growth in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and India hit double  digits—and some moderation was clearly in order  On top of that, the catastrophe in  Japan led to the disruption of supply chains and manufacturing throughout the world  in the second quarter, but that effect will not persist  Second-quarter activity was also  held down by oil field fires in Canada and, of course, the Royal Wedding in the  United Kingdom   August 9, 2011 22 of 162              Going forward, we see aggregate foreign growth rebounding to more than  3½ percent in the current quarter and settling in at a little under that pace for the rest  of the forecast period  Japan’s recovery from its earthquake, including the positive  effects on other economies from the restoration of global supply chains, accounts for  nearly all of the 1½ percentage point rise in economic growth we anticipate between  the second and third quarters  We are reasonably confident about this part of the  story, as Japanese industrial production and exports are rebounding more rapidly than  we had anticipated in June  It is also heartening that, even as economic growth  slowed in many economies in the second quarter, domestic demand has held up  In  Canada, employment has been posting strong gains and investment intentions have  remained buoyant, even as weak exports and disruptions in the oil sector have  restrained output; growth in credit and retail sales remains brisk in Brazil; and the  slowdown in China, where authorities have cracked down on bank lending, should  still leave Chinese GDP growth skimming along at more than 8 percent this year and  next   Nevertheless, we are hardly complacent about the foreign outlook  Purchasing  managers’ indexes around the world, even in emerging Asia, declined further in July,  highlighting some significant risks to our projection of a rebound in growth abroad  this quarter  Moreover, another critical factor in the projected global rebound, the  pickup in the US economy, is somewhat tenuous, as David has emphasized  In fact,  the weaker outlook for the United States, along with the deeper financial strains in  Europe, have led us to revise down by ¼ percentage point our projection of aggregate  foreign GDP growth during the forecast period  The turbulence in global financial  markets, which became even more pronounced after we closed our forecast,  strengthens the possibility that we may be downgrading the outlook further by the  time you meet again in September   Largely reflecting concerns about global economic growth, the price of WTI  crude oil fell another 13 percent during the intermeeting period, including the sharp  declines of the past few days, putting it nearly 30 percent below its April peak   Declines in oil and other commodity prices have led to declines in headline inflation  rates around the world in recent months  With the combination of weaker prospects  for economic growth and diminishing price pressures, expectations are that major  central banks will delay their plans to withdraw monetary accommodation  This  includes, of course, the ECB, which had raised policy rates in July but left them  unchanged at its meeting last week  The ECB did expand and extend its offerings of  special liquidity facilities in response to the tensions in financial markets last week   In addition, as Brian noted, the Swiss National Bank and the Bank of Japan, whose  currencies have risen to record levels, each announced easing actions last week  The  Bank of Japan announcement came on the heels of Thursday’s massive intervention  sales of yen in the foreign exchange market by Japan’s Ministry of Finance  By  contrast, central banks in several emerging market economies continued to tighten  monetary policies to bring down inflation and ward off economic overheating   So far, the slowdown in foreign growth has left a relatively shallow imprint on  US exports  Real export growth moved down from 8 percent in the first quarter to   August 9, 2011 23 of 162              6 percent in the second, below what we’d written down in June  But import growth  also slowed, to only about 1 percent, so that the contribution of net exports to GDP  growth was a still-solid ½ percentage point  Going forward, we are projecting  another ½ percentage point contribution in the second half of this year, as both export  and import growth rebound, and ¾ percentage point in 2012  These are much  stronger net export contributions than are usually seen during US recoveries, largely  reflecting a faster bounceback in foreign economies and previous and prospective  declines in the dollar  Over the past year, the broad real dollar has depreciated  8½ percent, and we are projecting it to move down at an annual rate of about a  2¾ percent during the remainder of the forecast period  Thank you    Well, I don’t have the exact numbers split out, but we did see GDP drop   from about 2 percent to about ¾ percent between the first and second quarters    Yes    Well, I think there may be a little of both there  The spreads of French   longer-term bond yields over German bund yields have gone up some  There have also been   rumors about downgrades for France circulating in the market  I don’t really know how much   truth there is to those rumors, but there are rumors  We have seen some funding pressures for   August 9, 2011 24 of 162              some French financial institutions— cutbacks on credit lines and such, and paying higher spreads   in overnight funding markets  The pressures are nowhere near the same degree that we’re   seeing, say, for Italian or Spanish banks, but they’re creeping up and it’s something to watch     I think the markets clearly were looking for, and many others were also   looking for, some greater political commitment to resolving the debt crisis that seems to be   spreading around the euro area  That took the form, for the most part, of the EFSF  Right now,   it isn’t even fully funded at this point, but it’s slated to have €440 billion  And the July 21 plan   expanded the range and scope of operations that it could do to try to provide more assistance to   countries, but they did not expand the size of the fund  And €440 billion is just not enough if we   run into problems in Spain and Italy, who seem to be the next in line   Ultimately, the European situation is just really difficult—the debt burden is too high,   there’s going to have to be some losses taken, and they have to decide how they’re going to   allocate those  Is it going to be done in a disorderly default, and they recover from that, or is it   August 9, 2011 29 of 162              going to be socialized, in a sense, through government support?  And the Europeans have said   that they’re going to do what it takes to hold things together and provide the funds, but it’s not   obvious that the political rhetoric is being supported yet by the political decisionmaking  So   there is a way out, perhaps, but it’s difficult in one respect because the governments have too   much debt  They need to cut back  It’s the same situation for the United States, I suspect    Cutting back in the near term is going to slow economic growth and puts them in an even worse   situation  And it’s very difficult for them to commit to cutting back in the longer run, so it’s just   very tricky  And we’re in one of these multiple equilibrium situations, where if the markets can   believe them, the rates might come down and they’ll get through, but if they don’t, it could be a   little messier  "
