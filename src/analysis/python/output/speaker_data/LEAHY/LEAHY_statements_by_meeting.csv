8117,2005-06-29," The top left panel of exhibit 11 presents our outlook for foreign  real GDP growth We forecast total foreign growth to move back up this quarter from  a soft first-quarter pace and to rise a bit further going forward  The pickup is modest  and reflects our assessment of the balance between some opposing forces  On the one  hand, higher oil prices, while supportive for some economies, are expected to damp  activity, on balance, for our foreign aggregate, which is weighted by US exports   On the other hand, financial conditions appear to be more uniformly supportive of  growth abroad Many foreign currencies have depreciated against the dollar since the  beginning of the year and, as shown on the right, stock prices in emerging-market and  industrial economies have moved up since the middle of last year  Emerging-market  bond spreads, shown in the bottom left panel, backed up a bit from their lows earlier  this year but are still tight by historical standards  And benchmark long-term interest  rates abroad have moved substantially lower, as shown by the red line in the bottom  right panel   The widespread decline of long-term rates has been a prominent topic of  discussion recently, and many hypotheses have been offered to explain it  I do not  propose to resolve that debate  [Laughter] However, the extent to which rates have  declined has varied across countries  Why this might be so is the subject of your next  exhibit As shown in the top left panel, the yield on the German government bond  was essentially equal to the 10-year Treasury yield in October 2003, a date that falls  before any of the central banks discussed on this page began tightening monetary  policy Since then, the bund yield has declined about 120 basis points and is  currently just off its record low of 310 percent  The yield on the Canadian bond,  shown in the next column to the right, has declined nearly as much, at 110 basis  points over the 20-month period  These developments contrast with the smaller net  decline of 80 basis points in the United Kingdom, and the much smaller net declines  of 40 basis points in the United States, and 20 basis points in Japan  The size of the  decline may have been more limited in Japan than in the other economies because of  the proximity of the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates   As shown in the middle row of panels, most of the decline in foreign long-term  yields appears to be related to a slide in real interest rates  Inflation compensation, as  measured by the spread between these nominal and inflation-indexed interest rates,  has not changed appreciably on balance for these economies over the past 20 months                               June 29-30, 2005 89 of 234  The relative size of these real and nominal yield movements appears to reflect  monetary policy actions taken during the period as well as expected future actions   With the exception of Japan, long-term rates have fallen more in economies where  tightening has been the least  None of the major foreign central banks has tightened  monetary policy as much as the FOMC has over this period  As shown in the first  panel of the bottom row, monetary policy in the euro area, where the largest decline  in bond yields occurred, has been on hold since June 2003  Market expectations that  the ECB might soon raise rates, a view heavily promoted in ECB rhetoric of only a  month ago, have all but vanished In Canada, where bond yields have declined  substantially also, the Bank of Canada has lowered policy rates on net since October  2003, but markets appear to expect the tightening that occurred in September and  October of last year to resume in future months  In contrast, the Bank of England, the  first of these central banks to start tightening, in November 2003, has raised its policy  rate 125 basis points over the period, and at this point markets appear to expect that  the next move for the Bank will be to lower the policy rate  Nonetheless, long-term  rates are down whereas short-term rates are up  Monetary policy at the Bank of Japan  (BOJ) has not changed significantly The BOJ has continued to pursue quantitative  easing, and reserve balances stepped up over the period   The low level of real long-term interest rates in the euro area and Japan should  help smooth the way for more robust expansion of activity in those economies  Other  financial factors, presented in your next exhibit, should also lend support  Positive  equity earnings forecasts, shown at the top left, should help lift stock prices and  reduce the cost of equity finance for firms  Forecasts of earnings per share, drawn  from surveys of equity analysts in mid-June, put earnings this year above last year’s,  and forecasts for 2006 show further increases BBB corporate bond spreads, shown  to the right, are relatively low, which implies that corporate bond financing costs have  generally followed government yields down  And the recent depreciation of the euro  and yen in foreign exchange markets, shown in real effective terms in the middle left  panel, should provide some boost to net exports going forward   Despite these positive financial conditions, higher oil prices, firms’ reluctance to  invest, and worker concerns about wages, pensions, and employment are restraining  growth, especially in the euro area  As shown by the black and blue lines in the  middle right panel, confidence in the euro area has taken a beating, with industrial  confidence dropping sharply and consumer confidence remaining low  All told, we  see euro-area growth, shown in the bottom left panel, slowing some this quarter  before eventually edging higher, to about 1¾ percent in the second half of this year  and next year The outlook for Japan, while not much stronger, at least has a slight  upward trend, driven by a slow but steady further increase in employment and  incomes  As shown at the right, Japanese GDP growth rebounded sharply in the first  quarter, led by strong gains in consumption and investment spending  Inventory  accumulation also contributed positively  We expect growth this quarter to drop  back, as inventories are run down and as consumer and business spending growth  moderates                              June 29-30, 2005 90 of 234  Your next exhibit examines the potential implications of recent changes in the  behavior of Chinese trade The top left panel shows a 12-month moving sum of  China’s merchandise trade balance over the past 20 years  In recent months, the  Chinese trade surplus has jumped to record levels  As shown on the right, exports  have continued to grow along trend, but imports appear to be decelerating  The  counterpart of the lower import growth is showing up elsewhere in Asia as a slowing  of exports to China As shown in the middle left panel, the growth of exports to  China from Taiwan, Korea, and Japan, three of the region’s largest economies and  also three of China’s top trading partners, has dropped from very rapid rates to near  zero We see two developments that are consistent with this shift  One is that  economic activity in China is decelerating  Policy measures adopted a year ago to  restrain runaway investment spending, which had increased more than 40 percent  over the four-quarter period immediately prior to the implementation of the measures,  may be beginning to show through to GDP  Our forecast for growth in China, shown  in the middle right, has growth stepping down to 7½ percent by the end of this year,  as we regard the double-digit GDP growth rates of the recent past as unsustainable   The other development is that China may be turning inward for some items that it had  been importing, including heavy industry items like iron and steel and road vehicles   As shown at the bottom left, exports of road vehicles have ramped up since 2002, and  exports of iron and steel rocketed up last year, as capacity to produce steel internally  came on line   As shown in the bottom right panel, China’s extraordinary growth does not seem  to have triggered broad-based inflation pressures  The consumer price inflation bulge  in 2004 came almost entirely from increases in food prices, and they have not  persisted   Your final exhibit presents our outlook for commodity prices and the US  external accounts As shown by the black line in the top left panel, prices of nonfuel  primary commodities have increased substantially in the past three years, boosted in  part by global growth but lifted also by the depreciation of the dollar, shown at the  right The metals price component of this index (the red line) has registered the  largest price gains Over the next year and a half, primary commodity prices are  forecast to change little, as world demand is expected to stay strong and supply  response comes on line   The spot price of oil, shown in the middle left panel, has continued to rise, as has  the price implied by futures contracts maturing about six years out, shown by the red  line Increasing doubts about future supply from Russia, Venezuela, Iran, and Iraq  have apparently cooled expectations that oil prices will retreat much from their  current, elevated levels  Potential supply shortfalls are of particular concern because  OPEC has little spare capacity and world oil demand is expected to continue to be  strong   Our outlook for the US current account deficit is shown to the right  The deficit  is projected to widen from about $780 billion in the first quarter of this year to                        June 29-30, 2005 91 of 234  $960 billion, or about 7¼ percent of US GDP, by the fourth quarter of 2006  With  the dollar projected to depreciate only modestly from its current level, US GDP  growth on a par with or above aggregate foreign growth, and oil prices remaining  high, the trade balance, shown at the bottom left, deteriorates $113 billion further  over the forecast period The projected decline in net investment income is almost as  large, at $79 billion The growing negative contribution of net investment income to  the deficit reflects expanded net holdings of US liabilities and an assumed increase  in US short-term interest rates    The dollar?     It depends on how far into the future you want to go  It’s an unsustainable   path    I think we’re seeing attempts now in some parts of the Middle East, such as   Saudi Arabia, to try to expand capacity for oil  As for these alternative sources, I don’t know if   we’ve reached the trigger points yet where expanding their production has become profitable    I’m not sure    In part it is the supply response in some of the metals and presumably in   food and other—                                June 29-30, 2005 104 of 234   These forecasts are based on the futures quotes  There may be some   differences in view between our forecast for China compared with what the futures markets are   thinking They might be a bit more upbeat about the outlook for China But we do have a little   downward tilt here, and I think it’s consistent with some slowing in China     Is the question about the import prices or about going from import prices to   the inflation measure?    Well, our forecast, obviously, is for import prices to decelerate  That’s based   on forecasts that the dollar will flatten out, roughly, or decline only moderately going forward, and   that commodity prices will also be relatively flat  So, to the extent you put a lot of confidence into   those forecasts, I think you could transfer that to our outlook for import prices  That’s how we do   the forecasts    I think forecasting asset prices has a high standard error around it; it’s not a   very precise art    Well, we’ve certainly been hearing a lot about so-called speculative players   in the market With respect to oil markets, inventories actually have been trending up a bit even as   prices are going up  So, there’s some kind of speculative activity going on currently, it would   appear But as for parsing out exactly how much reflects the traders on the exchange, I don’t know  "
