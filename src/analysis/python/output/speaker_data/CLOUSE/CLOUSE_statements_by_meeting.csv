8425,2008-04-29,"  Thanks, Steve  As noted on page 25, the Interest on Reserves   Workgroup developed a set of options for monetary policy implementation in the  United States based on alternative settings for a small set of core structural elements   The first core element—so-called balance targets—is a central feature of many  systems  In the United States, Japan, Switzerland, and the euro area, balance targets  are established through mandatory reserve requirements  In the United Kingdom,  balance targets are established through voluntary contractual arrangements  Other  countries, such as Canada and Australia, operate with no formal balance targets   Target bands are a second structural element incorporated in many systems to afford  banks some flexibility in meeting their targets  The carryover provisions for required  reserves and the clearing band for required clearing balances play this role in the  United States  The structure of the maintenance period is another core structural  element  As Steve noted, the US system operates with a mixture of one-week and  two-week maintenance periods  The United Kingdom and the euro area operate with  maintenance periods that correspond to the interval between monetary policy  meetings  Central banks like the Bank of Canada and Reserve Bank of Australia that  operate without balance targets implicitly operate with a one-day maintenance period    April 29–30, 2008 148 of 266    Finally, most systems involve some form of interest rate corridor with the upper  bound of the corridor established by a standing lending facility and the lower bound  set by the rate of remuneration on excess reserves or a redeposit facility       As noted on page 26, market developments may, at times, impair the efficacy of   one or more of these core structural elements  For example, the standing lending  facility should, in theory, establish a cap on interbank rates  However, the presence  of stigma in using the standing lending facility can impair the effectiveness of the  cap  That certainly seems to have been the case in the United States over recent  months  We have observed depository institutions regularly bidding for funds in the  market at rates above the primary credit rate  The table at the bottom reports some  evidence on this score culled from data on Fedwire transactions  Over recent weeks,  many of the largest banks in the country have executed numerous trades for sizable  amounts at rates well above the primary credit rate  It may be possible to redesign the  discount window to mitigate stigma to some extent, but it appears likely that stigma  will continue to be an issue for the discount window, especially during periods of  financial distress  As a result, systems that rely heavily on a standing lending facility  to establish an upper bound on the federal funds rate implicitly disadvantage those  institutions that are most wary about using the discount window  As you can see in  the table, that set of institutions in the United States includes many that are critical  providers of liquidity across a range of markets  It is noteworthy in this regard that  Citibank in the past has been willing to provide liquidity in the funds market by  borrowing primary credit and relending the proceeds in the funds market  However,  in recent weeks, Citi has seemed reluctant to pursue this strategy and has, in fact,  executed more than 100 trades from late March through last week in sizable amounts  at rates above the primary credit rate  Indeed, the three largest banks in the country— shown in the first three rows—all appear to be quite wary about using the discount  window     As noted on page 27, it is helpful, broadly speaking, to think about the five   options discussed in the paper as falling into two basic categories—systems that  incorporate a multiple-day maintenance period and systems in which depositories  manage their reserves to meet a daily reserve objective  The multiple-day systems— options 1 and 2 in the paper—rely on arbitrage across days of a maintenance period  as an important factor contributing to day-to-day funds rate stability  Single-day  systems tend to rely more heavily on standing facilities and the structure of  remuneration rate(s) on reserves to stabilize the funds rate  The next few slides focus  on multiple-day systems     Option 1  As noted on page 28, option 1 considers a straightforward modification   of our current system of monetary policy implementation  Required reserve balances  would be remunerated at a rate close to the target funds rate  The primary credit  facility, in theory anyway, would establish the upper bound of an interest rate  corridor  The lower bound of the corridor would be established by paying interest on  excess reserves at a rate appreciably below the target funds rate  The solid line in the  picture displays what the demand for reserves might look like on the last day of the   April 29–30, 2008 149 of 266    reserve maintenance period  The curve would be downward sloping and might entail  some precautionary demand for excess reserves  The reserve demand curve on  previous days in the maintenance period—the dotted line—would be much flatter at  the target rate over a wide range, reflecting the ability of banks to substitute balances  across days of the maintenance period in meeting reserve requirements  Eventually,  though, at very low levels of balances, the increased risk of an overnight overdraft  would push the intraperiod demand curve up to the primary credit rate  At high levels  of balances, the intraperiod demand curve would eventually fall to the remuneration  rate on excess reserves as banks recognized that they held excess balances that could  not be worked off by the end of the maintenance period  The width of the “flat  portion” of the intraperiod demand curve tends to narrow over the maintenance period  as the scope for substitution diminishes across the remaining days of the period  In  this structure, the Desk would operate much as it does today, supplying an aggregate  quantity of reserve balances each day to address both daily demands and  maintenance-period average needs     Option 2  As noted on page 29, option 2 in the paper is a multiple-day system   based on voluntary balance targets rather than mandatory reserve requirements  This  system would share many of the key structural elements of the system for monetary  policy implementation employed in the United Kingdom  Depository institutions  would establish a voluntary balance target that they would agree to meet, on average,  over a maintenance period  The maintenance period could be set equal to the interval  between FOMC meetings  The system could include a target balance “band” to  afford banks some flexibility in meeting their voluntary target balance As shown on  the right, the demand for reserves on the last day of the period would again be  downward sloping, and the Desk would supply an aggregate quantity of reserves  equal to the quantity demanded at the target funds rate  Reserve management and the  funds market under this option probably would be similar to that for option 1  The  longer maintenance period might allow depository institutions more scope for  substitution of balances across days of the maintenance period  That could imply less  need for daily fine-tuning of balances and greater funds rate stability  A key issue,  however, is whether the aggregate quantity of voluntary balance targets would be  large enough to provide adequate leeway for effective arbitrage across days of the  maintenance period  Many banks might choose not to establish a voluntary balance  target in this system, and those that do may not choose to establish a large balance  target  In this case, the funds rate could be fairly volatile within the interest rate  corridor     Option 3  As noted on page 30, option 3 in the paper—the simple corridor—is   similar to the systems employed by the Bank of Canada and the Reserve Bank of  Australia  Banks would not need to establish a balance target of any sort and would  simply manage their accounts each day to balance the opportunity cost of holding  reserves against the risk of overnight overdrafts  The system would involve a fairly  narrow symmetric funds rate corridor  As noted in the figure, the Desk would supply  reserves each day equal to the quantity demanded along the downward sloping  portion of the demand curve  Because the demand curve is likely to be fairly steep,   April 29–30, 2008 150 of 266    shocks to reserve supply are likely to result in significant volatility in the funds rate  within the corridor  As noted earlier, the heavy reliance on the primary credit facility  to establish an upper bound on the funds rate may be suspect, especially during  periods of financial distress     Option 4  As noted on page 31, option 4 in the paper is a system similar in many   respects to that employed by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand  Key structural  features of this system include an asymmetric interest rate corridor and a relatively  high level of balances to ensure that the funds rate trades near the floor of the interest  rate corridor  As in option 3, depositories would not need to establish a balance target  of any sort  The reserve demand curve for this system might look like that shown to  the right  At low levels of balances, the demand curve would be downward sloping  reflecting precautionary demands for balances to avoid overnight overdrafts  But at  sufficiently high levels of balances, the risk of overnight overdrafts should become  very low, and the demand curve would asymptote near the floor of the funds rate  corridor  It is difficult to estimate the level of balances that would be necessary to  reach this point, but an aggregate level of balances on the order of $50 billion would  probably be sufficient in most cases  In principle, fluctuations in various factors  affecting reserves would not have much effect on the funds rate, and the generally  high level of balances could reduce daylight overdrafts  Partly because of the  experience in New Zealand, there are questions about incentives for strategic  behavior in this structure     Option 5  As noted on page 32, option 5 is a hybrid single-day system that would   involve a voluntary daily balance target and a relatively wide target band   Depositories would receive full remuneration on balances maintained up to the upper  bound of the target band and would be penalized for any shortfall in balances below  the lower bound of the target band  With these structural elements, the reserve  demand curve should be fairly flat at the target rate over a wide range, but the curve  would be downward sloping near the upper and lower bounds of the target balance  band  The Desk would presumably operate by targeting a quantity of balances each  day near the middle of the target band  As with option 2, a significant issue with  option 5 would be whether depositories would choose a high enough level of  voluntary balance targets to allow the target band to play the desired role in  stabilizing the federal funds rate       As noted on page 33, the paper also identifies a number of general issues that cut   across all the options  First, depository institutions will still be subject to statutory  limitations on their ability to pay interest on demand deposits  As a result, the  Federal Reserve’s initiative to pay interest on reserves may be seen by correspondent  banks as unfair competition  There are also technical issues associated with the  setting of the remuneration rates on reserve balances that appropriately account for  the essentially risk-free nature of balances held with the central bank  The Federal  Reserve would need to work through governance issues associated with all the  options  In particular, the Board is responsible for setting all remuneration rates on  balances, and this would need to be closely coordinated with the FOMC’s   April 29–30, 2008 151 of 266    determination of the target federal funds rate  Finally, many if not all the options  discussed would likely require some transition period that would need to be carefully  managed  Spence will now discuss some of the pros and cons of each option in more  detail and how they stack up relative to key objectives        The determination of voluntary targets, as Spence mentioned, is a really big   issue that we’d have to study much further  At least in the context of the simple models, banks will   face some probability of an overdraft charge if they are operating with very low balances, so they   might have an incentive to set up a voluntary requirement on which they receive remuneration  On   the other hand, they may not view even fully remunerated balances as an especially attractive asset,   so there might be some balancing between the desire to hold large enough requirements to stay   April 29–30, 2008 159 of 266    away from overdrafts and the idea of having balances or assets booked that aren’t particularly high   earning  But this is a major uncertainty for these types of models     As Steve noted, we already have $7 billion in required clearing balances   with a rate of remuneration that’s only 80 percent of the T-bill rate  So in all likelihood, we would   have a positive number  How large that number would be is the question mark  "
8764,2009-06-23,"4  Thank you, Mr Chairman  We’ll be referring to the package   entitled “FOMC Briefing on Reserve Management Tools to Target a Higher Policy   Rate” The FOMC memo on reserve management options described a number of   possible tools that the Federal Reserve might employ to foster effective control of the   federal funds rate even with a much expanded balance sheet  The operational details   of these various options were described in a series of accompanying memos, but it   may be useful to note how these various options fit within the usual demand and   supply paradigm in the reserve market                  June 23–24, 2009 19 of 261  In simple models, as shown by the red line in the top panel of exhibit 1, the  hypothetical aggregate demand for reserves with interest paid on excess reserves at  the so-called IOER rate should asymptote to just a touch above the IOER rate  In  practice, however, the actual demand curve seems to be more like the black line that  extends somewhat below the IOER rate  For much of the fourth quarter of last year,  for example, federal funds regularly traded 50 basis points or more below the IOER  rate And in recent months, the effective federal funds rate has been about 10 basis  points below IOER on average  As best we can tell, this phenomenon has stemmed  from a confluence of factors  In particular, GSEs and others that earn no interest on  overnight balances may have an incentive to lend in the funds market at rates below  IOER; in addition, various impediments to arbitrage in the funds market—line limits,  banks’ concerns about capital constraints, and possible adverse perceptions associated  with significant overnight borrowing in the funds market—seem to have undermined  the usual market forces that would ordinarily be expected to keep the federal funds  rate close to the IOER rate   Consistent with this simple diagram, the various options discussed in the memo  are classified under two basic headings—those that aim to strengthen and shape the  demand for reserves and those designed to reduce the supply of reserves  As shown  in the middle panel, the demand-side options are aimed at shifting the demand curve  to the right, or making the curve “flatter,” that is, more interest-elastic, around the  IOER rate, or some combination of the two   Options aimed at shifting the demand curve to the right include increasing reserve  requirement ratios and establishing a system of voluntary requirements  Simple  calculations suggest that increasing required reserve ratios under the current structure  to the maximum levels allowed under the Federal Reserve Act—14 percent for  transaction deposits and 9 percent for nonpersonal time deposits and net  Eurocurrency liabilities—could increase required reserve balances quite substantially   Alternatively, as noted in the work presented to the FOMC in April of 2008, the  Federal Reserve could develop a system of voluntary reserve requirements  Similar  to the current program of required clearing balances, depository institutions in this  system could establish a voluntary requirement ahead of each two-week maintenance  period The rate of remuneration for balances held to meet such voluntary  requirements would need to be above the rate of remuneration on excess reserve  balances in order to induce banks to establish a significant level of voluntary  requirements    Options that might tend to flatten the demand curve include the payment of  interest on reserves for all account holders  Payment of interest on balances held by  institutions such as Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Federal Home Loan Banks  would likely increase their desired holdings of Fed balances and could induce them to  arbitrage in the funds market if the federal funds rate were to dip below the IOER  rate As described in the note by Jamie McAndrews, the Federal Reserve may also be  able to flatten the demand curve by establishing special accounts that would allow  federal funds transactions to be collateralized by balances held at the Federal Reserve                              June 23–24, 2009 20 of 261  As shown in the bottom panel of the exhibit, the various supply-side tools  described in the memo—issuance of Fed bills, the development of term deposits, an  expanded Supplementary Financing Program, expanded use of reverse repurchase  agreements, and asset sales or scaled back liquidity programs—all would work by  shifting the supply of reserves to the left     In the case of Fed bills, this would be accomplished through the issuance of short- term debt obligations of the Federal Reserve that could be purchased by a wide range  of investors  Fed bills could be purchased by depository institutions but would not  count toward meeting reserve requirements  Fed bills would be a very powerful tool  for reserve management for the Federal Reserve but would require new legislation   A closely related tool discussed in the note by Steve Meyer would be a system of  term deposits  Term deposits would be issued only to depository institutions, perhaps  via an auction mechanism or by posted rates  These term deposits would not be  eligible to satisfy reserve requirements and likely would be structured as  nonnegotiable instruments  For example, two-week term deposits could be offered at  the start of each two-week maintenance period  Of course, the return on such  deposits would need to be high enough to induce banks to shift a significant portion  of their holdings of overnight reserve balances into a term deposit   As yet another reserve-draining mechanism, the Federal Reserve could explore an  expanded SFP in which the Treasury would issue special bills and place the proceeds  with the Federal Reserve  To be fully satisfactory from the Federal Reserve’s  perspective, the Treasury would need to be obliged to meet Federal Reserve requests  for SFP issuance, and the bills issued under an expanded SFP should be excluded  from the federal debt ceiling   Another reserve-draining mechanism that could be employed would involve  expanded use of triparty reverse repurchase agreements with Treasury, agency, and  agency-backed MBS securities As noted in the background memos, reverse RPs  against Treasury and agency collateral will be feasible in the very near future  The  ability to arrange for triparty reverse RPs against agency MBS may take longer to put  in place—perhaps by the end of this year In the case of agency MBS, a very similar  reserve-draining mechanism would involve temporary sales of our MBS holdings in  the dollar roll market     Finally, the Federal Reserve could conduct outright sales of assets or take steps to  scale back credit provided through various liquidity facilities  These mechanisms  would almost certainly be successful in draining reserves but, as Spence will describe,  would entail a number of important policy judgments   I will comment  Spence may have some other points  The existing   regime for reserve requirements is very hard to rationalize  It’s based on the monetary policy   implementation of the early 1980s and very much focused on transactions deposits  I think that   using that kind of creaky, old structure to generate a huge increase in required reserves would be   a little awkward And then there are the communications challenges associated with why we   would be raising reserve requirements by a huge amount, even though they are being   remunerated—it still might be awkward to explain  Spence may have some further comments   I think there’s an excellent chance that it would rise  We just don’t   know whether it would go up by an 80 percent factor or a 90 percent factor—that remains to be   seen So I think it’s very prudent to examine all of these other tools  We just really are in   uncharted territory, especially with hundreds of billions of dollars in reserve balances   outstanding  "
8820,2009-09-22," Thanks, Bill The staff has continued to develop reserve management  tools—including term reverse RPs, a term deposit facility, and reserve collateral accounts—  that, along with adjustments to the interest rate on excess reserves, should allow the  Committee to raise the federal funds rate when it wishes to do so     As discussed at the August meeting, the Desk could drain reserves by conducting term  reverse RPs with primary dealers or other counterparties  The Desk will be prepared to  conduct reverse repos on a sizable scale as early as a month from now, using Treasury and  agency collateral and with primary dealers as counterparties  Staff is also working on two  significant expansions of this basic program  the ability to do reverses against agency MBS  and the inclusion of counterparties beyond the primary dealers   The informal consultations with four financial institutions that Bill described, along with  the Desk’s conversations with primary dealers, indicate that there is considerable interest  among dealers in participating in a term reverse RP program  However, the primary dealers  note that their participation in the program would be limited by balance sheet constraints    To some extent, such balance sheet concerns reportedly are connected with regulatory  capital requirements  While the SEC’s regulatory net capital charges for dealers explicitly  exclude transactions with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, regulatory leverage ratios  may be an issue for those dealers that are part of bank holding companies  For these  institutions, the financing of collateral reversed in from the Federal Reserve could have an  appreciable impact on their leverage ratios at the consolidated bank holding company level                      September 22–23, 2009 25 of 212  Dealers have noted that in many cases balance sheet constraints also stem very  importantly from internal guidelines regarding leverage; in part, such internal guidelines are  based on the attention devoted to leverage in the analyses of credit rating agencies and other  outside analysts Staff continues to investigate ways to mitigate such concerns about balance  sheet capacity One avenue currently being explored is the potential for the Federal Reserve  to participate in the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation, a step that might allow for netting of  primary dealers’ matched book repo transactions with the Federal Reserve and thereby avoid  large increases in the size of their balance sheets   Based on conversations with about half of the dealer community and the staff  consultations with banking organizations, staff estimates suggest that the primary dealers in  aggregate could take on $100 billion to $200 billion or so of reverse RPs  The apparent  capacity constraint among primary dealers in conducting large-scale operations in reverse  RPs puts a premium on expanding the list of counterparties beyond primary dealers  Primary  dealers have been informed that additional counterparties may be needed for an effective  implementation of this program  Work on this front is slated to start soon   The Desk has made substantial progress in laying the operational groundwork for a  reverse RP program, including contract negotiations, the development of automated systems,  and settlement processes  Concerning contracts, the legal documentation to support triparty  reverse repos is expected to be executed by the primary dealers and clearing banks later this  month The Desk has also negotiated agreements with the triparty banks on service levels  and the general fee structure for triparty reverses  This agreement is also expected to be  finalized in the coming days  Regarding automation and settlement, the Desk has tested the  existing FedTrade system for use in conducting triparty reverse RPs  The Desk is in the final  stages of preparing for implementation and should be ready to perform end-to-end testing  with primary dealers, clearing banks, and settlement systems in early October  The basic  version of the reverse RP program—triparty reverse RPs with primary dealers against  Treasury and agency securities—will be ready to go by the end of next month  Work to  expand the range of collateral and counterparties is ongoing and should be completed later  this year   Turning to the term deposit facility, the staff consultations with four banking  organizations suggested that they could well be interested in participating in a term deposit  program  We do not yet have a reading on small banks’ interest  The amounts that  institutions would be willing to shift from reserve balances into term deposits would depend  on various factors, including the maturities offered and the interest rate paid on term deposits,  particularly relative to the rate earned on excess reserves  The banks in our informal  consultations indicated that they would want to hold more term deposits if there were some  means by which such deposits could be utilized to meet an unusual liquidity demand, perhaps  through an early withdrawal option or by allowing term deposits to serve as collateral at the  discount window   A staff steering group has been established to oversee four work streams associated with  the term deposit facility—program design, legal documentation, governance, and  implementation                                                                                 3 The materials used by Mr Madigan are appended to this transcript (appendix 3)   September 22–23, 2009 26 of 212  The design team is studying various aspects of posted-rate term deposit facilities,  including appropriate pricing and maturity structures, and it is also considering the set of  rules that should apply if the System elects to issue term deposits via an auction    System legal staff is examining the legal basis for establishing term deposit accounts and  is also considering the agreements between Reserve Banks and depository institutions  necessary to support term deposit accounts    The staff has also begun to discuss governance issues raised by both the posted-rate and  auction-rate approaches  The key issue is ensuring that rates and quantities would be set in a  way that ensures appropriate input from all Federal Reserve stakeholders   The implementation group has, for some time, been developing and testing the computer  code necessary to support a term deposit program  Using this code, DIs we to submit tenders  through a web-based application  This new code will be deployed at the end of next month  and can be activated when the facility is ready to be implemented  As noted in the August  briefing, some lead time will be required to implement a term deposit facility, because DIs  would have to request and receive electronic certificates to access the application  Our  expectation is that about one month of lead time would be required to have several thousand  depositories positioned to participate        As discussed at the August meeting, reserve collateral accounts, or RCAs, would be new  Federal Reserve deposit accounts designed to facilitate trading of fed funds on a  collateralized basis By reducing counterparty credit risk concerns, these new accounts might  well enable sellers who utilize the accounts to obtain higher bids for the fed funds they sell    The staff has surveyed two GSEs about their interest in using RCAs  Both are examining  the option, and their internal staffs are reviewing the RCA as a new product  They will share  the outcome of those internal reviews with Federal Reserve staff in the near future  The  reviews are expected to yield a fairly rich set of information on those GSEs’ likely use of  RCAs    RCAs are entirely new, and the staff is still in a relatively early stage of analysis for these  accounts We are waiting to hear back from the GSEs before determining whether to  establish a steering group to oversee future work in this area  Internally, the RCA concept  has been discussed with the System’s Accounting Management Steering Group (AMSG)   The AMSG viewed the concept as feasible and similar in some respects to the recent  implementation of excess balance accounts  In addition, members of the Committee on  Reserve Administration have reviewed the proposal  Brian will now continue the staff   presentations   I’ve had a number of conversations with Chris Burke and his colleagues—of   course, Brian may want to comment on this as well—and I think that the perception is that it will be a   challenge to pull in a lot of additional counterparties  One obvious lending group would be the money   funds You would like to have them participate—conceivably, even banks that are holding huge volumes   of reserves might want to be lenders of cash against securities  So there are natural sets of institutions that   you might want to target, but in order to get them into the system, you have to have legal agreements   established with them—that takes some time, I have learned  And there are also all sorts of operational                                             September 22–23, 2009 30 of 212  difficulties in setting up collateral arrangements and having the monitoring in place  There’s a   perception, at least, that you could get a substantial number of additional counterparties in place by the   end of the year, but I think Chris and his colleagues at your Reserve Bank have their work cut out for   them   My own personal view, for what it’s worth, is that the combination of reverse   RPs and the term deposits could be very powerful nine months from now  The term deposit facility, in   particular, could drain a huge amount of reserves; obviously, it depends on the rates that we’re willing to   offer As for the reverse RPs, I think we could find a very large amount of lenders there, as well  So I   think the combination of those two programs will put us in pretty good shape    I think one variation on it would be very much like the term auction facility in   structure The Committee could establish amounts that it wished to auction, take bids, and it would be   very much like the TAF, just in reverse  We probably wouldn’t use the existing technology, the program   for submitting bids and receiving results and various spreadsheets that have been developed  It’s not the   most sophisticated automation, but Sherry Edwards and company have been working for about a year to   develop the code in the Statistics and Reserves system to support an auction and to have all of the entries   pass through to reserve accounting and to the Federal Reserve Banks’ accounting systems properly So I   think on that dimension we’re in very good shape for the term deposit program   I don’t like to view them as competing things  I really view them as kind of   complementary, and it could be that both are very useful    I’m not sure about the theoretical robustness, but I definitely think the staff   shares your basic concerns about whether this would really function in the way the theory might suggest    One of the things that the staff has done is to consult with the GSEs to find out whether their view of it   would align properly  I think it’s also important that we consult with the other side of that transaction, the   banks that would be putting these liabilities on their balance sheets, to find out whether they, in fact,   would find it attractive, because it really takes both sides of that transaction to make this thing work, and I   think it’s really unclear at this stage  The staff has more work to do to vet this to be more confident that it   could be useful    Not yet, no  They’re actually doing a fairly extensive review  They’re treating it   as a new product, and they’re putting it through a fairly standard process that they would use in analyzing   a new product, and they’re going to report those results back to us fairly shortly  So I hope we’ll learn a   good bit from those                                                September 22–23, 2009 34 of 212   Absolutely  First of all, just the pure operational dimension of having an early   withdrawal option for a term deposit is really very difficult  But, beyond that, to your point, certainly if   there were a withdrawal option, you’d want to have a pretty stiff penalty associated with it, so that it   wouldn’t just be relabeling reserves  It would have to have a fairly clear distinction in order to perform   the function that’s intended  "
8847,2009-11-03," Thanks Chris I will be discussing progress on the term deposit  facility, or TDF, under which the Federal Reserve would have the capability to offer  term deposits to depository institutions as a means of reducing the quantity of  reserves in the banking system Work on the TDF has been proceeding along three  important dimensions—further developing systems and preparing for  implementation; drafting key documents, including a Federal Register notice and a  legal agreement for term deposits; and evaluating alternative designs for the TDF  I’ll  briefly summarize progress in each of these three areas in turn and conclude with a  discussion of next steps   The implementation workgroup—which includes Reserve Bank representatives  from various System communities including legal, reserves, accounting, credit-risk,  and customer support—has been overseeing the steps necessary to position the  System to implement the TDF in the first quarter of next year  Last weekend, the  automation development team—after months of hard work—deployed a web-based  application that allows depositories to submit bids or subscription orders for term  deposits via a secure Internet connection  The application supports both posted rate  offerings and auction offerings  In coming months, the implementation team will be  coordinating work across the System on the remaining steps necessary to implement a  term deposit facility, such as formulating procedures for issuing electronic credentials  to access the TDF and developing a communications plan    The staff has also made substantial progress in developing two key documents  that will be necessary before a term deposit facility can be implemented  A system  legal group has produced a draft agreement for term deposits that would be signed by  participating institutions In addition, the staff has developed a draft Federal Register  notice that provides background on the proposed TDF and seeks comment from the                  November 3–4, 2009 21 of 201  public on a number of key design features  The Federal Register notice could be  published this month if desired   The design workgroup has developed some basic structures for a term deposit   facility  The core design issues involve the type of deposit to be offered—fixed rate   versus floating rate—and the mechanism by which deposits would be offered—   through an auction or simply by posting a rate or rates  Beyond these key design   parameters, there are a number of related technical questions, such as the appropriate   maturities of term of deposits; whether to allow an early withdrawal option and, if so,   at what penalty; and whether deposits can be pledged as collateral at the discount   window At present, the staff’s sense is that term deposits would have relatively short   maturities, likely ranging between two weeks and three months  Our current thinking   is that early withdrawal would not be allowed, given that the objective of a TDF is to   drain reserves On the other hand, it seems appropriate that banks should be able   pledge term deposits as collateral at the window, especially if early withdrawal is not   allowed, and the staff is working to ensure that such pledging can be done in an   automated fashion  The proposed Federal Register notice would seek public   comment on all of these basic design questions    The staff anticipates that it will propose going out for public comment on the term   deposit facility with a 30-day comment period  The results from the public comments   would then inform decisions about the final structure for a term deposit facility  On a   parallel track, the implementation group will be coordinating work with Reserve   Banks and various System groups to be in position to implement any of several   potentially desirable structures for the TDF in the first quarter of next year    The staff is proposing a Federal Register notice, potentially this month for   design input on the term deposits  It would be helpful to hear whether that’s a desirable thing or not   Yes I’m sorry There are lots of complications, obviously  I think, to   your point, if they were eligible for collateral, that would presume that the primary credit rate   was substantially above the IOER rate, for example, so that there wouldn’t be an incentive for   them to use these particular classes of assets as collateral at the discount window to undo exactly   the operation And, of course, they have to worry not only about the spread, but also any   nonpecuniary—   Of course, in doing so, they would be suffering a 25 basis point cost in   that operation, so it wouldn’t be an incentive   "
8873,2009-12-15," Following up on the plans discussed at the last meeting, the Desk  carried out a series of small-scale, real-value reverse RP operations over the  intermeeting period to identify any operational difficulties in moving cash and  collateral between the Federal Reserve, the clearing banks, and the primary dealers   Before conducting the operations, the New York Fed released a statement announcing  that a series of such operations would be conducted and emphasizing that they had no  implications for the stance of monetary policy  Five such operations have been  conducted with both Treasury and agency debt securities serving as collateral  The  maturities for these operations ranged from overnight to eight days, including some  with overlapping terms  The operations were quite small—the maximum outstanding  over the last two weeks was only about $400 million—and, as anticipated, had little  or no market impact  All of the operations were conducted, settled, and matured  successfully  A few minor technical issues surfaced and are being addressed  In  short, the tests confirmed that the System now has the capacity to conduct triparty  reverse RP operations effectively with primary dealers using Treasury and agency  debt as collateral   The staff continues to work on extending the reverse RP program to include  agency MBS as collateral and to include a broader set of counterparties Regarding  the extension of collateral to include agency MBS, the staff has been working with  the two triparty clearing banks and the agency MBS custodian to determine the most  efficient, cost-effective means of reversing out agency MBS collateral  Significant  complications must be addressed in this effort, but the team expects to reach  agreement on an overall approach in the near future and to give the clearing banks the  go-ahead to make the necessary system changes within the next month  We expect  that those changes will be implemented by the end of the first quarter of next year and  that small-scale, real-value test reverse RP operations with agency MBS can begin  shortly thereafter                      December 15–16, 2009 31 of 247  In terms of expanding the range of counterparties for reverse RP operations  beyond the primary dealers, the Desk has identified a set of large cash providers and  has begun discussions with some of these firms on a number of operational issues  In  addition, the staff is working to develop a set of public criteria that will allow a small  number of large firms, perhaps two dozen, to present themselves as potential  counterparties Both of these efforts are proving quite challenging given the wide  range of institutions involved The staff is pursuing this agenda aggressively, but our  best guess at this point is that the expansion of the range of counterparties will require  several months for completion   Turning to other work on reserve management tools, the staff has developed a  proposal for a term deposit facility, the basic elements of which were summarized in  a memo distributed last week  As envisioned in the proposal, term deposits would be  a new type of account offered by the Federal Reserve to any institution that is eligible  to earn interest on balances at a Reserve Bank  Balances placed in term deposits  would not be eligible to satisfy reserve or clearing balance requirements or to cover  daylight or overnight overdrafts As a result, balances placed in term deposits would  drain reserves The proposal suggests that term deposits would be fixed-rate  obligations and could have maturities ranging between one and six months with no  early withdrawal option As required by statute, the rate paid on term deposits could  not exceed the general level of short-term interest rates  Consistent with the Federal  Reserve’s general policy of accepting as collateral any sound asset that a bank may  hold, the proposal suggests that term deposits could be pledged as collateral to secure  borrowing at the discount window or daylight credit   The staff proposal notes that term deposits could be offered to the public in  several ways but focuses largely on the possibility of auctioning term deposits   Auctions of term deposits would employ a single-price format so that all winning  bidders receive the highest rate among all winning bids at the auction  Auctions  would be conducted at regular intervals, perhaps every two weeks, and the settlement  dates and maturities of the deposits could be aligned with the beginning of reserve  maintenance periods  The proposal suggests that the Board would select one Reserve  Bank to act as the term deposit offering administrator for the System  The offering  administrator would be responsible for tasks such as announcing term deposit  auctions and posting auction results to a public website   The staff proposal would seek public comment on three basic questions  the need  for limitations on the amount of term deposits that any individual institution may hold  or win at auction; the appropriate range of maturities for term deposits; and whether  there are any alternative structures for term deposits that should be considered  After  review by the Board, the staff proposal would be published in the Federal Register  with a 30-day public comment period Based on the comments received, a final  proposal would be published early next year  As noted previously, the automated  systems necessary to implement a term deposit program have been developed and  tested, but a number of operational steps must be completed before the program can                            December 15–16, 2009 32 of 247  be implemented  The staff will be working aggressively to complete these steps over  the next few months  Bill will now continue the staff presentation   Both of them would give some potential for accessing liquidity  I   personally wouldn’t characterize it as being in conflict  It was a fine judgment on whether we   should allow these to be pledged as collateral at the discount window, but the Federal Reserve   has a long-standing policy of taking basically any asset that a bank can hold as collateral  As           December 15–16, 2009 34 of 247  long as the pricing for the primary credit program is correct, as was pointed out at the last   meeting, actually, there wouldn’t be strong incentives for an institution to pledge collateral at the   primary credit facility in order to invest it in a term deposit  We would ensure that that sort of   arbitrage was ruled out And, of course, there’s lots of stigma around borrowing at the discount   window, too, so the option value of that is probably not that high   I view it, anyway, as sort of a technical thing  Banks already have over $1 trillion worth   of collateral pledged at the discount window  They could do anything they need to at the   primary credit window with any other form of collateral  So there’s nothing really special about   the term deposit facility allowing them to pledge those particular deposits as collateral  It’s just   to be consistent with our existing policy   Well, an early withdrawal option is, first of all, tremendously   complicated to develop in the automated system  The automated system has been developed,   and, to put in that feature, would really greatly complicate things  In addition, you have to worry   a lot about where you set the penalty to guard against very frequent usage of that option  So if   you wanted to provide some capability for these institutions to access liquidity, it just seemed a   lot more natural to keep access to liquidity in a facility where we understand exactly how things   work And, as you know, we don’t anticipate, especially as we move to normalize the program,   that institutions will be regularly using the primary credit facility  But I would say, too, that it   will be interesting to review comments on this from the public    The staff proposal envisions largely an auction facility to offer these   deposits, and you might expect, then, that the auction rate would stop out somewhat below a   comparable term money market instrument, for example, maybe a little bit below LIBOR,   reflecting the fact that we’re a risk-free counterparty rather than a risky counterparty   That seems likely, given the market’s expectations   Well, we’d want to be sure that it couldn’t go higher than the primary   credit rate, for sure  "
8902,2010-01-26,"2  Thank you  I’ll be referring to the materials titled “Materials for   Briefing on Strategies for the Removal of Policy Accommodation”  As background   for this topic, the staff distributed a package of materials to the Committee last week,   including two main policy memos and four supporting memos  I will summarize   some of the background material from the supporting memos, and Spence Hilton will   then continue with a summary of the key policy issues regarding asset sales and the   sequencing of the use of reserve-draining tools                                                          2 The materials used by Messrs Clouse and Hilton are appended to this transcript (appendix 2)   January 26–27, 2010 29 of 260    As noted on page 1, staff members at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York   have been working to enhance the System’s term reverse repurchase capacity by   expanding the range of collateral to include agency MBS and by expanding the list of   counterparties for reverse RPs to include institutions beyond the primary dealers  The   capability to conduct term reverse RPs against agency MBS with primary dealers is   expected to come on line in late March  An initial set of expanded counterparties,   likely including money funds, is expected to be available in late spring               On the term deposit facility (TDF), a Federal Register notice was published at the   end of December, and public comments are due next Monday  The staff will review   the comments and prepare a final proposal next month, and the Board could issue a   final rule in March  Meanwhile, staff members across the System continue to work   toward implementation  Assuming that all goes well, the TDF could be fully   operational in May of this year   The staff has also begun to analyze the possibility of extending the existing   overnight reverse RP arrangement with foreign official accounts—the so-called   foreign RP pool—to include a term reverse component  This work is just beginning,   but our initial estimate is that term reverse RPs with foreign official accounts could   drain $100 billion or so of reserves, on net  That capability may be available by July   Finally, the staff is considering resuming work on reserve collateral accounts   (RCAs)  Reserve collateral accounts would enable banks to pledge balances held in   special accounts at the Federal Reserve as collateral to secure borrowing from the   GSEs and other lenders in the funds market  GSEs could potentially utilize RCAs in   their overnight lending transactions with banks rather than operate through the   brokered federal funds market  The GSEs’ lending in the federal funds market   currently accounts for as much as 90 percent of the activity in the federal funds   market and has generally taken place at rates below the IOER rate  Thus, removing   those transactions could serve to tighten the link between the interest rate paid on   excess reserves and the federal funds rate  However, the federal funds market would   likely be smaller and perhaps more idiosyncratic, at least in the near term  A System   steering group is being formed to develop a plan for the implementation of RCAs    The staff should be able to provide a clearer sense of the necessary steps and time   required to implement RCAs by the time of your next meeting   Page 2 reviews staff projections of the potential to drain reserves with these   various tools  These projections, which were described in a memo circulated ahead   of the meeting, are quite speculative, given that the tools are still being developed and   have never been used to drain reserves on a large scale  That said, as shown in the   shaded column, under fairly conservative assumptions about ramping up the various   reserve-management tools beginning in March, it might be possible to reduce the   quantity of reserve balances by nearly $1 trillion, to a level of about $200 billion in   the fourth quarter of this year  As shown in the columns at the right, these projections   assume that the Federal Reserve begins to ramp up reverse RPs in March, implements   the TDF in May, and implements reverse RPs with foreign accounts in July  These   January 26–27, 2010 30 of 260    projections suggest that the Committee could drain a very sizable quantity of reserves   over a fairly compressed period once the tools have been fully developed  As a   caveat, this exercise focused solely on the operational capabilities of the tools  It did   not attempt to analyze the possible market effects or communication issues that could   arise in executing draining operations of this magnitude            The capability to drain significant quantities of reserves bears on two questions   addressed on page 3  The memo focusing on the federal funds rate and the reserve   market raised two key issues for the exit strategy—the quantity of reserves that must   be drained in order to bring the fed funds rate into closer alignment with the existing   interest rate on excess reserves of 25 basis points and the extent to which the funds   rate will respond to changes in the IOER rate at any given level of reserves  On the   first question, the authors of the memo estimated various specifications for a reserve   demand curve and, by all accounts, the demand curve appears to be very flat at the   current elevated levels of reserve balances  The scatter plot to the left illustrates this   effect quite clearly  Based on the econometric estimates and the visual impression   from the chart, it appears that it might be necessary to drain several hundred billion   dollars of reserves in order to push the funds rate up to the existing IOER rate   The second question—the extent to which the federal funds rate would respond to   an increase in the IOER rate—is even more challenging  Empirical evidence that can   be brought to bear on this question is scarce because the IOER rate has been constant   at ¼ percent since December 2008  However, the Desk’s survey distributed last week   provides some indication of the range of market participants’ views on this issue    The table to the right is a variant of the table that Brian showed, only reporting the   mean survey responses rather than the range of responses  As can be seen,   respondents believe that the spread between the IOER rate and the funds rate would   widen from its current value of around 12 basis points as the IOER rate is increased    In addition, they believe that the degree of widening would be a function of the level   of reserve balances  For example, as shown in the first column, with reserve balances   at $1 trillion, the spread between the IOER rate and the funds rate might widen to   44 basis points if the IOER rate were raised to 2 percent, thus leaving the level of the   funds rate at about 16 percent  As shown in the second column, respondents expect   that the widening of the spread of the interest rate on excess reserves over the funds   rate would be roughly cut in half with a level of reserve balances at $500 billion and   essentially eliminated if balances were returned to pre-crisis levels of $25 billion   As noted on page 4, an important issue the Committee may face during the exit   period is the possibility that the federal funds rate may not be as tightly connected   with other short-term interest rates as in the past  It is worth emphasizing that this has   not been the case to date  As shown in the chart at the right, while the funds rate over   the last year has diverged from the IOER rate, it has remained highly correlated, both   in levels and differences, with other overnight rates  However, with extraordinarily   high levels of reserve balances and new tools being employed, it is possible that the   funds rate could become more idiosyncratic during the exit period  In addition, if   reserve collateral accounts are implemented and the link between the interest rate on   January 26–27, 2010 31 of 260    excess reserves and the fed funds rate is tightened, active trading in the federal funds   market could fall to very low levels  Such possibilities might lead the Committee to   consider targeting alternative rates               As noted in the memo, two essential attributes of a policy instrument are   controllability by the central bank and a predictable relationship with other short-term   interest rates  With these attributes in mind, the memo examined a range of market   rates as possible alternatives to the overnight federal funds rate, including overnight   Eurodollar and LIBOR rates, overnight repo rates, and term money market rates  To   a first-order approximation, targeting any of these alternatives would be roughly   comparable to targeting the federal funds rate given that, at least in ordinary times,   the degree of correlation among these rates is very high  In a crisis period, however,   these potential measures might behave very differently; for example, as noted by the   blue dashed line in the chart, the general collateral repo rate dropped sharply at the   peak of the crisis in 2008 as demand for general Treasury collateral intensified, while   the federal funds rate and LIBOR rates increased sharply as lenders became wary of   taking on uncollateralized exposures   Another possible choice reviewed in the memo is simply to choose the IOER rate   as the primary policy instrument  The IOER rate is obviously perfectly controllable,   but whether it will be an effective anchor for money market rates generally is an open   question  Moreover, the IOER rate does not provide any market guidance for the   conduct of open market operations  The Committee could direct that the Desk   conduct open market operations so as to keep other short-term rates near the IOER   rate, but then it presumably would need to provide guidance about which rates should   be close to the IOER rate and perhaps also how close is close  Selecting the IOER   rate as the principal index of the stance of policy also has some potentially awkward   governance issues in that, by statute, the Board rather than the FOMC sets the IOER   rate  The bottom line is that a number of potential alternatives to the federal funds   rate are available, but none emerges as the clearly preferred choice   The memo from the International Finance Division summarizes foreign   experience with interest on reserves, the subject of page 5  Five of the countries   reviewed currently have very sizable levels of excess reserves—although not nearly   as large as in the United States—and the rates on their redeposit facilities have   generally established effective floors on their interbank rates  The experience of the   Bank of England may be the closest to that of the United States  As detailed in the   memo, the SONIA rate monitored by the Bank of England has hovered 5 to 10 basis   points below the rate of remuneration on excess reserve balances since early 2009  In   other countries, the interbank rate is either above or just slightly below the interest   rate on excess reserves  In general, the effectiveness of the floor on rates across   countries seems to be related to the scope of access to central bank accounts   Foreign country experience also sheds some light on the question addressed on   the previous page concerning the extent to which an increase in the IOER rate can be   used to tighten policy  The Norges Bank tightened policy effectively by 50 basis   January 26–27, 2010 32 of 260    points in late 2009 by increasing its rate of remuneration on reserves despite still-  elevated levels of reserve balances               On balance, foreign country experience suggests that interest on reserves can be   used to set an effective floor on interbank rates and that policy can be tightened by   raising the remuneration rate on excess reserves even when aggregate reserve levels   are quite elevated  However, the memo also notes that foreign experience may be an   imperfect guide in judging likely outcomes in the United States  The fact that the   floor on rates in the United States is less effective than in many other countries raises   questions about how much one can infer from their experiences in tightening financial   conditions   Page 6 focuses on the longer-run balance sheet management issues that the   Committee will eventually need to consider  One long-run issue concerns the   framework for monetary policy implementation  In discussing these issues at the   April 2008 FOMC meeting, the Committee seemed comfortable with the idea of   eventually moving away from a system that depends heavily on mandatory reserve   requirements and either adopting a corridor framework that utilizes a simpler reserve-  accounting framework or moving to a floor system that dispenses with the reserve-  accounting framework altogether  The staff’s sense is that the exit period will likely   provide valuable empirical evidence for judging how well floor systems can be made   to work  Moreover, the Committee could move toward any of these possible systems   once the level of reserves has been returned to a more normal level   Other long-term balance sheet management issues include the long-run size and   composition of the balance sheet  Historically, the size of the Federal Reserve’s   balance sheet has been driven largely by trend growth of currency in circulation    However, given the authority to pay interest on reserves and the availability of new   draining tools, the Committee could, in principle, expand and contract the size of the   balance sheet as a means of easing or tightening financial conditions in addition to   adjusting the target federal funds rate  In addition, the Committee might wish to set   more-specific goals for the size of the portfolio in the steady state  The Committee   will likely also wish to consider its desired composition of the balance sheet  A key   question here is whether the Committee wishes to return to a Treasury-only portfolio    The staff memo noted that holding non-Treasury assets potentially involves a number   of complications for a central bank  In addition, the maturity structure of the portfolio   may be worth revisiting  In particular, a short-maturity portfolio may be desired to   provide for flexibility in meeting any potential future increase in loans or other assets    Spence will continue our presentation    Well, the decision to suspend work really wasn’t a decision that it wasn’t   worth pursuing  It was just that there were constraints on various resources—particularly, the   same resources that would be developing the RCAs are the ones that are currently being   employed to develop the term deposit facility  But as we are now getting closer to an   implementation date for the term deposit facility, we feel as though we are in a position to again   take up the work on reserve collateral accounts    I may have one story, but I bet Brian has better ones    Presumably that spread should reflect whatever impediments there are in   the arbitrage process  So if you think there are credit constraints of the type that Jamie   McAndrews has discussed or you just don’t want to be seen borrowing in the overnight funds   market for fear of being seen needing funds or if there are capital issues, then all of those things   might lead to a gap between the market rate and the IOER rate    Right now you’re very compressed between the IOER rate and the zero   bound, which is a very effective zero bound  But as you raise that, it is a good bet that there is   one-way risk on where it will go  So I can’t tell you whether it will be an S-shaped curve or   whether it is an exponential curve, but it is a pretty good bet that it will be wider as we raise the   January 26–27, 2010 41 of 260    IOER rate  And in fact, it was wider, as you know, when we first started  Those were   tumultuous times    I think that is absolutely a key question  To your first question, it   certainly does make the floor permeable, and that’s what we have observed so far  But I come   back again  The GSEs have an incentive to lend below the IOER rate, but there’s also some   January 26–27, 2010 42 of 260    impediment to arbitrage that prevents other borrowers in the market from buying up lots of funds   and bidding the rate up to the IOER rate  So at least in a perfectly competitive, frictionless   market, the fact that the GSEs don’t have access to the IOER rate shouldn’t result in a funds rate   that is markedly below the IOER rate because it would just get competed away  But we’re not   seeing that for a variety of reasons evidently  But I think your question is right on target, and it’s   kind of a major question around what will happen to these widening spreads    It cannot be higher than the general level of short-term interest rates, but   that’s a term of art that is being defined in the regulation—in particular, the list of short-term   interest rates that are included in the regulation include the primary credit rate, which will likely   be somewhat above the general level of many market interest rates  So as a general matter   probably it will be the case that the Board and the Committee can envision setting the IOER rate   where they wish and not be constrained by that feature of the statute  "
