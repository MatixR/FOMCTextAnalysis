6306,2001-06-26," I’d like to begin by thanking Don Kohn and Sandy  Struckmeyer for inviting the Boston Fed to give its perhaps aberrant views on  productivity developments         I’d also like to start off by emphasizing that I am a productivity  optimist  I believe that the creation, adoption, and adaptation of new  technologies over the past twenty years has increased the efficiency with  which the economy produces a wide variety of goods and services As you  know, this process, while inherently a surge in the level of productivity, is  ongoing and gradual, and has thus been manifested in a notable rise in the  average growth rate of productivity The process continues today; I am  optimistic not just about the past, but about the future growth of productivity   I want to take a minute today to raise a few questions--in particular,  quantitatively how much optimism is warranted, and with how much  precision can we quantify it?  Second, how much weight should we put on the  most recent observations in estimating trend productivity growth?  And  finally, how much more difficult does the strong complementarity of  computer hardware and software make our attempts to measure the capital  services that derive from them?   To anticipate my answers to these questions, I believe that   (1) statistically, it is difficult to justify long-run productivity growth   much in excess of 25 percent or so;  (2) how much weight to put on the most recent observations is largely   a matter of judgment, not statistics; and  (3) the interactions between computer hardware and software make   inferences about capital services especially difficult and subject to more than  the normal degree of uncertainty, which is large to begin with   To put my cards on the table, I estimate that we currently enjoy a 25  percent trend rate of productivity growth and will likely continue at a rate  near that for the next 5 to 10 years  Reassuringly, as of the June Greenbook,  the Board staff and I have converged on the same near-term estimate  My  basis for this long-run assessment is that network and telecommunications  technologies are still evolving, and their improvement, adaptation, and  gradual adoption will likely add to productivity over the next decade  My  estimate of current and near-term productivity growth is derived, as is the     6/26-27/01 14   Board staff’s, from a variety of techniques including direct trend estimation,  inference from Okun’s law relationships, and growth accounting  All of these  involve a good measure of judgment   To begin, I’d like to take a very simple look at aggregate productivity  data Turning to the next page of our briefing materials, the top panel of  figure 1 displays the distribution of quarterly productivity growth rates over  the past 6 years  I chose this period because many have dated the shift in  productivity growth to early 1995, and I will provide evidence corroborating  that date in a moment  What do I see in this simple picture?   First, there are only 25 quarterly numbers in this plot  That is not  much data from which to infer a trend shift  As a necessary consequence, we  cannot say with much certainty whether a shift has occurred, and if so, how  large the shift is Again, I believe a shift upward to about 25 percent growth  has occurred But I could not rule out the Board staff’s earlier, more  optimistic estimates, nor could I rule out the possibility that recent  productivity surges will prove largely transitory   The second observation to make from the figure is that the 25 quarters  fall more than 2 to 1 in growth rates below 35 percent  The average growth  rate during the period is about 25 percent   Turning to the bottom panel of figure 1, it is not the case that higher  growth rates tend to be clustered in the more recent years or that lower  growth rates are clustered in the early portion of the sample  This panel uses  the same color-coding by growth range as the upper panel, from slow growth  (dark blue) to rapid (red) As the lower panel indicates, slow and moderately  rapid growth rates are fairly evenly distributed across the six years  This time  distribution of growth rates suggests that, while the average growth rate has  likely shifted up, the basis for an ongoing acceleration in productivity is not  as immediately evident   Nonetheless, the three highest growth rates in this period occurred  relatively recently, in the third and fourth quarters of 1999 and the second  quarter of 2000 As a result, the rate of productivity growth for the four  quarters ending in the 2nd quarter of 2000 was an astonishing 53 percent  If  evidence of further acceleration is to be found, it is in the fairly short and  recent period from mid-1999 through mid-2000   More formal statistical tests for productivity trend shifts confirm the  insights from this simple analysis  Figure 2 presents results of tests for a shift  in the productivity trend allowing for multiple unknown breakpoints This test  looks for breakpoints over a given sample while remaining completely  agnostic about the location of the breakpoints  It’s important to note that,  owing to restrictions from statistical theory, this procedure does not allow     6/26-27/01 15   breakpoints too frequently, say every two or three years, or breaks too close  to the beginning or end of the sample  But I think that’s actually a good  thing determining frequent or recent breaks in trends is a matter for  judgment, not statistics   The actual quarterly growth in nonfarm business productivity is  shown in the gray bars in the figure The red line depicts the estimated trend  productivity growth rates for the sub-periods defined by the breakpoints The  figure suggests the following   The simplest test, shown in the top panel, finds a shift in trend  productivity growth in early 1995 The estimated growth rate from 1995 to  2001 is 24 percent   In the middle panel, I add to the breakpoint test regressors that attempt  to control for “cyclical” effects on productivity growth--rapid, unmeasured  increases in labor effort during spurts of high demand, for example  While  these cyclical effects are indeed significant in explaining some of the  quarterly fluctuations in productivity, they do not materially alter the  estimates of the recent trend growth rate from the top panel   In the bottom panel, the growth in capital services per hour--the  “capital deepening” variable of choice--is added to the test regression  The  addition of this variable virtually eliminates any recent shifts in trend  productivity That is, after controlling for capital deepening, average  productivity growth since the mid-1990s is roughly equal to the average for  the dozen years before that   This last result suggests that multifactor productivity growth, which  accounts for the bulk of labor productivity after excluding the effects of  capital deepening, has grown at a healthy pace over the past decade or more ­ -about a percentage point faster than in the dismal ’70s and early ’80s  However, this method provides little evidence of a more recent increase in  trend multifactor productivity growth  Sustained increases in productivity  must ultimately be supported by multifactor productivity growth--that is, by  technological progress With steady technological progress, we can  continuously add new machines that embody the latest technology without  suffering diminishing returns  I believe that this process of embodied- technology-driven investment was at the heart of the capital deepening in the  late 1990s and may well drive additional capital deepening when we recover  from the current slowdown  But once again, an acceleration in productivity  which arises from an increase in the rate of growth of multifactor productivity  is hard to justify using this methodology   In discussing Figure 1, I noted that the evidence for a more rapid  increase in productivity growth lies in a few key observations between mid­    6/26-27/01 16   1999 and mid-2000  This leads naturally to the question In assessing  changes in productivity growth, how much weight should one put on the  recent past?  As I suggested, this is largely a matter of judgment, not statistics  or economic theory  Your next chart (figure 3) displays the evolution of the  Board staff’s estimates of structural productivity growth over the past six  years As the chart indicates, as recently as mid-1997, the Board staff had  estimated structural productivity growth, shown in the black dotted lines, at  below 1 percent, which looks quite pessimistic by today’s standards  To be  sure, some of this pessimism arose from the less robust growth evident in the  unrevised, real-time data shown in the light gray line   As of September 1999, the Board estimated trend growth for 2001  (the bold red line at the right) at 23 percent  From that point, their estimate  rose dramatically, increasing almost 15 percentage points in less than 12  months, echoing actual productivity performance in 1999 and early 2000  Since August of 2000, the Board’s forecast for structural productivity growth  for 2001 has fallen almost 12 percentage points, just as actual productivity  growth has slowed In the interest of full disclosure, I should note that I was  probably too slow to revise my estimates of productivity growth upward  In  May of 1998 I estimated structural productivity growth at 13 percent; in June  of 1999 my estimate was at 175 percent; and only by September of 2000 had  I raised my estimate to 25 percent, where it stands now   Of course, the Board staff’s rising and falling estimates arise through  the link between the staff’s investment forecast and its computation of capital  services per hour Rapid investment implies larger net additions to the capital  stock, a larger flow of capital services from that stock, and more capital  services per hour While this methodology has a sound theoretical basis, our  judgment is that it has produced large and rapid swings in structural  productivity that may stretch many people’s notion of “structural” I offer two  reasons for smoothing through some of these recent bursts of productivity  First, it is conceivable that much of the investment in 1999/2000 was Y2K­ related computer investment--or just generic over-investment--that didn’t  deliver much in the way of additional capital services  Second, we think it  likely that a good portion of both the unusually high productivity numbers  and the very recent lower ones reflects unmeasured variations in effort, rather  than changes in underlying productivity  Not all hours of work yield the  same effective input  It is likely that workers can increase effort per hour for  short periods of time when demand is high  These unmeasured changes in the  intensity of effort may have allowed temporary, unsustainable increases in  output without structural productivity increases   Finally, I’d like to raise a conceptual question about how well our  productivity accounting systems capture the joint contribution of computing  equipment and software to capital services per worker  In essence, my  concern boils down to the possibility that we may have over-adjusted     6/26-27/01 17   computer prices for quality improvements, thus over-estimating their  contribution to real output and productivity  No doubt the rapid declines in  hardware prices approximate the increased processor speed and storage  capacity of new computer models  However, it may not be the case that these  increases in hardware capability accurately reflect the increased functionality  provided to businesses by the combined hardware-software bundle   Hardware often advances just enough to make it possible to run the latest  software Here I have in mind, for example, the “killer apps” reference in the  staff memo on capital overhang--killer applications that require new hardware  to run them  As a result, the services delivered by the bundle of hardware and  software are not likely to equal the sum of the independently computed  service flows for hardware and software In addition, this interdependence of  the development of new software and hardware is a key determinant of the  effective rate of hardware obsolescence  This is a significant departure from  standard assumptions about capital depreciation  These complexities  seriously tax our standard methods for tracking the additions to capital  services of the hardware/software bundle  I am not suggesting an elegant  alternative to our current methods, although I believe this will be an  important area for future research  But I do wish to point out that this  fundamentally complex conceptual problem adds to the uncertainty  surrounding our estimates of capital services and, hence, of structural  productivity growth   In sum, our near-term estimate of trend productivity growth is 25  percent, the same as the Board’s current estimate, although we have  sometimes differed in the past and may in the future  The long-run prognosis  for productivity growth is also good, because it appears that the growth in  multifactor productivity has improved markedly compared to the 1970s  That  said, the difficulties in estimating productivity trends should not be  underestimated  They include inferring recent trend breaks with relatively  few data points, separating “cyclical” from secular fluctuations, making  assumptions about the rate of technological progress going forward, and  measuring capital services for conceptually complex hardware/software  bundles These difficulties leave plenty of scope for reasonable individuals to  disagree   Charlie Steindel from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York will  now continue the presentation    There is some of that    At some risk--maybe when the Chairman speaks for me, I should just   keep my mouth shut and leave well enough alone--I just want to try to clarify one point  And that   is that I don’t think we’re actually as far different in our concept of what productivity is as you   might be suggesting  I would not as an operational matter use simple long-run linear trends to   figure out structural productivity In fact, the reason I believe that productivity growth     6/26-27/01 27   accelerated over time is precisely because we had sustained bursts of investment that actually did   add capital services because those services embodied new technology  So that concept, I think, is   absolutely right The question is only about short periods, when we impute productivity surges   that are structural because of investment bursts that may not deliver capital services in the way   that the model says they would  Then there’s some scope for applying judgment to adjust those   estimates, and I’m applying judgment a little differently from the way the Board staff is as well    But I don’t think we’re quite so different in terms of our notion of structural productivity    Yes    I would be somewhat hesitant to draw very tight links between   anybody's specific estimate of structural productivity and what the stock market did or didn't do   at any point in time  I think a qualitative link is there in that, yes, we in Boston believe that   structural productivity has increased for the reasons you just enumerated and that at some level   it’s sensible for the stock market to price that in  I have no disagreement with that  We are only   disagreeing about how much, whether some of these developments were transitory, and whether     6/26-27/01 39   the stock market should have seen through them, and so on  That's a matter for an academic   debate But there are lines of your story that I would certainly agree with  "
