6820,2001-06-26,FUHRER," I’d like to begin by thanking Don Kohn and Sandy  Struckmeyer for inviting the Boston Fed to give its perhaps aberrant views on  productivity developments         I’d also like to start off by emphasizing that I am a productivity  optimist  I believe that the creation, adoption, and adaptation of new  technologies over the past twenty years has increased the efficiency with  which the economy produces a wide variety of goods and services As you  know, this process, while inherently a surge in the level of productivity, is  ongoing and gradual, and has thus been manifested in a notable rise in the  average growth rate of productivity The process continues today; I am  optimistic not just about the past, but about the future growth of productivity   I want to take a minute today to raise a few questions--in particular,  quantitatively how much optimism is warranted, and with how much  precision can we quantify it?  Second, how much weight should we put on the  most recent observations in estimating trend productivity growth?  And  finally, how much more difficult does the strong complementarity of  computer hardware and software make our attempts to measure the capital  services that derive from them?   To anticipate my answers to these questions, I believe that   (1) statistically, it is difficult to justify long-run productivity growth   much in excess of 25 percent or so;  (2) how much weight to put on the most recent observations is largely   a matter of judgment, not statistics; and  (3) the interactions between computer hardware and software make   inferences about capital services especially difficult and subject to more than  the normal degree of uncertainty, which is large to begin with   To put my cards on the table, I estimate that we currently enjoy a 25  percent trend rate of productivity growth and will likely continue at a rate  near that for the next 5 to 10 years  Reassuringly, as of the June Greenbook,  the Board staff and I have converged on the same near-term estimate  My  basis for this long-run assessment is that network and telecommunications  technologies are still evolving, and their improvement, adaptation, and  gradual adoption will likely add to productivity over the next decade  My  estimate of current and near-term productivity growth is derived, as is the     6/26-27/01 14   Board staff’s, from a variety of techniques including direct trend estimation,  inference from Okun’s law relationships, and growth accounting  All of these  involve a good measure of judgment   To begin, I’d like to take a very simple look at aggregate productivity  data Turning to the next page of our briefing materials, the top panel of  figure 1 displays the distribution of quarterly productivity growth rates over  the past 6 years  I chose this period because many have dated the shift in  productivity growth to early 1995, and I will provide evidence corroborating  that date in a moment  What do I see in this simple picture?   First, there are only 25 quarterly numbers in this plot  That is not  much data from which to infer a trend shift  As a necessary consequence, we  cannot say with much certainty whether a shift has occurred, and if so, how  large the shift is Again, I believe a shift upward to about 25 percent growth  has occurred But I could not rule out the Board staff’s earlier, more  optimistic estimates, nor could I rule out the possibility that recent  productivity surges will prove largely transitory   The second observation to make from the figure is that the 25 quarters  fall more than 2 to 1 in growth rates below 35 percent  The average growth  rate during the period is about 25 percent   Turning to the bottom panel of figure 1, it is not the case that higher  growth rates tend to be clustered in the more recent years or that lower  growth rates are clustered in the early portion of the sample  This panel uses  the same color-coding by growth range as the upper panel, from slow growth  (dark blue) to rapid (red) As the lower panel indicates, slow and moderately  rapid growth rates are fairly evenly distributed across the six years  This time  distribution of growth rates suggests that, while the average growth rate has  likely shifted up, the basis for an ongoing acceleration in productivity is not  as immediately evident   Nonetheless, the three highest growth rates in this period occurred  relatively recently, in the third and fourth quarters of 1999 and the second  quarter of 2000 As a result, the rate of productivity growth for the four  quarters ending in the 2nd quarter of 2000 was an astonishing 53 percent  If  evidence of further acceleration is to be found, it is in the fairly short and  recent period from mid-1999 through mid-2000   More formal statistical tests for productivity trend shifts confirm the  insights from this simple analysis  Figure 2 presents results of tests for a shift  in the productivity trend allowing for multiple unknown breakpoints This test  looks for breakpoints over a given sample while remaining completely  agnostic about the location of the breakpoints  It’s important to note that,  owing to restrictions from statistical theory, this procedure does not allow     6/26-27/01 15   breakpoints too frequently, say every two or three years, or breaks too close  to the beginning or end of the sample  But I think that’s actually a good  thing determining frequent or recent breaks in trends is a matter for  judgment, not statistics   The actual quarterly growth in nonfarm business productivity is  shown in the gray bars in the figure The red line depicts the estimated trend  productivity growth rates for the sub-periods defined by the breakpoints The  figure suggests the following   The simplest test, shown in the top panel, finds a shift in trend  productivity growth in early 1995 The estimated growth rate from 1995 to  2001 is 24 percent   In the middle panel, I add to the breakpoint test regressors that attempt  to control for “cyclical” effects on productivity growth--rapid, unmeasured  increases in labor effort during spurts of high demand, for example  While  these cyclical effects are indeed significant in explaining some of the  quarterly fluctuations in productivity, they do not materially alter the  estimates of the recent trend growth rate from the top panel   In the bottom panel, the growth in capital services per hour--the  “capital deepening” variable of choice--is added to the test regression  The  addition of this variable virtually eliminates any recent shifts in trend  productivity That is, after controlling for capital deepening, average  productivity growth since the mid-1990s is roughly equal to the average for  the dozen years before that   This last result suggests that multifactor productivity growth, which  accounts for the bulk of labor productivity after excluding the effects of  capital deepening, has grown at a healthy pace over the past decade or more ­ -about a percentage point faster than in the dismal ’70s and early ’80s  However, this method provides little evidence of a more recent increase in  trend multifactor productivity growth  Sustained increases in productivity  must ultimately be supported by multifactor productivity growth--that is, by  technological progress With steady technological progress, we can  continuously add new machines that embody the latest technology without  suffering diminishing returns  I believe that this process of embodied- technology-driven investment was at the heart of the capital deepening in the  late 1990s and may well drive additional capital deepening when we recover  from the current slowdown  But once again, an acceleration in productivity  which arises from an increase in the rate of growth of multifactor productivity  is hard to justify using this methodology   In discussing Figure 1, I noted that the evidence for a more rapid  increase in productivity growth lies in a few key observations between mid­    6/26-27/01 16   1999 and mid-2000  This leads naturally to the question In assessing  changes in productivity growth, how much weight should one put on the  recent past?  As I suggested, this is largely a matter of judgment, not statistics  or economic theory  Your next chart (figure 3) displays the evolution of the  Board staff’s estimates of structural productivity growth over the past six  years As the chart indicates, as recently as mid-1997, the Board staff had  estimated structural productivity growth, shown in the black dotted lines, at  below 1 percent, which looks quite pessimistic by today’s standards  To be  sure, some of this pessimism arose from the less robust growth evident in the  unrevised, real-time data shown in the light gray line   As of September 1999, the Board estimated trend growth for 2001  (the bold red line at the right) at 23 percent  From that point, their estimate  rose dramatically, increasing almost 15 percentage points in less than 12  months, echoing actual productivity performance in 1999 and early 2000  Since August of 2000, the Board’s forecast for structural productivity growth  for 2001 has fallen almost 12 percentage points, just as actual productivity  growth has slowed In the interest of full disclosure, I should note that I was  probably too slow to revise my estimates of productivity growth upward  In  May of 1998 I estimated structural productivity growth at 13 percent; in June  of 1999 my estimate was at 175 percent; and only by September of 2000 had  I raised my estimate to 25 percent, where it stands now   Of course, the Board staff’s rising and falling estimates arise through  the link between the staff’s investment forecast and its computation of capital  services per hour Rapid investment implies larger net additions to the capital  stock, a larger flow of capital services from that stock, and more capital  services per hour While this methodology has a sound theoretical basis, our  judgment is that it has produced large and rapid swings in structural  productivity that may stretch many people’s notion of “structural” I offer two  reasons for smoothing through some of these recent bursts of productivity  First, it is conceivable that much of the investment in 1999/2000 was Y2K­ related computer investment--or just generic over-investment--that didn’t  deliver much in the way of additional capital services  Second, we think it  likely that a good portion of both the unusually high productivity numbers  and the very recent lower ones reflects unmeasured variations in effort, rather  than changes in underlying productivity  Not all hours of work yield the  same effective input  It is likely that workers can increase effort per hour for  short periods of time when demand is high  These unmeasured changes in the  intensity of effort may have allowed temporary, unsustainable increases in  output without structural productivity increases   Finally, I’d like to raise a conceptual question about how well our  productivity accounting systems capture the joint contribution of computing  equipment and software to capital services per worker  In essence, my  concern boils down to the possibility that we may have over-adjusted     6/26-27/01 17   computer prices for quality improvements, thus over-estimating their  contribution to real output and productivity  No doubt the rapid declines in  hardware prices approximate the increased processor speed and storage  capacity of new computer models  However, it may not be the case that these  increases in hardware capability accurately reflect the increased functionality  provided to businesses by the combined hardware-software bundle   Hardware often advances just enough to make it possible to run the latest  software Here I have in mind, for example, the “killer apps” reference in the  staff memo on capital overhang--killer applications that require new hardware  to run them  As a result, the services delivered by the bundle of hardware and  software are not likely to equal the sum of the independently computed  service flows for hardware and software In addition, this interdependence of  the development of new software and hardware is a key determinant of the  effective rate of hardware obsolescence  This is a significant departure from  standard assumptions about capital depreciation  These complexities  seriously tax our standard methods for tracking the additions to capital  services of the hardware/software bundle  I am not suggesting an elegant  alternative to our current methods, although I believe this will be an  important area for future research  But I do wish to point out that this  fundamentally complex conceptual problem adds to the uncertainty  surrounding our estimates of capital services and, hence, of structural  productivity growth   In sum, our near-term estimate of trend productivity growth is 25  percent, the same as the Board’s current estimate, although we have  sometimes differed in the past and may in the future  The long-run prognosis  for productivity growth is also good, because it appears that the growth in  multifactor productivity has improved markedly compared to the 1970s  That  said, the difficulties in estimating productivity trends should not be  underestimated  They include inferring recent trend breaks with relatively  few data points, separating “cyclical” from secular fluctuations, making  assumptions about the rate of technological progress going forward, and  measuring capital services for conceptually complex hardware/software  bundles These difficulties leave plenty of scope for reasonable individuals to  disagree   Charlie Steindel from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York will  now continue the presentation   There is some of that   At some risk--maybe when the Chairman speaks for me, I should just   keep my mouth shut and leave well enough alone--I just want to try to clarify one point  And that   is that I don’t think we’re actually as far different in our concept of what productivity is as you   might be suggesting  I would not as an operational matter use simple long-run linear trends to   figure out structural productivity In fact, the reason I believe that productivity growth     6/26-27/01 27   accelerated over time is precisely because we had sustained bursts of investment that actually did   add capital services because those services embodied new technology  So that concept, I think, is   absolutely right The question is only about short periods, when we impute productivity surges   that are structural because of investment bursts that may not deliver capital services in the way   that the model says they would  Then there’s some scope for applying judgment to adjust those   estimates, and I’m applying judgment a little differently from the way the Board staff is as well    But I don’t think we’re quite so different in terms of our notion of structural productivity   Yes   I would be somewhat hesitant to draw very tight links between   anybody's specific estimate of structural productivity and what the stock market did or didn't do   at any point in time  I think a qualitative link is there in that, yes, we in Boston believe that   structural productivity has increased for the reasons you just enumerated and that at some level   it’s sensible for the stock market to price that in  I have no disagreement with that  We are only   disagreeing about how much, whether some of these developments were transitory, and whether     6/26-27/01 39   the stock market should have seen through them, and so on  That's a matter for an academic   debate But there are lines of your story that I would certainly agree with  "
8879,2009-12-15,FUHRER," Thank you, Mr Chairman  In thinking about how to introduce  this topic this morning I was tempted to extend the Titanic metaphor of yesterday  afternoon Were I to do that, I might note that First Officer Wilcox and Ensign Sheets  had left the Committee in the middle of the frigid North Atlantic, clinging to flimsy  life boats, while the sharks of high unemployment and highly uncertain inflation  circled hungrily Fortunately, the intrepid crew of the RMS Carpathia, headed by  officers Michael Dotsey from Philadelphia, Mark Wynne from Dallas, and Jeff  Fuhrer from Boston, were steaming their way to extricate the Committee from its  rather precarious circumstances  However, I chose not to extend that metaphor   [Laughter] Further, in part, because, unlike Batman, who seems to have an endless  supply of tools in his utility belt to take care of any circumstances that might arise in  Gotham City, we don’t actually have any such tools to extricate you from your  predicament  So, I will move on and leave that belabored metaphor alone                             December 15–16, 2009 144 of 247  In weighing the options for monetary policy in the coming years, inflation plays a  pivotal role If inflation stabilizes at its recent level and then rises gradually to the  Committee’s implicit goal, while unemployment declines towards a rate consistent  with full employment over the same horizon, many will consider this an acceptable  outcome  If, on the other hand, inflation continues to decline in the presence of  elevated unemployment, falling more significantly below the Committee’s goal, then  the Committee’s policy decisions could become much more complicated   Which of these outcomes materializes will depend on what determines inflation in  the short run So what does determine inflation?  In answering this question, I am  reminded of one of my favorite stories, which involves Sigmund Freud and one of his  graduate students (and which is probably entirely apocryphal)  The student was  troubled about Freud’s theory that all dreams reflect wish fulfillment  She had a  recurrent dream in which she murdered her young children, and she found it  impossible to believe that this dream reflected her wishes  When she posed this  dilemma to Freud, he thought for a moment and replied, “But don’t you see that your  dream simply reflects your wish to disprove my theories?”  [Laughter]   Like Freud, economists love to be clever, and also like Freud, our deep and  abiding love of our own theories may make it difficult for us to see their flaws  In  considering the possible trajectory of inflation, I believe we should contemplate the  alternatives with un-Freud-like humility  The fact is that we don’t know what will  happen to inflation  In recent years, inflation has certainly fluctuated, but it has been  quite stable by the standards of the 1970s and 1980s  It appears to have been so far  only modestly responsive to the significant declines in employment, activity, and  labor costs And, while short-run inflation expectations have generally tracked short- run movements in inflation, some measures of long-run expectations have remained  remarkably stable  As a consequence, it is difficult to know whether inflation in this  turbulent period will respond to economic conditions as it did in the turbulent 1970s  and 1980s, or instead remain placid in the wake of recent and ongoing upheaval,  taking on the imperturbable, sphinx-like demeanor that was characteristic of inflation  in the period that we now fondly remember as The Great Moderation    Our goal today, then, is not to provide evidence that irrefutably explains how  inflation has behaved and where it must go, but instead to impose a degree of rigor on  the discussion, to raise questions based on our best theoretical and empirical analysis,  and, most importantly, to spark a discussion among the principals at this table that  will help us better understand each of our imperfect frameworks for thinking about  inflation   And in that regard, I would just note that, at breakfast this morning, such a  discussion started to emerge—a rather engaging, interactive discussion about some of  the issues that we’ll talk about today  So I’m hoping that maybe some of that sense  will spill over to the discussion this morning  Now let me turn it over to Mike  Dotsey, who will make the first presentation                                                                     4 The materials used by Mr Dotsey are appended to this transcript (appendix 4)   December 15–16, 2009 145 of 247 6  I’ll be referring to the third of the three exhibits in your packets   I just wanted to note before starting that the work I’ll discuss reflects contributions  from other people in the room today, including Giovanni Olivei, Wilbert van der  Klaauw, and Todd Clark, as well as other economists who couldn’t be with us today   In current discussions regarding the likely trajectory of inflation, two issues loom   large  first, whether “well-anchored” expectations will help to restrain inflation’s  decline and, on the flip side, whether an “unanchoring” of expectations could lead to  an undesirably high rate of inflation; and second, whether and  to what extent output  (or, more generally, resource utilization) gaps are useful components of empirical  models of inflation, and, if they are, to what extent current gaps will counterbalance  the effects of expectations on inflation   Page three of your handout provides a skeletal depiction of the most widely used  framework for modeling inflation  Some version of this model is in use at virtually  all Reserve Banks and the Board; in fact, very little exists in the way of strongly  competing frameworks  As the top left panel of the chart shows, the framework  suggests that inflation depends on the expectation of inflation in the next period, the  current value of a driving variable such as marginal cost of production or an output  gap, and the inherent inertia in inflation, captured by dependence on the previous  period’s inflation rate Many other factors can influence inflation directly and  indirectly, but these key elements sit at the center of the framework and of recent  discussion The extent to which each of these three factors contributes to the  evolution of inflation remains under considerable debate   The top right panel of that chart highlights an implication of this simple  framework  If the framework is true in the current period, it holds in the next period  as well If you squint at these two panels for just a few minutes, and squint in just the  right way, you’ll see that the model boiled down implies that inflation fundamentally  depends on current and expected output or marginal cost, as noted in the bottom left   panel of the chart Of course, expectations of output depend in part on expectations  of monetary policy  Policy in turn depends on the inflation goal, which in this  framework may vary over time  As a consequence, expectations of monetary policy                                 December 15–16, 2009 152 of 247  actions and the monetary authority’s inflation goal are, not surprisingly, among the  determinants of inflation   The bottom right panel of that same exhibit displays the implications that this  framework holds concerning which expectations measures should best explain  inflation Taken together, the simplest features of the model in the top left panel and  its implications in the next two panels suggest that short-term inflation expectations  matter directly—or, equivalently, that the expectations for output on average over the  medium term matter directly  Less directly, but certainly importantly for this  audience, long-run inflation expectations should matter, to the extent that they serve  as proxies for the central bank’s long-run inflation goal   What do “anchored expectations” mean in this framework?  Your next exhibit, the  fourth exhibit, suggests that anchored expectations should be interpreted as having  two components  First, the public knows the FOMC’s numerical inflation goal, and  second, the public believes that goal is not likely to change—at least, not by much   As indicated in the exhibit, many believe that the Fed’s inflation goal has changed  quite significantly in postwar history, particularly in the 1970s and 1980s  More  recent evidence suggests that public perceptions of the Fed’s goal have changed little  in recent years As shown in your next exhibit, exhibit 5, a carefully constructed  econometric estimate of the inflation trend—often interpreted as the public’s  perception of the FOMC’s inflation goal—suggests that it has indeed varied over time  and that the variation is well proxied by the median SPF 10-year CPI inflation  forecast, and that this proxy has been remarkably stable over the past 10 to 12 years   If this proxy accurately reflects the relevant expectations, then they are currently  well-anchored indeed   We now use a model that incorporates all these features—well-anchored  expectations, some effect of output gaps or marginal cost on inflation, and some  effect of lagged inflation—to quantify the extent to which, in circumstances such as  those we face today, well-anchored expectations may serve to offset downward  pressures on inflation from dramatic declines in marginal cost Your next two exhibits  consider such an exercise   In the first case, shown in exhibit 6, expectations are purely forward-looking  The  economy starts at a 2 percent inflation rate, that’s the black line in the top panel, with  marginal cost, shown in the bottom panel, well below its historical average—as is the  case today for real unit labor costs for the nonfarm business sector, which are about  8 to 10 percent below their long-run average  Somewhat optimistically, I assume that  the output gap is only modestly negative  In these circumstances, the inflation rate,  which is shown by the solid black line, falls to a bit below 1 percent, and rises after  two to three years to the Fed’s assumed inflation goal of 2 percent, which is depicted  by the red line   In the second case, which is shown in your next exhibit, exhibit 7, inflation  depends in roughly equal measure on lagged and expected inflation  The other                             December 15–16, 2009 153 of 247  features of the simulation are identical, but the results in this case are dramatically  different Inflation falls significantly below zero, and the funds rate, the dashed black  line, is pinned at the zero lower bound for several quarters  I should emphasize that  the coefficient on marginal cost in these simulations is quite small by historical  standards The point is that one needs only a very small dependence on marginal cost  to develop such results   Clearly, the implications for inflation in this canonical framework depend  critically on the way expectations are formed—purely forward-looking or with some  measure of backward-looking influence  So which is a better description of inflation?  Your next exhibit, number 8, outlines an empirical approach to answering this  question We estimate a model that allows expectations to be determined by any  combination of the following measures the rational or model-consistent expectations  employed in the preceding simulations, lagged inflation, and short- and long-term  survey expectations, here using the Survey of Professional Forecasters’ measures   We allow the contributions of these four expectations proxies to vary over time   Your next exhibit, exhibit 9, presents a simple summary of the results  On  average over the past 30 years, the purely forward-looking expectations have played  at most a modest role in explaining inflation, and that role appears to have declined in  importance in recent years  Lagged inflation has played a somewhat larger role  historically, although its role has similarly declined in recent years  Survey  expectations have helped to explain inflation, and their influence appears to have  risen in recent years I would note that the survey measures are well-approximated by  slow-moving averages of recent inflation, which suggests that they too may “anchor”  inflation, as they will lend a slow-moving component to it  While this might serve to  slow the decline of inflation in the face of significant marginal cost pressure, it will  also slow inflation during its ascent to the Fed’s inflation goal  The bottom line of  this exercise is that the data suggest that the very favorable outcome in the purely  forward-looking exercise of exhibit 6 is not our best forecast   Your next several exhibits consider what would happen if the public’s inflation  expectations were to become unanchored Note that the models that we used in the  simulations just a moment ago require inflation ultimately to rise one-for-one with an  increase in long-run inflation expectations  Interestingly, estimates of a less  structured empirical model, shown in exhibit 11, yield the same basic result  A  reasonable interpretation of that result is that when long-run expectations move  significantly and persistently, they likely reflect a change in the public’s perception of  our inflation goal Such a shift, if sustained, would very likely feed into inflation over  time   Your next exhibit, number 12, considers a potential cause of such a shift in long- run expectations Based on the same empirical model, the exhibit examines the  response of long-run expectations to a decline in core inflation  The figure suggests  that, over the past 25 years, persistent deviations of core inflation from the Fed’s  inflation goal have engendered significant movements in long-run expectations  This                   December 15–16, 2009 154 of 247  exhibit highlights the risk that, in the wake of declines in core inflation over the past  year, long-run expectations could also decline  Together with persistently large  output gaps and cost pressures, declining long-run expectations could imply sizable  declines in inflation Of course, the risk could play out in the opposite direction if  expectations moved persistently higher   Another candidate for spurring such an expectations dynamic is the potential link  between inflation expectations and the expected path of federal deficits  The New  York Fed conducted a set of surveys to elicit perceptions among consumers and  financial experts about the association between future changes in government debt  and inflation Survey responses shown in exhibit 13a indicate that a majority of  consumers perceive unexpected increases in government debt to be inflationary,  irrespective of whether unexpectedly high debt is due to a shortfall in tax revenues or  higher-than-expected government spending In a follow-up survey, the scenarios  described in the exhibit were expanded by adding specific hypothetical causes for the  increase in government spending and shortfall in tax revenues  These additions had  no effect on the response patterns Moreover, they are robust across education,  income, and financial literacy categories of consumers    In contrast to consumers, financial experts view the scenario in which higher­ than-expected debt is due to a shortfall in tax revenues—where a recession is the  leading cause for such a scenario—as not inflationary, with 6 out of 11 financial  experts associating such conditions with a decline in inflation  However, 10 out of  11 financial experts perceive the scenario in which there is higher-than-expected  government spending to be inflationary   Having discussed some ways in which expectations could become unanchored,  we now attempt to quantify how unanchored expectations might affect our outlook  for inflation Exhibit 14 displays a simulation of the model we discussed earlier in  exhibit 7, except in this case the public mistakenly believes the central bank’s  inflation goal has risen to 3 percent The upward pressure that this places on  inflation, the black line, is noticeable—inflation does not decline as deeply as in the  simulation with anchored expectations  The funds rate, the black dashed line, is  pinned at the zero lower bound for a shorter time  But the Fed’s actions and the  course of inflation gradually persuade the public, in this model, at least, that the Fed’s  goal is not 3 percent, so the economy returns to its desired state of full employment  with price stability Even with unanchored expectations as characterized in this  exercise, very low costs and sizable slack at the onset of the simulation still imply a  protracted period of low inflation   All of the Phillips curve models, structural or reduced-form, old-fashioned or  new-fashioned, hinge on the influence of an activity or cost variable  Without the  influence of such a variable, these relationships are vacuous and inflation can be  indeterminate—there is no channel for monetary policy to control inflation, and, as  suggested in exhibit 3, the relevant expectations have nothing to anchor them   Exhibits 15 and 16 examine the issue of whether activity gaps have been reliable                              December 15–16, 2009 155 of 247  inflation predictors Much ink has been spilled over this issue, so we are unlikely to   provide a definitive answer there  But our empirical work corroborates the   commonsense findings of Jim Stock and Mark Watson, and that is that gaps matter   when they’re large, but less noticeably when they are small    The figure in exhibit 16 summarizes the evidence simply, although it takes a   second to orient yourself to it  Using historical data from 1961 to 2009, the figure   compares the absolute value of unemployment gaps on the vertical axis to the   difference between forecast errors from a Phillips curve and a naive statistical model   of inflation that does not include the activity gap  The reduction in forecast error   provided by incorporating an unemployment gap measure is insignificant when the   unemployment gap is near zero, toward the bottom of the chart  But, as the   magnitude of the gap increases, the forecast error made by the gap-augmented model   falls relative to the error from the naive model, as indicated by the prevalence of blue   diamonds to the left of the vertical axis in the upper half of the chart  This finding is   consistent with the small estimated coefficients on output gaps in Phillips curves for   the 1990s and early 2000s and explains the finding in some prior research that during   those relatively calm times, the naive model predicts inflation about as well as, or   better than, a gap-dependent forecasting model This is less likely to be the case in   current circumstances    What does this empirical finding imply for the current inflation forecast?  Your  next exhibit, number 17, shows that a model that incorporates this nonlinearity  explains the past several years’ inflation data quite well However, the surge in  unemployment over the past year implies a significant decline in inflation to near zero  over the next year or so Thus, the next several quarters will provide an important test  of this model   Finally, we would be remiss if we altogether ignored money in a discussion of   inflation dynamics Your final exhibit, which is courtesy of the Minneapolis Fed,   displays the correlations between money growth and inflation at progressively longer   horizons from left to right While these correlations do not show causality, many   would agree that, over long periods of time, high growth in money is likely to be   accompanied by high inflation  Because such correlations are essentially   contemporaneous, they also do not imply that money can be used to predict future   inflation As the exhibit suggests, Milton Friedman may now rest in peace    That concludes our prepared remarks  We’d be happy to take questions   Thanks for your question, Eric  I would take on board some of   Michael’s and coauthors’ caveats about the use of statistical gaps  I think my approach would be   somewhat similar to what the Chairman was saying in response to another question—we   wouldn’t take a univariate approach in gauging the state of the economy  We’d look to see   what’s going on with unemployment, and I’d say it’s clearly elevated, and I don’t see evidence in   traditional measures of reallocation to suggest that anything extraordinary is going on there    Therefore, I would take on board that a good portion, maybe the majority, of the increase in   unemployment is really reflective of slack resources  When I couple that with the observations           December 15–16, 2009 182 of 247  on marginal cost, which are severely depressed, I think I have several measures that all are   telling me roughly the same story  So in that regard, at least from the point of view that the gap   or utilization is a driving variable, I would expect some downward pressure on inflation   Now, as we suggested in the discussion around the table, inflation expectations might   counterbalance that, but I would emphasize in that regard, at two levels, that what I said in my   presentation is that the implication of the models is that the inflation expectation really implies a   concern for future marginal cost and gaps, not just inflation expectations per se  That’s at the   pointy-headed rational expectations level  But let’s take a step back and think, along the lines   that President Narayana Kocherlakota was saying, about the importance of the microdata—     I’ll get the middle name next time  [Laughter] The goal keeps   increasing   At the micro level, let’s think about the story that motivates these kinds of models that we   use, which at its base is not unreasonable, and that is that there are firms who are trying to set   prices What do they consider in trying to set prices?  They think about their cost structure    That’s where the marginal cost comes from  I would say that today the cost structure really is   challenged Wages are pressured to be quite low, and productivity appears to be fairly high  So   from the cost side, that puts downward pressure  The other thing that they take into account is   how much they can mark up over those costs  That’s a factor of market power and current   demand circumstances  And I would say, there again, the ability to mark up over their cost   structure is not terrific So you don’t need the pointy-headed rational expectations model to tell   you that the key determinants that fold into these models would suggest that, in current     December 15–16, 2009 183 of 247  circumstances, the pressures on inflation, taking into account expectations and costs and gaps or   whatever else, appear to be on the downside  That’s the way I would answer that question   Now, I did say, as President Plosser emphasized, that we need to have some humility   when we approach this And I think that to date we are starting to see perhaps the beginning of a   puzzle that says, as Mike Dotsey suggested, that inflation maybe should have fallen more than   these models have suggested  And I think we’ll be looking at that carefully, because if it doesn’t   fall noticeably over the next year, we have some ‘splaining to do  [Laughter] And that will   require some additional thought  So thank you for the question, and that’s what I would say  "
