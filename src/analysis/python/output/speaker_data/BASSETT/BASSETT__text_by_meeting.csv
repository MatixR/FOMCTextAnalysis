8580,2008-10-28,BASSETT,"2  Thank you, Nathan  I will be referring to the exhibits labeled   in red, “Staff Presentation on Financial Developments”  The intermeeting period was  characterized by persistent strains in financial markets and a sharp drop in asset  prices Although some markets have improved in recent days, the ongoing disruptions  have generated intense pressures on financial institutions and have contributed to a  significant further tightening of credit conditions for households and businesses  As  Bill Dudley noted, spreads on credit default swaps (CDS) for financial institutions  have been quite volatile  As shown by the top left panel of your first exhibit, median  spreads for large bank holding companies (the black line) and regional commercial  banks (the red line) declined substantially after the announcement of the Treasury’s  capital purchase program and the FDIC’s temporary liquidity guarantee program on  October 14; they ended the period almost 70 basis points lower, on balance  The  median CDS spread for insurance companies (the blue line) increased substantially  over the latter part of the intermeeting period amid concerns about the financial  condition of these firms  Judging from the wide range of dealers’ price quotes on  CDS for the same firms (shown in the top right panel), liquidity and price discovery  in the CDS market remain strained       The functioning of markets for corporate debt is also impaired  As shown by the   blue line in the middle left panel, the staff’s proxy for the bid-asked spread on high- yield bonds spiked to more than 4 percent before partially reversing course over the  past week  This spread is also unusually elevated for investment-grade bonds (the  black line)  As shown to the right, the average bid-asked spread on syndicated loans  traded in the secondary market (the black line) jumped up over the intermeeting  period  Secondary market prices for syndicated loans (the blue line) dropped to  unprecedented levels, reportedly reflecting heavy sales by hedge funds that were  forced to meet investor redemptions as well as the unwinding of some types of  structured investments      Municipal finance, the subject of the bottom two panels, was significantly   disrupted by dislocations in money market mutual funds in September and record                                                    2 The materials used by Mr Bassett are appended to this transcript (appendix 2)   October 28–29, 2008 12 of 206    withdrawals from long-term municipal bond funds in early October  Markets for  structured products, such as tender-option bonds, that issued short-term variable-rate  debt backed by longer-term municipal bonds were particularly affected  Yields on  those short-term instruments (shown by the black line in the bottom left panel)  jumped for a time, and the sales of the underlying long-term bonds as the structures  unwound boosted long-term municipal bond yields (the blue line)  As shown to the  right, issuance slowed substantially until mid-October, when a few states—notably  California—placed a sizable amount of new debt, though they paid fairly elevated  interest rates to do so  In recent days, however, liquidity conditions have shown signs  of improvement, yields have decreased somewhat, and issuance has moved back up  from the extremely slow pace seen in the second half of September and the first half  of this month        Please turn to exhibit 2  As noted by Bill Dudley, prime money market funds   suffered a wave of redemptions in mid-September, shown by the red bars in the top  left panel  Although the flows diminished after the Federal Reserve and the Treasury  announced steps to support money funds on September 19, prime funds lost about  one-fifth of their assets, on net, over the intermeeting period  As a result, prime funds  have dramatically reduced their holdings of commercial paper, generating significant  disruptions in that market  As shown by the black line in the top right panel,  unsecured financial commercial paper outstanding has declined sharply since mid- September, and the ongoing contraction in ABCP (the blue line) has continued  In  contrast, the amount of unsecured commercial paper placed by nonfinancial firms (the  yellow line) was little changed, on net, over the period  As shown in the middle left  panel, broad equity prices (the black line) dropped about 30 percent over the  intermeeting period as the outlook for both economic growth and earnings dimmed,  and implied volatility increased to record levels  As depicted by the red bars to the  right, those developments were accompanied by record outflows of about $60 billion  from equity mutual funds in September  Weekly data indicate that, over the first half  of October, investors withdrew more than $100 billion from long-term mutual funds,  including about $70 billion from equity funds, but outflows have slowed in recent  days     As shown in line 1 in the bottom left panel, M2 expanded rapidly in September   and early October as some firms and households shifted toward safer assets  Liquid  deposits (line 2) increased significantly in September and stayed about flat in  October  In contrast, retail money funds (line 3) were little changed in September but  have grown briskly this month  The sizable increases in small time deposits in both  months (line 4) were widespread, in contrast to the more concentrated gains seen over  the summer in response to elevated yields at a few financial institutions  Currency  (line 5) began increasing rapidly in recent weeks, apparently supported by higher  demand from both foreign and domestic holders     As a result of the disruptions in short-term funding markets, a range of borrowers   turned to banks for funding  The “other loans” category (the blue line in the bottom  right panel) rose sharply beginning in mid-September as a result of both unplanned   October 28–29, 2008 13 of 206    overdrafts and draws on existing credit lines by nonfinancial businesses, money  market mutual fund complexes, foreign banks, nonbank financial institutions, and  municipalities  C&I loans at banks (the black line) have also increased significantly  in recent weeks, as a broad spectrum of nonfinancial firms tapped existing credit  lines  According to the October Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey, however, about  25 percent of the largest banks and 35 percent of other banks surveyed indicated that  C&I loans not made under previous commitment accounted for some of the recent  increase       Additional results from the survey are the subject of your next exhibit  Large net   fractions of institutions reported having continued to tighten their lending standards  and terms on all major loan categories over the previous three months, with some  banks reporting that they had tightened lending policies considerably  As shown by  the black line in the top left panel, about 80 percent of domestic respondents  tightened their lending standards on C&I loans since July, and all but one of the 54  banks surveyed reported charging higher spreads over their cost of funds on such  loans (the red line)  As noted to the right, nearly all the banks that tightened  standards or terms did so in response to a more uncertain or less favorable economic  outlook and a reduced tolerance for risk  Almost 40 percent of domestic banks  tightened in part because of concerns about their capital or liquidity position,  somewhat more than had cited those pressures in July  As indicated in the middle left  panel, a large fraction of domestic banks again reported tightening standards on  commercial real estate loans over the past three months     Moving to loans to households, almost 70 percent of respondents tightened   standards on residential mortgages to prime borrowers (the red line in the middle  right panel)  As shown by the blue line, nearly 90 percent of the institutions that  originated nontraditional mortgages tightened standards on such loans  As shown by  the short black line in the bottom left panel, about 75 percent of the respondents  tightened lending standards on home equity lines of credit, and about 60 percent  tightened standards on both credit cards (the blue line) and other consumer loans (the  red line)  As noted to the right, almost 25 percent of banks, on net, reported reducing  the credit limits on existing credit card accounts of some prime customers over the  past three months, and about 60 percent of banks reported cutting existing lines of  some of their nonprime borrowers  Banks that had trimmed the limits on existing  credit card accounts most often cited the more uncertain economic outlook as a very  important reason followed, in turn, by a reduced tolerance for risk and deterioration in  the credit quality of individual customers     Business finance is the subject of your next exhibit  The spread on BBB-rated   bonds issued by nonfinancial corporations (the blue line in the top left panel) rose  about 275 basis points over the intermeeting period, to more than 600 basis points,  whereas that on bonds of financial firms (the black line) reached nearly 1,000 basis  points before easing some in recent days  As spreads spiked and volatility increased,  bond issuance by both nonfinancial and financial corporations (shown in the table to  the right) dropped appreciably in the third quarter (row 3) relative to the pace seen in   October 28–29, 2008 14 of 206    the first half of the year (row 2)  As shown in the last row, there has been no high- yield issuance by nonfinancial firms so far this month, and bond issuance by financial  firms has come to a near halt       In commercial mortgage markets, secondary market spreads on AAA-rated   commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS), shown in the middle left panel,  continued to increase on net, and no new CMBS have been issued for several months   As noted to the right, using announced earnings for about 200 firms and analysts’  estimates for the rest, the staff expects third-quarter S&P 500 earnings to come in  about 10 percent below the level posted in the third quarter of last year  Losses at  financial companies account for the drop  Bank holding companies reported further  substantial write-downs on mortgage-related and other securities as well as higher  loan-loss provisions necessitated by widespread deterioration in credit quality  In  contrast, earnings of nonfinancial companies are projected to have risen about  12 percent from a year earlier, but increased profits of energy companies account for  virtually all of those gains  As indicated in the bottom left panel, analysts have  revised down significantly their expectations for earnings of nonfinancial firms (the  red line) over the next year, likely in response to the worsening economic outlook   Expected earnings for financial firms (the black line) also have been cut further this  month  A rough estimate of the equity premium (shown in the bottom right panel)  stands at an extremely high level       The household sector is the subject of your last exhibit  As shown by the top left   panel, interest rates on conforming residential mortgages have been volatile—partly  in response to the renewed pressures on GSE debt noted by Bill Dudley—but ended  the period only slightly higher at around 6 percent  The staff expects home prices  (the black line to the right) to decline significantly further through the end of 2010  and mortgage debt (the red line) to be about flat over that period  Both paths have  been marked down from the September forecast to reflect a weaker economic outlook  and tighter credit conditions  Spreads on asset-backed securities backed by credit  card loans (the black line in the middle left panel) and auto loans (the red line) have  risen more than 150 basis points since mid-September, moving well above their  spring peaks  The cumulative increase in spreads since midyear has hindered  issuance of such securities, and the volume of new deals, shown to the right, dropped  more than 50 percent in the third quarter  The latest data, available through  October 17, suggest that very little issuance has occurred this month  As shown in  the bottom left panel, consumer credit has decelerated recently  With lending  conditions likely to remain tight and with spending on durables expected to be soft,  the staff sees significant further weakness in consumer credit in coming quarters     Summing up, although there has been modest improvement in several financial   markets recently, the worsening of the global financial crisis sharply increased  pressures on financial firms and markets over the intermeeting period as a whole   Those pressures have led to further deleveraging, diminished liquidity, increased  concerns among investors about the economic outlook, and a reduced tolerance for  risk-taking  The resulting sharp fall in asset prices and the further tightening of credit   October 28–29, 2008 15 of 206    conditions have had substantial adverse effects on nonfinancial businesses and  households  That concludes my prepared remarks    "
