 Thank you, Mr Chairman   Nothing that has not already been said, Mr Chairman Thank you   Thank you, Mr Chairman Real GDP growth through the first three  quarters is above most estimates of potential growth Fourth-quarter estimates and forecasts are  sharply higher than they were earlier in the year Personal spending and credit growth are  expected to end the year on a high note The broad monetary aggregates, M2 and M3, are  growing at or above the announced target ranges On balance, it appears that the surprisingly  low rate of inflation in 1997 may give way to higher inflation in 1998 and beyond  Nevertheless, continued turmoil in the Asian markets argues for a steady policy prescription at  this meeting In my view, the FOMC continues to face the challenge of when and how to lock in  recent gains on inflation We would support "B" asymmetric    Thank you, Mr Chairman Economic conditions in the Eighth  District are consistent with full employment of the region's economic resources District  labor markets remain very tight, with measured unemployment rates showing no  indication of departing from their lowest levels in 20 years The diminished pool of  qualified labor continues to temper employment gains in the District relative to those seen  nationwide Labor inflows from other regions do not appear sufficient to meet the  demands of firms engaged in the current robust business expansion Despite these  caveats, reasonably strong employment gains persist in many manufacturing sectors and  to a lesser extent in construction, especially nonresidential building activity In some  areas, increased wage pressures are accompanying the tight labor markets A District    2/3-4/98  executive in the health care field suggested that further productivity gains in that industry  are unlikely in the near term  On balance, Asian market turmoil does not appear to be exerting a serious drag on  the District's economic activity Recent discussions with business contacts in the District  indicated that while some industries have seen appreciable disruptions, others have  benefited from lower costs that foreign-based suppliers can pass along Some agricultural  prices have declined sharply in response to the Asian situation On net, the effect on  economic activity in the District appears to have been minimal and absent a dramatic  deterioration of conditions in Asia, the effect should remain muted  Even in the face of diminishing labor pools and disrupted foreign markets, District  manufacturers remain optimistic for 1998 Orders appear to be holding firm, and so far  there have been no broad-based adverse inventory shifts Likewise, consumers appear to  have perked up recently Initial District reports suggested that retail sales increased  between 2 and 3 percent on average during the 1997 holiday season over a year earlier,  but those increases may be somewhat understated in view of post-holiday sales strength  As long as income and employment gains remain solid, there is little reason to question  the forecasts of retailers who are expecting moderate to strong sales during the current  quarter  I will not repeat the indicators relating to the nation's economy that have been  mentioned, but the national economy in our view is entering 1998 with substantial  momentum The economy appears very robust and shows few signs of slowing As a  result, the Eighth District forecast is on the high end of the range of the members'  forecasts for nominal and real GDP growth and on the low end of the range for the    2/3-4/98 78  unemployment rate Considering the environment in which recent inflation gains have  been achieved, we may be testing the bottom on inflation, with most of the future risk  remaining on the upside   We support alternative I for now and eventually moving to  alternative III as Governor Meyer suggested   I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman
