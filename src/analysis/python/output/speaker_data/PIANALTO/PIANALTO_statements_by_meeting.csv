4196,2000-11-15,"   Thank you, Mr Chairman  With one exception regional economic   conditions in the Fourth District have changed little since our Beigebook report  Growth rates in   several industries, particularly manufacturing, appear to be moderating toward growth rates that   are more typical of the average growth rates we have been seeing throughout this expansion    The one exception to our Beigebook report is retail sales, where the outlook has become notably   more bearish  Retail sales figures for early November have been disappointing  Retailers tell us   that sales of menswear are a leading indicator for retail sales in general, and they are concerned   that a recent weak selling pace in this category foreshadows a softening in consumer demand   during the critical upcoming holiday season   Now, according to the Beigebook national summary, economic activity in the Fourth   District is slowing a bit faster than in the nation as a whole  And there is little doubt that some   firms in our District are doing poorly  However, the reasons for the poor performance seem to   be more peculiar to the industry and the firm rather than an economy-wide business slowing    For example, the heavy truck manufacturing industry has experienced a reduction in output of 40               54      percent from last year's record high levels  But it is not a lessening in demand for trucking   services that has caused the drop; in fact, truck freight tonnage has grown to an all-time high    Rather, conditions peculiar to the truck manufacturing industry are responsible for the slowdown    First of all, the oil price shock has hit the trucking firms’ capital spending budgets especially   hard  Second, trucking companies are having a more difficult time getting loans  In fact, our   contact at banks singled out loans to trucking firms as their most dangerous ones because of past   fixed price contracts that were made before diesel prices skyrocketed  Finally, because   anticipated trade-in values have dropped, it's harder for truckers to justify buying new trucks  So   while truck production has declined substantially, truck shipping has not     As a District that’s characterized by a larger concentration of manufacturing activity   than the nation as a whole, we tend to hear from that group somewhat disproportionately  And   manufacturers continue to tell us that they cannot raise their prices no matter how hard they try--  and you've heard that from several others this morning--and they are becoming increasingly   concerned about the competitive environment  In fact, they cite the very same intensifying cost   pressures that the Greenbook notes higher energy prices, higher health care costs, and higher   labor costs because of the tight labor market, especially for skilled labor   The steel industry provides a very powerful example of what is going on  Inventories   in steel are quite high and the industry is characterized by excess capacity around the world    Steel imports have been flooding into the United States  Conditions have become so bad for the   integrated producers that plant shutdowns and/or layoffs within a year are likely and a couple of   our directors point out that outright bankruptcies are not out of the question if conditions don't   change  Competition has prevented prices of manufacturers from rising even in a situation               55      where prices of raw materials are increasing  Chemical firms, for example, report that even   though higher oil prices have greatly increased their costs, they’ve been unable to raise their   selling prices   Now, I take the reports from manufacturers seriously, but I also want to put them in   perspective  On an ex food and energy basis, goods prices as measured by the CPI have been   increasing at an annual rate of only 1/2 percent in each of the past three years  So it's no surprise   that manufacturers do not see inflation lurking around the corner  Yet the overall core CPI   continues to accelerate  The culprit is the services sector, which may be less susceptible to   import competition, less prone to productivity increases and, of course, has a larger component   of labor inputs than the goods-producing industries   This brings me to the national situation  The Greenbook says that the economy is   essentially in balance--in the sense that the level of economic activity is roughly in line with that   of potential  And I think the Greenbook does a good job of expressing the caution that has crept   into the minds of businesspeople  But I am also mindful of the economy's extraordinary ability   to grow faster than the Greenbook expects  In the baseline projection, to the extent that any   policy adjustment is thought prudent, only a 50 basis point increase in the fed funds rate in the   next two years is called for  Given all the uncertainties surrounding forecasts and policy   prescriptions, we could almost regard that as no change in policy at all  I say “almost” because   the staff still maintains in its baseline projection that the economy is at risk for more inflation   rather than less over the forecast horizon    I share that concern, but perhaps for some reasons that are different from those   underlying the Greenbook projection  I'm concerned that we will confuse people about our               56      definition of price stability and our willingness to pursue it  This year will mark the fifth   consecutive year that the core PCE will have increased at a rate of less than 2 percent  Last   year's rate was 1-1/2 percent and that result led many people to say that we had achieved price   stability  But core inflation measures will be up this year from last year and if the Greenbook is   correct, we'll see them creep up further in each of the next two years  A statistical test that we   have run on the median CPI, a core measure that we developed at our Bank, indicates that the   inflation trend has not changed at all during the expansion  Similar analyses that we’ve run on   the core PCE lead us to the same conclusion  Once we’ve added in the Greenbook projection for   PCE, there will have been no improvement in the inflation trend during the entire expansion   period  So, I find it difficult to contemplate looking at a projection for core PCE that entails   reverting to the inflation levels that we had in 1994 and 1995 without at least expressing some   concern that the balance of risks is toward more inflation than is really acceptable  Thank you,   Mr Chairman  "
4197,2000-11-15,"  I also agree with your recommendation  Like others, I was   prepared to make a longer statement in case the recommendation was to change the tilt    And my reason for that is that I am concerned about our objective of achieving price   stability  But like others, I will also spare you from the statement  "
4889,2003-03-18,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Economic conditions in the Fourth   District appear to be broadly consistent with those in the rest of the nation  Two sentences in the   Beige Book national summary describe our situation very well—namely that growth in economic   activity remained subdued in January and February and that geopolitical and economic   uncertainties are constraining business and consumer spending and tempering near-term   expectations  I think the staff did an excellent job in reporting, analyzing, and synthesizing the   data that have come in since our last meeting  The staff concluded that the economy is likely to   be weaker in the near term, yet real GDP growth and inflation next year are expected to be about   the same as was forecast at our last meeting, indicating the largely transient nature of the   additional softness  I generally agree with that forecast, although how I arrive at the GDP figures   is slightly different    I’d like to focus my comments this morning on some of this near-term weakness and its   potential implications  First, the March 7 release of the February labor market data does seem to   have powerfully affected market sentiment about the economy  All of us are aware that last   month’s weather distorted economic activity, and our Beige Book contacts across a wide range   of retail sectors reported that the winter storms did affect their sales  Even if we knew how to   account for the weather, we probably still would conclude that labor markets weakened in   February  But it’s hard to know how much of that report is idiosyncratic, as can often happen   with one month’s data     One of my directors, whose firm supplies materials nationally to the homebuilding   market, reported that she saw a significant decrease in orders in February  But as rapidly as   orders had declined in February, they bounced back in early March  Overall I don’t get a sense   from our directors or advisory council members and other contacts in the District that conditions   March 18, 2003 59 of 101    have changed fundamentally in the past few months  But, like President Santomero, I detect a   significantly more negative tone in their comments    The economy is still expanding, and it is expected to do so, albeit at a very moderate   pace  Housing has continued to be strong, and the bankers in my District say that it’s going to   continue to be strong  Business investment is weak, and it is expected to remain weak according   to business people in my District  I’ve had many conversations with contacts throughout the   District about how credit availability, the geopolitical risks, and capacity utilization are affecting   the pace of their capital spending  Bankers report that they are very liquid and anxious to lend    In fact, they note in a more short-term perspective that they finally have started to receive   inquiries from their business customers  Customers have increased their credit lines but are not   using those lines, which tells me at least that they’re gearing up for some use of them down the   road but not until the Iraq situation is resolved  Within the last week alone, two of my business   contacts informed me that their firms had turned away sizable orders because to fill those orders   they would have to add to capacity and, with the uncertainty that we face, they weren’t willing to   do that  In ordinary times, those investments would have been made   So, as I commented at the last meeting, I still am concerned about the outlook for a   snapback in BFI given the current low levels of capacity utilization  Our research department   did some statistical work to examine the relationship between capacity utilization and business   fixed investment  We found that both the level and the change in capacity utilization strongly   lead business investment, again suggesting that we shouldn’t expect a pickup in BFI until some   of the excess capacity gets absorbed  From our Beige Book contacts we hear a consistent story,   namely that they are not willing to add to their capacity  Many of them still have a lot of idle   capacity and aren’t planning any additional capital spending even to bring that idle capacity back   March 18, 2003 60 of 101    on line  This does not mean that we won’t see any spending on plant and equipment or software   but rather that the upward trajectory is not going to be as steep as we’d like to see  Interestingly,   I think the caution about capital spending fits into the Greenbook projection of strong   productivity growth  I say that because the CEOs I talk to are telling me that, even though they   are paying very close attention to payrolls and to capital spending—they’re not hiring and   they’re not spending—they are still innovating  These efforts show up in the healthy rate of   multifactor productivity growth as we see in the Greenbook   In summary, I am discouraged by the lack of progress in the expansion thus far, but I   believe that some of it is clearly due to the unsettled risks of war and terrorism  Obviously, the   potential for war is a very dark cloud overhead—and not that far overhead perhaps  Although   this cloud is restraining economic activity now, I do believe that its successful dissolution will   result in a continued economic expansion  So as the Vice Chair and others have indicated today,   this is a time for the central bank to be patient, to watch developments unfold, and especially to   see how the economy looks once this dark cloud of uncertainty dissipates  Thank you, Mr   Chairman  "
4890,2003-03-18,"  I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman  "
4937,2003-05-06,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  My comments about economic conditions   in the Fourth District are not too different from those that my colleagues have already reported   about their Districts  Moreover, conditions in our region haven’t changed very much since my   last several reports  The Fourth District’s economy is poised to expand at a faster pace in the   second half of this year, but reasonable doubts still exist about the timing and the extent of that   expansion  District business leaders and bankers I’ve talked to are still expressing caution if not   outright skepticism about the environment  The bankers continue to enjoy fee income from   mortgage refinancings, but they know they can’t rely on that product line to sustain their   business indefinitely  They look forward to expanding their commercial and industrial loans, but   their most creditworthy customers have yet to see any need to draw down their credit lines    Business firms still seem to place a premium on staying liquid  For example, several members of   May 6, 2003 49 of 115    our Business Advisory Council indicated that their customers are extending the period over   which they are making payments  Some of them are extending it by thirty to sixty days, not   because they don’t have the cash to pay but because they want to conserve their cash and stay   more liquid   Another condition that hasn’t changed in several months, as many others have already   noted, is the aversion to business investment  I continue to question business people closely   about their capital spending plans, and I’ve yet to find any concrete evidence pointing to a   firming of spending plans later this year  There is just too much excess capacity in too many   firms  Also, in line with what President Poole reported earlier, several manufacturers have told   me that there’s a glut of used capital equipment on the market and, because of the glut, prices are   quite low  Some firms with very strong balance sheets are buying this equipment and   warehousing it until demand picks up, reasoning that in the worst-case scenario they can just sell   it again  However, most firms I’ve talked to don’t want to buy any capital equipment even at   these low prices The equipment they already own has lost significant market value, weakening   their balance sheets  Lenders, consequently, are less willing to advance credit to these firms    Business conditions haven’t deteriorated—just the balance sheets   Many manufacturers in the District also have become increasingly more pessimistic   about their ability in the longer term to compete against firms that have located production   facilities outside the United States, especially in areas like China, where labor costs are quite   low  Some of these manufacturers are recalling the shakeout that occurred in the 1980s after a   long period of dollar appreciation  In today’s environment, manufacturers are still cutting their   prices but are facing higher input costs for both raw materials and labor benefits  They fear that   May 6, 2003 50 of 115    we’re in another ratcheting down of industrial activity in this country—a structural adjustment   that they say began in late 2000 and could persist for several more years     Turning to the national economic outlook, if I generalize what I’m hearing from my   District contacts—many of whom have operations nationally and internationally—one inference   that I can draw is that business fixed investment may be weaker than in the Greenbook path, at   least for the next year or two  It could be that the negative tone I’m hearing from these business   people is contemporaneous and not predictive of their future investment plans  If that’s the case   and the negative tone simply reflects the current cautious environment, then when economic   activity picks up we may indeed see the stronger business fixed investment portrayed in the   Greenbook  However, if the negative tone is more foretelling of problematic fundamentals, then   perhaps it reflects a reduced expected return to new investment  So it may be telling us that the   equilibrium real rate of capital has moved down somewhat and will remain lower for a longer   period of time than we thought  I expect we’ll talk more about that during the policy discussion    Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
4938,2003-05-06,"  I am supportive of the policy recommendation, and I support the   unbundling of the two risks  I’m also pleased that the statement acknowledges our concern about   deflation by indicating that a substantial fall in inflation would be unwelcome  However, I share   some of the views expressed by others about the “taken together” sentence, which rebundles the   risks  I am concerned that it will cause the markets to focus just on the fact that we’ve changed   our balance of risks toward weakness  My preference is not to have that sentence in the   statement  However, I can support the statement as it’s written  And I, too, look forward to the   development of a communication method that we all feel comfortable calling a swan    "
4992,2003-08-12,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Reports from the Fourth District are   consistent with the story of the US economy  slow, steady growth and slowly improving   August 12, 2003 35 of 110    conditions, coupled with mixed economic signals and still a great deal of lingering anxiety  The   one bright spot in the Fourth District’s economic scene is Lebron James  He’s the high-school   basketball phenomenon who was the number one draft pick in the NBA  The Cleveland   Cavaliers drafted him and have sold a lot of season tickets as a result  And this young man   hasn’t played a game for them yet  The reason I’m bringing this up is that Lebron and I attended   the same high school  [Laughter]  Clearly, the more recent Akron St Vincent graduate is having   a greater impact on the Cleveland economy than the one who graduated many years ago!     The driving force behind the lingering anxiety in the Fourth District is China  I haven’t   been able to have a single conversation with a member of the business community recently   without that conversation slipping into a discussion about China and its rapid growth as a US   trading partner  I have to say, though, that the business people I talk to don’t speak about China   as a business partner but rather as a source of intense competition  Last year the United States   imported as much from China as from Japan, although we exported far less to China than to   Japan  Many of the manufacturers are complaining that it is difficult to export to China because   of trade impediments and because China unfairly pegs its currency to the US dollar     I interpret the preoccupation with China that I’m encountering in the business community   as a proxy for the expansion of the global trading order, of which China is but a part  That   expansion in global trade and the international linkages are clearly affecting the decisions that   business people in our District are making  Some of them are reconfiguring their supply chains   to source goods from companies abroad  Others are locating their production facilities in foreign   countries  For many manufacturing companies in our area, all that’s left in the District are   assembly and testing  The prices of items produced in China and elsewhere are clearly affecting   our firms’ pricing strategies  The economic emergence of China and other developing countries   August 12, 2003 36 of 110    appears to be forcing adjustments in the capital and labor markets in many nations, not just ours,   and this process is going to take many, many years to play out   I suspect that today US capital spending, production, and employment are weaker than   otherwise would be the case and that relative prices of manufactured goods are also lower as a   result of this phenomenon  Business persons I speak to have indicated that making capital   expenditure decisions in this environment has been very complex  For some manufacturing   companies, the productive capacity located in the United States may no longer have the same   economic value as it once did  And we’re seeing an increase in corporate mergers, acquisitions,   and restructuring that are all part of this process   Intense foreign competition is probably also an element in understanding why the higher   disposable incomes that we see and the monetary accommodation that exists have not yet totally   been translated into greater domestic production and employment  My business contacts are   telling me that there is business out there; they’re just not getting it  These stories appear to have   been confirmed, as was mentioned earlier, by the excess of final sales over gross domestic   product now evident in the second-quarter numbers  If this anxiety that I’m hearing about from   our District manufacturers is pervasive throughout the country, it may be that the pickup in   business fixed investment will not materialize as quickly as forecast in the Greenbook  Thank   you, Mr Chairman  "
4993,2003-08-12,"  Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation on the fed funds rate   and on the balance of risks statement  "
5022,2003-09-15,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  After the last two meetings and even after   reading the transcripts of the last two meetings, when we spent a lot of time talking about the   need to improve our communications, I expected to be supporting major changes in the way we   communicate  But after getting the material from Vincent and also reading Dave Lindsey’s   paper, I found myself in the camp of wanting to make only some minor changes to what we’re   doing currently  I believe that we should have a statement that announces our action and gives   the reasons for the action  I think we should continue to have language on the balance of risks,   with some improvements such as those that have been recommended by Presidents Stern and   Moskow  I noted in reading the minutes of our August meeting that the language about our   action was clearer than that in the statement, which brought to mind the comment by Governor   Bies that maybe we could be clearer in our language  The wording in the minutes still had the   risk information in it, but the statement was just a little clearer to me  So I think the suggestions   that have been made about providing some draft language in advance in the Bluebook and then   tying that language to our press release will help to make our statements clearer   I also agree with several of my colleagues, however, that we should stop short of hinting   at future policy and refrain from either deliberately or inadvertently signaling to the markets   what our next move is likely to be  So I would want us to stop short of trying to manage   expectations about our future policy actions     Finally, in regard to the minutes, I came in here thinking that it was a good idea to release   the minutes earlier  But after listening to the comments tonight, especially the concern that we   September 15, 2003 68 of 78    could not readily reverse that decision and return to our current practice, I think the issue   requires a little more thought before we make such a move  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
5070,2003-09-16,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  As we’ve been discussing this morning,   the staff projection contemplates a very good business environment for the next couple of years    Aggregate demand and real GDP are expected to expand very rapidly, and an amazing 7 million   net new jobs are created  The business fixed investment climate improves considerably, and by   the end of 2005 the economy is producing near its potential output level and expanding at about   the same rate as potential  And, of course, inflation is even lower than it is today  I think most   people would be pleased to see that projection become actual experience  I know I would    However, I’ve been confronted almost daily during this intermeeting period with a   dichotomy between the economy described in the Greenbook and the economy as it is   characterized in the reports of the business people I talk with in the Fourth District  I’ve been   hearing a rather consistent story during this period from CEOs—many of whom are heads of   companies that operate internationally—across a wide spectrum of manufacturing and service   industries  Their story goes something like this  We invested heavily in equipment and software   September 16, 2003 57 of 106    during the latter half of the 1990s, and it has taken us a while to figure out how to use all of this   in a productive manner  We’ve learned that, in addition to putting in the new technologies, we   have to develop different business practices and retrain our employees—which is similar to a   comment Dave Stockton made this morning  We found out that in the late ’90s we expanded our   capacity too rapidly, and therefore we’re planning to expand more slowly this time around  At   the moment we find that we can generate additional output from our current payroll and capital   stock more readily than we thought we could  We need to take steps to avoid increasing costs,   and we don’t have to add to capital as much as we thought   Allowing for some occasional variation, that’s the story I hear  So I conclude from my   business contacts that they remain guarded in their willingness to take on new employees and to   invest domestically  Their concern doesn’t appear to be a lack of demand for their products but   rather how much risk they’re willing to take on to meet that demand  The lack of hiring, as   we’ve been talking about this morning, is amazingly widespread  Only about one-third of US   industries are adding to domestic payrolls today as compared with nearly two-thirds of our   industries at a comparable stage of the so-called jobless recovery of a decade ago     My business contacts are confirming that a great deal of industrial restructuring is   occurring, as President Guynn and First Vice President Stewart have noted  Many firms are   continuing to reevaluate the economic value of their current employment base and their fixed   investments as they develop their hiring and investment plans for the next year  Some of that   labor and capital may simply be less valuable to them now than they had previously thought to   be the case  Now, the usual process of reallocating physical capital is for the ownership to   change through a sale of the assets without a need to move the buildings or equipment  But the   International Steel Group, which just acquired assets from both LTV and Bethlehem Steel,   September 16, 2003 58 of 106    announced that it’s selling two of its quarter-mile-long strip rolling mills to a Chinese company   and will relocate those mills to China  One news account estimates that it’s going to take several   years to dismantle, ship, and reassemble these mills  It’s a transaction that provides a vivid   illustration of a different way to reallocate resources that is evolving in this global economy   As I said at the outset, I would welcome the Greenbook baseline projection  However,   it’s not the picture of the outlook that my business contacts are painting  They seem to be   harboring a fair amount of uncertainty about the environment in which they’re operating, as   many others have said is the case in their Districts  If the Greenbook projection proves to be   accurate, it’s going to be fascinating to watch the perceptions and actions of these business   people as they change their behavior to converge in the direction of the scenario in the   Greenbook  Thank you, Mr Chairman    "
5071,2003-09-16,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support your recommendation on the   federal funds rate target and your recommendation on retaining the balance of risks statement as   it is currently  As I said last night, though, I am uncomfortable about signaling our future policy   actions in our statement and, therefore, at the August meeting I was not in favor of the   considerable period of time sentence  But I also agree with your assessment that dropping it at   this meeting would confuse the markets  So I support the statement as written    "
5129,2003-10-28,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  The 2001 recession is now nearly two   years behind us, and I believe that most people in the Fourth District have accepted, perhaps   surprisingly, that the economy is expanding  Even our manufacturers are seeing evidence of   improvement in business activity  Our steel producers report that the worst may be over and that   prices are actually firming in some markets  Machine-tool makers report that they also are   seeing a pickup in orders from small and medium-size businesses as a result of the special   depreciation allowance for capital goods   Nevertheless, there is still a great deal of anxiety about the sustainability of the recent   upturn in business activity  I’m told by my business contacts that the expansion lacks balance    October 28, 2003 57 of 126    Bankers, for example, are having a profitable year, but they would prefer to have a larger portion   of commercial loans in their loan portfolios  Manufacturers in my District remain uneasy over   the pressures they face from global competition, and I doubt whether that pressure is going to   dissipate any time soon  As a member of my Small Business Advisory Council put it last week,   old line thinkers who looked through the business cycle expecting their order books to return to   normal are now exiting their businesses  There is no “normal” any more     Recessions and their immediate aftermath account for much of the trend decline in   manufacturers’ share of overall employment, and this cycle is no different  CEOs continue to   report that they are using this downturn to reassess their business strategies, to reexamine their   product lines, and to reexamine the location of their facilities  As they sort through these   options, companies continue to be cautious—or maybe I should say disciplined—about their   expansion plans, including their hiring plans  Their comments, though recently a bit more   optimistic, do not suggest an impending rebound in hiring on the order of magnitude of the   acceleration that the Greenbook forecasts in 2004  Productivity and profitability are figuring   prominently in everyone’s thinking about the business outlook  CEOs report that they can still   generate productivity increases by reorganizing their business processes and by implementing   new production technologies  For example, a metal stamper firm in our District reported   purchasing for only $120,000 a machine that cost $1 million three years ago, and that machine is   going to do the work of five people  So he expects to make a profit with this technology and is   focusing on increasing sales, but he’s not going to increase his workforce in the near future     It’s not entirely clear to me how to think about the current high rate of joblessness and   low rate of capacity utilization  Again, I wonder whether these resources are simply   underemployed or whether they have become obsolete  The story of the metal stamper is not   October 28, 2003 58 of 126    unique  Many manufacturers in my District tell me that resources, both capital and labor, have   lost their economic value during the past several years  Perhaps the lower economic value   placed on these resources represents a slowdown in potential output  Translating, therefore, what   I’ve heard from my District contacts into the Greenbook projections, I would end up with a   scenario close to what President Broaddus and some others talked about earlier this morning—  that is, somewhat slower employment growth and somewhat faster productivity growth over the   next several years  As David Stockton commented earlier, these two factors could still yield   roughly the same output and income path as in the Greenbook  But as noted by President   Broaddus and others, these two factors—slower employment growth with somewhat higher   productivity growth—could also lead to further disinflation  However, if it’s reasonable to think   that the economy has sustained a slowdown in the rate of growth of potential, then looking   forward, the disinflation implications could be less troublesome than in the Greenbook baseline    Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
5130,2003-10-28,"  I agree with your recommendation, Mr Chairman  "
5194,2003-12-09,"  I’m going to switch gears back to the inflation issue  In your   comments, Dave, you addressed some of the risks toward higher inflation  Of course, our   statement still says that the probability, though minor, of an unwelcome fall in inflation exceeds   that of a rise in inflation  In June you prepared and shared with us some probabilities of the   economy falling into deflation  I would like to know you have rerun those simulations and   whether they’ve changed very much or if that is just not a concern any longer     Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Conditions in the Fourth District have   improved notably since our last meeting, as was described in some detail in our latest Beige   Book report  Consumer spending and housing remained buoyant, and now a broader mix of   business persons are willing to express satisfaction with their profitability and their order books    Nevertheless, those I talk to remain cautious about their capital spending plans and are still   tentative about hiring plans  I get a lot of questions from business people in our District about   where this 82 percent growth is occurring because they just don’t see it  I suspect that the   Fourth District is going to be one of the laggards as this economywide expansion extends into the   next year     December 9, 2003 60 of 133    Although the media like to report on the manufacturing sector as if it’s some type of one-  dimensional animal, the performance in that sector has been quite mixed  Certainly there are   differences among companies due to the manufacturing sub-industry in which they operate since   some sub-industries are experiencing stronger demand than others  Defense-related industry is   the most obvious example  However, small firms that supply components to larger companies   are having an extraordinarily difficult time in the current environment  These small firms   typically buy raw materials in world markets, and they have no bargaining power over the prices   they pay  Their final customers can source components, even custommade parts on world   markets as well, and those customers are forcing the component suppliers to compete against one   another strictly on spot prices  The result is that the component suppliers are being squeezed   from both sides     An example of this in my District was related to me by a contact whose firm makes a   variety of small rubber parts  He sells those parts to larger companies that are producing   automobiles, computers, and consumer goods  One of his customers recently asked him to   reduce his price for a component from $115 to $40  If that price request could not be met, the   customer said he was going to have to take his business offshore  My contact couldn’t produce   the component at that price so he went offshore and found a producer who could  He then was   able to sell this part to his customer for $38 apiece, just slightly under the $40 price requested    The part costs my contact $09 plus $05 shipping, so he’s still making a profit  I find two   aspects of this story noteworthy  The first is that my contact, when asked to reduce his price,   thought the product could not be made at that price  But he found that it could be produced   offshore with technology that he didn’t even know existed  He was unaware of the technology   until he visited the shop floor and actually saw that technology being used  So it wasn’t labor   December 9, 2003 61 of 133    cost that was driving down the price but the technology being used offshore  The second aspect   that I find interesting is that many large US manufacturing companies are now depending on   inexpensive offshore sourcing to keep their own products competitive  So if there are   disruptions in the relations with emerging economies, that is going to help some US industries   but will hurt many others     Collectively these circumstances suggest to me that we are still in the process of adjusting   to the globalization in trade that is occurring and that the adjustment process is going to last for   some time  Again, I don’t think I will be surprised to learn that this adjustment process is   altering some of the economic relationships that we have used in the past as guideposts, such as   measures of capacity and its utilization  I think it’s clear that international trade and productivity   patterns have been instrumental in driving down prices of both goods and services, especially   manufactured consumer products  CPI goods prices are still falling and by enough arithmetically   to hold the overall core rate of inflation at a low level  In fact, as we’ve discussed extensively   this morning, inflation rates are somewhat lower than various estimates of expected inflation     As has been reported in the media lately, some Wall Street economists think that we’re   trying to communicate that we want the inflation rate to move up about 100 basis points from   where it is today  Others seem to think that our statements are designed simply to communicate   something about the amount of slack that we see remaining in the economy through the next   year  This confusion leads me to want to be a bit cautious about changing our communications   significantly at this meeting  It reinforces to me, though, that we need to be clear about our   intentions and I am looking forward to our discussions next month, which I hope will help us   communicate more effectively to the public in that regard  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
5195,2003-12-09,"  I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman  Brian indicated in his   remarks that one rationale for dropping the “considerable period” language is that one is opposed   to a policy precommitment  I’ve been opposed to the policy precommitment all along, but I   don’t think dropping that sentence at this time conveys that message  I would prefer to do more   work to improve our communications rather than have the markets try to figure out what we’re   attempting to communicate by making a change in that “considerable period” language  I   support your recommendation    "
5242,2004-03-16,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Economic conditions in the Fourth   District have continued to strengthen since our last meeting  My business contacts are telling me   that their order books are beginning to fill up, and bankers are saying that their commercial loan   portfolio pipelines are also filling up  The business executives that I’ve spoken to since the last   meeting are still finding excellent opportunities to increase productivity, and they are spending   on capital equipment with that goal in mind  As many others who have spoken ahead of me   already said, most of the anecdotal information on capital spending is that businesses are   spending on computers, computer networking equipment, and software  However, I just learned   that a major steel producer is going to restart a basic oxygen furnace and continuous caster   operation in Cleveland to satisfy the growing global demand for steel  And it was only four   March 16, 2004 52 of 107    months ago that the domestic steel producers were lobbying for an extension of steel tariffs    Other business contacts are telling me that it’s no longer possible to scoop up at distressed prices   some of the nearly new machine tool equipment that’s out there  My contacts seem to be saying   that all of the good bargains are now gone   In my discussions with District business executives about their hiring plans, I’m still   hearing a great deal of reluctance to add people to the payrolls  Business managers have become   very adept at expanding output without adding to the workforce; as others have said, firms are   using new technology and are redesigning their business processes  And it’s not just that new   hires add to wage and benefit costs  I’m hearing executives say that, by holding down their head   count, everyone in the company is becoming more creative about ways to increase productivity   Large companies—and increasingly medium-sized companies—are expressing an   interest in and have more and more experience with outsourcing to foreign suppliers  In some   cases they are getting manufactured components from foreign suppliers, but in other cases they   are getting services, such as software development, call centers, back office operations, and even   some research and legal services  I, too, don’t want to make a lot of this or overstate the amount   of activity that is moving offshore, but I am amazed at the number of new instances I keep   hearing about, especially from medium-sized and smaller companies  What this growing volume   suggests to me is that businesses continue to feel intense pressure to rethink their business   operations  I believe that this kind of restructuring we’ve been hearing about is still going on,   and I think it’s going to continue to boost the pace of productivity growth   I reported at our last meeting that several of my business contacts were dealing with   rising prices, and that trend has accelerated  In most instances the price increases continue to be   in commodities, construction materials, and metals  But I’m hearing more reports now that   March 16, 2004 53 of 107    many firms are able to pass some of these price increases on, a point others have mentioned as   well  Even though we know that there has been little effect from these price increases on goods   at the retail level, for the first time I am hearing people say that they are more willing to   contemplate passing on some of these price increases  That suggests to me that this long period   of disinflation we’ve been living through is bottoming out  I know that in an economy where we   think there is still a considerable amount of slack it would be unusual for inflationary pressures   to emerge at this point  However, the rising prices of commodities, energy, housing, and health   care combined with the falling dollar and a very accommodative macro policy have led to a   situation that is beginning to generate some concerns among my directors, and that also worries   me  I do think that monetary policy appears to be on the right course, but I hope that we’re not   confronted with a situation where our preoccupation with weak labor markets leads us to   discount the inflationary signals that may arise  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
5243,2004-03-16,"  Mr Chairman, I also can support your recommendation on the   language, given your comment that, if we make a change, the markets are going to view that as   the first step in a sequence and will expect changes at our subsequent meetings  But I do have to   admit that I also have a mild preference for going to a balance of risks on inflation  Again,   though, I can support your recommendation on the language  "
5294,2004-05-04,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Business conditions continued to improve in   the Fourth District  The pace of improvement appears to have accelerated in recent weeks, and the   improvement is rather broad-based across industrial sectors  I’d like to make four general   observations about business conditions in the Fourth District  First, businesses appear to be   accelerating their capital spending plans for this year and next  Second, they continue to identify   opportunities to increase productivity  Third, firms remain very disciplined about their hiring plans   And fourth, the broadly based run-up in raw materials prices that we’ve been seeing, combined with   healthy order books, appears to be affording some companies the opportunity not only to pass along   these price increases but also to finally get some additional pricing leverage  I want to expand a bit   on these four general observations with a little more detailed information from a few companies that   I follow closely   One company produces customized rubber parts that are used in a large number of products   in a variety of industries  Less than six months ago, the CEO of this company was very concerned   about his business  His order book was spotty, and his customers kept pressuring him for price   reductions  He was worried about losing business to Asian producers  In fact, he was so worried   that he finally found an Asian supplier himself rather than produce only from his domestic facility    May 4, 2004 54 of 112       Today, his order book is full, he has a backlog, and he has been able to pass along raw materials   price increases and expand his margins a bit on top of that  The domestic toolmakers that he buys   from suddenly have huge backlogs as well  He is investing in new and sophisticated manufacturing   equipment to continue to improve his productivity and is cautiously adding to his workforce  A   second company that I follow stamps and fabricates sheet metal The CEO of this company reports   that his orders have picked up sharply in the past month and that he, too, is buying new capital   equipment  He is going to establish an operation in China to supply his US customers who are   producing there for the Asian markets—a move that he said is actually strengthening his   relationships with customers in domestic markets as well  This company also is now able to pass   along price increases due to the increased cost of steel and is able to widen its profit margins in the   process  Finally, in the course of our Beige Book calls, a number of specialty retailers and   department store contacts indicated that they were, for the first time, having some success with   scaling back the price discounts that they’ve been giving     I believe these companies and their stories represent a growing number of firms in my   District and they reflect the strengthening in business conditions that is taking place  I have little   doubt that the business cycle is swinging decisively into a new phase  I expect that, as this new   phase takes hold, we will see many more markets, including labor markets, firm up because of the   increases in demand  A natural element of this business-cycle process should also include, in due   course, a rise in the equilibrium real rate of interest   I see an apparent inconsistency between estimates of resource slack and stories of reviving   pricing power and the higher-than-expected inflation report  Among the people that I talk with in   the District and in some of the financial press, stories about the return of pricing power have   replaced stories about the jobless recovery  I believe that the risks on inflation are balanced  As   May 4, 2004 55 of 112       President Moskow noted earlier, inflation expectations are relatively stable partly because of our   credibility  So indicating that we will begin to unwind our policy accommodation will be necessary   to anchor inflation expectations  And if the data continue to indicate strong economic performance   and inflation that is higher than expected, I would like us to have the flexibility to react   appropriately  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
5295,2004-05-04,"  Mr Chairman, I also support your recommendation  I have to admit   that, when I first read the “measured pace” language in the Bluebook, I was concerned that it would   be interpreted by markets as indicating that we had a predetermined path for moving rates up and   that we would be doing it based on a time schedule rather than reacting to information about the   economy  And as I said earlier, I was leaning toward wanting the flexibility to react more quickly if   the data continue to come in stronger, especially the inflation numbers  I think the new language   that Vincent proposed, “is likely to be measured,” does give us the added flexibility  So I support   your recommendation  "
5343,2004-08-10,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  The pace of economic activity in the Fourth   District, although sound, has been slower this summer than in late winter and early spring  My   conversations with business persons throughout the District have reinforced my view that the region   is still poised for solid economic growth for the remainder of this year, although at a pace somewhat   slower than I had expected in the spring  During the past few months, I had thought that current   economic conditions in my District were lagging those in the rest of the country  However, national   economic statistics and the Beige Book reports indicate that the recent slowdown is more broadly   based than I had thought  Going into our June meeting, the business people I talked to were   expressing a growing sense of confidence in the economy, and at that point I thought that was   helping to dispel some of the lingering caution about restraining capital investment and hiring plans    But those expressions of confidence have dissipated somewhat, and this change in attitude came   before the July employment report     The balance of comments from the people I talk to has shifted from enthusiasm to renewed   concerns about the pace of the expansion  And this shift in attitude is not confined to those   businesses that are under stress  I had a conversation with an executive from a global   manufacturing company, whose growth in orders is matching the peak levels of the late 1990s  But   despite his strong order book, even this individual confided that this pace of business would not last    When I pressed him about the reasons he was saying that, he couldn’t cite any specific reasons  He   just had a gut feeling that it could not last    So this return of greater caution about the outlook is reinforcing the desire on the part of   firms to expand production and to meet the growing orders via productivity gains  And as I have   been reporting for some time, companies indicate that they intend to remain disciplined about their   hiring  Wage pressures don’t appear to be restraining the hiring, but high and rising health care   August 10, 2004 27 of 103          costs are  I’ve been accustomed to hearing complaints about the rise in health care costs whenever   inflation is mentioned, but lately business persons have raised this issue in the context of their hiring   strategies; from their perspective, labor is becoming more expensive  And companies that have   already enjoyed significant productivity gains continue to assert that there are plenty of   opportunities to become even more efficient  That might be a factor in the weak demand for labor   that we are seeing in the data   I find the inflation picture somewhat complicated  When we talk about inflation as the   twelve-month change in the market-based core PCE price index, we’re many steps removed from   the experiences that most people have in their local grocery stores and at the gas pumps  Even my   directors, who have become accustomed to talking about the nuances of inflation measurement,   have been very concerned about the steady stream of big headline CPI numbers this year  They   point out that people might begin to lose their patience with the idea that these large increases are   transitory  Furthermore, a number of my directors and other District contacts tell me that some of   the previous spikes in commodity and energy prices have not been fully priced into final goods    Some of my contacts in the manufacturing sector say that they still have contracts, especially with   steel producers; but those contracts will be expiring in the fall, so we might see some additional   pass-through later on this year   Fortunately, despite these reports, I have not been hearing anything that would lead me to   believe that substantial inflationary pressures are building across a wide range of final goods prices    It still seems to me that the Greenbook inflation projection is the most likely outcome  Headline   inflation rates should start to moderate in the next several quarters, but I do see some risks in the   inflation outlook  Over the course of this year, I have thought that dominant forces in the economy   were producing a higher equilibrium real rate of interest and that monetary policy needed to adjust   August 10, 2004 28 of 103          to that situation in a timely fashion  I still believe that this is so and that we should continue to   move the fed funds rate toward a more neutral stance  At the same time, I was concerned at our last   meeting that we might be falling behind the curve  But after listening to the growing caution that I   am hearing from my business contacts and after last Friday’s employment report, I’m wondering   whether the economy hasn’t shifted to a somewhat slower growth track than I expected six weeks   ago  If that is the case, then today’s fed funds rate would be closer to neutral as well  I do not think,   however, that it is so much closer that I would not want to move today  Recent developments   obviously highlight the difficulties that we face in communicating our future actions, and I’d like to   have maximum flexibility with respect to policy going forward  I would want the flexibility to   gauge the timing of future actions as economic circumstances warrant  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
5344,2004-08-10,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I also support your recommendation for a   25 basis point increase in the fed funds rate target  And along with others I, too, like this version of   the language better than the original  I also like the fact that we’re not introducing a lot of change to   August 10, 2004 87 of 103          the language since every word we change is scrutinized in the market  So I am comfortable with   this proposal  "
5395,2004-09-21,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  The tone of the reports that I’m getting   from my business contacts in the Fourth District is positive, but it’s hardly reminiscent of the   reports of robust growth that I was hearing earlier this year  Still, both order books and profits   are reported to be fairly strong  Business leaders across a broad array of industries tell me that   they expect to see steady sales growth through the end of 2004   Despite these positive reports, business confidence remains less upbeat than order books   and profits would appear to warrant  My contacts still say that, if the economy continues to   grow and stays on its present course, they will persevere in their search for more productivity   improvements rather than hire additional workers, at least for the foreseeable future  And this is   perhaps still the most remarkable aspect of this expansion—the ability of businesses to continue   to squeeze out more production with the same number of workers  It can’t persist, of course, but   I’m beginning to wonder how long I’m going to keep saying that   At a recent joint meeting of our boards from the three offices in the District, the directors   made several observations about energy prices  Although most directors expect energy prices to   retreat somewhat from their current high levels, they are basing their future business plans on   energy prices that they expect will be higher than those of a year or two ago  In response to   energy prices, though, several of our directors were commenting that they are adjusting—or at   least trying through innovation to adjust—the composition of the products that they’re   producing They’re using innovations to develop products that are less energy-dependent   September 21, 2004 47 of 100          The Fourth District economy, like the nation’s, seems to have a lot going for it except   considerable employment growth  The incoming data, though, suggest to me that the risks we   face remain balanced and may actually have narrowed a bit in their scope since the summer  By   that I mean that the prospects for either a resumption of the exceptionally strong business   expansion that we saw in the winter and spring or a slipping back to a tractionless recovery—  both of which seemed possible in the summer—look considerably more remote to me this time    Similarly, the extreme inflation or disinflation outcomes seem to me less likely as well  In   summary, I believe the economy is expanding at a sustainable rate, and I think we should   continue with our plan to gradually remove our policy accommodation  Thank you, Mr   Chairman  "
5396,2004-09-21,  I support your recommendation  
5449,2004-11-10,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Ohio may have decided the country’s   presidential election last week, but it doesn’t seem to be determining the economy’s direction  I’m   afraid I’m going to be a bit of an outlier in my report on economic conditions  Ohio was the   battleground state, and it may be that businesses and people in Ohio are just weary from this long   election cycle  [Laughter]  But as was evidenced in the Beige Book, Fourth District conditions   seemed to be less buoyant than those in the rest of the country  Businesspeople I talked to around our   District are reporting only modest growth in production and sales  And in fact, I’m seeing a growing   dichotomy in what my business contacts tell me, based on where they sell their goods and services    Those who sell only locally tend to be somewhat pessimistic about business conditions, whereas   those who sell nationally and internationally express more optimism   My local business contacts gave me very little reason to anticipate the strength that we saw in   the October employment report  Now, the report could be just another bad exit poll  [Laughter]  But   our District clearly is going through an industrial realignment that may not be indicative of   November 10, 2004 46 of 107    developments in the nation as a whole  Notwithstanding the strong overall October employment   report, manufacturing shed another 5,000 jobs in October following a decline of 14,000 jobs in   September  And Ohio’s employment remains 4 percent lower than it was at the peak of the last   business cycle, while nationally employment is up only 1 percent  The October employment report   does square with the fact that we are seeing an improving national picture, but the experience of this   past spring makes me leery of allowing one month’s data on employment to unduly influence my   thinking about the labor markets  I still hear from most of my business contacts, regardless of where   they do business, that they expect to meet rising demand without adding substantially to their   payrolls  From these comments, I expect that productivity could be higher than in the staff’s baseline   forecast, perhaps more in line with the higher productivity scenario shown in the Greenbook   Businesspeople also continue to report cost pressures, obviously from oil prices but also   from higher prices on a wide range of nonpetroleum materials  I have yet to see any convincing   evidence, though, that these cost pressures have become a part of generalized inflation  Retail   prices and wage growth remain subdued, and inflation expectations seem to be holding steady    This is in part because my business contacts, unlike those of President Moskow, say that they still   find it very difficult to pass on these price increases to their customers, especially to customers that   produce finished goods  Consequently, they are still busy altering their production processes to   substitute away from some of these more expensive commodities, if possible  One of my directors,   a very large international producer of vinyl siding and decking materials, stated that her capital   investments are all directed at raw material substitution   Taking all of this into consideration, it seems to me that our monetary policy stance is about   right at the moment, presuming an action today  My view on the appropriate policy in the future,   though, will be strongly influenced by the incoming data on economic activity  I also want to have   November 10, 2004 47 of 107    the necessary flexibility to adjust policy as economic developments unfold  Thank you, Mr   Chairman  "
5450,2004-11-10,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I also am in strong agreement with your   recommendations both to increase the fed funds rate and on the statement  My thinking on how we   would remove our accommodation has evolved over the past few months, along the line that   November 10, 2004 88 of 107    President Poole has already articulated, and I’m just not certain when a pause may be necessary  So   I am supportive of language that gives us that flexibility  And I was encouraged by Vincent’s   comments that some market participants do think that the current language gives us that flexibility    So I’m in support of your recommendations  "
5509,2004-12-14,"  Like President Minehan, I thought the experiment on early release of the   minutes was motivated by the struggle that we were having in capturing the full sense of the   Committee in the few words that are allowed in the press statement  I also have been uncomfortable   with the code words that we’ve been using in that press statement  And those code words have   proven awkward to remove without sending unintended signals to the markets  So I still prefer a   shorter post-meeting statement with the early release of the minutes    I also agree with President Minehan—especially after reading Vincent’s list of untested   aspects of the experiment—that we’ve been conducting it in the best of times  That led me to come   to this meeting in favor of what Cathy referred to as the middle-of-the-road ground  Let’s extend   the experiment through circumstances that might not be considered the best of times  I know that   this is an unpopular position, but I thought we were going to continue to perfect our communication   strategy and that this would all be one package  I can see, however, in listening to my colleagues,   that I’m in a minority in that view  Nevertheless, I did want to take a more middle-of-the-road   approach and continue to improve our communications     Okay  Yes         December 14, 2004 98 of 118          "
5510,2004-12-14,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I want to start my comments this morning   with a somewhat troubling statistic, and that is that the PNC Bank’s Twelve Days of Christmas   price index jumped 24 percent  It has been reported that a surge in French hen prices more than   offset a modest drop in the cost of turtle doves  [Laughter]  If you look at their core index, which   I’m told excludes the highly volatile swans-a-swimming component, that index was actually up   31 percent from a year ago  [Laughter]   With that, I’ll turn to my District report  In my report at our last meeting, I noted that   business activity in the Fourth District did not seem representative of what we’ve been hearing at   the national level  And judging by the most recent Beige Book, my region still seems to be more   economically challenged than the rest of the nation  During the intermeeting period, I spent a   significant amount of time talking to members of the business community  And from my   conversations, I sense a continued disconnect between the strong growth reports that I’m getting,   especially from the larger international manufacturers, and the continued soggy performance of our   District’s labor markets  Companies report that a lot of growth in orders and production is taking   December 14, 2004 32 of 118           place  It just isn’t always being met with much job growth, and indeed, the activity itself isn’t   always occurring in the Fourth District  Firms that report ample capacity are seeing some squeeze   in profit margins as they are able only to partially pass along some of their rising costs to customers    Others have been able to maintain their profits by finding yet more ways to absorb the cost   pressures through productivity enhancements  And some businesses that are feeling capacity   constraints, including the steel producers and the capital goods makers, say they are actually   successfully passing cost pressures up the production lines   But where I might ordinarily hear that these firms that are at capacity are gearing up to   expand their local production capabilities, what I’m now commonly hearing are stories that these   firms are choosing instead to expand their production capacity abroad, especially in Southeast Asia   and China  One interpretation of this information is that some industries are still in the midst of a   rather wrenching and likely protracted structural change, and the Fourth District is as close to   ground zero in that transformation as one can get  It may take a long time yet before we see   sustained significant employment gains in our area  And while this global realignment is under   way, I think it might be more challenging than usual to accurately judge capacity utilization and   inflationary break points   If I’ve been following the past several Greenbooks correctly, the staff has had to put more   monetary restraint into its projections to hold the inflation rate steady, because over the next two   years it now seems that aggregate demand is growing somewhat faster and cyclical productivity is   growing somewhat slower than previously  I found the alternative scenarios about productivity   growth and cost pass-throughs to be very informative as I thought about the risks to the outlook    Each of these variables, of course, is very difficult to predict  I am more optimistic than the baseline   Greenbook projections about productivity because of the comments I’ve been hearing from my   December 14, 2004 33 of 118           business contacts  But I am also hearing from my business contacts that they are having greater   success in passing costs along to their customers  These forces, of course, have offsetting   implications for the inflation outlook, and they do bear close scrutiny in the months ahead   We have been removing our policy accommodation at a gradual and steady pace  As we’ve   done so, I have become more satisfied about the balance of risks to our goals  Clearly, there are   uncertainties about how the economic situation is evolving, and my preference in this environment   is to avoid the risk of unexpected increases in inflation  I am fairly confident that the economy is   going to continue to expand at a pace that’s consistent with a rising equilibrium real rate over time,   and I think it’s a good idea for people to expect that environment until we see strong evidence to the   contrary  So I think that today we should take the steps that the market anticipates, and I would also   make as few changes as possible to our statement  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
5511,2004-12-14,"  I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman  "
5562,2005-03-22," Thank you, Mr Chairman  Conditions in the Fourth District have been   gradually improving across a broad range of industries this year, and business confidence appears to   be strengthening as well Actually, it feels good to no longer be a Beige Book outlier [Laughter]   As it turns out, I am also not a Greenbook outlier  I find myself in broad agreement with the staff’s   baseline projection I know I should feel comfortable being in such good company, but I view the   projection as the result of competing risks  Both the Greenbook and my business contacts are   bringing to my attention the positives associated with productivity growth and the negatives   associated with price increases   Although the rate of structural productivity growth might slow somewhat over the next few   years, in my view the decline in the Greenbook multifactor productivity projections seems a little   steep The productivity growth surprises of the last couple of years may persist a bit longer    Business executives that I talk to tell me that they are still very focused on looking for opportunities   to enhance productivity and that their capital investments are designed to achieve that goal  The   drive for efficiency has become even more pronounced for those companies that are grappling with   large increases in energy prices and in the prices of other raw materials  And, of course, many   companies continue to experience large increases in medical care costs, adding to the incentives to   wring out labor costs and other costs   The prospect that productivity growth may exceed the Greenbook baseline gives me some   optimism about the inflation outlook at a time when the headline inflation numbers keep escalating   Yet the factors driving the price level up do not seem to be going away  Energy prices, as we’ve   commented, have ratcheted up again  And, as multiyear contracts with energy suppliers roll off,   many companies continue to face increases in the prices they have to pay  The same situation exists,   although to a lesser degree, with retail pricing pressures induced by higher prices of raw materials                          March 22, 2005 37 of 116  and also intermediate products  In addition to these factors, there is also the possibility that past   dollar depreciation could show up in the form of higher prices of both imported and domestic   products   The anecdotal information that I have been receiving about pricing has taken on a different   tone from last year  Last year, retailers like Wal-Mart and Home Depot would not accept price   increases from their suppliers  But the dam seems to be showing some cracks  Recently, I heard   from the CEO of a global company that supplies the big-box retailers with adhesive products, such   as duct tape He told me that during a recent meeting with Wal-Mart he explained that he was   requesting a price increase He was told that they weren’t accepting any price increases and that   they would go to his competitors  Three days later he received a call from Wal-Mart saying that   they were going to purchase these supplies from him at the price increases he requested because his   competitors had also asked for a price increase     Also, a large manufacturer of capital equipment who supplies the adhesive industries, among   others, told me that he can get price increases for his equipment even though his costs are not rising   that dramatically  But because the businesses he is supplying are able to pass on price increases,   they are willing to take a price increase from him  So it seems that, at least in this industry, it’s more   than the adhesives themselves that are beginning to stick  [Laughter]   All things considered, I do think that the pricing environment over the next year or so will be   very challenging for companies  I see some evidence that price pressures have been building, yet, if   businesses are successful in maintaining strong productivity growth, these pressures might be held in   check The Greenbook illustrates the tension between these two factors and, as I said, I can find   myself being either hopeful or worried                                    March 22, 2005 38 of 116  I think our strategy of gradually removing our policy accommodation has convinced the   public that we are determined to keep inflation in check over the long term  It will be important for   us to earn that same degree of confidence as we go forward and as resources in the economy become   more intensely utilized  Although I’m concerned that the possibility of inflation creep over the next   year is there, the risks still seem balanced to me as long as we continue to remove our policy   accommodation at a measured pace and do so for the foreseeable future  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
5563,2005-03-22," I also support the recommendation for a 25 basis point increase in the   funds rate I was concerned, when I first read on Friday the language in paragraph 5 in alternative B,   that it would be confusing The discussion today helped me to understand the meaning behind the   language, and I hope that we’ll be able, through our minutes, to explain that to the markets, also I   understand that there will a three-week lag, and we’ll see what happens in these three weeks   I’m also in the camp that believes the balance-of-risk language has been useful, but I think it   has served its purpose and it’s time to look at a different approach  As we’ve noted today, we should   be able to rely on the minutes to communicate more fully, and I think the experience of early release   of this next set of minutes will help us to see if that is true  I would prefer to keep our statement on   the shorter side—and less forward-looking—and rely more on the minutes to communicate  "
5611,2005-05-03," Thank you, Mr Chairman  At our last meeting I said that I was happy to   report that the Fourth District was no longer an outlier in the Beige Book and that economic activity   in the region appeared to be gradually improving  But that warm glow appears to have been short-  lived Since our last meeting, economic activity in my District has shifted down somewhat,   conforming to what we now see in the national economy   In both the Beige Book process and my conversations with business contacts, I’ve been   especially keen to elicit information about pricing pressures and the reemergence of pricing power    The tone regarding pricing power also appears to have softened  Although I still hear that there’s an   ability to pass through some higher raw material costs, the majority of my contacts are once again   reporting that it is difficult to pass on price increases   My instinct is to be concerned about the possibility of further inflation creep over the year   After all, most of the inflation surprises have been on the upside for quite a while now  But from my   perspective, the issue that we confront is whether to regard the inflation situation as unfortunate but   transitory, or unfortunate and persistent   The Greenbook projection treats energy shocks like rocks thrown into a pond The energy   shock creates a ripple that dissipates over time  The price statistics throughout last year behaved   accordingly When that rock or energy shock entered the pond in 2003, the core rate of inflation   initially spiked up but then declined throughout much of the year  Energy markets threw another   stone into that inflation pond last year Without those energy shocks, my guess is that the   Greenbook inflation projections for this year would have held up nicely; and I think the current   projections are sensible, barring any more ugly supply shocks  That is, I think it is reasonable to   expect that core inflation once again will drift back down—in the absence of more rocks entering   this pond There is little evidence that unit labor costs are accelerating or that prices not affected by                                 May 3, 2005 46 of 116  energy are problematic  So this gives me some comfort with the Greenbook baseline inflation   projection But I recognize that inflation dynamics could deliver more persistence than that   Throughout this policy tightening cycle, I’ve been focused on getting the fed funds rate back   into the neutral range When the pace of economic activity appeared to be more robust, I preferred   to be in the higher end of that range However, the incoming data have made me less certain about   aiming that high  And it is possible that the equilibrium real rate of interest could be either notably   higher or lower by the time of our June meeting   For now, I still think that a sequence of small incremental increases in the fed funds rate is   the most likely course of action in the immediate future  Nonetheless, greater uncertainty about the   outlook for economic activity and inflation does change my view about how policy decisions ought   to be communicated  In my view, the “measured pace” language we’ve been using has served us   well But I think this type of guidance should be reserved for those periods of time when the   Committee feels especially confident about what the next few policy actions will be and has reason   to believe that its intentions would be misunderstood without that kind of guidance  I do not think   that these conditions are present today For that reason, I do favor removing the “measured pace”   language If the statement were reflecting my own thoughts, I would also insert some words that   convey a greater sense of uncertainty about the outlook for real growth and inflation and, therefore,   more uncertainty about the timing and magnitude of future policy actions  Thank you, Mr   Chairman  "
5612,2005-05-03," Thank you, Mr Chairman  I also support your recommendation for a 25   basis point increase in the fed funds rate target, and I will also take your guidance on the language                                 May 3, 2005 98 of 116  As I said earlier, though, I had a preference for expressing more uncertainty about not only the   outlook on inflation but also the timing and magnitude of our future moves  But given what you said   earlier, I will support your recommendation  "
5657,2005-08-09," Thank you, Mr Chairman  As I talk to my business contacts in the   Fourth District, I’m struck by the lack of any specific concerns about the near-term economic   outlook The business community appears to be optimistic about the remainder of this year—   they see diminishing inflation concerns and a brightening growth outlook   The price statistics reported during the intermeeting period were better than I expected   them to be  I hear from businesspeople I talk with that steel and raw material prices remained   soft; moreover, the Big Three auto producers have reduced prices to sell more vehicles  These   price cuts might take some pressures off of inflation as well  Based on the comments of my   business contacts and my reading of the details of the price statistics, I don’t see that inflationary   pressures are intensifying further   Like President Stern, I don’t believe that the near-term inflation outlook has changed as   much as the inflation revisions between the June and August Greenbook might imply  The   inflation environment that I just described seems to be more in line with the baseline forecast in   the June Greenbook than that in the August Greenbook  However, for reasons that David has   already explained, the staff believes that there is somewhat more inflation pressure in the   economy today than they saw a month ago  Consequently, they think that the policy path now   needs to follow a steeper trajectory than the one assumed last month in order to nudge inflation   back down gradually over time   Now, I have to confess that I’d rather be making policy based on the world depicted in   the June Greenbook than the world in the August Greenbook  And I don’t want to come across   as complacent about inflation  As I stated at our last meeting, the inflation rate is already   running at the high end of my comfort zone  I also find myself concerned that the heavily   advertised unwinding of energy shocks has not arrived  And as pointed out in the Greenbook,                         August 9, 2005 57 of 110  the inflation outlook appears to be requiring more policy restraint  The fed funds path in the   August Greenbook might prove to be too steep if inflation pressures unwind faster than the   baseline projection contemplates  But it also might prove to be too flat if those pressures don’t   unwind at all   I don’t relish the prospect of having to add an additional 50 basis points to the funds rate   path projected in the June Greenbook and not get much of a reduction in the inflation rate as a   result of that Since the funds rate paths in the June and August Greenbooks don’t part company   until the November meeting, I’m hopeful that we’ll have a better read on the inflation situation   by then For today I’m comfortable with the path that we’re on, and I don’t see a need to diverge   from that path today  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
5658,2005-08-09," Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation  And given the   comment that you just made about the less we change the statement the better, I do like President   Poole’s recommendation about the order of the wording in section 4 because that is a little more   like our previous statement on inflation  Also, given our comments around this table that   inflation today is near the high end of where we’d like it to be, I don’t want that first statement                   August 9, 2005 90 of 110  about core inflation being relatively low to be misinterpreted as meaning that the current level of   inflation is well within our comfort zone  I understand that it’s hard to fine-tune this statement at   this table, so I am comfortable with the language, but I do like President Poole’s ordering of   section 4  "
5699,2005-09-20," Thank you, Mr Chairman  The contours of the economic effects of   Hurricane Katrina that are laid out in the Greenbook baseline look about right to me  But in the   aftermath of the hurricane, and with the fragility in the energy markets, I found myself focusing   more on the alternative scenarios in the Greenbook  In the conversations that I’ve had with my                      September 20, 2005 71 of 117  business contacts, they appear to have more anxiety about future prospects than about the present   circumstances  My business contacts who have retail stores, warehouses, and production   facilities in the Gulf region all seem to have a good handle on the direct impacts of the storm,   and for the most part they say that their losses are manageable  But they emphasize that the   indirect effects of the storm, driven primarily by increases in costs of energy and building   materials prices, will be difficult to discern for many months     Of particular concern to many of my directors is the reaction of consumers to the expense   of filling their gas tanks and heating their homes during the winter  My directors report that they   are already witnessing some retrenchment in consumer spending, and they don’t know how   much of this is just a temporary reaction or how much of it is a preview of more adjustments to   come   The preliminary release of the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment survey   illustrates this concern, and I think the Greenbook’s “sentiment slump” alternative scenario   addresses the policy issues that such a development would entail     The latest spike in energy prices triggered by Katrina also has implications for the   inflation outlook On the positive side, most reports that I have been getting still have the flavor   of businesses unable to pass on higher costs to their customers Nevertheless, the headline and   core inflation reports are likely to look scary for the next several months  Fortunately, as several   of my contacts have explained, more than the usual number of price increases are taking the form   of surcharges that are expected to be removed when energy and other raw materials prices   recede To the extent that this practice lies behind some of the near-term bad news that we are   seeing on the inflation front, there is still reason to think that the Greenbook baseline projection   will prove to be accurate  But at the same time, the “deteriorating inflation expectations”                          September 20, 2005 72 of 117  scenario highlights a risk to the outlook that also troubles me a great deal  I’m very pleased that   we’ve enjoyed the public’s confidence regarding our commitment to containing long-term   inflation expectations for as long as we have during the successive energy price increases that   we’ve been hit with, but I’m not anxious to test the limits of that confidence   Even if the odds of the sentiment slump and the deteriorating inflation expectations   scenarios are similar, the policy implications are not  The Greenbook projects a GDP difference   in those two scenarios that is very small, but the difference in the projected inflation outcomes is   too sizable for me to ignore  Consequently, I think the more prudent course of action today is for   us to continue to remove our policy accommodation  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
5700,2005-09-20," Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation  "
5745,2005-11-01," Thank you, Mr Chairman  The worst position for a central banker to be in   is depicted in the Greenbook’s stagflation scenario  I don’t think we’re headed there, but just   knowing that it has a nontrivial probability is somewhat disturbing  And indeed, I’ve started to get   questions from business people in the Fourth District on whether I’m concerned about stagflation   With that possibility in mind, I’d like to speak first about the real economy and then make a   few comments about inflation  During this intermeeting period, I’ve had a number of conversations   with directors, obviously, but we’ve also held several economic forums and business advisory   council meetings From these conversations, I’ve concluded that the business conditions in the   Fourth District are mixed    First, I’ll comment on the positive news  Steel producers report that sales in most product   lines are doing very well  Commercial construction activity in the District picked up recently, albeit   from a relatively low level  Trucking and shipping firms continue to report that business is brisk   and that they’re having a difficult time finding qualified drivers Many firms report that they are                                        November 1, 2005 55 of 114  planning to step up their capital spending next year, and investments—in foreign operations   especially—continue unabated   Now for the not-so-positive news  The problems in the automobile industry appear to be   deepening, as signified by the Delphi bankruptcy filing  Ford, GM, and a host of their suppliers are   concentrated in my District, and their restructuring activities are almost certainly going to be a drag   on regional growth for a while  In fact, there appear to be a lot of mergers, acquisitions, and   restructurings taking place in the manufacturing sector, as was pointed out by President Moskow   Certainly, the companies that rely heavily on natural gas and petrochemical feedstocks are   facing severe margin pressures  One of my directors from a large multinational chemical company   reports that the US coatings industry is becoming globally uncompetitive due to the price and   availability of natural gas in the United States   Moreover, as others have mentioned, many business leaders are quite anxious about the   impact of home heating bills in the coming months on consumer spending  Some retailers are being   especially cautious about their inventories, and companies further down the supply chain tell me   that they can quickly pull back capital spending projects if the need arises   Although the comments that I’ve been hearing about the real economy vary a lot by industry, I   hear a much more consistent commentary when it comes to the pricing environment  Everyone I’ve   spoken with is worried about the effects of higher energy prices and pricing psychology more   generally  It’s a fact that energy and other input costs have been rising  Some of these costs are   now being passed through successfully, and I’m concerned that the climate has become more   receptive to pass-through than at any time in recent memory   One of my directors reported that she has been trying unsuccessfully to raise prices to a   particular customer for the past several years  Two weeks ago that customer called her to say that                                November 1, 2005 56 of 114  he knew she was going to have to raise prices in this environment and he was just hoping to get a   heads-up on how much those price increases would be and when they would come  What that   customer had previously regarded as unacceptable was now acknowledged as inevitable  An   executive of a software company that specializes in solutions to steel companies told me that he is   increasing his prices because his customers are finally making plenty of money, so they’re now   willing to accept his price increases  To paraphrase him and others “Now that the train is leaving   the station, you’d better get on with as much luggage as you can carry”  [Laughter]   Shortages of some raw materials are also likely to add price pressures in coming months    Several people reported that their suppliers are invoking force majeure clauses in contracts  Their   suppliers are facing shortages of some raw materials, preventing them from meeting their contract   obligations  These people tell me that they’ve not encountered such circumstances in 30 years of   doing business, and they are concerned about where prices are headed   I’ve not been as alarmed about inflationary pressures as my business contacts because core   measures have been very favorable  And I expect the headline numbers to improve next year  But I   can’t refrain from noting something about the policy environment that’s implied by the Greenbook   baseline projection  An awkward feature of that projection is the trajectory of the headline and core   inflation measures in 2006  After telling the public that they should ignore headline numbers and   pay attention instead to core inflation statistics, this Committee would be holding the fed funds rate   steady during a year in which labor costs and core price measures are expected to accelerate from   their current pace  This might indeed be the correct policy, but it might appear to the public that we   are tolerating a rise in core inflation  Such a situation could pose some additional communication   challenges for us next year  So, like others, I know it’s time for us to start focusing on how we                                November 1, 2005 57 of 114  communicate these issues  But for today, I believe the appropriate action for us is to continue to   remove our policy accommodation  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
5746,2005-11-01, I support your recommendations  
5790,2005-12-13," Thank you, Mr Chairman  What a difference six weeks can make  At our   last meeting, the Greenbook offered two alternative scenarios—stagflation and a consumer sentiment   slump—which at least from the Fourth District’s perspective seemed plausible and worrisome  In   early November, we had to consider the possibility that output growth might weaken even as inflation   accelerated Fortunately, the output and productivity data that we’ve received since that meeting have   been on the upside, and the inflation news has been generally encouraging  Although there are still   various scenarios to worry about today, stagflation and a consumer sentiment slump no long appear to   be among them  My own information-gathering process during this intermeeting period leaves me   very comfortable with the Greenbook baseline, which now expects more favorable paths for output,   productivity, and inflation than it called for at our last meeting   I have a few observations about each of these  First, output  The national pace of economic   activity appears to be on the upswing, even though in my own District the economy appears to remain                                 December 13, 2005 46 of 100  on a slower improvement trend  Bankers report that the commercial loan pipelines are filling up, and   competition among lenders is very strong  As I said, my District has been trailing the nation  The   automobile industry has a large weight in my District, and recent developments there, though not   unexpected, are pretty dreary, as President Moskow reported  The Big Three automobile companies   and their suppliers are under intense pressure to downsize and reduce costs, especially labor costs   Many plant closings and layoffs have already been announced, and the dark clouds hanging over the   industry are already having adverse effects on many communities  But most business leaders I speak   with outside of the automobile industry are optimistic about their national markets as they look into   next year   Next I’ll comment on productivity  The CEOs that I talked to are still working very hard to   generate profits by increasing productivity  I’m amazed by how frequently and uniformly CEOs talk   about efficiency efforts under way in their companies  A natural consequence of the productivity   culture, of course, is that business people are watching their head counts very closely, even as their   sales are expanding Hospital executives are especially bullish about their ability to generate   significant productivity gains, and they’ve been ramping up their capital spending on equipment and   facilities  One of my directors works for a large commercial construction company and reports that   this is a nationwide trend   Finally, inflation  Retailers tell me that they’ve trained their customers to shop for bargains   only too well  Consumers are relentless in their hunt for bargains, and Internet shopping is growing   rapidly in popularity and making that hunt for bargains easier  Retailers in the District tell me that   they expect consumers to hang back and wait until the bitter end for steeper discounts, and those   discounts are going to inevitably rise as Christmas looms close  Consequently, retailers expect to turn   over their inventories, but they anticipate having to give up some of the normal profit margins that                             December 13, 2005 47 of 100  they seek at this time of the year  Discounting is extremely intense  Sales volume, then, should turn   out well, but profits may be disappointing   Some manufacturers say that they are finally getting a little traction with price increases above   and beyond the energy surcharges  But most manufacturers that I talked to report that competition   remains very intense and they emphasize that they have little pricing power  Although businesses   have had to absorb price increases for many of their commodity inputs, several business executives   note that raw materials prices have stopped increasing for the most part and, in many instances, have   started to decline   So as I look at the national economy, I’m very comfortable with the Greenbook baseline  I   expect productivity growth to hold up rather well next year, along the lines of that faster productivity   growth alternative scenario in the Greenbook  Although I indicated in my report at our last meeting   that we could see stronger pass-through of energy prices, I was not hearing that from my business   contacts in their reports this time around  In fact, many of them said that the energy and commodity   price shocks that we’ve experienced in the past two years could move through our economy without   elevating core inflation rates   The disappearance of the stagflation and consumer sentiment slump scenarios and the   emergence of other risks serve as a reminder to me that the future, even the near-term future, is   uncertain The 70 percent confidence range surrounding the Greenbook baseline projection is wide   enough to include all of the alternative simulations  I believe, as a couple of others have already said,   that with another move today our policy accommodation will have been substantially removed,   making the timing and extent of additional firming more uncertain for me  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
5791,2005-12-13," Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support your recommendation of a 25 basis   point increase in our fed funds rate target  I can also accept the language in alternative B  Like   others, though, I came to the meeting preferring to remove the word “measured”  But I didn’t see   removing the term “measured” in the way Brian did—that it meant markets might think we would go   up at a faster pace of 50 basis points  I thought that its removal would give us more flexibility to stop   at a certain point  It’s interesting, in listening to this conversation today, that we all have different   interpretations of what it would mean  So I am just going to go with your guidance  Nevertheless,   given what I know today, I’m leaning to the view that we’re going to have to stop at some point soon   versus having concern that we’re going to have to do more  But again, given what I’ve heard today   and given your recommendation, I support the language as written in alternative B  "
5836,2006-01-31,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  By now I’m sure that most of you are tired   of hearing me report that conditions in my District are not as vigorous as conditions in most of the   country  I know that I’m tired of repeating it  Fortunately, optimism is increasing in many parts of   my District  My directors and business contacts that have national and international business   interests report fairly solid conditions in most of their industries  They tell me that they plan to   maintain a strong pace of capital spending this year and that they expect healthy productivity gains   from doing so  These trends encourage me to think that our economy will be able to maintain the 3   percent rate of structural productivity growth that underlies the Greenbook baseline projection    Since we are nearing the point of monetary policy neutrality, I’m counting on a strong rate of   productivity growth to help us gradually nudge the inflation rate back down over the next several   years  I have not changed my thinking about the underlying trends in the economy since our last   meeting  I was pretty much in sync with the Greenbook outlook then and remain so today  The   January 31, 2006 44 of 106    BEA’s fourth-quarter revisions appear to affect the timing of economic activity across a couple of   quarters but not to affect the longer-term outlook   Even though I still expect to see headline and core inflation moderate over the projection   period, I have become a bit more sensitive to the upside inflation risks in the baseline projection    First, in the Greenbook we received last week, the staff concluded that inflation this year could   creep up a bit more than they had thought in December, and the staff elevated their estimate of core   PCE inflation for the fourth quarter from 19 percent to 22 percent as a result of the most recent   BEA report  The staff hedged against that possibility by imposing a temporary 25 basis point surtax   on their December fed funds rate path beginning at our next meeting, and it seems sensible to me to   keep this option open  At our December meeting I said that I thought we were very close to being   able to stop increasing our fed funds rate target at every meeting  I still think so  If monetary policy   is a combination of science and art, I think we’re now out of the laboratory and inside the art studio,   and having flexibility as we go forward is highly desirable to me   Finally, Mr Chairman, I have to admit that I’ve spent more time since our last meeting   thinking about what to say in acknowledgement of your last meeting than I’ve thought about   economic conditions, and it’s impossible to come up with words to express my feelings  I just   simply want to say that it has been truly an honor and a privilege to serve under your leadership of   this Committee  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
5837,2006-01-31,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I, too, support your recommendation on the   25 basis point increase in our fed funds rate target  I, too, like the language as you proposed it    Removing the word “well” in the statement gives us, I think, more of the flexibility that I said I   desired  And I, too, would like to defer the decision on what we vote on  Thank you  "
