 Mr Chairman, this is Sandy Pianalto in Cleveland, and I am  substituting for Jerry Jordan Obviously, I can not commit to what Jerry's position will be at next  week's meeting However, I am fairly certain that Jerry would raise some objection to revealing an  action that the FOMC might take without a full deliberation of the members But again, I can not  commit to what his position will be next week   Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  With one exception regional economic   conditions in the Fourth District have changed little since our Beigebook report  Growth rates in   several industries, particularly manufacturing, appear to be moderating toward growth rates that   are more typical of the average growth rates we have been seeing throughout this expansion    The one exception to our Beigebook report is retail sales, where the outlook has become notably   more bearish  Retail sales figures for early November have been disappointing  Retailers tell us   that sales of menswear are a leading indicator for retail sales in general, and they are concerned   that a recent weak selling pace in this category foreshadows a softening in consumer demand   during the critical upcoming holiday season   Now, according to the Beigebook national summary, economic activity in the Fourth   District is slowing a bit faster than in the nation as a whole  And there is little doubt that some   firms in our District are doing poorly  However, the reasons for the poor performance seem to   be more peculiar to the industry and the firm rather than an economy-wide business slowing    For example, the heavy truck manufacturing industry has experienced a reduction in output of 40               54      percent from last year's record high levels  But it is not a lessening in demand for trucking   services that has caused the drop; in fact, truck freight tonnage has grown to an all-time high    Rather, conditions peculiar to the truck manufacturing industry are responsible for the slowdown    First of all, the oil price shock has hit the trucking firms’ capital spending budgets especially   hard  Second, trucking companies are having a more difficult time getting loans  In fact, our   contact at banks singled out loans to trucking firms as their most dangerous ones because of past   fixed price contracts that were made before diesel prices skyrocketed  Finally, because   anticipated trade-in values have dropped, it's harder for truckers to justify buying new trucks  So   while truck production has declined substantially, truck shipping has not     As a District that’s characterized by a larger concentration of manufacturing activity   than the nation as a whole, we tend to hear from that group somewhat disproportionately  And   manufacturers continue to tell us that they cannot raise their prices no matter how hard they try--  and you've heard that from several others this morning--and they are becoming increasingly   concerned about the competitive environment  In fact, they cite the very same intensifying cost   pressures that the Greenbook notes higher energy prices, higher health care costs, and higher   labor costs because of the tight labor market, especially for skilled labor   The steel industry provides a very powerful example of what is going on  Inventories   in steel are quite high and the industry is characterized by excess capacity around the world    Steel imports have been flooding into the United States  Conditions have become so bad for the   integrated producers that plant shutdowns and/or layoffs within a year are likely and a couple of   our directors point out that outright bankruptcies are not out of the question if conditions don't   change  Competition has prevented prices of manufacturers from rising even in a situation               55      where prices of raw materials are increasing  Chemical firms, for example, report that even   though higher oil prices have greatly increased their costs, they’ve been unable to raise their   selling prices   Now, I take the reports from manufacturers seriously, but I also want to put them in   perspective  On an ex food and energy basis, goods prices as measured by the CPI have been   increasing at an annual rate of only 1/2 percent in each of the past three years  So it's no surprise   that manufacturers do not see inflation lurking around the corner  Yet the overall core CPI   continues to accelerate  The culprit is the services sector, which may be less susceptible to   import competition, less prone to productivity increases and, of course, has a larger component   of labor inputs than the goods-producing industries   This brings me to the national situation  The Greenbook says that the economy is   essentially in balance--in the sense that the level of economic activity is roughly in line with that   of potential  And I think the Greenbook does a good job of expressing the caution that has crept   into the minds of businesspeople  But I am also mindful of the economy's extraordinary ability   to grow faster than the Greenbook expects  In the baseline projection, to the extent that any   policy adjustment is thought prudent, only a 50 basis point increase in the fed funds rate in the   next two years is called for  Given all the uncertainties surrounding forecasts and policy   prescriptions, we could almost regard that as no change in policy at all  I say “almost” because   the staff still maintains in its baseline projection that the economy is at risk for more inflation   rather than less over the forecast horizon    I share that concern, but perhaps for some reasons that are different from those   underlying the Greenbook projection  I'm concerned that we will confuse people about our               56      definition of price stability and our willingness to pursue it  This year will mark the fifth   consecutive year that the core PCE will have increased at a rate of less than 2 percent  Last   year's rate was 1-1/2 percent and that result led many people to say that we had achieved price   stability  But core inflation measures will be up this year from last year and if the Greenbook is   correct, we'll see them creep up further in each of the next two years  A statistical test that we   have run on the median CPI, a core measure that we developed at our Bank, indicates that the   inflation trend has not changed at all during the expansion  Similar analyses that we’ve run on   the core PCE lead us to the same conclusion  Once we’ve added in the Greenbook projection for   PCE, there will have been no improvement in the inflation trend during the entire expansion   period  So, I find it difficult to contemplate looking at a projection for core PCE that entails   reverting to the inflation levels that we had in 1994 and 1995 without at least expressing some   concern that the balance of risks is toward more inflation than is really acceptable  Thank you,   Mr Chairman     I also agree with your recommendation  Like others, I was   prepared to make a longer statement in case the recommendation was to change the tilt    And my reason for that is that I am concerned about our objective of achieving price   stability  But like others, I will also spare you from the statement     Mr Chairman, this is Sandy Pianalto  I also support your   recommendation  The economic outlook in the Fourth District is showing no signs of   deterioration and, if anything, is improving  The steel industry, of course, is the major     4/18/01 9   exception, but those problems appear to be systemic and not cyclical  Despite the more   positive reports on current economic activity than we were getting in the past few   months, our directors and some of the early respondents to our Beige Book surveys are   cautious about the outlook for the balance of the year  Most of our contacts believe that   there will be no substantial or lasting pickup in business until the fall at the earliest  In   light of this expectation, capital spending plans in almost all the areas we surveyed have   been curtailed or put on hold     The one change that I’m seeing is in people’s attitudes about what is going to   get the economy moving again  Last fall and late last year--and even very early this year   --whenever business people in our community saw someone from the Fed they would tell   us that the Fed had to do something  They’d say, “You’ve got to get interest rates down   to get this economy moving again”  Today, those same people are not looking to   monetary policy to fix the current problems  They recognize that some of the problems   are systemic and that they are going to have to work through them themselves and not   depend on monetary policy  Even so, the reason I’m supporting your recommendation is   that it is in line with ensuring that monetary policy is not contractionary  So I think it is   the appropriate move and the appropriate time    Mr Chairman, this is Sandy Pianalto in Cleveland,   representing Jerry Jordan  We fully support your recommendation     Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll begin my remarks with a report from   La Paz, Mexico, where Jerry Jordan is taking possession of his new sailboat  He sent me an   e-mail a few days ago saying that he had found a dollar store there—sort of  [Laughter]  It is   called “Uno Precio,” and everything in the store is priced at 10 pesos  So at just over 10 pesos to   the dollar, he notes that it’s a bit more expensive than the dollar store he found in Canada  But   the Mexicans who are packing this place still find it a great bargain  Jerry’s final comment to me   was “price stability reigns”   I noted in reading the transcript of the December meeting that   January 28-29, 2003 131 of 195    many of you commented that you’re going to miss Jerry’s anecdotes and vignettes  So I’ll do my   best to bring interesting but, more important, entertaining anecdotes from the Fourth District   Economic conditions in our District have been moving sideways for the past six months,   and this intermeeting period was no different  Manufacturers in the District continue to express   their disappointment about the current state of economic affairs more vocally than just about any   other group  Automobile manufacturers are doing a bit better than most, but even in that sector   there are differences depending on which plant and what model one is looking at  Home sales   and new home construction continue strong, as many others have mentioned about their   Districts  One director who last week attended a national convention for homebuilders indicated   that there was a great deal of optimism in that group  Her company is a supplier to homebuilders   and they as well as other suppliers are seeing strong orders  So, that area of the economy   continues to be optimistic  Auto sales in our District have continued to be brisk, although they   are backing off a bit from the record levels of last year  Consumer spending is flat to down over   the past two months compared with a year ago   We made a point of asking our advisory council members about the poor state of capital   spending  Specifically, we asked them how the geopolitical situation might be affecting their   capital spending plans  Although the sample is not really representative of anything, what we   heard was interesting  They told us that they don’t put a great deal of weight on the view that   terrorist activity or the pending war with Iraq is holding back a lot of capital spending    Businesses are spending  But they’re spending on higher health care costs, increased insurance   premiums, and the higher costs of maintaining their old plant and equipment  So if this view has   any merit, the easing of geopolitical tensions may not lead to the immediate surge in capital   spending that some analysts are predicting    January 28-29, 2003 132 of 195    Regarding the national outlook, my view is consistent with the Greenbook; the economy   does appear capable of continued growth  However, using Larry Slifman’s term from this   morning, I am “somewhat skeptical” about the timing of the snapback in business fixed   investment, which many forecasters believe is necessary to propel the economy by the summer   back to the higher growth trend  Given the reported figures on excess capacity in the economy,   it may be that capital services can expand without a substantial snapback in investment   expenditure, at least in the short run  My guess is that it depends on whether the excess capacity   represents past investments that are simply not likely to become productive in the short run—  those that were highly speculative in the high-tech industry—or whether the excess capacity   represents a more traditional weakness in demand  At least some of the individuals I have   spoken with in the Fourth District suggest that it is the weakness in demand  They have the   capacity to meet increased demand but seem to be saying that they’re not going to be in a hurry   to invest in new capital equipment when business picks up again  I know that would break from   the historical patterns we’ve seen, so maybe this attitude will prove to be just pessimism and not   reality    I believe that we’re seeing in our region the same phenomena many of you have   mentioned in the labor markets  Firms are looking at ways to produce more with their existing   workforce  I agree with Sandy’s comment this morning that the relatively tepid employment   growth we’re seeing is mirroring the pattern of the 1990-91 recovery more closely than other   postwar recoveries  If that pattern continues, we may face a second year of very little   employment growth while GDP again is growing  Thank you, Mr Chairman     I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Economic conditions in the Fourth   District appear to be broadly consistent with those in the rest of the nation  Two sentences in the   Beige Book national summary describe our situation very well—namely that growth in economic   activity remained subdued in January and February and that geopolitical and economic   uncertainties are constraining business and consumer spending and tempering near-term   expectations  I think the staff did an excellent job in reporting, analyzing, and synthesizing the   data that have come in since our last meeting  The staff concluded that the economy is likely to   be weaker in the near term, yet real GDP growth and inflation next year are expected to be about   the same as was forecast at our last meeting, indicating the largely transient nature of the   additional softness  I generally agree with that forecast, although how I arrive at the GDP figures   is slightly different    I’d like to focus my comments this morning on some of this near-term weakness and its   potential implications  First, the March 7 release of the February labor market data does seem to   have powerfully affected market sentiment about the economy  All of us are aware that last   month’s weather distorted economic activity, and our Beige Book contacts across a wide range   of retail sectors reported that the winter storms did affect their sales  Even if we knew how to   account for the weather, we probably still would conclude that labor markets weakened in   February  But it’s hard to know how much of that report is idiosyncratic, as can often happen   with one month’s data     One of my directors, whose firm supplies materials nationally to the homebuilding   market, reported that she saw a significant decrease in orders in February  But as rapidly as   orders had declined in February, they bounced back in early March  Overall I don’t get a sense   from our directors or advisory council members and other contacts in the District that conditions   March 18, 2003 59 of 101    have changed fundamentally in the past few months  But, like President Santomero, I detect a   significantly more negative tone in their comments    The economy is still expanding, and it is expected to do so, albeit at a very moderate   pace  Housing has continued to be strong, and the bankers in my District say that it’s going to   continue to be strong  Business investment is weak, and it is expected to remain weak according   to business people in my District  I’ve had many conversations with contacts throughout the   District about how credit availability, the geopolitical risks, and capacity utilization are affecting   the pace of their capital spending  Bankers report that they are very liquid and anxious to lend    In fact, they note in a more short-term perspective that they finally have started to receive   inquiries from their business customers  Customers have increased their credit lines but are not   using those lines, which tells me at least that they’re gearing up for some use of them down the   road but not until the Iraq situation is resolved  Within the last week alone, two of my business   contacts informed me that their firms had turned away sizable orders because to fill those orders   they would have to add to capacity and, with the uncertainty that we face, they weren’t willing to   do that  In ordinary times, those investments would have been made   So, as I commented at the last meeting, I still am concerned about the outlook for a   snapback in BFI given the current low levels of capacity utilization  Our research department   did some statistical work to examine the relationship between capacity utilization and business   fixed investment  We found that both the level and the change in capacity utilization strongly   lead business investment, again suggesting that we shouldn’t expect a pickup in BFI until some   of the excess capacity gets absorbed  From our Beige Book contacts we hear a consistent story,   namely that they are not willing to add to their capacity  Many of them still have a lot of idle   capacity and aren’t planning any additional capital spending even to bring that idle capacity back   March 18, 2003 60 of 101    on line  This does not mean that we won’t see any spending on plant and equipment or software   but rather that the upward trajectory is not going to be as steep as we’d like to see  Interestingly,   I think the caution about capital spending fits into the Greenbook projection of strong   productivity growth  I say that because the CEOs I talk to are telling me that, even though they   are paying very close attention to payrolls and to capital spending—they’re not hiring and   they’re not spending—they are still innovating  These efforts show up in the healthy rate of   multifactor productivity growth as we see in the Greenbook   In summary, I am discouraged by the lack of progress in the expansion thus far, but I   believe that some of it is clearly due to the unsettled risks of war and terrorism  Obviously, the   potential for war is a very dark cloud overhead—and not that far overhead perhaps  Although   this cloud is restraining economic activity now, I do believe that its successful dissolution will   result in a continued economic expansion  So as the Vice Chair and others have indicated today,   this is a time for the central bank to be patient, to watch developments unfold, and especially to   see how the economy looks once this dark cloud of uncertainty dissipates  Thank you, Mr   Chairman     I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The economic information that I’ve   gathered from my directors and other business contacts in the past few weeks really hasn’t   altered my view of the economy  The economy is still expanding, but growth remains subdued    With the exception of steel manufacturers and a few durable goods manufacturers, most of the   people I’ve talked to say that they expect conditions to improve in the next six months  Very   few of my contacts reported any noticeable change in their business due to the war in Iraq  The   exception was retailers, who did notice a slowdown in traffic but only during the first few days   April 16, 2003 14 of 47    of the war  One of my directors called it the “CNN effect,” people staying home to watch the   war on TV  Although consumer spending reports were generally weak in April, retailers that I   talked to are optimistic that sales will bounce back, in part because of improved weather, but   they also are hoping that the longer Easter buying season will improve sales     Most manufacturers that I talked to noted that production and sales were flat or slightly   improving  In general, growth was stronger in the nondurables sector than it was in the durable   goods sector  Nondurable goods producers reported steady or even increasing employment as   well as some significant overtime at their plants; durable goods manufacturers, on the other hand,   reported some layoffs and staff reductions as well as shortened overtime schedules  Most   durables manufacturers expected conditions to remain flat in the near future, but some did have a   degree of optimism regarding increased sales and production during the latter half of 2003     The bankers in our District continue to see strong mortgage refinancings  For the first   time, though, I also heard more of our banking contacts say that commercial borrowers were   taking advantage of the lower interest rates by refinancing their outstanding loans  Bankers are   reporting that they are flush with deposits and that net interest margins are being squeezed   In summary, I haven’t seen much change in the economy over the past few weeks—no   deterioration but also no improvement  That concludes my comments, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  My comments about economic conditions   in the Fourth District are not too different from those that my colleagues have already reported   about their Districts  Moreover, conditions in our region haven’t changed very much since my   last several reports  The Fourth District’s economy is poised to expand at a faster pace in the   second half of this year, but reasonable doubts still exist about the timing and the extent of that   expansion  District business leaders and bankers I’ve talked to are still expressing caution if not   outright skepticism about the environment  The bankers continue to enjoy fee income from   mortgage refinancings, but they know they can’t rely on that product line to sustain their   business indefinitely  They look forward to expanding their commercial and industrial loans, but   their most creditworthy customers have yet to see any need to draw down their credit lines    Business firms still seem to place a premium on staying liquid  For example, several members of   May 6, 2003 49 of 115    our Business Advisory Council indicated that their customers are extending the period over   which they are making payments  Some of them are extending it by thirty to sixty days, not   because they don’t have the cash to pay but because they want to conserve their cash and stay   more liquid   Another condition that hasn’t changed in several months, as many others have already   noted, is the aversion to business investment  I continue to question business people closely   about their capital spending plans, and I’ve yet to find any concrete evidence pointing to a   firming of spending plans later this year  There is just too much excess capacity in too many   firms  Also, in line with what President Poole reported earlier, several manufacturers have told   me that there’s a glut of used capital equipment on the market and, because of the glut, prices are   quite low  Some firms with very strong balance sheets are buying this equipment and   warehousing it until demand picks up, reasoning that in the worst-case scenario they can just sell   it again  However, most firms I’ve talked to don’t want to buy any capital equipment even at   these low prices The equipment they already own has lost significant market value, weakening   their balance sheets  Lenders, consequently, are less willing to advance credit to these firms    Business conditions haven’t deteriorated—just the balance sheets   Many manufacturers in the District also have become increasingly more pessimistic   about their ability in the longer term to compete against firms that have located production   facilities outside the United States, especially in areas like China, where labor costs are quite   low  Some of these manufacturers are recalling the shakeout that occurred in the 1980s after a   long period of dollar appreciation  In today’s environment, manufacturers are still cutting their   prices but are facing higher input costs for both raw materials and labor benefits  They fear that   May 6, 2003 50 of 115    we’re in another ratcheting down of industrial activity in this country—a structural adjustment   that they say began in late 2000 and could persist for several more years     Turning to the national economic outlook, if I generalize what I’m hearing from my   District contacts—many of whom have operations nationally and internationally—one inference   that I can draw is that business fixed investment may be weaker than in the Greenbook path, at   least for the next year or two  It could be that the negative tone I’m hearing from these business   people is contemporaneous and not predictive of their future investment plans  If that’s the case   and the negative tone simply reflects the current cautious environment, then when economic   activity picks up we may indeed see the stronger business fixed investment portrayed in the   Greenbook  However, if the negative tone is more foretelling of problematic fundamentals, then   perhaps it reflects a reduced expected return to new investment  So it may be telling us that the   equilibrium real rate of capital has moved down somewhat and will remain lower for a longer   period of time than we thought  I expect we’ll talk more about that during the policy discussion    Thank you, Mr Chairman     I am supportive of the policy recommendation, and I support the   unbundling of the two risks  I’m also pleased that the statement acknowledges our concern about   deflation by indicating that a substantial fall in inflation would be unwelcome  However, I share   some of the views expressed by others about the “taken together” sentence, which rebundles the   risks  I am concerned that it will cause the markets to focus just on the fact that we’ve changed   our balance of risks toward weakness  My preference is not to have that sentence in the   statement  However, I can support the statement as it’s written  And I, too, look forward to the   development of a communication method that we all feel comfortable calling a swan       Thank you, Mr Chairman  I also want to thank the staff  I thought   the papers and the presentations were excellent, and they did add to my knowledge on these   issues  I just want to make a couple of brief comments on managing expectations  I don’t make   it a point to go around talking about deflation, but increasingly I’m asked about it  Also, more   and more often I’m being asked what tools the Federal Reserve has if we do reach the zero   bound  What ammunition do we have left?  Again, it’s because so much has been written in the   press about these issues  So I believe, as others have said today, that it is important to manage   June 24-25, 2003 53 of 211    expectations by communicating effectively  We need to say confidently that the possibility of   deflation is remote, that it’s the job of the central bank to make sure that we don’t have deflation,   and that the central bank has a variety of tools available to address this issue  I, too, as several of   my colleagues have suggested, would focus on providing reserves to the system because that’s   the tool that we have readily available       Thank you, Mr Chairman  Economic conditions in the Fourth   District have not changed very much during the intermeeting period  Many manufacturers   continue to report significant amounts of excess capacity and declining prices for the products   they are producing  For the most part they’re not planning to acquire new capital equipment   beyond the amounts that they had scheduled early in the year  More and more manufacturers   with whom I talk indicate that their firms are undergoing a fundamental restructuring  More of   the components that they use in the production process are being produced overseas or purchased   from overseas, and only the assembly, testing, and value-added components are remaining in the   United States for now     Bankers consistently tell me that, although their residential mortgage loan origination   volumes remain very large, they are hungry for qualified commercial and industrial borrowers    Bankers also tell me that their loan-to-deposit ratios are quite low and their liquidity ratios are   quite high  When I talk to business people I find that they’ve become as impatient about the   economy’s sluggishness as we have  They are unsettled about their inability to generate sales or   to have any pricing traction, and in the meantime their medical costs and pension costs continue   to rise   Increasingly, my directors and other business contacts report that they are planning   additional rounds of cost cutting and personnel downsizing in order to generate respectable   profits  Apparently some organizations had decided to wait until midyear—forecasters were   June 24-25, 2003 108 of 211    projecting that the economy was going to pick up by then—before implementing these plans for   additional downsizing, and reluctantly some of the CEOs are now feeling the need to pull the   trigger  My business contacts do not see the current price and availability of credit as   impediments to capital spending  Perhaps they don’t appreciate the various other channels   through which lower interest rates might help the economy, such as through the influence on   exchange rates and balance sheets     Turning to the national economy, from my perspective the Greenbook outlook is on the   high side  What accounts for the difference is that the Greenbook is more optimistic than I am   about capital spending, and the numbers that I submitted are consistent with my view on capital   spending  The Greenbook does characterize the economy as operating far below potential in   terms of both levels and growth rates  Suppose, however, that the economy is not operating   quite as far below potential as assumed in the Greenbook  That is, even at somewhat higher   capacity utilization levels certain firms would still not be economically viable  I’m hearing from   my business contacts that some industries may still need to shed more capacity than they have so   far and that the process is going to take some time     There are possible reasons why at this time—after a stock market crash, terrorist attacks,   accounting scandals, and industrial restructuring—we might prudently lower our estimates of   potential output and its growth rate, at least for a few years  To the extent that these various   forces are at work, easier monetary policy may not lead to appreciably faster economic growth  I   am concerned that we may be too focused on stimulating aggregate demand and not appreciative   enough of the supply-side constraints that may be at work and that we just have to work through    Thank you, Mr Chairman   June 24-25, 2003 109 of 211      Mr Chairman, I also support your recommendation for a 25 basis   point cut  The reason I support it is the need to address the disinflation risk  In the statement we   issued at the last meeting we did tell the public for the first time that we had concerns about that   June 24-25, 2003 154 of 211    risk, and over the intermeeting period we validated those concerns in such a way as to strengthen   the public’s conviction that we would act today  Having called attention to the risk, I think we   are obligated to follow our rhetoric with action  As others have said, uncharted territories   contain risks that we would be wise to avoid, and I think this action will help us avoid those   risks     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Reports from the Fourth District are   consistent with the story of the US economy  slow, steady growth and slowly improving   August 12, 2003 35 of 110    conditions, coupled with mixed economic signals and still a great deal of lingering anxiety  The   one bright spot in the Fourth District’s economic scene is Lebron James  He’s the high-school   basketball phenomenon who was the number one draft pick in the NBA  The Cleveland   Cavaliers drafted him and have sold a lot of season tickets as a result  And this young man   hasn’t played a game for them yet  The reason I’m bringing this up is that Lebron and I attended   the same high school  [Laughter]  Clearly, the more recent Akron St Vincent graduate is having   a greater impact on the Cleveland economy than the one who graduated many years ago!     The driving force behind the lingering anxiety in the Fourth District is China  I haven’t   been able to have a single conversation with a member of the business community recently   without that conversation slipping into a discussion about China and its rapid growth as a US   trading partner  I have to say, though, that the business people I talk to don’t speak about China   as a business partner but rather as a source of intense competition  Last year the United States   imported as much from China as from Japan, although we exported far less to China than to   Japan  Many of the manufacturers are complaining that it is difficult to export to China because   of trade impediments and because China unfairly pegs its currency to the US dollar     I interpret the preoccupation with China that I’m encountering in the business community   as a proxy for the expansion of the global trading order, of which China is but a part  That   expansion in global trade and the international linkages are clearly affecting the decisions that   business people in our District are making  Some of them are reconfiguring their supply chains   to source goods from companies abroad  Others are locating their production facilities in foreign   countries  For many manufacturing companies in our area, all that’s left in the District are   assembly and testing  The prices of items produced in China and elsewhere are clearly affecting   our firms’ pricing strategies  The economic emergence of China and other developing countries   August 12, 2003 36 of 110    appears to be forcing adjustments in the capital and labor markets in many nations, not just ours,   and this process is going to take many, many years to play out   I suspect that today US capital spending, production, and employment are weaker than   otherwise would be the case and that relative prices of manufactured goods are also lower as a   result of this phenomenon  Business persons I speak to have indicated that making capital   expenditure decisions in this environment has been very complex  For some manufacturing   companies, the productive capacity located in the United States may no longer have the same   economic value as it once did  And we’re seeing an increase in corporate mergers, acquisitions,   and restructuring that are all part of this process   Intense foreign competition is probably also an element in understanding why the higher   disposable incomes that we see and the monetary accommodation that exists have not yet totally   been translated into greater domestic production and employment  My business contacts are   telling me that there is business out there; they’re just not getting it  These stories appear to have   been confirmed, as was mentioned earlier, by the excess of final sales over gross domestic   product now evident in the second-quarter numbers  If this anxiety that I’m hearing about from   our District manufacturers is pervasive throughout the country, it may be that the pickup in   business fixed investment will not materialize as quickly as forecast in the Greenbook  Thank   you, Mr Chairman     Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation on the fed funds rate   and on the balance of risks statement     Thank you, Mr Chairman  After the last two meetings and even after   reading the transcripts of the last two meetings, when we spent a lot of time talking about the   need to improve our communications, I expected to be supporting major changes in the way we   communicate  But after getting the material from Vincent and also reading Dave Lindsey’s   paper, I found myself in the camp of wanting to make only some minor changes to what we’re   doing currently  I believe that we should have a statement that announces our action and gives   the reasons for the action  I think we should continue to have language on the balance of risks,   with some improvements such as those that have been recommended by Presidents Stern and   Moskow  I noted in reading the minutes of our August meeting that the language about our   action was clearer than that in the statement, which brought to mind the comment by Governor   Bies that maybe we could be clearer in our language  The wording in the minutes still had the   risk information in it, but the statement was just a little clearer to me  So I think the suggestions   that have been made about providing some draft language in advance in the Bluebook and then   tying that language to our press release will help to make our statements clearer   I also agree with several of my colleagues, however, that we should stop short of hinting   at future policy and refrain from either deliberately or inadvertently signaling to the markets   what our next move is likely to be  So I would want us to stop short of trying to manage   expectations about our future policy actions     Finally, in regard to the minutes, I came in here thinking that it was a good idea to release   the minutes earlier  But after listening to the comments tonight, especially the concern that we   September 15, 2003 68 of 78    could not readily reverse that decision and return to our current practice, I think the issue   requires a little more thought before we make such a move  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  As we’ve been discussing this morning,   the staff projection contemplates a very good business environment for the next couple of years    Aggregate demand and real GDP are expected to expand very rapidly, and an amazing 7 million   net new jobs are created  The business fixed investment climate improves considerably, and by   the end of 2005 the economy is producing near its potential output level and expanding at about   the same rate as potential  And, of course, inflation is even lower than it is today  I think most   people would be pleased to see that projection become actual experience  I know I would    However, I’ve been confronted almost daily during this intermeeting period with a   dichotomy between the economy described in the Greenbook and the economy as it is   characterized in the reports of the business people I talk with in the Fourth District  I’ve been   hearing a rather consistent story during this period from CEOs—many of whom are heads of   companies that operate internationally—across a wide spectrum of manufacturing and service   industries  Their story goes something like this  We invested heavily in equipment and software   September 16, 2003 57 of 106    during the latter half of the 1990s, and it has taken us a while to figure out how to use all of this   in a productive manner  We’ve learned that, in addition to putting in the new technologies, we   have to develop different business practices and retrain our employees—which is similar to a   comment Dave Stockton made this morning  We found out that in the late ’90s we expanded our   capacity too rapidly, and therefore we’re planning to expand more slowly this time around  At   the moment we find that we can generate additional output from our current payroll and capital   stock more readily than we thought we could  We need to take steps to avoid increasing costs,   and we don’t have to add to capital as much as we thought   Allowing for some occasional variation, that’s the story I hear  So I conclude from my   business contacts that they remain guarded in their willingness to take on new employees and to   invest domestically  Their concern doesn’t appear to be a lack of demand for their products but   rather how much risk they’re willing to take on to meet that demand  The lack of hiring, as   we’ve been talking about this morning, is amazingly widespread  Only about one-third of US   industries are adding to domestic payrolls today as compared with nearly two-thirds of our   industries at a comparable stage of the so-called jobless recovery of a decade ago     My business contacts are confirming that a great deal of industrial restructuring is   occurring, as President Guynn and First Vice President Stewart have noted  Many firms are   continuing to reevaluate the economic value of their current employment base and their fixed   investments as they develop their hiring and investment plans for the next year  Some of that   labor and capital may simply be less valuable to them now than they had previously thought to   be the case  Now, the usual process of reallocating physical capital is for the ownership to   change through a sale of the assets without a need to move the buildings or equipment  But the   International Steel Group, which just acquired assets from both LTV and Bethlehem Steel,   September 16, 2003 58 of 106    announced that it’s selling two of its quarter-mile-long strip rolling mills to a Chinese company   and will relocate those mills to China  One news account estimates that it’s going to take several   years to dismantle, ship, and reassemble these mills  It’s a transaction that provides a vivid   illustration of a different way to reallocate resources that is evolving in this global economy   As I said at the outset, I would welcome the Greenbook baseline projection  However,   it’s not the picture of the outlook that my business contacts are painting  They seem to be   harboring a fair amount of uncertainty about the environment in which they’re operating, as   many others have said is the case in their Districts  If the Greenbook projection proves to be   accurate, it’s going to be fascinating to watch the perceptions and actions of these business   people as they change their behavior to converge in the direction of the scenario in the   Greenbook  Thank you, Mr Chairman       Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support your recommendation on the   federal funds rate target and your recommendation on retaining the balance of risks statement as   it is currently  As I said last night, though, I am uncomfortable about signaling our future policy   actions in our statement and, therefore, at the August meeting I was not in favor of the   considerable period of time sentence  But I also agree with your assessment that dropping it at   this meeting would confuse the markets  So I support the statement as written       Thank you, Mr Chairman  The 2001 recession is now nearly two   years behind us, and I believe that most people in the Fourth District have accepted, perhaps   surprisingly, that the economy is expanding  Even our manufacturers are seeing evidence of   improvement in business activity  Our steel producers report that the worst may be over and that   prices are actually firming in some markets  Machine-tool makers report that they also are   seeing a pickup in orders from small and medium-size businesses as a result of the special   depreciation allowance for capital goods   Nevertheless, there is still a great deal of anxiety about the sustainability of the recent   upturn in business activity  I’m told by my business contacts that the expansion lacks balance    October 28, 2003 57 of 126    Bankers, for example, are having a profitable year, but they would prefer to have a larger portion   of commercial loans in their loan portfolios  Manufacturers in my District remain uneasy over   the pressures they face from global competition, and I doubt whether that pressure is going to   dissipate any time soon  As a member of my Small Business Advisory Council put it last week,   old line thinkers who looked through the business cycle expecting their order books to return to   normal are now exiting their businesses  There is no “normal” any more     Recessions and their immediate aftermath account for much of the trend decline in   manufacturers’ share of overall employment, and this cycle is no different  CEOs continue to   report that they are using this downturn to reassess their business strategies, to reexamine their   product lines, and to reexamine the location of their facilities  As they sort through these   options, companies continue to be cautious—or maybe I should say disciplined—about their   expansion plans, including their hiring plans  Their comments, though recently a bit more   optimistic, do not suggest an impending rebound in hiring on the order of magnitude of the   acceleration that the Greenbook forecasts in 2004  Productivity and profitability are figuring   prominently in everyone’s thinking about the business outlook  CEOs report that they can still   generate productivity increases by reorganizing their business processes and by implementing   new production technologies  For example, a metal stamper firm in our District reported   purchasing for only $120,000 a machine that cost $1 million three years ago, and that machine is   going to do the work of five people  So he expects to make a profit with this technology and is   focusing on increasing sales, but he’s not going to increase his workforce in the near future     It’s not entirely clear to me how to think about the current high rate of joblessness and   low rate of capacity utilization  Again, I wonder whether these resources are simply   underemployed or whether they have become obsolete  The story of the metal stamper is not   October 28, 2003 58 of 126    unique  Many manufacturers in my District tell me that resources, both capital and labor, have   lost their economic value during the past several years  Perhaps the lower economic value   placed on these resources represents a slowdown in potential output  Translating, therefore, what   I’ve heard from my District contacts into the Greenbook projections, I would end up with a   scenario close to what President Broaddus and some others talked about earlier this morning—  that is, somewhat slower employment growth and somewhat faster productivity growth over the   next several years  As David Stockton commented earlier, these two factors could still yield   roughly the same output and income path as in the Greenbook  But as noted by President   Broaddus and others, these two factors—slower employment growth with somewhat higher   productivity growth—could also lead to further disinflation  However, if it’s reasonable to think   that the economy has sustained a slowdown in the rate of growth of potential, then looking   forward, the disinflation implications could be less troublesome than in the Greenbook baseline    Thank you, Mr Chairman     I agree with your recommendation, Mr Chairman     I’m going to switch gears back to the inflation issue  In your   comments, Dave, you addressed some of the risks toward higher inflation  Of course, our   statement still says that the probability, though minor, of an unwelcome fall in inflation exceeds   that of a rise in inflation  In June you prepared and shared with us some probabilities of the   economy falling into deflation  I would like to know you have rerun those simulations and   whether they’ve changed very much or if that is just not a concern any longer     Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Conditions in the Fourth District have   improved notably since our last meeting, as was described in some detail in our latest Beige   Book report  Consumer spending and housing remained buoyant, and now a broader mix of   business persons are willing to express satisfaction with their profitability and their order books    Nevertheless, those I talk to remain cautious about their capital spending plans and are still   tentative about hiring plans  I get a lot of questions from business people in our District about   where this 82 percent growth is occurring because they just don’t see it  I suspect that the   Fourth District is going to be one of the laggards as this economywide expansion extends into the   next year     December 9, 2003 60 of 133    Although the media like to report on the manufacturing sector as if it’s some type of one-  dimensional animal, the performance in that sector has been quite mixed  Certainly there are   differences among companies due to the manufacturing sub-industry in which they operate since   some sub-industries are experiencing stronger demand than others  Defense-related industry is   the most obvious example  However, small firms that supply components to larger companies   are having an extraordinarily difficult time in the current environment  These small firms   typically buy raw materials in world markets, and they have no bargaining power over the prices   they pay  Their final customers can source components, even custommade parts on world   markets as well, and those customers are forcing the component suppliers to compete against one   another strictly on spot prices  The result is that the component suppliers are being squeezed   from both sides     An example of this in my District was related to me by a contact whose firm makes a   variety of small rubber parts  He sells those parts to larger companies that are producing   automobiles, computers, and consumer goods  One of his customers recently asked him to   reduce his price for a component from $115 to $40  If that price request could not be met, the   customer said he was going to have to take his business offshore  My contact couldn’t produce   the component at that price so he went offshore and found a producer who could  He then was   able to sell this part to his customer for $38 apiece, just slightly under the $40 price requested    The part costs my contact $09 plus $05 shipping, so he’s still making a profit  I find two   aspects of this story noteworthy  The first is that my contact, when asked to reduce his price,   thought the product could not be made at that price  But he found that it could be produced   offshore with technology that he didn’t even know existed  He was unaware of the technology   until he visited the shop floor and actually saw that technology being used  So it wasn’t labor   December 9, 2003 61 of 133    cost that was driving down the price but the technology being used offshore  The second aspect   that I find interesting is that many large US manufacturing companies are now depending on   inexpensive offshore sourcing to keep their own products competitive  So if there are   disruptions in the relations with emerging economies, that is going to help some US industries   but will hurt many others     Collectively these circumstances suggest to me that we are still in the process of adjusting   to the globalization in trade that is occurring and that the adjustment process is going to last for   some time  Again, I don’t think I will be surprised to learn that this adjustment process is   altering some of the economic relationships that we have used in the past as guideposts, such as   measures of capacity and its utilization  I think it’s clear that international trade and productivity   patterns have been instrumental in driving down prices of both goods and services, especially   manufactured consumer products  CPI goods prices are still falling and by enough arithmetically   to hold the overall core rate of inflation at a low level  In fact, as we’ve discussed extensively   this morning, inflation rates are somewhat lower than various estimates of expected inflation     As has been reported in the media lately, some Wall Street economists think that we’re   trying to communicate that we want the inflation rate to move up about 100 basis points from   where it is today  Others seem to think that our statements are designed simply to communicate   something about the amount of slack that we see remaining in the economy through the next   year  This confusion leads me to want to be a bit cautious about changing our communications   significantly at this meeting  It reinforces to me, though, that we need to be clear about our   intentions and I am looking forward to our discussions next month, which I hope will help us   communicate more effectively to the public in that regard  Thank you, Mr Chairman     I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman  Brian indicated in his   remarks that one rationale for dropping the “considerable period” language is that one is opposed   to a policy precommitment  I’ve been opposed to the policy precommitment all along, but I   don’t think dropping that sentence at this time conveys that message  I would prefer to do more   work to improve our communications rather than have the markets try to figure out what we’re   attempting to communicate by making a change in that “considerable period” language  I   support your recommendation       Thank you  I also found the work of the working group helpful in   thinking through some of these issues  Like others, I began the exercise thinking that formulaic   language would help the Committee communicate because it would narrow the range of words   we would be using and the markets would become more comfortable with the phrases and then   interpret them in the same way over time  However, as I reviewed the alternatives presented by   the working group and also the concerns listed in the document and the pitfalls noted on page 9   of Vincent’s report today—measurement issues, clarity, and the conditioning assumptions—my   preference became gradual evolution  I favor telling the markets what we did and why we did it    January 27-28, 2004 33 of 238    I don’t think it’s appropriate to signal future policy action  And I strongly support having   explicit language alternatives spelled out in the Bluebook   That said, I have favored for the past several months discontinuing the assessment of   risks portion of the statement  But I didn’t think that was an option  When we were discussing   our communication with the markets, I thought we took off the table the possibility of going   backwards, so to speak, and communicating less  I thought taking something away would not be   an option  So for now my preference is gradual evolution, but depending on how we come out   on the earlier release of the minutes or the role of the projections, discontinuing the risk-  assessment portion of the statement might be a possibility      Thank you  For all the reasons that were listed as pros in Vincent’s   presentation, I was leaning toward supporting early release of the minutes  However, some of   the cons listed on the same page and in Brian Madigan’s memo are more troublesome to me  I   think they also present some greater risks, especially the temptation to send signals and the   ability to make conditional statements—some of the points that President Guynn just made    Also, there’s the issue that President Santomero raised about the ability to work out differences   among Committee members or the Committee and the staff in a timely fashion  Those concerns   cause me to step back and not support early release at this time  I was also going to recommend,   as President Santomero did, that we do some dry runs if the Committee at some point feels   compelled to go in this direction  I think we really do need to have some practice with this   January 27-28, 2004 56 of 238    process to make sure that we are working out all of these issues, especially those that are listed   on the “cons” side  So at this time I’m not willing to support early release of the minutes  I want   to have a better understanding of some of the issues that have been raised     I concur with the Chairman  I don’t think there is anything to be   gained by an enhanced role for FOMC member projections  I, like others, am not in the business   of forecasting  My staff does not prepare projections  I rely on the Greenbook projections as a   starting point  So I’m not in favor of expanding the role of the FOMC projections     Thank you, Mr Chairman  By most measures, economic conditions   in the Fourth District are improving  Households have continued to purchase new and existing   homes, automobiles, and light trucks at a solid pace  Bankers in the District are reporting that   credit quality in their consumer loan portfolios has been very good  A notable development   during the intermeeting period has been the improvement in sentiment regarding capital   spending  Whereas several months ago it was common for me to hear from most CEOs that they   were not going to invest significantly in new equipment for a “considerable period” of time,    [laughter] many business leaders now say that they are willing to do so  This improvement in   attitude seems to be due both to a change in mind and to a change in heart The change in mind   comes from a better capital spending arithmetic  Many CEOs are now convinced that demand   for their products will remain strong  Moreover, corporate earnings have been excellent, and   investors have flocked back to the equity markets The change in heart seems to stem from the   appearance of more stability in the international situation  The paralyzing uncertainty that had   been in place has been replaced by more informed risk-taking  CEOs are beginning to act as   though we are in an expansion, and they are again beginning to make decisions, especially   investment decisions, with more confidence    Nevertheless, the contrast in business attitudes between capital spending and hiring plans   remains striking  My business contacts remain adamant about not expanding worker head counts   except as a last recourse  A CFO from a large national retailer told me that she and the company   president must approve any net addition to employment anywhere in the company  At the same   time, though, while some CEOs express a grudging reluctance to hire, I am beginning to hear   from a number of bankers that they are having difficulty finding qualified workers to hire  We   January 27-28, 2004 145 of 238    are experiencing our own problems in that regard in the District  We are having a difficult time   finding qualified bank examiners to hire and a difficult time in our Cincinnati marketplace trying   to find employees for some expanded check-processing operations that we are doing there  So   labor market patterns are puzzling  The data suggest to me that something unusual is happening   both on the supply side as well as the demand side so it is hard to get a handle, as many others   have said, about the degree of slack in the labor markets  I think the staff’s decision to lower   employment growth in 2004 from its previous projection is a sensible adjustment    What has surprised me most in the District during the past several weeks has been talk   about prices increasing for certain products despite the low inflation rate of which we are all   aware  I don’t want to make much of this  It’s just that I haven’t heard the topic of price   increases mentioned in quite a while  Commodity prices, both energy and non-energy related,   have been increasing for some time  Some manufacturers are now quietly looking for   opportunities to pass on price increases in their products  Steel producers have gone from famine   to feast  They are enjoying a strong global demand after a period of industrial consolidation   With the strengthening in demand, steel prices have been rising sharply and obviously without   the protection of tariffs  Price increases for raw materials and industrial commodities have not   found their way into retail prices in any broad-based way  Indeed, we discussed the looseness of   the relationship between commodity and consumer prices at the last meeting  In addition, I   know that many manufacturers expect that the dollar’s depreciation will provide them with some   leverage in a strengthening global economy even though, again, the empirical evidence of that   happening is questionable  After all, retail price inflation is still slipping rather than rising, but   perhaps the mere fact that there is any discussion about price increases is simply another sign   that business persons have regained their confidence in the outlook     January 27-28, 2004 146 of 238    As I think about the national outlook, I realize that, despite my confidence in the   prospects for the expansion, I have little confidence in forecasts of the future course of inflation    The output gap and our estimates of the natural rate of interest provide us only rough guidelines   in the best of circumstances  Unfortunately, today we have the challenge of trying to decipher   inconsistent evidence regarding labor market tightness, accounting for the possibility that some   of our measured capital stock is obsolete, and attempting to estimate the underlying rate of   growth in structural productivity  My best guess is that we have passed through the point of   concern about unwelcome disinflation and are entering a period where the odds favor greater   inflation stability  Given that, I believe we should proceed with the strategy that you laid out at   our December meeting, Mr Chairman  Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support your recommendation on the   rate and also on the change in language  I welcome the removal of the “considerable period”   reference because, as I said earlier, I would prefer to be silent on any future policy actions that   the Committee might take  In that regard I would also have to agree with the concerns that   January 27-28, 2004 184 of 238    President Moskow and Governors Bies and Olson raised regarding the new language  But I do   support the change at this point     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Economic conditions in the Fourth   District have continued to strengthen since our last meeting  My business contacts are telling me   that their order books are beginning to fill up, and bankers are saying that their commercial loan   portfolio pipelines are also filling up  The business executives that I’ve spoken to since the last   meeting are still finding excellent opportunities to increase productivity, and they are spending   on capital equipment with that goal in mind  As many others who have spoken ahead of me   already said, most of the anecdotal information on capital spending is that businesses are   spending on computers, computer networking equipment, and software  However, I just learned   that a major steel producer is going to restart a basic oxygen furnace and continuous caster   operation in Cleveland to satisfy the growing global demand for steel  And it was only four   March 16, 2004 52 of 107    months ago that the domestic steel producers were lobbying for an extension of steel tariffs    Other business contacts are telling me that it’s no longer possible to scoop up at distressed prices   some of the nearly new machine tool equipment that’s out there  My contacts seem to be saying   that all of the good bargains are now gone   In my discussions with District business executives about their hiring plans, I’m still   hearing a great deal of reluctance to add people to the payrolls  Business managers have become   very adept at expanding output without adding to the workforce; as others have said, firms are   using new technology and are redesigning their business processes  And it’s not just that new   hires add to wage and benefit costs  I’m hearing executives say that, by holding down their head   count, everyone in the company is becoming more creative about ways to increase productivity   Large companies—and increasingly medium-sized companies—are expressing an   interest in and have more and more experience with outsourcing to foreign suppliers  In some   cases they are getting manufactured components from foreign suppliers, but in other cases they   are getting services, such as software development, call centers, back office operations, and even   some research and legal services  I, too, don’t want to make a lot of this or overstate the amount   of activity that is moving offshore, but I am amazed at the number of new instances I keep   hearing about, especially from medium-sized and smaller companies  What this growing volume   suggests to me is that businesses continue to feel intense pressure to rethink their business   operations  I believe that this kind of restructuring we’ve been hearing about is still going on,   and I think it’s going to continue to boost the pace of productivity growth   I reported at our last meeting that several of my business contacts were dealing with   rising prices, and that trend has accelerated  In most instances the price increases continue to be   in commodities, construction materials, and metals  But I’m hearing more reports now that   March 16, 2004 53 of 107    many firms are able to pass some of these price increases on, a point others have mentioned as   well  Even though we know that there has been little effect from these price increases on goods   at the retail level, for the first time I am hearing people say that they are more willing to   contemplate passing on some of these price increases  That suggests to me that this long period   of disinflation we’ve been living through is bottoming out  I know that in an economy where we   think there is still a considerable amount of slack it would be unusual for inflationary pressures   to emerge at this point  However, the rising prices of commodities, energy, housing, and health   care combined with the falling dollar and a very accommodative macro policy have led to a   situation that is beginning to generate some concerns among my directors, and that also worries   me  I do think that monetary policy appears to be on the right course, but I hope that we’re not   confronted with a situation where our preoccupation with weak labor markets leads us to   discount the inflationary signals that may arise  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Mr Chairman, I also can support your recommendation on the   language, given your comment that, if we make a change, the markets are going to view that as   the first step in a sequence and will expect changes at our subsequent meetings  But I do have to   admit that I also have a mild preference for going to a balance of risks on inflation  Again,   though, I can support your recommendation on the language     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Business conditions continued to improve in   the Fourth District  The pace of improvement appears to have accelerated in recent weeks, and the   improvement is rather broad-based across industrial sectors  I’d like to make four general   observations about business conditions in the Fourth District  First, businesses appear to be   accelerating their capital spending plans for this year and next  Second, they continue to identify   opportunities to increase productivity  Third, firms remain very disciplined about their hiring plans   And fourth, the broadly based run-up in raw materials prices that we’ve been seeing, combined with   healthy order books, appears to be affording some companies the opportunity not only to pass along   these price increases but also to finally get some additional pricing leverage  I want to expand a bit   on these four general observations with a little more detailed information from a few companies that   I follow closely   One company produces customized rubber parts that are used in a large number of products   in a variety of industries  Less than six months ago, the CEO of this company was very concerned   about his business  His order book was spotty, and his customers kept pressuring him for price   reductions  He was worried about losing business to Asian producers  In fact, he was so worried   that he finally found an Asian supplier himself rather than produce only from his domestic facility    May 4, 2004 54 of 112       Today, his order book is full, he has a backlog, and he has been able to pass along raw materials   price increases and expand his margins a bit on top of that  The domestic toolmakers that he buys   from suddenly have huge backlogs as well  He is investing in new and sophisticated manufacturing   equipment to continue to improve his productivity and is cautiously adding to his workforce  A   second company that I follow stamps and fabricates sheet metal The CEO of this company reports   that his orders have picked up sharply in the past month and that he, too, is buying new capital   equipment  He is going to establish an operation in China to supply his US customers who are   producing there for the Asian markets—a move that he said is actually strengthening his   relationships with customers in domestic markets as well  This company also is now able to pass   along price increases due to the increased cost of steel and is able to widen its profit margins in the   process  Finally, in the course of our Beige Book calls, a number of specialty retailers and   department store contacts indicated that they were, for the first time, having some success with   scaling back the price discounts that they’ve been giving     I believe these companies and their stories represent a growing number of firms in my   District and they reflect the strengthening in business conditions that is taking place  I have little   doubt that the business cycle is swinging decisively into a new phase  I expect that, as this new   phase takes hold, we will see many more markets, including labor markets, firm up because of the   increases in demand  A natural element of this business-cycle process should also include, in due   course, a rise in the equilibrium real rate of interest   I see an apparent inconsistency between estimates of resource slack and stories of reviving   pricing power and the higher-than-expected inflation report  Among the people that I talk with in   the District and in some of the financial press, stories about the return of pricing power have   replaced stories about the jobless recovery  I believe that the risks on inflation are balanced  As   May 4, 2004 55 of 112       President Moskow noted earlier, inflation expectations are relatively stable partly because of our   credibility  So indicating that we will begin to unwind our policy accommodation will be necessary   to anchor inflation expectations  And if the data continue to indicate strong economic performance   and inflation that is higher than expected, I would like us to have the flexibility to react   appropriately  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Mr Chairman, I also support your recommendation  I have to admit   that, when I first read the “measured pace” language in the Bluebook, I was concerned that it would   be interpreted by markets as indicating that we had a predetermined path for moving rates up and   that we would be doing it based on a time schedule rather than reacting to information about the   economy  And as I said earlier, I was leaning toward wanting the flexibility to react more quickly if   the data continue to come in stronger, especially the inflation numbers  I think the new language   that Vincent proposed, “is likely to be measured,” does give us the added flexibility  So I support   your recommendation     I want to follow up on what you just said, David  You mentioned that   less slack wasn’t the major contributor to the bulk of the rise in inflation, but you didn’t comment   on exactly how much your estimate for slack has changed  Can you tell us how much you reduced   that estimate from the time of the May Greenbook?  You made a few remarks about that, but is that   the sole explanation for the change in the fed funds rate path from the May Greenbook to the current   Greenbook?  There is a significant change in that path  Is it all a reflection of the change in that   estimate for slack?     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Business conditions in the Fourth District   began to improve noticeably just before our last meeting in May, and the outlook remains somewhat   positive  After a long period of relative quiet, my business contacts are now busy adjusting to   higher sales volumes  They are installing new capital equipment and reorganizing business   processes  They are also coping with the volatile pricing environment and, in a few cases, are   beginning to add to payroll  So most people in the Fourth District are expecting a solid year  I   don’t really see much evidence that the pace of economic activity is poised to accelerate further as   we head into the second half of this year  So the Greenbook projection for real GDP growth in the   4½ to 5 percent range this year, with the pace slowing somewhat next year, seems consistent with   what I hear from my business contacts in the District   CEOs remain disciplined about adding to their payrolls  They are not allowing the stronger   demand for their products to shift their focus away from improving productivity  I hear consistent   stories from business persons, whether they’re from large companies or small companies, that they   continue to see opportunities to add to their productivity gains today and into the future  Many of   the company executives that I speak with are talking more and more about “lean” manufacturing    They are using these lean manufacturing strategies to significantly increase the through-put in their   facilities by taking unproductive steps out of the production process  And the end results include   greater flexibility in their scheduling and enhanced customization of their products for their   customers  They find that they are holding smaller inventories and that their customers need to hold   June 29-30, 2004 102 of 203          smaller inventories, and they are able to produce more volume with almost no additional employees    In some cases, after companies “lean out” the factory floor, they move on to lean out their back   office operations  So I’ve seen, at least in the manufacturing sector, continued growth in   productivity   The CEO of a very large global producer of pneumatic and hydraulic equipment told me   that his company’s productivity has been increasing at 10 percent annual rates recently and that he   sees that continuing for the next several years  I know that might be an extreme case, but I’m   hearing that kind of story from lots of CEOs I talk to, again because of their use of some of these   lean manufacturing techniques  So I will not be surprised to see the elevated levels of productivity   that we have been witnessing in the manufacturing sector continue for a while  Now, on the one   hand, the strong productivity growth has enabled firms to keep their unit labor costs lower than   otherwise, and that, they say, has enabled them to limit price increases  On the other hand,   economies do tend to display a close correspondence over time between the rate of productivity   growth and the rate of return on capital and the equilibrium real rate of interest  Consequently, and   especially since we’ve been talking about the low rate of domestic saving in the United States, as I   look ahead I do expect to see forces at work that are consistent with a rise in the equilibrium real   rate of interest  I’m less confident about the magnitude and timing of that rise than I am about the   general direction   At our last meeting, I expressed some concerns about the significant increases in commodity   prices and the message that I was getting from CEOs that they had more pricing power  I was   becoming concerned that those were the first signs of a fundamental change in the inflation process    So I spent a great deal of time during this intermeeting period talking with business leaders about   this issue  The result of my conversations is that I am not seeing strong evidence that the recent   June 29-30, 2004 103 of 203          upsurge in commodity and consumer prices is foreshadowing a buildup in inflationary pressures    My business contacts report that, while many of the recent commodity price increases will stick,   others will not  Energy prices have come back down from their highs, as have some other   commodity prices  In some cases the raw materials price increases can be passed along the supply   chain, but a lot of my contacts still say that others cannot  And unit labor costs have not been rising    So, in general, business persons do not talk as though they are expecting any worsening in the   inflation climate from where we are today   I think there are good reasons to expect that we can keep the trend core PCE in a range close   to1½ percent for the next several years, if we get monetary policy back toward neutral within a   reasonable period of time  At the moment, I think the inflation risks facing us have shifted from a   balanced position toward an environment in which inflation could gradually creep up over time if   we aren’t vigilant  But I will feel less anxious about this imbalance of risks if we move the fed   funds rate up today and continue to do so for a while, at a pace in tandem with the expansion and   consistent with getting policy back toward neutral  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The pace of economic activity in the Fourth   District, although sound, has been slower this summer than in late winter and early spring  My   conversations with business persons throughout the District have reinforced my view that the region   is still poised for solid economic growth for the remainder of this year, although at a pace somewhat   slower than I had expected in the spring  During the past few months, I had thought that current   economic conditions in my District were lagging those in the rest of the country  However, national   economic statistics and the Beige Book reports indicate that the recent slowdown is more broadly   based than I had thought  Going into our June meeting, the business people I talked to were   expressing a growing sense of confidence in the economy, and at that point I thought that was   helping to dispel some of the lingering caution about restraining capital investment and hiring plans    But those expressions of confidence have dissipated somewhat, and this change in attitude came   before the July employment report     The balance of comments from the people I talk to has shifted from enthusiasm to renewed   concerns about the pace of the expansion  And this shift in attitude is not confined to those   businesses that are under stress  I had a conversation with an executive from a global   manufacturing company, whose growth in orders is matching the peak levels of the late 1990s  But   despite his strong order book, even this individual confided that this pace of business would not last    When I pressed him about the reasons he was saying that, he couldn’t cite any specific reasons  He   just had a gut feeling that it could not last    So this return of greater caution about the outlook is reinforcing the desire on the part of   firms to expand production and to meet the growing orders via productivity gains  And as I have   been reporting for some time, companies indicate that they intend to remain disciplined about their   hiring  Wage pressures don’t appear to be restraining the hiring, but high and rising health care   August 10, 2004 27 of 103          costs are  I’ve been accustomed to hearing complaints about the rise in health care costs whenever   inflation is mentioned, but lately business persons have raised this issue in the context of their hiring   strategies; from their perspective, labor is becoming more expensive  And companies that have   already enjoyed significant productivity gains continue to assert that there are plenty of   opportunities to become even more efficient  That might be a factor in the weak demand for labor   that we are seeing in the data   I find the inflation picture somewhat complicated  When we talk about inflation as the   twelve-month change in the market-based core PCE price index, we’re many steps removed from   the experiences that most people have in their local grocery stores and at the gas pumps  Even my   directors, who have become accustomed to talking about the nuances of inflation measurement,   have been very concerned about the steady stream of big headline CPI numbers this year  They   point out that people might begin to lose their patience with the idea that these large increases are   transitory  Furthermore, a number of my directors and other District contacts tell me that some of   the previous spikes in commodity and energy prices have not been fully priced into final goods    Some of my contacts in the manufacturing sector say that they still have contracts, especially with   steel producers; but those contracts will be expiring in the fall, so we might see some additional   pass-through later on this year   Fortunately, despite these reports, I have not been hearing anything that would lead me to   believe that substantial inflationary pressures are building across a wide range of final goods prices    It still seems to me that the Greenbook inflation projection is the most likely outcome  Headline   inflation rates should start to moderate in the next several quarters, but I do see some risks in the   inflation outlook  Over the course of this year, I have thought that dominant forces in the economy   were producing a higher equilibrium real rate of interest and that monetary policy needed to adjust   August 10, 2004 28 of 103          to that situation in a timely fashion  I still believe that this is so and that we should continue to   move the fed funds rate toward a more neutral stance  At the same time, I was concerned at our last   meeting that we might be falling behind the curve  But after listening to the growing caution that I   am hearing from my business contacts and after last Friday’s employment report, I’m wondering   whether the economy hasn’t shifted to a somewhat slower growth track than I expected six weeks   ago  If that is the case, then today’s fed funds rate would be closer to neutral as well  I do not think,   however, that it is so much closer that I would not want to move today  Recent developments   obviously highlight the difficulties that we face in communicating our future actions, and I’d like to   have maximum flexibility with respect to policy going forward  I would want the flexibility to   gauge the timing of future actions as economic circumstances warrant  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I also support your recommendation for a   25 basis point increase in the fed funds rate target  And along with others I, too, like this version of   the language better than the original  I also like the fact that we’re not introducing a lot of change to   August 10, 2004 87 of 103          the language since every word we change is scrutinized in the market  So I am comfortable with   this proposal     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The tone of the reports that I’m getting   from my business contacts in the Fourth District is positive, but it’s hardly reminiscent of the   reports of robust growth that I was hearing earlier this year  Still, both order books and profits   are reported to be fairly strong  Business leaders across a broad array of industries tell me that   they expect to see steady sales growth through the end of 2004   Despite these positive reports, business confidence remains less upbeat than order books   and profits would appear to warrant  My contacts still say that, if the economy continues to   grow and stays on its present course, they will persevere in their search for more productivity   improvements rather than hire additional workers, at least for the foreseeable future  And this is   perhaps still the most remarkable aspect of this expansion—the ability of businesses to continue   to squeeze out more production with the same number of workers  It can’t persist, of course, but   I’m beginning to wonder how long I’m going to keep saying that   At a recent joint meeting of our boards from the three offices in the District, the directors   made several observations about energy prices  Although most directors expect energy prices to   retreat somewhat from their current high levels, they are basing their future business plans on   energy prices that they expect will be higher than those of a year or two ago  In response to   energy prices, though, several of our directors were commenting that they are adjusting—or at   least trying through innovation to adjust—the composition of the products that they’re   producing They’re using innovations to develop products that are less energy-dependent   September 21, 2004 47 of 100          The Fourth District economy, like the nation’s, seems to have a lot going for it except   considerable employment growth  The incoming data, though, suggest to me that the risks we   face remain balanced and may actually have narrowed a bit in their scope since the summer  By   that I mean that the prospects for either a resumption of the exceptionally strong business   expansion that we saw in the winter and spring or a slipping back to a tractionless recovery—  both of which seemed possible in the summer—look considerably more remote to me this time    Similarly, the extreme inflation or disinflation outcomes seem to me less likely as well  In   summary, I believe the economy is expanding at a sustainable rate, and I think we should   continue with our plan to gradually remove our policy accommodation  Thank you, Mr   Chairman     I support your recommendation     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Ohio may have decided the country’s   presidential election last week, but it doesn’t seem to be determining the economy’s direction  I’m   afraid I’m going to be a bit of an outlier in my report on economic conditions  Ohio was the   battleground state, and it may be that businesses and people in Ohio are just weary from this long   election cycle  [Laughter]  But as was evidenced in the Beige Book, Fourth District conditions   seemed to be less buoyant than those in the rest of the country  Businesspeople I talked to around our   District are reporting only modest growth in production and sales  And in fact, I’m seeing a growing   dichotomy in what my business contacts tell me, based on where they sell their goods and services    Those who sell only locally tend to be somewhat pessimistic about business conditions, whereas   those who sell nationally and internationally express more optimism   My local business contacts gave me very little reason to anticipate the strength that we saw in   the October employment report  Now, the report could be just another bad exit poll  [Laughter]  But   our District clearly is going through an industrial realignment that may not be indicative of   November 10, 2004 46 of 107    developments in the nation as a whole  Notwithstanding the strong overall October employment   report, manufacturing shed another 5,000 jobs in October following a decline of 14,000 jobs in   September  And Ohio’s employment remains 4 percent lower than it was at the peak of the last   business cycle, while nationally employment is up only 1 percent  The October employment report   does square with the fact that we are seeing an improving national picture, but the experience of this   past spring makes me leery of allowing one month’s data on employment to unduly influence my   thinking about the labor markets  I still hear from most of my business contacts, regardless of where   they do business, that they expect to meet rising demand without adding substantially to their   payrolls  From these comments, I expect that productivity could be higher than in the staff’s baseline   forecast, perhaps more in line with the higher productivity scenario shown in the Greenbook   Businesspeople also continue to report cost pressures, obviously from oil prices but also   from higher prices on a wide range of nonpetroleum materials  I have yet to see any convincing   evidence, though, that these cost pressures have become a part of generalized inflation  Retail   prices and wage growth remain subdued, and inflation expectations seem to be holding steady    This is in part because my business contacts, unlike those of President Moskow, say that they still   find it very difficult to pass on these price increases to their customers, especially to customers that   produce finished goods  Consequently, they are still busy altering their production processes to   substitute away from some of these more expensive commodities, if possible  One of my directors,   a very large international producer of vinyl siding and decking materials, stated that her capital   investments are all directed at raw material substitution   Taking all of this into consideration, it seems to me that our monetary policy stance is about   right at the moment, presuming an action today  My view on the appropriate policy in the future,   though, will be strongly influenced by the incoming data on economic activity  I also want to have   November 10, 2004 47 of 107    the necessary flexibility to adjust policy as economic developments unfold  Thank you, Mr   Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I also am in strong agreement with your   recommendations both to increase the fed funds rate and on the statement  My thinking on how we   would remove our accommodation has evolved over the past few months, along the line that   November 10, 2004 88 of 107    President Poole has already articulated, and I’m just not certain when a pause may be necessary  So   I am supportive of language that gives us that flexibility  And I was encouraged by Vincent’s   comments that some market participants do think that the current language gives us that flexibility    So I’m in support of your recommendations     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I want to start my comments this morning   with a somewhat troubling statistic, and that is that the PNC Bank’s Twelve Days of Christmas   price index jumped 24 percent  It has been reported that a surge in French hen prices more than   offset a modest drop in the cost of turtle doves  [Laughter]  If you look at their core index, which   I’m told excludes the highly volatile swans-a-swimming component, that index was actually up   31 percent from a year ago  [Laughter]   With that, I’ll turn to my District report  In my report at our last meeting, I noted that   business activity in the Fourth District did not seem representative of what we’ve been hearing at   the national level  And judging by the most recent Beige Book, my region still seems to be more   economically challenged than the rest of the nation  During the intermeeting period, I spent a   significant amount of time talking to members of the business community  And from my   conversations, I sense a continued disconnect between the strong growth reports that I’m getting,   especially from the larger international manufacturers, and the continued soggy performance of our   District’s labor markets  Companies report that a lot of growth in orders and production is taking   December 14, 2004 32 of 118           place  It just isn’t always being met with much job growth, and indeed, the activity itself isn’t   always occurring in the Fourth District  Firms that report ample capacity are seeing some squeeze   in profit margins as they are able only to partially pass along some of their rising costs to customers    Others have been able to maintain their profits by finding yet more ways to absorb the cost   pressures through productivity enhancements  And some businesses that are feeling capacity   constraints, including the steel producers and the capital goods makers, say they are actually   successfully passing cost pressures up the production lines   But where I might ordinarily hear that these firms that are at capacity are gearing up to   expand their local production capabilities, what I’m now commonly hearing are stories that these   firms are choosing instead to expand their production capacity abroad, especially in Southeast Asia   and China  One interpretation of this information is that some industries are still in the midst of a   rather wrenching and likely protracted structural change, and the Fourth District is as close to   ground zero in that transformation as one can get  It may take a long time yet before we see   sustained significant employment gains in our area  And while this global realignment is under   way, I think it might be more challenging than usual to accurately judge capacity utilization and   inflationary break points   If I’ve been following the past several Greenbooks correctly, the staff has had to put more   monetary restraint into its projections to hold the inflation rate steady, because over the next two   years it now seems that aggregate demand is growing somewhat faster and cyclical productivity is   growing somewhat slower than previously  I found the alternative scenarios about productivity   growth and cost pass-throughs to be very informative as I thought about the risks to the outlook    Each of these variables, of course, is very difficult to predict  I am more optimistic than the baseline   Greenbook projections about productivity because of the comments I’ve been hearing from my   December 14, 2004 33 of 118           business contacts  But I am also hearing from my business contacts that they are having greater   success in passing costs along to their customers  These forces, of course, have offsetting   implications for the inflation outlook, and they do bear close scrutiny in the months ahead   We have been removing our policy accommodation at a gradual and steady pace  As we’ve   done so, I have become more satisfied about the balance of risks to our goals  Clearly, there are   uncertainties about how the economic situation is evolving, and my preference in this environment   is to avoid the risk of unexpected increases in inflation  I am fairly confident that the economy is   going to continue to expand at a pace that’s consistent with a rising equilibrium real rate over time,   and I think it’s a good idea for people to expect that environment until we see strong evidence to the   contrary  So I think that today we should take the steps that the market anticipates, and I would also   make as few changes as possible to our statement  Thank you, Mr Chairman     I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman     Like President Minehan, I thought the experiment on early release of the   minutes was motivated by the struggle that we were having in capturing the full sense of the   Committee in the few words that are allowed in the press statement  I also have been uncomfortable   with the code words that we’ve been using in that press statement  And those code words have   proven awkward to remove without sending unintended signals to the markets  So I still prefer a   shorter post-meeting statement with the early release of the minutes    I also agree with President Minehan—especially after reading Vincent’s list of untested   aspects of the experiment—that we’ve been conducting it in the best of times  That led me to come   to this meeting in favor of what Cathy referred to as the middle-of-the-road ground  Let’s extend   the experiment through circumstances that might not be considered the best of times  I know that   this is an unpopular position, but I thought we were going to continue to perfect our communication   strategy and that this would all be one package  I can see, however, in listening to my colleagues,   that I’m in a minority in that view  Nevertheless, I did want to take a more middle-of-the-road   approach and continue to improve our communications     Okay  Yes         December 14, 2004 98 of 118            Thank you, Mr Chairman  I would also like to start by thanking the staff   for the great material on this subject; I found it very helpful  And I’d like to be on record as stating   that I do regard price stability as the most important contribution that we can make to the nation’s   long-term economic welfare  I also believe the FOMC has done a remarkable job over the past 20   years in achieving and then maintaining price stability  Nevertheless, I think there are some   modifications to our current practices that are worth considering  In my view, being more   numerically explicit about our inflation objective can help us to be successful in maintaining price   stability I don’t regard an explicit numerical price objective as a panacea, but I think it could help   us We might gain some additional credibility with the public by simply being clearer than we are   today After all, what is reported in the press is that the public already most likely believes that a           February 1-2, 2005 40 of 177  majority of us have something like a 1 to 3 percent CPI range in mind  But some people might   suspect that we are intentionally trying to create some wiggle room so that we can avoid   accountability So, greater clarity, I think, would enable us to project a more credible image, and it   might engender some extra self-discipline when we really need it   More importantly, I think that being more explicit will give us a greater capacity to   communicate both internally as well as externally  By that, I mean that now I sometimes can’t tell   whether I’m differing with another participant’s position because we have different price projections   or because we have different price objectives So, I think it would be constructive for us to be a little   more explicit with one another about each of these factors   My price stability objective is for price expectations to be consistent with the PCE index   increasing at an average rate of 1½ percent per year, which I expect to achieve by having the PCE   index itself increasing at that average rate over periods of five to ten years  Now, I’m stating my   definition in terms of PCE because we’ve gravitated to that measure in this Committee, but I don’t   have a strong preference for it over the CPI Either would be fine with me  If we were to use the   CPI, though, I would have my objective in the 2 percent range   Since inflation is certain to vary around any single numerical objective in the short run, even   when we achieve the average objective over time, I think putting a range around the objective can   indicate a kind of tolerance zone My tolerance zone is a 1 percentage point spread above and below   my 1½ percent PCE inflation objective  I don’t view this necessarily as a boundary triggering policy   action; but when inflation falls outside of that range, I think some extra public communication about   the situation would be helpful   Turning to the question of what role the price objective should play in the Committee’s   policy process, I’m open to considering the idea of a Committee objective and range, as described in   Vincent’s alternative 2, although I don’t think it’s necessary to jump to such a position in one leap    In fact, I think it would be more prudent to take a small step in that direction and gain some   experience I think we would gain a lot by modifying our semiannual economic projections, as laid           February 1-2, 2005 41 of 177  out in Vincent’s alternative 3 More specifically, I like the idea of individually submitting   projections for each of the next two years, as we did for this meeting, plus an additional set of   projections for the average of the next three to five years These projections, as Don Kohn   mentioned, would be based on each participant’s working definition of price stability and the   policies that support it The ranges and the central tendencies of these projections would become   public, perhaps in the context of an expanded discussion of them in the Monetary Policy Report    And then policy actions could be explained in the context of these more explicit objectives  I   wouldn’t be surprised to discover that our three- to five-year inflation projections converge to a   fairly narrow range Moreover, this adjustment to our current practice would be embedded in a   process that’s already quite familiar to the public and shouldn’t be regarded as radical  Importantly,   I think this modification to our current practice would be perfectly consistent with the congressional   mandate under which we operate today  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  My District report will balance out President   Guynn’s report, because economic conditions in the Fourth District have not changed very much   since December  As suggested by our Beige Book report, it appears that our region’s economy is   still not advancing at quite the pace as the rest of the country   That said, most of my business contacts are cautiously optimistic that the country’s economy   will see solid growth in 2005 In what might be a good sign for job creation, for the first time since   I’ve been in this job I’m hearing less emphasis on productivity gains as an explanation for limited   hiring I am finally hearing some mention of staff additions, although they are focused in particular   industries and are not widespread These comments are consistent with GDP expansion in the 3½ to   4 percent range, modest gains in employment, and relatively robust capital spending, as   contemplated in the Greenbook baseline projection   My directors and my other business contacts continue to comment on high input prices,   especially prices of raw materials, and they comment on the desirability, or even necessity, of   maintaining their margins  They seem to be having success in passing on some of the price                    February 1-2, 2005 96 of 177  increases to their customers, although it remains difficult to quantify how much of this talk is feeding   into retail prices Nonetheless, from my perspective, the flat markup scenario that is reported in the   Greenbook is a very important risk, even though I do believe that the baseline projection is the more   likely scenario   We’ve just ended a year in which the realized rate of headline inflation was higher than I   think is acceptable going forward Of course, as has been mentioned, there were special pressures   from the energy sector that contributed to that, and I share the opinion that those problems are   probably behind us And I am heartened that we have managed to emerge from the year without   deterioration in the private sector’s inflation expectations  Nonetheless, when asked what will turn   out to be the biggest economic surprise in 2005, the Blue Chip forecasters put higher-than-expected   inflation at the top of their list    I’d like to be sure that we don’t contribute to a continuation of last year’s price level   performance by unintentionally setting the fed funds rate at a level that’s too low  I do like the fact   that we’ve been able to remove our accommodation at a measured pace in moving the fed funds rate   back toward a more comfortable zone  If we stop short in adjusting the fed funds rate now, we could   find ourselves losing the ability to continue with the moderate steps that we’ve had the luxury of   implementing so far  Over the past few months, many of us have noted that what we ultimately   want is to move the fed funds rate somewhere back to a neutral neighborhood  Given the   imprecision of this neutral concept, it’s a pretty big neighborhood, and I’d prefer not to be at the   lower end of that range Thank you, Mr Chairman    I support the recommendation    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Conditions in the Fourth District have been   gradually improving across a broad range of industries this year, and business confidence appears to   be strengthening as well Actually, it feels good to no longer be a Beige Book outlier [Laughter]   As it turns out, I am also not a Greenbook outlier  I find myself in broad agreement with the staff’s   baseline projection I know I should feel comfortable being in such good company, but I view the   projection as the result of competing risks  Both the Greenbook and my business contacts are   bringing to my attention the positives associated with productivity growth and the negatives   associated with price increases   Although the rate of structural productivity growth might slow somewhat over the next few   years, in my view the decline in the Greenbook multifactor productivity projections seems a little   steep The productivity growth surprises of the last couple of years may persist a bit longer    Business executives that I talk to tell me that they are still very focused on looking for opportunities   to enhance productivity and that their capital investments are designed to achieve that goal  The   drive for efficiency has become even more pronounced for those companies that are grappling with   large increases in energy prices and in the prices of other raw materials  And, of course, many   companies continue to experience large increases in medical care costs, adding to the incentives to   wring out labor costs and other costs   The prospect that productivity growth may exceed the Greenbook baseline gives me some   optimism about the inflation outlook at a time when the headline inflation numbers keep escalating   Yet the factors driving the price level up do not seem to be going away  Energy prices, as we’ve   commented, have ratcheted up again  And, as multiyear contracts with energy suppliers roll off,   many companies continue to face increases in the prices they have to pay  The same situation exists,   although to a lesser degree, with retail pricing pressures induced by higher prices of raw materials                          March 22, 2005 37 of 116  and also intermediate products  In addition to these factors, there is also the possibility that past   dollar depreciation could show up in the form of higher prices of both imported and domestic   products   The anecdotal information that I have been receiving about pricing has taken on a different   tone from last year  Last year, retailers like Wal-Mart and Home Depot would not accept price   increases from their suppliers  But the dam seems to be showing some cracks  Recently, I heard   from the CEO of a global company that supplies the big-box retailers with adhesive products, such   as duct tape He told me that during a recent meeting with Wal-Mart he explained that he was   requesting a price increase He was told that they weren’t accepting any price increases and that   they would go to his competitors  Three days later he received a call from Wal-Mart saying that   they were going to purchase these supplies from him at the price increases he requested because his   competitors had also asked for a price increase     Also, a large manufacturer of capital equipment who supplies the adhesive industries, among   others, told me that he can get price increases for his equipment even though his costs are not rising   that dramatically  But because the businesses he is supplying are able to pass on price increases,   they are willing to take a price increase from him  So it seems that, at least in this industry, it’s more   than the adhesives themselves that are beginning to stick  [Laughter]   All things considered, I do think that the pricing environment over the next year or so will be   very challenging for companies  I see some evidence that price pressures have been building, yet, if   businesses are successful in maintaining strong productivity growth, these pressures might be held in   check The Greenbook illustrates the tension between these two factors and, as I said, I can find   myself being either hopeful or worried                                    March 22, 2005 38 of 116  I think our strategy of gradually removing our policy accommodation has convinced the   public that we are determined to keep inflation in check over the long term  It will be important for   us to earn that same degree of confidence as we go forward and as resources in the economy become   more intensely utilized  Although I’m concerned that the possibility of inflation creep over the next   year is there, the risks still seem balanced to me as long as we continue to remove our policy   accommodation at a measured pace and do so for the foreseeable future  Thank you, Mr Chairman    I also support the recommendation for a 25 basis point increase in the   funds rate I was concerned, when I first read on Friday the language in paragraph 5 in alternative B,   that it would be confusing The discussion today helped me to understand the meaning behind the   language, and I hope that we’ll be able, through our minutes, to explain that to the markets, also I   understand that there will a three-week lag, and we’ll see what happens in these three weeks   I’m also in the camp that believes the balance-of-risk language has been useful, but I think it   has served its purpose and it’s time to look at a different approach  As we’ve noted today, we should   be able to rely on the minutes to communicate more fully, and I think the experience of early release   of this next set of minutes will help us to see if that is true  I would prefer to keep our statement on   the shorter side—and less forward-looking—and rely more on the minutes to communicate    Thank you, Mr Chairman  At our last meeting I said that I was happy to   report that the Fourth District was no longer an outlier in the Beige Book and that economic activity   in the region appeared to be gradually improving  But that warm glow appears to have been short-  lived Since our last meeting, economic activity in my District has shifted down somewhat,   conforming to what we now see in the national economy   In both the Beige Book process and my conversations with business contacts, I’ve been   especially keen to elicit information about pricing pressures and the reemergence of pricing power    The tone regarding pricing power also appears to have softened  Although I still hear that there’s an   ability to pass through some higher raw material costs, the majority of my contacts are once again   reporting that it is difficult to pass on price increases   My instinct is to be concerned about the possibility of further inflation creep over the year   After all, most of the inflation surprises have been on the upside for quite a while now  But from my   perspective, the issue that we confront is whether to regard the inflation situation as unfortunate but   transitory, or unfortunate and persistent   The Greenbook projection treats energy shocks like rocks thrown into a pond The energy   shock creates a ripple that dissipates over time  The price statistics throughout last year behaved   accordingly When that rock or energy shock entered the pond in 2003, the core rate of inflation   initially spiked up but then declined throughout much of the year  Energy markets threw another   stone into that inflation pond last year Without those energy shocks, my guess is that the   Greenbook inflation projections for this year would have held up nicely; and I think the current   projections are sensible, barring any more ugly supply shocks  That is, I think it is reasonable to   expect that core inflation once again will drift back down—in the absence of more rocks entering   this pond There is little evidence that unit labor costs are accelerating or that prices not affected by                                 May 3, 2005 46 of 116  energy are problematic  So this gives me some comfort with the Greenbook baseline inflation   projection But I recognize that inflation dynamics could deliver more persistence than that   Throughout this policy tightening cycle, I’ve been focused on getting the fed funds rate back   into the neutral range When the pace of economic activity appeared to be more robust, I preferred   to be in the higher end of that range However, the incoming data have made me less certain about   aiming that high  And it is possible that the equilibrium real rate of interest could be either notably   higher or lower by the time of our June meeting   For now, I still think that a sequence of small incremental increases in the fed funds rate is   the most likely course of action in the immediate future  Nonetheless, greater uncertainty about the   outlook for economic activity and inflation does change my view about how policy decisions ought   to be communicated  In my view, the “measured pace” language we’ve been using has served us   well But I think this type of guidance should be reserved for those periods of time when the   Committee feels especially confident about what the next few policy actions will be and has reason   to believe that its intentions would be misunderstood without that kind of guidance  I do not think   that these conditions are present today For that reason, I do favor removing the “measured pace”   language If the statement were reflecting my own thoughts, I would also insert some words that   convey a greater sense of uncertainty about the outlook for real growth and inflation and, therefore,   more uncertainty about the timing and magnitude of future policy actions  Thank you, Mr   Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I also support your recommendation for a 25   basis point increase in the fed funds rate target, and I will also take your guidance on the language                                 May 3, 2005 98 of 116  As I said earlier, though, I had a preference for expressing more uncertainty about not only the   outlook on inflation but also the timing and magnitude of our future moves  But given what you said   earlier, I will support your recommendation    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Business activity in the Fourth District has   not changed very much during the intermeeting period  Business conditions in the region are okay,   but not great  Many of the business contacts I talked to report that their business is better in other   parts of the country than in our District   Recent credit downgrades of debt issued by GM, Ford, and some of their suppliers have   received a lot of attention in the District  Longer term, companies in the automobile supply chain   are bracing for consolidation, as Ford, Daimler-Chrysler, and GM grapple with their cost structures   My District, though, has a number of Honda and Toyota plants and suppliers to those plants  So the   longer-term adjustments in the District are not likely to be quite as severe as in other parts of the   Midwest  Nevertheless, the Fourth District companies that sell to the automobile supply chain are   not optimistic about the sales and profitability outlook for that sector  One banker I talked to   confirmed that his customers in the automotive supply chain have become very cautious about their   investment spending recently     At the time of our last meeting, my greatest concern was that the pace of real economic   activity might slow and that the pace of core inflation might pick up  As it turns out, economic                                      June 29-30, 2005 129 of 234  growth has held up fairly well and inflation has held fairly steady  Nevertheless, I’m not feeling any   more confident or certain about the outlook—especially the outlook for inflation—than I was in   May   I approached this meeting thinking about inflation in the same way that David Wilcox did in   his presentation  The Greenbook baseline projection for core PCE is close to 2 percent for nearly all   of this year and next year and only very slowly returns to my preferred rate of 1½ percent  And I   find this long time frame to be discouraging  Even more discouraging is the prospect that inflation   could very well turn out to be greater than that baseline projection   As David pointed out in his exhibit 6, in early 2004 the Greenbook baseline projection   called for core PCE to increase over the four quarters of 2005 at a rate of 1 percent  By the end of   last year, that was moved up to 1½ percent  Then over the past six months of this year it has been   moved up another ½ percentage point to 2 percent  I’m not repeating these numbers to cast   aspersions on the staff projections because, after all, when they were made I thought those were   very reasonable projections and I agreed with them  As a group, we reported to Congress in   February that our central tendency projection for core PCE was 1½ percent to 1¾ percent this year   and the same for next year  And, as Steve pointed out this morning, in our preliminary numbers, the   projection for core PCE has been moved up to 1¾ to 2 percent for this year and next    I know that I have consistently underestimated inflation  And now we’re facing oil prices of   close to $60 per barrel and there is a risk, I believe, that unit labor costs could trend up  Assuming   that the real side of the economy does hold up, the potential inflationary consequences of these   developments give me second thoughts about pausing too soon in our removal of policy   accommodation  But I’ll hold my comments on policy for later on in the meeting  Thank you, Mr   Chairman                               June 29-30, 2005 130 of 234   I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman                                                      June 29-30, 2005 170 of 234   Thank you, Mr Chairman  As I talk to my business contacts in the   Fourth District, I’m struck by the lack of any specific concerns about the near-term economic   outlook The business community appears to be optimistic about the remainder of this year—   they see diminishing inflation concerns and a brightening growth outlook   The price statistics reported during the intermeeting period were better than I expected   them to be  I hear from businesspeople I talk with that steel and raw material prices remained   soft; moreover, the Big Three auto producers have reduced prices to sell more vehicles  These   price cuts might take some pressures off of inflation as well  Based on the comments of my   business contacts and my reading of the details of the price statistics, I don’t see that inflationary   pressures are intensifying further   Like President Stern, I don’t believe that the near-term inflation outlook has changed as   much as the inflation revisions between the June and August Greenbook might imply  The   inflation environment that I just described seems to be more in line with the baseline forecast in   the June Greenbook than that in the August Greenbook  However, for reasons that David has   already explained, the staff believes that there is somewhat more inflation pressure in the   economy today than they saw a month ago  Consequently, they think that the policy path now   needs to follow a steeper trajectory than the one assumed last month in order to nudge inflation   back down gradually over time   Now, I have to confess that I’d rather be making policy based on the world depicted in   the June Greenbook than the world in the August Greenbook  And I don’t want to come across   as complacent about inflation  As I stated at our last meeting, the inflation rate is already   running at the high end of my comfort zone  I also find myself concerned that the heavily   advertised unwinding of energy shocks has not arrived  And as pointed out in the Greenbook,                         August 9, 2005 57 of 110  the inflation outlook appears to be requiring more policy restraint  The fed funds path in the   August Greenbook might prove to be too steep if inflation pressures unwind faster than the   baseline projection contemplates  But it also might prove to be too flat if those pressures don’t   unwind at all   I don’t relish the prospect of having to add an additional 50 basis points to the funds rate   path projected in the June Greenbook and not get much of a reduction in the inflation rate as a   result of that Since the funds rate paths in the June and August Greenbooks don’t part company   until the November meeting, I’m hopeful that we’ll have a better read on the inflation situation   by then For today I’m comfortable with the path that we’re on, and I don’t see a need to diverge   from that path today  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation  And given the   comment that you just made about the less we change the statement the better, I do like President   Poole’s recommendation about the order of the wording in section 4 because that is a little more   like our previous statement on inflation  Also, given our comments around this table that   inflation today is near the high end of where we’d like it to be, I don’t want that first statement                   August 9, 2005 90 of 110  about core inflation being relatively low to be misinterpreted as meaning that the current level of   inflation is well within our comfort zone  I understand that it’s hard to fine-tune this statement at   this table, so I am comfortable with the language, but I do like President Poole’s ordering of   section 4    Thank you, Mr Chairman  The contours of the economic effects of   Hurricane Katrina that are laid out in the Greenbook baseline look about right to me  But in the   aftermath of the hurricane, and with the fragility in the energy markets, I found myself focusing   more on the alternative scenarios in the Greenbook  In the conversations that I’ve had with my                      September 20, 2005 71 of 117  business contacts, they appear to have more anxiety about future prospects than about the present   circumstances  My business contacts who have retail stores, warehouses, and production   facilities in the Gulf region all seem to have a good handle on the direct impacts of the storm,   and for the most part they say that their losses are manageable  But they emphasize that the   indirect effects of the storm, driven primarily by increases in costs of energy and building   materials prices, will be difficult to discern for many months     Of particular concern to many of my directors is the reaction of consumers to the expense   of filling their gas tanks and heating their homes during the winter  My directors report that they   are already witnessing some retrenchment in consumer spending, and they don’t know how   much of this is just a temporary reaction or how much of it is a preview of more adjustments to   come   The preliminary release of the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment survey   illustrates this concern, and I think the Greenbook’s “sentiment slump” alternative scenario   addresses the policy issues that such a development would entail     The latest spike in energy prices triggered by Katrina also has implications for the   inflation outlook On the positive side, most reports that I have been getting still have the flavor   of businesses unable to pass on higher costs to their customers Nevertheless, the headline and   core inflation reports are likely to look scary for the next several months  Fortunately, as several   of my contacts have explained, more than the usual number of price increases are taking the form   of surcharges that are expected to be removed when energy and other raw materials prices   recede To the extent that this practice lies behind some of the near-term bad news that we are   seeing on the inflation front, there is still reason to think that the Greenbook baseline projection   will prove to be accurate  But at the same time, the “deteriorating inflation expectations”                          September 20, 2005 72 of 117  scenario highlights a risk to the outlook that also troubles me a great deal  I’m very pleased that   we’ve enjoyed the public’s confidence regarding our commitment to containing long-term   inflation expectations for as long as we have during the successive energy price increases that   we’ve been hit with, but I’m not anxious to test the limits of that confidence   Even if the odds of the sentiment slump and the deteriorating inflation expectations   scenarios are similar, the policy implications are not  The Greenbook projects a GDP difference   in those two scenarios that is very small, but the difference in the projected inflation outcomes is   too sizable for me to ignore  Consequently, I think the more prudent course of action today is for   us to continue to remove our policy accommodation  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation    Thank you, Mr Chairman  The worst position for a central banker to be in   is depicted in the Greenbook’s stagflation scenario  I don’t think we’re headed there, but just   knowing that it has a nontrivial probability is somewhat disturbing  And indeed, I’ve started to get   questions from business people in the Fourth District on whether I’m concerned about stagflation   With that possibility in mind, I’d like to speak first about the real economy and then make a   few comments about inflation  During this intermeeting period, I’ve had a number of conversations   with directors, obviously, but we’ve also held several economic forums and business advisory   council meetings From these conversations, I’ve concluded that the business conditions in the   Fourth District are mixed    First, I’ll comment on the positive news  Steel producers report that sales in most product   lines are doing very well  Commercial construction activity in the District picked up recently, albeit   from a relatively low level  Trucking and shipping firms continue to report that business is brisk   and that they’re having a difficult time finding qualified drivers Many firms report that they are                                        November 1, 2005 55 of 114  planning to step up their capital spending next year, and investments—in foreign operations   especially—continue unabated   Now for the not-so-positive news  The problems in the automobile industry appear to be   deepening, as signified by the Delphi bankruptcy filing  Ford, GM, and a host of their suppliers are   concentrated in my District, and their restructuring activities are almost certainly going to be a drag   on regional growth for a while  In fact, there appear to be a lot of mergers, acquisitions, and   restructurings taking place in the manufacturing sector, as was pointed out by President Moskow   Certainly, the companies that rely heavily on natural gas and petrochemical feedstocks are   facing severe margin pressures  One of my directors from a large multinational chemical company   reports that the US coatings industry is becoming globally uncompetitive due to the price and   availability of natural gas in the United States   Moreover, as others have mentioned, many business leaders are quite anxious about the   impact of home heating bills in the coming months on consumer spending  Some retailers are being   especially cautious about their inventories, and companies further down the supply chain tell me   that they can quickly pull back capital spending projects if the need arises   Although the comments that I’ve been hearing about the real economy vary a lot by industry, I   hear a much more consistent commentary when it comes to the pricing environment  Everyone I’ve   spoken with is worried about the effects of higher energy prices and pricing psychology more   generally  It’s a fact that energy and other input costs have been rising  Some of these costs are   now being passed through successfully, and I’m concerned that the climate has become more   receptive to pass-through than at any time in recent memory   One of my directors reported that she has been trying unsuccessfully to raise prices to a   particular customer for the past several years  Two weeks ago that customer called her to say that                                November 1, 2005 56 of 114  he knew she was going to have to raise prices in this environment and he was just hoping to get a   heads-up on how much those price increases would be and when they would come  What that   customer had previously regarded as unacceptable was now acknowledged as inevitable  An   executive of a software company that specializes in solutions to steel companies told me that he is   increasing his prices because his customers are finally making plenty of money, so they’re now   willing to accept his price increases  To paraphrase him and others “Now that the train is leaving   the station, you’d better get on with as much luggage as you can carry”  [Laughter]   Shortages of some raw materials are also likely to add price pressures in coming months    Several people reported that their suppliers are invoking force majeure clauses in contracts  Their   suppliers are facing shortages of some raw materials, preventing them from meeting their contract   obligations  These people tell me that they’ve not encountered such circumstances in 30 years of   doing business, and they are concerned about where prices are headed   I’ve not been as alarmed about inflationary pressures as my business contacts because core   measures have been very favorable  And I expect the headline numbers to improve next year  But I   can’t refrain from noting something about the policy environment that’s implied by the Greenbook   baseline projection  An awkward feature of that projection is the trajectory of the headline and core   inflation measures in 2006  After telling the public that they should ignore headline numbers and   pay attention instead to core inflation statistics, this Committee would be holding the fed funds rate   steady during a year in which labor costs and core price measures are expected to accelerate from   their current pace  This might indeed be the correct policy, but it might appear to the public that we   are tolerating a rise in core inflation  Such a situation could pose some additional communication   challenges for us next year  So, like others, I know it’s time for us to start focusing on how we                                November 1, 2005 57 of 114  communicate these issues  But for today, I believe the appropriate action for us is to continue to   remove our policy accommodation  Thank you, Mr Chairman    I support your recommendations    Thank you, Mr Chairman  What a difference six weeks can make  At our   last meeting, the Greenbook offered two alternative scenarios—stagflation and a consumer sentiment   slump—which at least from the Fourth District’s perspective seemed plausible and worrisome  In   early November, we had to consider the possibility that output growth might weaken even as inflation   accelerated Fortunately, the output and productivity data that we’ve received since that meeting have   been on the upside, and the inflation news has been generally encouraging  Although there are still   various scenarios to worry about today, stagflation and a consumer sentiment slump no long appear to   be among them  My own information-gathering process during this intermeeting period leaves me   very comfortable with the Greenbook baseline, which now expects more favorable paths for output,   productivity, and inflation than it called for at our last meeting   I have a few observations about each of these  First, output  The national pace of economic   activity appears to be on the upswing, even though in my own District the economy appears to remain                                 December 13, 2005 46 of 100  on a slower improvement trend  Bankers report that the commercial loan pipelines are filling up, and   competition among lenders is very strong  As I said, my District has been trailing the nation  The   automobile industry has a large weight in my District, and recent developments there, though not   unexpected, are pretty dreary, as President Moskow reported  The Big Three automobile companies   and their suppliers are under intense pressure to downsize and reduce costs, especially labor costs   Many plant closings and layoffs have already been announced, and the dark clouds hanging over the   industry are already having adverse effects on many communities  But most business leaders I speak   with outside of the automobile industry are optimistic about their national markets as they look into   next year   Next I’ll comment on productivity  The CEOs that I talked to are still working very hard to   generate profits by increasing productivity  I’m amazed by how frequently and uniformly CEOs talk   about efficiency efforts under way in their companies  A natural consequence of the productivity   culture, of course, is that business people are watching their head counts very closely, even as their   sales are expanding Hospital executives are especially bullish about their ability to generate   significant productivity gains, and they’ve been ramping up their capital spending on equipment and   facilities  One of my directors works for a large commercial construction company and reports that   this is a nationwide trend   Finally, inflation  Retailers tell me that they’ve trained their customers to shop for bargains   only too well  Consumers are relentless in their hunt for bargains, and Internet shopping is growing   rapidly in popularity and making that hunt for bargains easier  Retailers in the District tell me that   they expect consumers to hang back and wait until the bitter end for steeper discounts, and those   discounts are going to inevitably rise as Christmas looms close  Consequently, retailers expect to turn   over their inventories, but they anticipate having to give up some of the normal profit margins that                             December 13, 2005 47 of 100  they seek at this time of the year  Discounting is extremely intense  Sales volume, then, should turn   out well, but profits may be disappointing   Some manufacturers say that they are finally getting a little traction with price increases above   and beyond the energy surcharges  But most manufacturers that I talked to report that competition   remains very intense and they emphasize that they have little pricing power  Although businesses   have had to absorb price increases for many of their commodity inputs, several business executives   note that raw materials prices have stopped increasing for the most part and, in many instances, have   started to decline   So as I look at the national economy, I’m very comfortable with the Greenbook baseline  I   expect productivity growth to hold up rather well next year, along the lines of that faster productivity   growth alternative scenario in the Greenbook  Although I indicated in my report at our last meeting   that we could see stronger pass-through of energy prices, I was not hearing that from my business   contacts in their reports this time around  In fact, many of them said that the energy and commodity   price shocks that we’ve experienced in the past two years could move through our economy without   elevating core inflation rates   The disappearance of the stagflation and consumer sentiment slump scenarios and the   emergence of other risks serve as a reminder to me that the future, even the near-term future, is   uncertain The 70 percent confidence range surrounding the Greenbook baseline projection is wide   enough to include all of the alternative simulations  I believe, as a couple of others have already said,   that with another move today our policy accommodation will have been substantially removed,   making the timing and extent of additional firming more uncertain for me  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support your recommendation of a 25 basis   point increase in our fed funds rate target  I can also accept the language in alternative B  Like   others, though, I came to the meeting preferring to remove the word “measured”  But I didn’t see   removing the term “measured” in the way Brian did—that it meant markets might think we would go   up at a faster pace of 50 basis points  I thought that its removal would give us more flexibility to stop   at a certain point  It’s interesting, in listening to this conversation today, that we all have different   interpretations of what it would mean  So I am just going to go with your guidance  Nevertheless,   given what I know today, I’m leaning to the view that we’re going to have to stop at some point soon   versus having concern that we’re going to have to do more  But again, given what I’ve heard today   and given your recommendation, I support the language as written in alternative B     Thank you, Mr Chairman  By now I’m sure that most of you are tired   of hearing me report that conditions in my District are not as vigorous as conditions in most of the   country  I know that I’m tired of repeating it  Fortunately, optimism is increasing in many parts of   my District  My directors and business contacts that have national and international business   interests report fairly solid conditions in most of their industries  They tell me that they plan to   maintain a strong pace of capital spending this year and that they expect healthy productivity gains   from doing so  These trends encourage me to think that our economy will be able to maintain the 3   percent rate of structural productivity growth that underlies the Greenbook baseline projection    Since we are nearing the point of monetary policy neutrality, I’m counting on a strong rate of   productivity growth to help us gradually nudge the inflation rate back down over the next several   years  I have not changed my thinking about the underlying trends in the economy since our last   meeting  I was pretty much in sync with the Greenbook outlook then and remain so today  The   January 31, 2006 44 of 106    BEA’s fourth-quarter revisions appear to affect the timing of economic activity across a couple of   quarters but not to affect the longer-term outlook   Even though I still expect to see headline and core inflation moderate over the projection   period, I have become a bit more sensitive to the upside inflation risks in the baseline projection    First, in the Greenbook we received last week, the staff concluded that inflation this year could   creep up a bit more than they had thought in December, and the staff elevated their estimate of core   PCE inflation for the fourth quarter from 19 percent to 22 percent as a result of the most recent   BEA report  The staff hedged against that possibility by imposing a temporary 25 basis point surtax   on their December fed funds rate path beginning at our next meeting, and it seems sensible to me to   keep this option open  At our December meeting I said that I thought we were very close to being   able to stop increasing our fed funds rate target at every meeting  I still think so  If monetary policy   is a combination of science and art, I think we’re now out of the laboratory and inside the art studio,   and having flexibility as we go forward is highly desirable to me   Finally, Mr Chairman, I have to admit that I’ve spent more time since our last meeting   thinking about what to say in acknowledgement of your last meeting than I’ve thought about   economic conditions, and it’s impossible to come up with words to express my feelings  I just   simply want to say that it has been truly an honor and a privilege to serve under your leadership of   this Committee  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I, too, support your recommendation on the   25 basis point increase in our fed funds rate target  I, too, like the language as you proposed it    Removing the word “well” in the statement gives us, I think, more of the flexibility that I said I   desired  And I, too, would like to defer the decision on what we vote on  Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The momentum in the Fourth District   economy appears to be broadly similar to the rest of the country’s  The region appears to be   expanding at a good but not spectacular pace  Although my District never experienced the extreme   acceleration in housing activity seen in many other parts of the country, we are nonetheless seeing   some downturn in residential activity relative to last year  And, of course, we are being affected by   the shifting fortunes in the auto industry  The further we move into the year, the more optimistic   business people seem to be about the outlook  The softness in last year’s fourth quarter is now all   but forgotten  Business leaders in the District are sticking with strong capital spending plans, and   I’ve been getting especially positive reports on commercial construction   Turning to the national economy, the Greenbook baseline captures the broad contours of my   own expectations—namely, a slowing in personal consumption spending and, as many others have   commented, in the housing sector over the course of the year, leading the overall economy back   toward a moderating but solid growth path next year   As for the outlook on prices, I am still predicting that headline inflation will shift down this   year from last year’s energy-shocked pace and move much closer to the center of my preference   range  Overall, I really am not seeing a lot in the way of warning signs that inflationary pressures   are building  I get sporadic reports of labor market tightness, a point to which I’ll return in a minute    But I hear just as many reports highlighting the moderation of energy costs, especially for natural   gas  The headline and ex-food and energy CPI inflation for February were quite favorable and were   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 57 of 167       certainly interpreted as such by financial markets  And, importantly, inflation expectations do   appear to be well contained  Like others, in Cleveland we typically monitor the ten-year TIPS   spreads, and those certainly have not been giving me any cause for alarm  Despite this, I get a sense   from business contacts that the full pass-through of energy and material costs into final goods prices   may not yet be complete  Consequently, the arc of my outlook is quite similar to that of the   Greenbook—some slight tick-up in core inflation this year as a whole, with core measures moving   down to more-desirable levels in 2007   As I turn to the risks to the outlook, I try to think of those places where my staff’s analysis   or the comments that I hear from my business contacts seem most at odds with the Greenbook   projections  If there is one area of some disagreement, it would be the degree to which the   Greenbook seems to emphasize potential increases in labor costs as a source of upward price   pressures in the near term  Consistent with the Greenbook assessment, I am hearing, for the first   time in years, reports of some tightening in labor markets and some accelerating wage growth    However, to echo your theme, Mr Chairman, the job vacancies and wage pressures do appear to be   concentrated in a small number of high-skilled occupations  My list is very similar to President   Minehan’s  In truth, I have to work pretty hard to get my business contacts to talk about their   concerns about accelerating wage costs  And I fear just a little that my interrogations may be   forcing confessions from the innocent  [Laughter]  At the same time, my business contacts are still   optimistic about their ability to generate solid productivity gains  Although I do expect to see some   continued pass-through of previous shocks to core measures of inflation, these influences are   expected to dissipate over the course of the year   When I add up all of these pieces, I don’t see much evidence that capacity constraints are   likely to drive up price and wage pressures  What I don’t know, of course, is whether the reports   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 58 of 167       that I’m getting are peculiar to the Fourth District  When I look at the employment cost data over   the past several quarters, they seem consistent with a relatively benign wage cost picture  But I   heard from a few of my colleagues ahead of me that they are seeing a different picture  I am   interested in whether these anecdotal impressions that I’m getting are just a Fourth District   peculiarity or whether they’re spread more broadly  Thank you, Mr Chairman     I was just going to add to that, David  For so many months I was hearing   about some increased construction in health care facilities and school buildings  But in the past few   months it has been broader than that—it has been office buildings and some plants     Vincent, in your comments about the Desk survey and what markets are   anticipating, you said that they anticipate little change in the statement  But there have been some   concerns—and, in fact, even a short article in the Wall Street Journal today mentions—that if there   is no change in the statement that was made in January, investors will probably ratchet up their rate   expectations  And there is a risk that, with no signaling, after the meeting they will build two more   moves into the future  Have you given any thought to how to prevent that from happening?   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 107 of 167         But then it has also built in an expectation of another action at the next   meeting     And so, when they expect little change, it is hard to know whether it is   no change in paragraph 4 versus little change in the rationale statement     Yes     Thank you, Mr Chairman  As I said yesterday, the Greenbook   baseline captures the broad contours of my expectations—namely, solid growth going forward   and projections for inflation moving downward over the forecast period  But that baseline is   broadly the same forecast that we received in January, and in January it was supported by a   475 percent funds rate  Obviously, this Greenbook has that same outcome being supported by a   5 percent funds rate    Based on the incoming reports that I received from my District contacts, my guess is   that the January forecast was about right  So I do fully support another 25 basis point increase in   the fed funds rate today  But then, that leaves open, obviously, as others have said, whether it’s   going to prove necessary to move to 5 percent or higher and how we communicate that   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 120 of 167        As I mentioned yesterday, my impression is that the Greenbook is showing pressures in   the labor market, and that was one of the central reasons for moving the fed funds path upward to   get the same inflation outlook  Because I’m not seeing those same pressures, I’m inclined to   believe that a 25 basis point move today roughly balances the upside and downside forecast risk   for inflation  Therefore, I could support leaving this meeting with the presumption that the rate   hike today is more than likely the last one for a while      Now, having said that, I am sensitive to the distinctions between a forecast risk and a   policy risk  And although I see the risk to the forecast, particularly the inflation forecast, as   relatively balanced at a 4¾ percent funds rate, I’m not averse to taking out some additional   insurance in case there is an upside risk or a surprise on the upside in inflation, because core   inflation is currently running at a rate higher than I want to see    So that leads me to think not so much about this meeting or even the May meeting but,   as others have said, about the June meeting  As we discussed earlier, my concern is that having   no change in the assessment-of-risk language today is going to reinforce the expectations that   there will be another 25 basis point increase in May, and I’m a little concerned that it will also   lead to an expectation of an additional 25 basis point increase in June  When my staff looks at   the distribution of market expectations based on options on fed funds futures, in the week or so   following our last meeting there was a movement up, but not because the data came in   unexpectedly high  The data came in where they were expected, but the fed funds options did   move up  I’m concerned that we’re going to see a similar pattern after this meeting if we don’t   make some changes to the language  But given Governor Kohn’s comments and some of the   others, the minutes can help us with that  Our statements can certainly also help us convey that   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 121 of 167        Given my concern, though, I have to say that I was interested in the language that was   suggested in the Bluebook by Vincent—that we modify our statement in section 4 just slightly to   say that some additional firming may be needed  However, given people’s comments today, I   can live with keeping section 4 language the same and accept some of the changes that Vincent   has laid out in alternative B, but I suggest that we then use our minutes and our statements if   we’re starting to see too much movement in market expectations about where we’re going to go    Thank you      I was just going to add that I agree with everyone’s statements about the   format  I like it  I thought splitting the policy from the economic go-round was very good  I was   going to add what Bill just mentioned—special topics—because I think that there are several that   we should give more time to  So if we go to a two-day meeting format, there are going to be times   when our policy decisions will require more time, but then we can use those other occasions for the   special topics  Communications is one  Inflation expectations another  The list is very long     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Based on the reports from my directors and my   business contacts in the Fourth District, the relatively broad-based growth of the first quarter appears to   May 10, 2006 43 of 120    have carried over into April  However, their comments about the balance of the year are consistent with   the moderating trend of the Greenbook baseline projection   To put it in terms used by the Conference Board’s consumer sentiment measures, the current   condition index is high, but the expectations index is falling  I was reminded by my staff as we were   preparing for this meeting that real-time data on real economic growth are difficult to assess  At the end   of our rate-increase cycle in 2000, the GDP figures were providing unreliable signals about the   underlying strength of the economy  We had a second quarter that had real growth of more than 6   percent  We were forecasting, and even saw in the advance figures a very strong third quarter, and yet   we had negative growth in that quarter   Comments I hear about price pressures contain some mixed messages  I don’t hear many   complaints about price pressures except for the obvious ones about the energy-related costs and material   shortages in construction-related businesses  However, I am hearing concerns about the persistence of   these costs and the possibility that they may have negative consequences for both inflation and overall   business conditions     The consequences of the energy shocks for prices are already apparent  At our November   meeting, I agreed with the Board staff projection that we would, at about this time, find ourselves facing   some pass-through in our core inflation measures from some of the previous energy-price increases  At   that time, however, it also appeared that headline inflation would be coming down at this point    Obviously, the current Greenbook suggests that recent oil shocks have taken that scenario away from us,   at least for the immediate future, and the tick-up in expected core inflation is now even further away   from my comfort zone than before   That said, based on what I’m hearing from my directors and business contacts, the Greenbook’s   assessment of current conditions and baseline projections going forward seem about right to me  But I   May 10, 2006 44 of 120    sense rather significant perceived risks both that economic growth might turn out weaker than I expect   and that inflationary pressures might be larger or even more persistent than I expect  If we can take any   encouragement from this, it would be that similar sentiments were expressed during the run-up in oil and   gas prices last fall, and those sentiments did abate fairly quickly when the energy market situation   stabilized  Unlike many of my colleagues who have spoken ahead of me, I do think that the risks are   weighted against both of our objectives, and, obviously, that’s not a comfortable place for a monetary   policymaker to be in  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  As I stated earlier, I basically agree with the   staff’s current baseline projection that, with the rate action today, we have a monetary policy that   supports the return of GDP growth to somewhere near its long-term potential, along with both core and   headline inflation beginning to turn back down as the year proceeds   I stated at our last meeting that I was willing to see the fed funds rate move above my best   estimate of where neutral is to a level that might be somewhat restrictive as insurance against some of   the adverse inflation effects of energy-price shocks that have hit the economy for more than two years   now  I noted with interest that a member of the Board staff reported on Monday at the Board briefing   that the staff thinks that energy shocks will add ¾ percent to core PCE inflation this year  Estimates   such as this one give me some comfort in deciding to reach beyond my estimate of neutral, but there are   limits as to how far I’m willing to reach   We all know that there is a historical relationship between energy-price shocks and weakness on   the real side of the economy  I also know, Mr Chairman, that some economists, for whom I have a   great deal of respect, have suggested that the weakness was partly associated with monetary policy   action taken in response to those shocks  I think we have reached a point where further policy actions to   head off potential price pressures may come at the expense of tipping the scales in the direction of   increasingly greater risk to economic activity     I admit that I’m not happy with the degree and speed of the decline in core inflation in the long-  term projections included in the Bluebook  It has been frustrating for me to watch the headline inflation   numbers keep moving up as a result of energy shocks and to see our timetable for moving core inflation   lower get pushed further and further into the future  But if the Board staff’s estimate of the effects of   May 10, 2006 85 of 120    energy-price shocks on core PCE is reasonable, it suggests that there is room for some further   improvement in core inflation once the energy shocks end, other things being equal of course   One fundamental element of the outlook that might not be equal is the dragging of the inflation   expectations anchor  I know that, as prudent central bankers, we have to be constantly alert to the   possibility that inflation expectations will take off  Our worst fear, most certainly, is that they will creep   up covertly and catch us unawares  So I applaud the diligence of the Bluebook authors in looking for   these weapons of mass destruction, but I’m not convinced that the evidence that we’ve compiled should   provoke us to attack just yet   At the last meeting, I indicated that I was inclined to pause after this meeting  That’s still my   inclination  But the last CPI report, coupled with little direct evidence that the pace of economic activity   is slowing, has moved me closer to putting even odds on our appropriate choice at the June meeting  I   said in March that I would not like a statement that induced market participants to automatically expect   a better than 50 percent chance for a rate hike in June  It’s clear to me from our discussion today that   some are leaning toward a rate increase in June and that they’re going to wait and see if the data will talk   them out of it  I also know that some people are thinking about a pause, and we’re going to wait and see   if the data are going to talk us into it  The most common theme I’m hearing is “wait and see,” and in my   opinion the wisest course is to make the smallest possible number of changes in our statement and hope   that the data will speak more convincingly over the next month and a half   So my preference is to make as few changes as possible to the statement that we made last   month  I think alternative B does that  I like adding the language  The second half of passage 4   reinforces the message of last month’s minutes that were widely interpreted as “wait and see”  So that’s   where I am  I support alternative B  Thank you     I agree with President Hoenig and Governor Kroszner     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Much like the Greenbook, the reports that I   hear from my directors and business contacts are consistent with an economy that is expanding, but   at a slower pace than earlier this year  Activity related to residential real estate has softened, and I   continue to hear from my business contacts that they are concerned that consumer spending will   retrench in response to the softer housing market and higher energy prices  But I do not get much   indication that this concern is having a substantial effect on their business plans  Capital spending   plans in particular seem little changed from the beginning of this year   As for inflation, rising costs are widely reported by my business contacts, but most of these   pressures are still related to energy and material prices  I continue to hear that productivity-adjusted   wage pressures remain in check  Among producers of intermediate goods, the number of firms that   report the ability to pass through costs seems to be increasing, but as of now, I am not hearing a lot   in the way of substantial price increases at the retail level   Despite what I am hearing from my business contacts, the data tell a different story, and they   have affected my thinking since our last meeting  The core inflation numbers have been drifting up,   whether calculated by excluding food and energy or by the trimmed mean and median CPI   measures that we monitor in Cleveland  Since December the majority of items in the CPI weighted   by their expenditure shares have risen at annual rates in excess of 3 percent  It is still possible, of   June 28-29, 2006 52 of 177    course, that the pattern of these price increases that have been showing up lately is just an outsized   but transitory pass-through of energy and commodity prices or the realignment of rents to the   exceptional residential housing market that we have seen in the past few years  But this explanation   is becoming increasingly difficult for me to defend     At our May meeting I expressed concerns that risks were weighted against both our   objectives, and the Greenbook baseline now reflects those concerns  weaker economic growth and   higher inflation  At this time, I do not see any signs that the real economy is going to be weaker   than projected in the Greenbook baseline, but unfortunately I do not expect an inflation outlook that   is much better than the Greenbook baseline either  That is my report, Mr Chairman  Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  With our decision in May to set the   federal funds rate target at 5 percent, I felt that we had moved the fed funds rate to a level that   was slightly above neutral  I thought at that time that the cumulative effects of our previous   actions, along with other elements in the outlook, might enable us to consider a pause at this   meeting  Others at that meeting weren’t quite as sanguine, and I said at that time that I perceived   June 28-29, 2006 115 of 177    two distinct positions regarding a rate hike at this meeting—those who were leaning in that   direction and looking for the data to talk them out of it and those who were leaning against an   increase and looking for the data to talk them into it      I was in that latter group, and the data have indeed talked me into another 25 basis point   increase in our fed funds rate target today  I’m just as wary now as I was in May of pushing the   fed funds rate beyond the level necessary to restrain inflationary pressures, but my concerns   about the real side of the economy have been trumped by what I perceive as a significant shift in   the risk to our price stability objective    For some time now, I’ve been expecting to see headline inflation slow down even as we   see a drift up in core inflation  We may yet find that some of the influences of energy and   housing prices on the inflation statistics are transitory and that they’ll wane  Nevertheless, I’m   less confident of that position today than I was in May, and I can’t comfortably rationalize the   recent string of bad inflation reports that we’ve seen  Fortunately, some of the wobbliness in   inflation expectations that concerned us in May appears to have stabilized because of the belief   that the Committee will respond to the latest inflation reports with a rate increase today  I think   it’s important to validate those expectations    As others stated previously, I’m also not prepared to say with any conviction today what I   will be prepared to do in August  As Vincent pointed out, the markets are currently expecting   another rate increase in August  I would prefer to see that probability closer to 50-50, and I hope   that Vincent is correct that our language is going to move the markets in that direction    In terms of our statement, I was ready to support President Lacker’s two suggestions in   the statement, taking “unwelcome” inflation, which appears in both alternatives A and C, and   using it in B  But after hearing President Stern’s question about what it means, I’m not so sure   June 28-29, 2006 116 of 177    that I would use “unwelcome” in alternative B  President Lacker’s second suggestion, of taking   the first sentence in paragraph 4 of alternative C and using it as the first sentence in alternative B,   addresses those concerns  It conveys that the Committee seeks a decline in core inflation, which   is more specific than “unwelcome” inflation  Even though I understand that the transmission   mechanism of monetary policy is through the slowing of aggregate demand, I would prefer that   our statement be more forthright about what we are trying to achieve as an objective  That’s   what I think that sentence in alternative C does—it says that we are seeking to foster our   objectives of price stability and sustainable economic growth and are seeking to see a decline in   core inflation  So my preference is alternative B with a change in the first sentence in   paragraph 4  Thank you, Mr Chairman      Well, just a comment that we’ve changed “implied” to “determined”  Is   there supposed to be a difference?  Again, it’s a nuance, but will people focus on that change of   word?  Is “determined” stronger than “implied”?  That’s all    David, in your opening comments you said that the staff got the last   two employment numbers right  But they were below the market expectations of what the   employment numbers would be  In the Greenbook baseline projections, the employment growth   numbers going forward are even lower  They are 80,000 per month for the rest of this year and   40,000 per month in 2007 Those seem like very low numbers; I think that, if those numbers are   realized, they’re going to continue to surprise markets and to appear pretty weak   So I was   wondering how sensitive to those specific employment numbers the outlook is  I know that the   Greenbook has a lower NAIRU alternative simulation; is that supposed to be providing us with   some information about the uncertainty in that forecast?  Given that lower NAIRU alternative in   August 8, 2006 16 of 158                         the Greenbook, I am also curious about what kinds of employment numbers we are looking at   that would achieve those outcomes    Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  My outlook hasn’t changed very much   since last spring, when I was contemplating the not-so-welcome cycle of slowdown in economic   activity and some persistence in both headline and core inflation due to the lingering effects of   large energy-price increases  In fact, the Greenbook projections for real GDP now reflect   something close to the pessimistic end of where I thought things could be heading  The   difference is that I have been thinking more of a cyclical slowdown and not so much of a   slowdown in demand and supply, as reflected in the Greenbook baseline  The possibility that   slack might not be widening as economic growth moves down puts the recent inflation numbers   in a particularly bad light   August 8, 2006 39 of 158                               I have been especially concerned about how broadly based the inflationary pressures   appear to be When you take energy components out of the CPI and you look at the median that   Richard was referring to earlier, about 67 percent of the expenditure-weighted items in the CPI   increased at an annual rate of 3 percent or more in June, which is about the same share that we   have seen since March As Richard mentioned, the PCE statistics yield basically the same   results   In Procter & Gamble’s most recent earnings report, the company attributed its good   earnings performance partly to the ability to pass on higher costs through to product prices, and I   am hearing similar remarks about pricing power from our directors and District business   contacts Although my business contacts have been reporting some ability to pass on price   increases now at the retail level, where in the past they were saying that it was very difficult to   go beyond intermediate goods, they’re not so sure that they will get more than one-time catch-up   adjustments  Most of my business contacts have not expressed concerns about an elevation in   the long-term inflation trend   Nevertheless, I think there are clearly reasons to be worried about the risk of inflationary   pressures intensifying over the balance of the projection period  I also think that there is a risk   that we’re not going to see as much slack as is embedded in the Greenbook baseline  As in many   other parts of the country, activity in the housing sector is slowing in the Midwest, particularly in   the Fourth District, and the housing situation in the Fourth District could never be characterized   as bubbly or frothy Some of the veteran Realtors in my District with whom I have been talking   are saying that this housing market is the worst that they can recall  Comments like these,   although they are selected, do suggest some more uncertain prospects for the housing sector  My   directors and business contacts have also been sounding a bit more cautious about the outlook for   August 8, 2006 40 of 158                         their sales, but at the same time their capital spending plans appear to be intact  They remain   vocal about the ability to get productivity gains, and they remain disciplined about their hiring   plans So as I contemplate the weaker spending track that’s forecast in the Greenbook, I’m   inclined to attribute more of it to the demand side of the economy than to the supply side  That   is, I am expecting the Greenbook’s call for moderation in economic growth to result in a little   more slack than appears in the Greenbook’s baseline     In a qualitative sense, my outlook carries lower inflationary pressure than the Greenbook   baseline and thus is similar in spirit to the “lower NAIRU” alternative scenario  Separating the   cyclical and structural performance of the economy, of course, is a real challenge, and it is   natural, I think, to feel unsure about the real-time estimates and projection of slack  If the slower   growth of potential output in the Greenbook baseline is accurate, it raises the possibility that the   equilibrium real interest rate may be lower than it was in the last half of the 1990s  In summary,   Mr Chairman, I still think there are risks to both of our objectives  Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Like others, I think the policy action at   this meeting is a very close call, but in the end I support a pause, even in light of the continuing   unfavorable inflation situation I think that there is a real possibility that slack could be greater   during this projection period than the staff’s baseline projections expect because of weaker   demand, stronger potential, or some combination of the two  I am encouraged that inflation   expectations remain anchored  In light of all of the uncertainties attached to the current outlook,   I would just like to take a pause and see how things play out  Now, as many have said, there is a   chance that the data are going to reveal that this is not a good stopping point  If the data do   reveal that more rate hikes are in order because inflation may reaccelerate, because inflation   expectations begin to increase, or because economic activity appears to be more robust than our   current projections, then I think we will need to consider the possibility of a more aggressive   move Unfortunately, I think it’s unrealistic to expect that some of these issues are going to be   August 8, 2006 98 of 158                             resolved in one or two future meetings  But we have market-based measures of inflation   expectations that are available to us on a continuous basis, and for that reason, it seems important   to me to be especially focused on inflation expectations in the coming months   I favor alternative B I support Governor Kohn’s suggestion that we move language from   alternative C, section 3, to emphasize our concern about the inflation risks  I also want to add   that, like President Guynn, I am not going to dissent if the consensus is for a move of 25 basis   points I came into the meeting leaning toward a pause  I have to say, after listening to many of   my colleagues’ statements today, that inclination is less pronounced  It’s just a very close call   today Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I agree that the goals listed in the   subcommittee’s memo are the right goals  However, in thinking about the next few questions   August 8, 2006 133 of 158                                                concerning the quantity and the content of the information and the nature of any forward-looking   information that we provide, I find it difficult to make judgments without knowing where we’re   going to emerge from our discussion about what policy approach we take, especially the discussion   about whether we’re going to adopt a numerical inflation objective  As others have said, I think that   our communication practices need to reinforce our policy strategy  In fact, we should consider our   communication practices to be a part of our policy strategy   So, for example, if we move down the path of adopting a numerical objective for inflation,   then the appropriate communication strategy may simply be to provide the explicit inflation   objective with little guidance about specific policy moves beyond reference to our performance   against that objective  In that case, I think there would be less need for information in the statement   that follows our meeting  However, it might require more information in our semiannual report to   the Congress   Then regarding the forward-looking language, again I think it depends on whether or not we   adopt a numerical objective for inflation  A successful communication strategy should first and   foremost give the public confidence that we’re going to produce low inflation over the long run  I   don’t think that a good communication policy strategy, as others have already said, necessarily   means that we have to make sure the public can anticipate our next policy move  If we have a   numerical objective helping us to anchor long-term inflation expectations, then that forward-looking   guidance might be reserved for those times when the Committee has a great deal of certainty in the   course of its near-term policy moves or when it perceives that the cost of being misunderstood is   just exceptionally great   Regarding the last set of questions from the subcommittee involving the individual   communications or the Committee communications, I believe that whatever communication   August 8, 2006 134 of 158                                           strategy we adopt, it is important to preserve our ability to give and express independent views,   especially about forecasts, policy strategies, actions, and so forth  It’s clear that each of us   formulates our own independent opinions about policy actions, and we form those opinions from a   sense of how we think economic conditions will evolve  I’d like to preserve the ability that we   enjoy today of sharing our independent thinking and the climate that I sense we have today of a   Committee that’s very skilled at building consensus around different perspectives but yet sees the   benefit of respectful dissent  Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Since our last meeting, I made a special   effort to talk with my directors and business contacts about two topics—developments in   housing markets and inflation  My District has been growing at a slower pace than most other   parts of the country; consequently, housing prices in the District never appreciated as much as   September 20, 2006 59 of 132                  those in the hot markets in the country  Nonetheless, a major Realtor in our region told me that   houses in his market, which includes the northern half of Ohio and the western half of   Pennsylvania, are taking longer to sell and that the average price of houses sold from January to   August is down about 2 percent compared with the same period last year  His view is that   nationally the housing market still has a way to go before conditions stabilize  Nevertheless,   right now he sees only a limited possibility that the adjustment process will cause serious harm to   the US economy   Apparently people are not leaving much to chance  I heard a report yesterday morning   that sales at religious stores for statues of St Joseph have been soaring  [Laughter] It seems as   though people who are trying to sell their homes are buying statues of St Joseph because he’s   the patron saint of real estate, and they’re burying him next to the “For Sale” sign    Unfortunately, there is no patron saint for central bankers  [Laughter]   Some forecasters, like the Greenbook, are expecting strength in the commercial   construction sector to offset much of the weakness in residential building  One of my directors,   who represents a large national commercial construction firm, has indicated that commercial   building in the past few years has been boosted by the growth of health and education sectors    His entire book of business increased 10 percent in real terms this year compared with last, and   he is looking to next year to have the book of business increase 3 to 4 percent  However, he is   expecting it to be flat in 2008, and his story squares with what I am hearing from bankers as   well—namely, that the flow of commercial loans in the pipeline, although not rapidly falling off,   is slowing, and it hasn’t been building as it was  The Greenbook baseline captures very well the   pattern that I’ve been describing in its projection for nonresidential investment over the next few   years   September 20, 2006 60 of 132                        Now, turning to inflation, the two CPI reports that we received during this intermeeting   period have not provided me with enough evidence that inflationary pressures have meaningfully   diminished  The reports, however, have encouraged me to think that the forward momentum has   been broken, but I’d like to see the next few CPI numbers be at least as good as those for July   and August, if not better, to be convinced that that momentum has been broken  I’ve heard some   hopeful comments regarding inflation in the past few weeks from several of my directors  Just a   few months ago they were indicating that elevated energy prices and material prices had   provided them with an opportunity to get more-generalized price increases, and they had   wondered whether that was going to be a one-time catch-up opportunity or whether it would be   persistent Now it appears to have been a one-time opportunity, which is passing or has passed     Several of my directors reported last week that they have resorted to unbundling their   prices to cope with the rising prices of energy and material costs  On their invoices, they are   breaking out the price increases that are due to the increased cost of steel, copper, energy, and   shipping in order to pass them on  Apparently, their customers are willing to accept price   increases that are due to those increased energy and material costs  But the expectation on the   part of both buyers and sellers is that, as energy and material costs dissipate, the ability to pass   on price increases will be removed  Several of my directors said that they are not planning any   price increases for the next year and that they suspect their commodity costs will be lower than   they were this year as well   As others have mentioned, there has been some interest in the elevated unit labor costs in   the second-quarter productivity and cost reports  As Dave noted, the compensation growth   underlying unit labor costs was boosted when the BLS took on board the first-quarter   unemployment insurance tax records  There is some suspicion that the dramatic increase in   September 20, 2006 61 of 132                     compensation had a lot to do with stock options and incentive pay, but the underlying data are   not available yet, so we don’t know for sure My staff was able to get some summary figures for   Ohio Compensation has been growing steadily in Ohio over the past several years, but the   preliminary figures are flat for the first quarter of 2006  However, there was double-digit growth   in three sectors—management of companies, finance and insurance, and utilities  These sectors   are often the ones that show substantial growth in the first quarters because they pay out stock   options and that’s often when those stock options are realized  So at least in my District there is   no evidence of any broad-based acceleration in compensation, and I tend to agree with the staff’s   view that it’s too early to incorporate those higher unit labor costs into the inflation outlook   At our last meeting, I expressed the opinion that whatever weakness we would see in   GDP was more likely to reflect demand factors than supply factors, and therefore I saw risks to   both our objectives The current Greenbook baseline projection for GDP is even lower than it   was at the time of our last meeting because of revisions, as Dave mentioned, to both supply and   demand factors  I still think that, if the Greenbook projection comes true, softer demand is likely   to be the more dominant explanation  Nevertheless, I would like to see further evidence that   inflationary pressures have been checked, if not actually reversed, before I would conclude that   the risks to our objectives are evenly balanced  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I favored a pause at the last meeting, and I   haven’t really heard or seen anything since then that would cause me to change that view    Consequently, maintaining the pause seems like the right thing to do, and I favor the language in   alternative B in communicating that decision  I would also like to add that I share the concern that   most have expressed today that the trajectory of inflation may not head downward fast enough    However, I favor the current policy stance because I believe that the rates we have already   implemented will bring the inflation rate down and because, as I said earlier, overtightening when   the economy appears to be moderating more than we anticipated even just a couple of months ago is   a concern to me  Mr Chairman, the chart that you handed out today reaffirms that concern  Even   though I am convinced that the inflation rate will fall, I am less convinced about how much and   when  Right now, I am satisfied with breaking the momentum in the inflation process and will wait   to see whether the moderation in the economy does stabilize  I can envision, as others have said   today, a point in the future when our policy will have to be more ambitious to bring the rate of   inflation down over time  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you  Dave, I have a question on the less-persistent inflation   scenario  The description indicates that the scenario allows for inflation to be less persistent in the   baseline perhaps for structural reasons  Could you give me a couple of examples of how the   structure might change and what the data might tell us or what data would be telling us that such a   change is occurring?     Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  For a while now, I’ve been somewhat   more pessimistic than most of the Committee about the downside risk to the real economy  I was   beginning to get worried that this might be the perpetual disposition of someone from Ohio    [Laughter]  As a prominent member of our business community said to me not too long ago, it’s   not the weather, it’s the climate  [Laughter]   Since our last meeting, I’ve become more comfortable with the idea that substantially   weaker-than-forecast growth is less probable—partly because we’re now a little further down the   road without any signs that the worst-case scenarios are materializing and partly because my   directors and my business contacts seem more positive about the economic outlook    Specifically, as I listened to some of my business contacts in construction, retail, and even real   October 24-25, 2006 33 of 203    estate, the expectations that things will get substantially worse just aren’t there  Also, the   demand for labor seems to be growing at a moderate pace   On the price side, my contacts are not indicating much of an impetus for higher final   goods prices  Although projected compensation growth seems to be firming just a bit, my   contacts are telling me that they think productivity gains will keep costs in check  With the   declining energy and material costs, I don’t hear much about the potential for accelerating   pressures on prices    When I combine what I’m hearing from my District contacts with the aggregate data that   have come in since our last meeting, I sense that we have weathered the worst in softness on the   real side for now  In September I noted that my biggest concern was the possibility that the   inflation trend would worsen  It does not appear that this is happening at this point  However,   we have yet to see lower rates of core inflation, and I’m sensitive to the fact that core measures   of inflation are being held up by the contribution to owners’ equivalent rent from the rising rents   and falling utility bills  Although more-stable energy prices will make the latter effect go away,   it’s not clear that the rent part of the picture will quickly fade, as rents continue to converge   toward still high housing prices  When we look at the distribution of prices in the CPI, excluding   energy, food, and owners’ equivalent rent, prices seem to be either rising rapidly or falling    There isn’t much in the middle, and that makes the underlying movements in the inflation trend   hard to interpret   It seems to me that the key risk on the real side of the economy has been that the housing   market would decline much faster and more deeply than we had forecast and that the effect on   consumption spending would be greater than we anticipated  So far, as others have commented,   the collateral effect on consumption appears to have been contained  Furthermore, we expected   October 24-25, 2006 34 of 203    that other forms of spending would hold up as the housing sector slumped, and those   expectations appear to be on track for now  I recognize that we’re not out of the woods yet, but   the downside risks to the real economy appear somewhat more benign than they did at both the   August and the September meetings  In regard to the inflation risks, the probability of   accelerating inflation has decreased, in my opinion, but the risk that inflation will remain higher   than I personally desire hasn’t really changed  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  As I noted yesterday, I’m more comfortable   than I was at our last meeting that economic growth will not deteriorate significantly, and I continue   to believe that the risk that inflation will remain higher than I personally desire is still there  So   today I support no change in the fed funds rate, and I support the language in alternative B    However, in listening to some of the comments around the table today, I like Governor Kohn’s   suggestion for section 2  For all the reasons he stated, I think that his suggestion makes it a little   clearer than the way it’s stated now  I was also going to suggest that in section 3 we use the   language under alternative A, as Governor Kohn suggested  As a few others have said, I prefer to   leave the assessment-of-risk language unchanged because I’m not sure that much has changed since   our last meeting  The Bluebook notes that we could use the B+ language to protest the view that   markets have that there is a greater likelihood that we’re going to be easing rather than tightening    I’m not sure they are going to view it as a protest, and I prefer to use our minutes and speeches to   more fully communicate that sentiment  So for those reasons I’m comfortable with the assessment-  of-risk language under alternative B  It’s becoming clearer to me that our discussion after this   round is becoming more important because the issues we’re confronting are what level of inflation   October 24-25, 2006 105 of 203    we find acceptable, how fast we are going to get there, and how we intend to get there  So I’m   looking forward to that discussion after this go-round  Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  In August, this Committee discussed the   goals for our policy communications and generally agreed that one goal is to improve the   effectiveness of monetary policy and the performance of the economy by helping agents generate   October 24-25, 2006 155 of 203    well-informed expectations consistent with the goals and strategy of the central bank  The other   goal is to enhance the accountability, credibility, and democratic legitimacy of an independent   central bank   I think that an explicit numerical specification of price stability can help us achieve these   goals  I’m in favor of establishing an explicit numerical objective by a vote of the Committee,   but I recognize that we have many issues to resolve before we would feel ready to implement   such a practice  The economic research in support of explicit numerical objectives is   encouraging but nowhere near conclusive  The same can be said about the experience of other   central banks  So, unfortunately, there is no single off-the-shelf solution for us  Our challenge is   to craft our own framework—one that’s achievable, understandable, and believable  Fortunately,   there are steps that we can take to move us in that direction  A significant internal benefit to   adopting an explicit numerical objective is that it would help communication within the   Committee  At a minimum, knowing each other’s inflation objectives would help us understand   when we disagree, whether the disagreement concerns our objectives or the means of achieving   those objectives  Externally, greater specificity could help us anchor the public’s inflation   expectations  In our current environment, with inflation low and credibility high, I don’t see the   external benefits as being especially large  However, history does have a way of repeating itself    If we had to face conditions like those of the 1930s or the 1970s again, having an established   practice of achieving explicit inflation objectives could prove helpful, and it could be a potent   insurance policy  So the benefits of having an explicit numerical objective will be significantly   greater during those periods of extreme inflationary or deflationary pressures than they are today   Of course, as others have indicated, an explicit numerical objective has potential costs    We might want to deviate from our objective for good reason but feel constrained from doing so    October 24-25, 2006 156 of 203    Here I’m encouraged by the experiences of other foreign central banks, which suggest that   flexibility is available  There is also the potential loss of credibility from not achieving the   objective when we should be achieving it, but that is a cost that I think we should dedicate   ourselves not to incur  Our challenge is to construct a framework in which we have the   flexibility to make small deviations from a numerical objective—but not large and persistent   ones  Two other potential costs matter to me  First, I want to pursue this option within the   mandate that we have from the Congress today  I’m not sure that inviting new legislation would   prove, on balance, to be constructive  Second, as we explore our options for jointly establishing   an explicit numerical objective, I would like to see the independent contributions of individual   Committee members preserved   Turning to Vincent’s question about how we should choose the inflation objective, I   prefer, as I said earlier, ultimately to arrive at the objective by a Committee vote rather than by   establishing individual objectives  I think the public would be least confused by a simple   statement from the Committee that says its operating definition of “price stability” is X percent,   with a range, and that specifies the particular index we’re using and the time horizon by which   we’re trying to achieve the objective  In other words, this approach would be the most   understandable  In choosing the X percent with the range and the time horizon, we’ll have to be   sure that we achieve the tests of achievability and believability  We might benefit from having a   period during which the public can get more comfortable with this option  An expression that I   like is “make haste slowly”  One step for getting us started would be to survey the Committee   members about their working definitions of “price stability” and to publish the distribution along   with our semiannual economic projections  Obviously, a potential pitfall of this practice, as   others have mentioned, is that eventually people are going to know that we’re doing this and   October 24-25, 2006 157 of 203    they’re going to want to know our specific individual objectives  So as we move forward with   that practice, we’re going to have to be aware of that   Turning to Vincent’s third question—“Will quantification serve as a new influence in   setting policy?”—I think that we can expect that having an explicit numerical objective could   change policy setting in ways that we can’t foresee  But I can also see some intentional changes   to the policy-setting process  First and foremost, being more explicit about our inflation   objective will shift the time horizon of our analysis and our discussions at our meetings into the   future a couple of years, which I think is a good thing  A shift in the focus on the medium term   would lead us to spend less time talking about where we are relative to the short-term Greenbook   baseline and to spend more time talking about whether we agree or disagree about issues like   productivity trends, the transmission mechanism, the cost of inflation, inflation measurement,   and so on  These are now regarded as special topics, but I think they would become more   normal fare under a new regime   I like Governor Mishkin’s and President Plosser’s suggestion to improve the Monetary   Policy Report to the Congress and to the public  Once we start to discuss these longer-term   trends, they could be included in the report, and their inclusion would make the report more   beneficial  The positions I’ve taken on these specific questions are positions that I had before I   walked into this room, but I recognize that my views are evolving as I’m listening to some of my   colleagues’ comments on these issues  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Dave, the two measures of labor compensation that we typically look   at—compensation per hour and the employment cost index—over a long period track each other   December 12, 2006 17 of 134         fairly closely, but in the shorter run there’s more variance  Even though we’ve seen the recent   downward revisions to compensation per hour, it’s still running higher than the ECI  I was   wondering how you have approached weighing these two series in your assessment of the labor   market and also how your outlook for inflation would change if you put more weight on the ECI,   which is lower than compensation per hour     Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  My outlook for the economy hasn’t changed   much since our last meeting, but I have become more concerned about the risk to the outlook for   real growth  So in my comments this morning, I’ll explain why my risk assessment has changed   The homebuilders with whom I spoke over the past several weeks told me that the low   interest rates and the new financial products created an environment in which they did five years’   worth of business in the space of three years  They said that most homebuilders recognized that this   pace of activity was unsustainable and so they planned accordingly  A few small builders have   declared bankruptcy, and others still may do so; but for the most part, builders feel that they are   December 12, 2006 39 of 134         financially prepared to make it through the next one or two years of poor business  So the financial   condition of homebuilders is not my chief concern   However, I have become more worried about the potential spillover of housing conditions   into consumer spending from wealth effects, income constraints, and creditworthiness  I think I’m   going to give the counterpoint to President Lacker on these issues  The Greenbook points out that   the OFHEO price index is still increasing a bit, but the builders I met with convinced me that the   published prices for new homes don’t accurately reflect market conditions  Sellers are offering   nonprice concessions, such as upgrades for appliances, carpets, fixtures, and so forth  Some   builders are going to great lengths to keep published prices up  I’ve been told stories of builders in   Arizona who have been giving buyers new Lexuses as part of the overall deal so that they don’t   have to bring down the prices in their subdivision  Also, it seems as though owners of existing   homes are not yet willing to reduce their asking prices by very much  With potential buyers still   waiting for prices to fall further, traffic levels and transactions are low  It seems as though markets   are not yet close to functioning smoothly, and homebuilders are telling me that it could take another   year before buyers and sellers exhibit more confidence  I am concerned that we don’t yet have a   good handle on where house prices are headed and how the uncertainties surrounding house prices   might affect consumer spending  Second, the support to consumption provided by cash-out   refinancing is not likely to be available going forward to the same degree that we’ve had during the   past several years  Finally, the financial condition of some households has become pretty fragile,   and we all know that rates on adjustable mortgages, including some subprime mortgage loans,   continue to reset at higher rates  The adjustable rate mortgages are already causing some well-  publicized problems for some households   December 12, 2006 40 of 134         Builders in my region report that the ability of potential homebuyers to qualify for home   mortgages is becoming an issue  One homebuilder from Columbus told me that he is giving away   new cars as well, but his motivation provides a twist on the Lexus story  Some of his customers are   struggling to qualify for mortgage loans  So he’s giving them new cars so that they can get rid of   their current cars and the payment obligations that go along with them  [Laughter]  He’s not giving   them a Lexus; he’s giving them a Kia  [Laughter]  Now, if we could get these homebuilders to   adopt a Buy American strategy, we might also be able to solve our domestic auto problem     As I said at the outset, I don’t have a major disagreement with the Greenbook baseline  I   think that the outlook for near-term growth has deteriorated a little since October, and the   Greenbook reflects that  I just think that there’s greater likelihood that the real economy could   prove to be weaker than the baseline in the Greenbook in 2007, and the key risk in my view is the   degree of spillover from the housing market into the rest of the economy  The Greenbook’s   extended house decline alternative scenario represents this risk, although I have not yet heard stories   that are quite as dramatic as the 20 percent decline in home prices in that scenario   Not much has changed, as many others have already commented, in the inflation outlook    The inflation trend continues to be hard to interpret, but I still expect core inflation to drift down   gradually over the forecast period  Although there is still a risk that inflation will remain higher   than I desire, I think that favorable compensation developments and declines in shelter costs could   speed that rate of decline  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Brian, in your comments you say obviously that dealers expect no   change in the stance of policy today  Most expect little change to the wording  Yet their path for   the fed funds rate is below what we see in the Greenbook  What information in your view would   markets need to move their path closer to the Greenbook’s?  What are they looking for?      As you point out, their economic forecasts are already much higher   than ours  The Greenbook is one of the lowest in terms of economic outlook, even those among   the Blue Chip forecasters      Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support maintaining the current federal   funds rate target today, and I can support the language in alternative B  I’m trying to decide   between the holiday language and the original, and I’m struggling with the “weaker than   anticipated”  So I agree that, if we remove it, I would be comfortable with that assessment  But   I am also concerned that our current risk-assessment language is becoming stale  Back in   August, when we first chose to pause, we were nervous that our next move was going to be up   and that inflationary pressures could intensify  We thought it was critical to tell the public that   we would be ready to resume raising the fed funds rate if our outlook required us to do so  I   myself was more than half expecting that such would be the case  But the incoming data since   August have not altered the Greenbook baseline projection for the next year, and so I’m less   worried today than I was in August that we will have to do more on the upside on the fed funds   rate  Today is not the day to remove that language or change that language  But if we believe   that the path of the fed funds rate in the Greenbook is the one that is likely to evolve, we should   start to prepare markets for our maintaining the current federal funds rate longer than they   currently expect—because they expect us to move down  So I would rather start to craft some   language that would signal to markets that we’re likely to stay at our current fed funds rate   longer and, depending on how the economy unfolds, that we may eventually be more restrictive   than we appear to be today  I agree that today is not the time to change our language   significantly, so I support alternative B      Thank you, Mr Chairman  I have the sense that since our last meeting   we’ve received a wealth of data but not necessarily a wealth of information  Between the data that   have come in and the conversations that I’ve had with my District contacts in the past six weeks,   I’m a little more confident about the outlook for real growth, and I view the inflation outlook as   unchanged  Housing is an example of having more data, but not necessarily more information    Though some aspects of the residential housing data have been encouraging, neither futures on   housing prices nor reports that I have received from people in the business suggest that the   slowdown in that sector will end any time soon  Despite that, it still looks as though the spillovers   to consumer spending and financial markets have been limited  At our last meeting, there was also   some uncertainty regarding the health of the manufacturing sector  For the most part, the   intermeeting data have been favorable for the manufacturing sector  The industrial production   numbers, for example, have been strong, but manufacturing employment remains flat    January 30-31, 2007 51 of 255    The usual story that makes sense of these disparate trends is the continuing strength in   manufacturing productivity  But I’d like to mention another element in the picture—others have   mentioned it this morning—and that’s the skills mismatches  My directors and business contacts in   the manufacturing sector tell me that they have jobs available but that they face great difficulty in   filling those jobs because they can’t find people with the right skills  Interestingly, as was   mentioned in the staff presentation earlier, the JOLTS data show openings as rising, and that’s also   true in the manufacturing sector  Openings have been rising over the past two years  This news   really isn’t so good per se, but it does suggest that at least some of the sluggishness in   manufacturing job growth is coming out of the structural elements in the labor markets and is not   purely a cyclical decline in aggregate demand  In a somewhat related vein, according to the   National Association of Colleges and Employers, college placements are up 17 percent this year, the   strongest showing since 2001  The story is that relatively high profits and good business prospects   are driving up demand  We also understand from the Ohio governor’s office that last year, although   sales tax receipts were lower, income tax receipts were stronger than expected   These bits and pieces combined with some of the positive news in the aggregate data reports   in the past couple of months make me somewhat less worried about the downside risks to economic   growth than I was at the last meeting  I don’t want to go overboard on this  I had that feeling   several times last year only to be subsequently moved in the other direction  It is hard to tell   whether some of this good news has been related to weather—that is, some spring activity might   have shifted into the fourth quarter   On the inflation front, both the official data and the anecdotal stories from my contacts   continue to provide some encouragement that core inflation will moderate over the next year, but   the data are not yet entirely convincing  My staff has noted that for most of 2006, especially in the   January 30-31, 2007 52 of 255    later half of the year, the growth rates of individual CPI components exhibited a bimodal   distribution  On an expenditure-weighted basis, most components were either falling in price or   rising at a troubling rate  Very few CPI components were rising at a pace that the CPI tells us is   about average  This pattern is highly unusual, and I don’t know what to make of it, except to say   that it does make it more difficult to tell which way the inflation trend is leaning   My only material difference of opinion with the staff baseline projection concerns the   assumption about labor supply  Economywide, there is some reason to think that aggregate labor   supply is more abundant than the Greenbook baseline contemplates  Labor force participation rates   for most demographic groups have been running stronger than the staff has been expecting,   indicating that the growth of potential output could lie somewhat above the Greenbook estimate    That’s what I am assuming, and therefore I get a slightly better combination of output and inflation    In the end, my outlook for the economy hasn’t changed  The general contours of the   forecast for a modest slowdown in growth coupled with a very gradual decline in core inflation   make sense to me  However, I have lowered just slightly my assessment of the risk that real growth   will fall short of my projection, and I have not changed my risk assessment of inflation  There’s   still a notable risk that year-over-year changes in inflation might remain stuck where they are today   as opposed to drifting down half a point or so over time as I would prefer  Thank you, Mr   Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support no change in the federal funds   rate today  From our comments yesterday, it appears that not much has changed in terms of our   outlook for growth and inflation  So I’d prefer to make only the changes to our statement that   are necessary to keep us current with the intermeeting data reports  I’m comfortable with the   language in alternative B  It updates what we’ve heard in terms of the current reports  However,   I also agree with Vincent’s comment that our language in our assessment of risk has become   stale  I felt that way in December  But we’re not operating with a clean slate, and any   significant changes to the language today are probably going to be interpreted as an attempt to   signal some significant change in our outlook or risks to that outlook  So I agree that today is not   the day to do that, but I hope that we’ll have some further discussion about how to use some   language in our statements that is more durable  For now, alternative B looks right to me  I have   January 30-31, 2007 105 of 255    one final comment  For the record, I agree with Vice Chairman Geithner’s comment about not   interpreting our actions today or our thought about the path for the fed funds rate as a suggestion   that we have a different objective on inflation  I think that Vice Chairman Geithner made a good   point, and I want to support it  Thank you, Mr Chairman      I agree  I was commenting on my own outlook  Because of some of   the differing assumptions that we talked about yesterday, I just didn’t want to be in the camp of a   2 percent objective      Thank you, Mr Chairman  I also want to start by saying that the   memos that we received from the staff before this meeting were helpful, and I think that Vincent   provided the right set of questions to guide our discussions  The goals that were laid out in the   memo that Dave distributed seem appropriate to me  From that memo and the comments from   David and Brian this morning, assessing whether releasing more forecast-related information   will improve economic performance appears difficult  However, I am persuaded that, by making   some modest changes to our current practice of preparing and releasing forecast-related   information, we could readily and inexpensively facilitate a richer internal discussion and at the   margin better inform the public about our thinking   So I want to say at the outset that I’m   interested primarily in using the forecast to help us better understand each other’s thinking about   longer-term objectives, policy risks, tradeoffs, and the workings of the economy, along the lines   laid out in Vice Chairman Geithner’s memo  From my assessment of our current practices and   the experience of foreign central banks laid out in Karen’s memo, I find no compelling case for   releasing additional forecast-related information to the public, with one exception related to the   January 30-31, 2007 182 of 255    forecast period that I’ll comment on later  So using Vincent’s language, I’m in the “modify the   status quo” camp, and I’d like to answer Vincent’s questions from that perspective    I support the “independent” option regarding forecasts  I think there is great value in the   diversity of opinions that individual Committee members bring to both the internal and the   public discussion about monetary policy, and I would like to use it as constructively as possible    Right now, I am not in favor of pursuing a single official forecast to be published by the   Committee as an element in our policy communication process  Although I am not opposed to   publishing information about individual forecast submissions, I think it would be fine just to   pursue the central tendency approach that we’re using and the forecast range summaries that   appear in the Monetary Policy Report today  Regarding the conditioning assumptions, I think it   would be counterproductive to impose a common definition of appropriate monetary policy or a   common set of conditioning variables  My hope would be that the assumptions and the   conditions that are important to each individual’s outlook would be revealed as part of the   dialogue that we have among ourselves about our forecasts  I suggest that we incorporate a   summary of our views in the semiannual Monetary Policy Report  For now, it would be enough   for me to simply reflect the general sense of the conversation in the Monetary Policy Report and   in our minutes, in the same way that we regularly summarize our views about the outlook and the   policy situations today      I have no objection to delegating the release of a minutes-style description of the   Committee’s forecast discussion to the Chairman, subject to some consultation with meeting   participants in the drafting process  The process that we’re currently using to review the minutes   after each meeting could be used for drafting and publishing such a description  The narrative   then could be included in the release of the Monetary Policy Report, much as the central   January 30-31, 2007 183 of 255    tendency forecasts are included today  My suggestion is that our forecasts continue to be shared   in our semiannual format  I don’t see the need for a more-frequent release of forecasts, although   listening to some of the comments today I wouldn’t be opposed to going to quarterly once we get   some experience with the process    One important change that I would make is that I would supplement our current   semiannual projections with a medium-term forecast for the relevant variables  Governor   Mishkin mentioned three years  My personal preference is to go out to a fifth year, so I would   continue to do the one and two years and then go out to the fifth year  My guess is that in most   cases providing something like a five-year period is long enough to assume that the fifth year   would obviously be made under the assumption of appropriate monetary policy, and that would   generally align with individual members’ views of our longer-term policy objectives  Even if a   five-year period is not long enough to reveal our long-run objectives perfectly, the longer period   will help us to clarify the pace that the Committee members view as appropriate in terms of   moving toward a more desirable inflation rate  It would also provide a description of any   tradeoffs that we perceive in meeting our objectives    I am comfortable with publishing a small set of essential outcome variables, much as we   do today  At some point we might want to discuss further whether it’s still useful to include   nominal GDP, as others have mentioned, and what price index or indexes we should include    For now, I am not proposing that the forecast discussions be extended to include any formal   measures of uncertainty    In summary, my preference is to stay much closer to the status quo than many of the   other options that were presented by the staff  We have a lot to gain from shifting the focus of   our internal policy discussions to include a medium term, and we can share that information   January 30-31, 2007 184 of 255    qualitatively with the public at a very low cost  These modest steps would not preclude us from   making more-ambitious changes that the Committee might wish further down the line  Thank   you, Mr Chairman      Actually, Michael, the CEO of a large bank that originates mortgages,   with whom I had a conversation, commented that this indicator is a bit confusing because it has   to do with the fact that the owners of these loans change  By the time the person makes the first   payment, it is a struggle to figure out to whom that payment goes  So the mortgage shows up as   default with the end owner, but the person did make the payment  The payment just didn’t get to   the right place  So the CEO said that we need to be careful about making too much of that   March 20-21, 2007 13 of 196    number because it’s more of an accounting issue than it is people actually defaulting on their first   payment     He mentioned that a number of 3 percent was attached to first   payments in default and that number is just way out of whack     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Comments from my business contacts   confirm the softening in economic activity that is depicted in the Greenbook  Most of the people   I talked with during this intermeeting period confirmed the slowing that we are seeing in the   national data  But at the same time, they expect that business will improve over this year  My   business contacts are still planning to add modestly to staff and to expand output, although their   capital spending plans are not particularly ambitious this year  A number of my business   March 20-21, 2007 42 of 196    contacts told me that the dollar depreciation is finally having an effect  They are getting more   orders and are being asked to quote more jobs from foreign customers   I have recently had conversations with CEOs of the large banks from my District, who   have an interesting perspective on the ongoing turmoil in the subprime mortgage market  They   don’t seem to be particularly concerned that the situation in the mortgage markets is going to be   substantially worse than is already factored into the admittedly weak housing forecast  But they   are concerned, as President Yellen mentioned in her comments earlier, that the subprime   mortgage problems are symptomatic of broader issues that could spill over into hedge funds and   private-equity funds—both of which have become an increasingly important source of funding   for business investment activity  They worry that retrenching among managers of these funds   could adversely affect business confidence more generally  Their comments resemble the   alternative Greenbook scenario labeled “Business Pessimism with Spillovers”  The difference,   however, is that my business contacts are suggesting that the problems could originate in the   financial sector and spill over to producers’ expectations   Turning to inflation, the volatility in the monthly retail price numbers, even in the so-  called core measures, will make it difficult to clearly perceive the very modest progress in the   inflation trend that appears in the Greenbook baseline  Given the usual noise in the price data,   work by my research department indicates that identifying a break in the inflation trend on the   order of about ½ percentage point with a fair amount of certainty can take somewhere between a   year and a half and two years after the break has in fact occurred  While I believe we are still on   a course that leads to a lower inflation trend, the path we take to get there will not likely be a   smooth one, and there will be times that will test our nerve  Indeed, as I look at the data today, I   would judge that the downside risk to the real economy has increased somewhat  Still, in my   March 20-21, 2007 43 of 196    view the primary risk we face is that inflation could remain stuck higher than either I or the   Greenbook foresee  Under these conditions, I think two qualities are essential—patience and   clarity  We need to be patient so that we don’t become unnecessarily aggressive in trying to   foster lower inflation in a softening economic environment, and we need clarity so that the public   does not come to see our patience as indifference to the current inflation trend  Thank you, Mr   Chairman      Thank you, Mr Chairman  I also favor leaving our policy rate   unchanged today, and I support the language in alternative B, although I find myself sympathetic   to the assessment of risk language in alternative A  The incoming information we have received   since our last meeting has led me to believe that the economy may not be as firmly footed as I   thought at our last meeting  However, my sentiment about the underlying strength in the   economy has taken more than a few turns in the past year, and I think the assessment of risk   language in alternative A may convey greater certainty over these real-side risks than I think we   currently know  So I think that removing the “additional firming” phrase that we’ve been using   for some time more accurately reflects how the softer tone in the incoming data has influenced   my assessment of risks  It’s still my view that the predominant risk that we face comes from the   possibility that we’re not making the kind of progress we want to make against the inflation trend   that I believe our policies are trying to engineer  So I’m comfortable with no change in the fed   funds rate today and the language in alternative B  I am indifferent about the issue of whether   we use “principal” or “predominant”  I think that, perhaps because you’ve used the word   “predominant” in your testimony, using it here helps us, but I can go either way  Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I also want to thank the staff for the   memos that were sent out before the meeting  They were very helpful in preparing for this   meeting   I am in favor of defining our price stability objective numerically  As others have noted,   being more explicit about our price objective will enhance both external and internal policy   discussions, improve our transparency, and help coordinate the public’s expectations about   inflation  Although my expectations about the gains that we can expect from adopting a   numerical inflation objective are modest for the short term, I think that over the long term the   benefits will prove to be more significant     March 20-21, 2007 141 of 196    My preferred price index is the headline CPI  I prefer the CPI mainly because it is   familiar and better understood by the public than other inflation measures  In addition, the fact   that the tax code, Social Security benefits, TIPS, and many other contracts are indexed to the CPI   means that people probably focus more on it than alternative measures  Also, research done by   my staff suggests that both near-term and longer-term household inflation expectations are more   strongly correlated with the behavior of the CPI and its core measures than with the PCE   alternatives  I understand that a lot of people prefer the PCE because of the fairly substantial role   of owners’ equivalent rent in the CPI  However, it’s worth noting that the small weight placed   on the OER in the PCE is a result of the larger weights placed on medical services and   nonmarket activities, each of which comes with its own problems  Because a numerical   objective could provide predictability and confidence in the purchasing power of money, I favor   expressing our objective in terms of an overall inflation measure rather than the core measure    Though core measures are certainly important for helping us to disentangle the trend in headline   inflation from temporary influences, I think it is the overall inflation rate that is important in a   welfare sense  For that reason, it makes sense to me to express our objectives in terms of the   overall measure   If the Committee were to choose the headline CPI, I would favor a midpoint target of   2 percent and an acceptable range around the midpoint of plus or minus 1 percentage point  If   the majority of the Committee prefers the PCE, I would choose a midpoint of 1¾ percent  A few   years ago I gave a speech on this issue and noted that I would choose 1½ percent, but because of   the revisions that were received last year, I moved that up to 1¾ percent  Whichever measure we   might choose, I would like to see the objective expressed in terms of an average over the medium   term, say three to five years  To me, the real discipline of an objective comes when it is   March 20-21, 2007 142 of 196    measurable but also realistic  So stating our objective in terms of an average achieved over a few   years provides a reasonable way for the public to explicitly gauge our performance  I should be   clear, however, that I don’t think that any deviation from this performance objective should   automatically trigger action by the Committee  However, it is quite reasonable and useful for us   to provide an explanation or a plan of action, depending on the circumstances, if we look over a   recent three-year to five-year period and find that we missed our stated inflation goal or if we   look forward and see that we’re likely to miss that goal   To the question of how often we set an objective, I agree with President Lacker,   Governor Mishkin, and a few others that we should just set it and forget it  [Laughter]  The staff   may tell us that there are some governance issues to address, and it might be desirable for voting   members to reconfirm the objective at the start of each year  But the presumption should be that,   once it’s chosen, the objective should be reframed only if there is a compelling and easily   explained reason to do so   In regard to the questions pertaining to the group, my first choice would be to generate a   consensus objective and communicate the desired near-term range to the public  If we can’t   agree on the desirability of this option, I do favor sharing individual preferences as part of our   discussion in the Committee, and I would have no objections to having my preferred numerical   objective made public in the meeting minutes  Obviously, this conversation is going to be public   five years from now through the transcript anyway  I do believe that sharing our own thinking   about inflation objectives among ourselves has value  So I wouldn’t considerate it a deal-breaker   if others feel that we should keep this an internal discussion only  However, if we do have a   conversation about it, as others have pointed out, I presume that it is going to be reflected in the   minutes, and then people are going to wonder why we’re not sharing the information publicly    March 20-21, 2007 143 of 196    So it may be difficult to keep the details under wraps once we start making it public that we are   having these conversations   Regarding the proposal for the forecast narrative trial run, I think it is a good step for the   Committee to take  I would also like to commend Vincent and his staff for providing a useful   model  I like what the staff has proposed, including the summary information provided in the   two tables and in chart 1  I only have two changes to suggest  Others have already commented   on one of them, and that is the issue around uncertainty  I do think it’s important for us to   convey that there is some uncertainty around our forecast, but I’m not sure that using the   FRB/US-generated confidence intervals is the right way to go  But we can talk about that detail   at some other point  The other issue is the reference to potential output  It may be a good idea   for Committee members to comment on individual estimates of potential growth, but it may not   be a good idea to use the staff reference to potential growth without explicit guidance from the   Committee  But both of these are details  I support moving forward with the trial run and am   looking forward to seeing the outcome of that  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The economy from the perspective of the   Fourth District isn’t materially different from the way I heard Dave describe national conditions    Manufacturers in the District generally report modest but steady growth  In particular, metals   producers and their suppliers report strong orders and production  My business contacts are   May 9, 2007 39 of 130    telling me that capital investment is a bit soft, but it should not at this point pose a serious   problem for the overall economy     I’ve had several meetings with homebuilders throughout my District in the past few   weeks, and they confirmed some of the information that we see in the national data—sales are   still very anemic, and the inventory of unsold homes remains quite high  They also shared some   information that is not easy to pull from the national indicators  For example, sales of starter and   lower-end homes are particularly slow, in part because lending standards have been significantly   tightened  This means that there has been a shift in the composition of homes sold toward the   upper end of the price spectrum, causing the reported sales-price data to be a little inflated  The   builders I spoke with assure me that price discounts are occurring and that the discounts have   been substantial  Likewise, I am told that appraisers are increasingly being asked by lenders to   do whatever possible to appraise the properties relative to current market conditions and to   discount price information from the historical comparables  My contacts are also saying that the   expectation that home prices are going to fall further has been keeping some buyers on the   sidelines for now  I also hear that, when possible, residential contractors are shifting resources to   nonresidential projects  Some nationally publicly traded home construction companies are   completing houses and selling them for a loss in some markets just so that they can exit those   markets more quickly  What I take away from my conversations with homebuilders and lenders   is that the national data may not yet fully have caught up with the poor conditions in the   residential construction sector and, further, those closest to the markets are betting that any   semblance of a recovery is still a long way off   This information had an influence on the economic projections that I submitted for   today’s meeting  Like the Greenbook, which as a consequence of more weakness in residential   May 9, 2007 40 of 130    construction has shaved an additional 05 percentage point off GDP growth in the latter half of   this year, I have marked down my expectations for growth in 2007  My projection sees a little   more growth relative to what I see in the Greenbook as we move into 2008 and 2009, although I   do see slower economic growth as an obvious risk to my outlook  I’m especially concerned   about the possibility of some spillover from the housing sector to the business investment   outlook   My inflation projection calls for a slightly more optimistic trend in core PCE than what I   see in the Greenbook  I had difficulty endorsing a three-year projection that doesn’t assume that   our policies are going to be positioned so that we eventually bring core PCE inflation back below   2 percent, if only just below  So my inflation projection represents my interpretation of   appropriate monetary policy—namely one that will bring core PCE in under 2 percent  My   economic projection is, therefore, based on a federal funds rate path that is very similar to the   Greenbook baseline, a constant path over the projection period; but I have assumed a slightly   more optimistic price path for oil  Given Karen’s comments this morning, I am a little more   comfortable with that assumption  I also have slightly more potential than the Greenbook does    So with these two assumptions, I do have a slightly lower path for inflation than the Greenbook   does  Obviously, these assumptions are not made with great conviction, and inflation may   continue to track just north of 2 percent  If it does, we do risk conditioning expectations to this   level, and that is an outcome that I would not welcome   I had an opportunity just a few weeks ago to spend a day with Paul Volcker, who visited   Cleveland  On the subject of inflation, he reminded me that in his experience big inflations start   out as a tolerance of modest inflations  Once inflation expectations drag their anchor a little, it’s   May 9, 2007 41 of 130    difficult and costly to get them re-anchored; and this, I think, remains the biggest risk that we   face as a Committee  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support the recommendation embodied by   alternative B  The Committee last time wanted to introduce a little more flexibility into the   statement while not sending a message that our resolve about achieving price stability had changed    It took a while for that message to get through, but it did  Since not much has changed in the way   May 9, 2007 86 of 130    the economy is unfolding relative to our expectations since the last meeting, I would prefer to make   only the essential adjustments to the statement, such as acknowledging the recent slowing in   economic activity  In the spirit of making only minimal changes, I would not add the clause “on   balance” to the sentence on core inflation  We had the benefit of asking what we were trying to   convey with that phrase and heard Vincent’s comments about time-series and cross-sectional   perspectives, but the markets aren’t going to have the benefit of that explanation until they get the   minutes  I am also concerned that introducing the language about uncertainty around inflation is   going to have the markets trying to interpret what we are trying to say  They have a lower path to   the fed funds rate built into their expectations, and I think they have been looking for language to   help support that position; our saying that we are uncertain about inflation may appear to them as a   bit dovish rather than hawkish  So I would just rather keep things where they are today, with very   few changes to our language  I support alternative B without “on balance,” but that is obviously not   a show stopper  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  News from the Fourth District is   little changed from my last report  The District economy continues to be weighed down   by weakness in the housing market, and there is general consensus among my contacts   that the housing sector has not yet seen bottom  To date, adverse spillovers from housing   to other sectors of the economy have not been observed, although this remains a   significant risk to the outlook     While I have heard some reports from my business contacts that the labor market   is strengthening, the official data still do not show net employment growth in the region    My projections for the national economy still call for growth to resume to a more typical   expansionary pace as we move beyond 2007  My projection for GDP is slightly stronger   June 27-28, 2007 57 of 261    than what is seen in the latest Greenbook because of my assumption for slightly stronger   growth in potential  Obviously, I don’t make that judgment with great confidence    However, the business leaders I talk with tell me that their plans to expand capital are   consistent with a pickup in productivity growth from its recent cyclical low  This   includes the Cleveland Cavaliers—[laughter]—a franchise which, as many of you know,   experienced a substantial productivity shortfall against the San Antonio Spurs a couple of   weeks ago  [Laughter]  Here, too, we are projecting a good rebound, so to speak, in   2008  In the meantime, I would like the record to show that I am making good on my   wager with President Fisher  I brought with me a selection of Cleveland’s finest, and I   will present those to Richard after this meeting with my heartfelt congratulations  I am   putting this back, because it feels funny having a beer bottle in my hand  [Laughter]     I also extend my heartfelt congratulations to the Spurs on their   fourth and final NBA championship  [Laughter]  Now, turning to inflation, I am hearing   reports of upward price pressures across a handful of industrial commodities, and notably   for metals  But wage pressures remain modest  Nevertheless, for the first time in more   than a year, I am hearing from my business contacts that they are concerned about   inflation  They are bringing inflation concerns up with me, and they are telling me that   they concur with the Committee’s assessment that inflation remains a risk  To be sure,   there were many positive signs in the May CPI report  The traditional core CPI beat   expectations, and while the trimmed mean estimators that we produce in Cleveland were   a little higher than the measure excluding food and energy, even those indicators were   June 27-28, 2007 58 of 261    consistent with the moderation and the longer-term inflation trend we expect to see    Looking at the core measures enables me to be encouraged by the May CPI report  But   that view is a rather hard sell to a public that saw headline CPI inflation rise 8½ percent   at an annualized rate last month  Indeed, our readings of the underlying inflation trend   and what people are feeling in their wallets have been at odds for many years now   I understand that our policies are not well advised or even equipped to address   transitory price movements  But at some point, large and persistent price disturbances,   such as we have seen in energy markets, warrant our attention  If these isolated price   pressures become more generalized and enter into consumer and business   decisionmaking, we could easily find ourselves living in the Greenbook’s “drifting   inflation expectations” scenario   In summary, I think the housing market still presents a risk that the economy may   not resume a more typical growth trajectory over the forecast period  Nonetheless, that   concern is trumped by the risk that we may yet lose the public’s confidence that we are   making sustainable progress against inflation  Therefore, I continue to believe that the   predominant risk going forward is that inflation will fail to moderate as expected  Thank   you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I also support the policy action in   alternative B  I have some of the same concerns that President Lacker and President   Plosser, and also President Yellen in her letter, raised about the increasing difficulty in   characterizing inflation without having a clear sense of the Committee’s longer-term   objective on inflation  I also mentioned yesterday that I have some concerns about   claiming that inflation has moderated at the same time that we see the headline measure   rising  I find this to be a real problem, and I therefore like the suggestion that President   Fisher made  However, I am concerned about introducing yet another concept or another   measure of inflation in our statement  I hope that through the minutes we will be able to   raise our concern about the headline measure staying stubbornly high  But without   further communication, introducing yet another concept, or another measure of inflation,   in our statement is going to confuse markets  So I support making as little change as we   can to the statement, and I am comfortable with the way the most recent alternative B is   presented—although I can also support Governor Kohn’s suggestion about the word   “pressure”  So I support alternative B, with some of the minor changes that Governor   Kohn has made  Thank you     Yes, I have a question on the timing of the Chairman’s   testimony  Are those dates set by law?     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I, like President Moskow, find it very   difficult to find any disagreement with what you propose  I’m very supportive of the   approach you’ve laid out for the reasons that you articulated so clearly  I support extending   the forecast period  You mentioned going to a third year; you also suggested maybe a three-  to-five-year average  I’m leaning toward the three-to-five-year average because I had   proposed a five-year extension of the forecast period—the two years that we currently use   and then adding the fifth year  But your three-to-five-year average makes perfect sense to   me   I’m very supportive of using a total inflation number  President Hoenig mentioned   that he had a preference for the total CPI and so do I for the reasons that you mentioned  It’s   a measure that the public currently understands, and it gets a lot of publicity  But as you   point out, if we start using the PCE deflator, the public will start to focus on that measure  I   like the approach of having quarterly releases of our projections  That seems appropriate    June 27-28, 2007 158 of 261    Last year we saw that when we release our forecasts only twice a year, they can become   outdated rather quickly  So giving more information on a quarterly basis would allow us to   keep our forecasts more current  I would like us to spend more time talking about whether   we assume an optimal policy because, as Governor Kohn pointed out, we’re going to get   pressure to release our fed funds rate path because people are going to want more   clarification of what we mean by “appropriate” monetary policy or “optimal” monetary   policy  Finally, I like the fact that your approach retains the current structure of the Federal   Reserve System and allows us to give our own forecasts, letting the public see the diversity   of opinion around that forecast  We are going to have to discuss when it will be appropriate   for us to talk about our individual forecasts because, once we start to give the public more   information about the Committee’s views on certain things, the public will want to find out   where the differences are  Then we will have to have some agreement about whether it’s   appropriate to talk individually about how we see our differences from the Committee  But   these are details that we can talk about with more time  In general, I’m very supportive of   the approach that you’ve laid out today   I know we’ve been asked to answer some of Vincent’s questions and respond to   some proposals that Governor Kohn put out, and I’ll just make a few comments  I do want   to proceed with the projection  I mentioned that quarterly would be fine  Regarding when   the projections should be finalized, I support doing it at the end of the week and using the   same rules that we use for the minutes currently—not to bring in new data that we receive    In terms of the benefits and costs of further expediting the minutes, I think, like President   Moskow, that the benefits are minor compared with some of the costs  The current process   June 27-28, 2007 159 of 261    is giving more time for members to give thoughtful input into those minutes, and I wouldn’t   want to change that  Those items complete my comments  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you  I’m basically happy with the statement the way it is   now  Like President Stern, I was leaning on the side of making it shorter, but when I started   to look at where I would cut, it was very hard to come up with places to cut  I don’t think   that adopting some of the changes that you outlined earlier will shorten the statement  It   June 27-28, 2007 203 of 261    could change how we characterize elements of the statement, especially the rationale   section  When we talk about economic growth, we can characterize it more as it relates to   the central tendency projections that we’ve provided  Then when we characterize inflation,   rather than using words like “remains elevated” or “will moderate further,” the public will   have the benefit of our projections on a quarterly basis, and it might be easier then to   describe how we view the inflation situation  Then also by adopting a total measure for   inflation, it will be easier and, again, clearer when we’re saying words like “inflation” or   “inflationary pressures”  The public will better understand what measure we’re looking at    So I don’t think that the new approach or the revised approach would change the length, but   it might help us in the communication process, and I’m happy with the way that we’re doing   the risk assessment in the statement now   In terms of governance, I think that the public views the statement as a product of   the Committee deliberations, and for that reason I think having the Committee vote on the   full statement would be helpful  In that regard, Vice Chairman Geithner made a comment   earlier about if we go that approach, let’s make fewer changes at the table and focus on   giving our input to the statement before the meeting  If we do some of the editing at the   table, we don’t have time to reflect on how those changes will be interpreted  So having   fewer changes at the table would be helpful  Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The reports that I am hearing from   business leaders in the Fourth District lead me to conclude that the pace of economic activity   hasn’t changed a great deal since our last meeting  However, the uncertainties surrounding the   business climate seem to have risen measurably  The troubled housing sector is still weighing on   the region, as it is nationally  I now have little doubt that this theme is going to recur throughout   the balance of the year and perhaps well beyond  My view of the housing sector conforms   closely to the way housing is depicted in the Greenbook baseline, but I have had many   conversations in the past few weeks with anxious industry insiders, who believe that housing   markets are likely to worsen substantially over the balance of the year with the possibility of   significant spillovers to other sectors of the economy  The stories they tell me sound a lot like   the greater housing correction scenarios that are depicted in the Greenbook  Indeed, casualties in   the mortgage markets are rising, and I am hearing more and more that the fallout from housing is   affecting deals in other sectors of the economy  For example, I talked with a CEO who runs a   August 7, 2007 37 of 136    large national real estate development company  He told me that some of his projects are being   held up by his investment banker’s inability to price deals and to bring them to market  Where   the deals can be priced, risk spreads have widened across a range of issuers and financial   instruments  This CEO’s comments are very much in line with the points that Bill Dudley made   in his report earlier this morning   Because of these uncertainties in financial markets, some of my contacts confirm that   they have been reevaluating their capital formation plans  They are trimming their projections of   some of the projects that they are going to put on the books, and that led me to trim my   projection for business fixed investment accordingly  Even with this adjustment, however, I am   concerned that the pattern of business investment that I have incorporated into my GDP   projections for this meeting may still be somewhat optimistic  This is a risk to the outlook that   was not on my radar screen at our last meeting   The June retail price measures gave us more evidence that the inflation trend may be   coming down  Inflation moderated in the second quarter, as measured by the median CPI and   the 16-percent trimmed mean that we produce at the Cleveland Fed  I am not yet persuaded that   this progress will be sustained, but the patterns in the June data were promising  My projection   for inflation in the outyears of the forecast are actually a little more favorable than what is in the   Greenbook baseline, primarily because I still expect a bit more potential GDP growth than the   Greenbook envisions  So I am feeling more comfortable about the inflation risks than I have felt   for a while but less comfortable about the real-side risks  My overall risk assessment is moving   closer into balance  Nevertheless, I still think that inflation is the predominant risk we face   today  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  As I said earlier, I do think that the risks   to the outlook for economic growth have increased while the risks to the outlook for inflation   have moderated but are still to the upside  So I found the suggestion on page 25 of the Bluebook   that we might want to mix and match the alternative A and B language appealing, but I did think   that changing our statement in that way could convey a greater shift in our risk assessment than I   believe is warranted today  So I think the revised version of alternative B makes the modest but   important adjustment of acknowledging the recent change in credit conditions in the rationale   section, and it signals the greater downside risks to growth in the risk assessment section  So I   support our alternative B—that is, no change in the fed funds rate today and the language that is   in the revised version  Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The reports that I am hearing from my   business contacts reflect a sudden and a significant deterioration in their evaluation of the   business climate  The data in hand, except for the troubling August employment report, have not   been especially dire, and neither are the impressions I get from the business community   regarding their current pace of economic activity  In fact, by most accounts, business activity in   the Fourth District, outside of the residential real estate market, remains reasonably positive, and   the Beige Book report that we submitted for this meeting reflects that view  In most cases, the   sharp downward reassessment of the business situation that I am now hearing from my contacts   describes greater unease over what may happen and not what has happened  As we discussed   earlier, our forecast models are not well equipped to accommodate the role that shifting   expectations play in shaping the economic outlook  Nevertheless, the sharp falloff in business   confidence that I am hearing from people in many sectors in the District has had a material   influence on the economic projections that I submitted for this meeting    The market for real estate is still declining, perhaps even in a freefall, according to the   descriptions I have been getting from people across the sector, including real estate   professionals, developers, and manufacturers of home construction supplies and materials  I   September 18, 2007 57 of 188    don’t pretend to have a very confident forecast of where the bottom of the residential real estate   market lies, but the industry sources that I am talking to have convinced me that we should   anticipate that this process will play itself out for a considerable time to come  Moreover, and   unlike my last report to the Committee, my business contacts are now fearful that we are going to   see a spillover from the declines in the residential real estate market, and they now expect some   amount of retrenchment by consumers  I have incorporated some of that sentiment into my   outlook  The most noteworthy development affecting my economic projection, however, has   been the deterioration in business confidence and the effect that deterioration may have on   capital expansion plans  The diminished confidence in the outlook that business leaders are   reporting to me has had a significant negative effect on my outlook for investment  Like the   Greenbook, I have scaled back my growth outlook to reflect a considerably softer trajectory for   business fixed investment  Even with a monetary policy response, the combination of weaker   consumer and business spending has led me to mark down my GDP projection for next year   nearly ½ percentage point, to 2 percent   Meanwhile, the incoming inflation report continues to point to a gradual disinflation    The usual caveats about inflation forecasts apply, of course, but I am not seeing in the data—and   I am not hearing from my business contacts—the same concern over rising prices that I heard in   the spring  My outlook for inflation hasn’t changed that much since July  I am still expecting   core PCE inflation to be just under 2 percent  But I am more confident, if just a little, that we are   seeing the progress toward price stability that we had hoped to achieve     So I believe that the risks to the outlook, given no change in our policy, have shifted   decisively toward potential rapid deterioration in the real economy  Some of that deterioration   may reflect the unwinding of earlier financial imbalances, and every prudent effort should be   September 18, 2007 58 of 188    made to allow that process to run its course  But the moral hazard caveat does not diminish the   significance of the falloff in business sentiment that I have heard since our last meeting, and so I   am concerned that we have seen greater risk to the economic outlook since our last meeting    Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Given the shift that I am projecting in   economic outlook, I think that a more decisive action is called for today, and I support a 50 basis   point cut in the fed funds target rate  In the past few meetings I was in favor of setting our fed funds   target rate above neutral to secure progress for disinflation, but that stance no longer seems   compelling  Recent inflation reports have been encouraging, and my outlook for inflation shows   inflation remaining in an acceptable range  Furthermore, an above-neutral stance does not seem   prudent given my projection for economic growth  I’m in favor of moving our policy stance back to   neutral  Obviously it is difficult to know exactly where that is; but if the economy is in the midst of   a rapid adjustment, I would prefer not to be behind the curve  So I would prefer not to be chasing   neutral down  Gradualism has its place, but in this instance I would prefer a more aggressive move   September 18, 2007 106 of 188    today and to not leave markets with an expectation of a long sequence of moves, as others have   already noted   I prefer the language of alternative B  Yes, we may see a great falloff in confidence and a   further deterioration in the economic outlook, but the recent business pessimism that I talked about   earlier may also prove to be unfounded  Therefore, I’d prefer not to lock ourselves into further rate   reductions  I also like the uncertainty language that’s been added to the new version of alternative   B  I think, again, with the 50 basis point move today there’s a good chance that we’ll be close to   neutral, and that’s exactly where I think we should be with the uncertainty that many of us see in the   outlook  I also take very seriously the risk of undermining the appropriate pricing of risk in   financial markets that we face  The long-run success of a decisive move today pivots on the ability   to make clear that we take such action in recognition of the current economic environment and that   it is not a rush to protect investors from poor past business decisions  So I support a clear statement   that, should be we later find ourselves in calmer financial waters and stronger economic winds, we   will move quickly to affirm our commitment to achieving and maintaining price stability  Now,   because of this preference for downplaying the financial market disruptions, I think a simple way to   remove at least one reference to them is to end paragraph 2 after the word “arise”—so “today’s   action is intended to help forestall some of the adverse effects on the broader economy that might   otherwise arise”  That gets rid of one reference to disruptions in financial markets  Also, the last   part of that statement on promoting moderate growth over time almost gets lost in that language, so   it might be simpler to just end the paragraph after “arise”  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  My inclination after reading the memo over   the weekend was to be supportive of the proposal  However, given some of the comments that I’ve   heard from my colleagues today, I welcome the additional time to think about some of the concerns,   especially some of the issues that President Rosengren raised about only five institutions borrowing    I have some of the same concerns that President Hoenig raised about whether introducing a   proposal like this during these times really does address the stigma issue  Then the memo also   raises the issue that there is a risk that such a program would exacerbate the moral hazard problem,   and I’m concerned about this  But I heard a lot of comments today around this table that, in terms   of financial stress, it’s critical that we do the right thing and play the appropriate central bank role    So, again, I like other comments that were made earlier  We have a great staff, a skilled staff, which   came up with a very creative proposal, and my inclination is to support it  I am pleased that we   have the additional time to think about some of these issues so that I can better understand some of   the concerns that were raised  Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Like many others around the table, my report   to this Committee in September indicated a sharp deterioration in business confidence  My business   contacts were concerned about what may happen  During the intermeeting period I heard less about   what may happen and more about what is actually happening  My contacts who are linked to   residential real estate have seen a further and, in some cases, sharp drop-off in business activity  My   banking supervision and regulation staff told me just a few days ago that they’re now seeing a   sudden and sizable percentage increase in nonperforming loans at a number of large banking   companies in my District  To be sure, nonperforming loans had been at extremely low levels, and   most of the sharp rise can be traced to mortgage and construction development lending  But I’m   now beginning to hear reports that bankers are experiencing some loan performance problems   outside their real estate portfolio  The CEO of a large, major bank in my District has also reported   difficulty in securitizing the student loans that they’re making, forcing them to keep those loans on   their books and to make adjustments elsewhere in their balance sheets  To what extent these   banking conditions are affecting overall bank lending is not obvious, but clearly there has been   some disruption to the channels of intermediation, and I am now beginning to hear reports of some   spillover to other sectors of the economy  A growing number of retailers tell me that they have seen   a noticeable decline in spending since mid-September in items ranging from autos to apparel   While my reports from the business community reflect a falloff in business conditions from   what we submitted to the Beige Book just a few weeks ago, they don’t necessarily indicate a   significant deviation from the slowdown that was already built into the economic projections that I   submitted in September  In preparing for this meeting, I found it difficult to judge whether the   reports of weakness that I am hearing represent an unfolding of the September projection or   additional deterioration in the outlook  In the end, I have only minor differences with the   October 30-31, 2007 41 of 162    Greenbook projection in the near term and, like the Greenbook, made only minor revisions to my   forecast  I see economic activity a bit softer than the Greenbook for the remainder of 2007, but I   project slightly better growth in 2008  Like the Greenbook, I have assumed an unchanged path for   the fed funds rate over the forecast period  The recent rise in oil prices has caused me to push up   my near-term PCE projection, but inflation expectation projections remain anchored around   2 percent  I see a small upside risk to the near-term inflation projection as a result of the continuing   dollar depreciation; but on the whole, I continue to judge our inflation risks as reasonably balanced   I would like to conclude by echoing the sentiments of others around the table  Considerable   strains in the financial sector remain, and further turmoil in markets is a distinct possibility  I think   that, in this environment, households and businesses can easily be spooked—excuse the Halloween   pun—and I don’t think it would take much additional tightness in credit markets to push my fragile   near-term growth outlook even lower  So this concern continues to be the predominant risk to my   outlook  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I, like several of my colleagues who have   gone ahead of me, find myself torn between alternatives A and B  I also wrestled with many of the   issues that President Plosser articulated so well  I left our September meeting thinking that the 50   basis point cut pretty much put us close to where we needed to be given our outlook, and my   outlook hasn’t changed much in the past six weeks  As I said yesterday, I’m not certain about   whether the weakness that I’m hearing or have heard about during this intermeeting period is simply   October 30-31, 2007 114 of 162    evidence of the business conditions that are unfolding as I thought they would or whether there is   more weakness than I anticipated in September and more weakness than I have reflected in my   projection  The Committee has said repeatedly and for good reason that our decisions are going to   be dependent on the incoming data, and as many have already said, the data seem to be confirming   my outlook  But financial markets do remain on edge  Moreover, many of the incoming data are   backward looking and, hence, don’t provide me with great comfort when we’re trying to ascertain   what might lie ahead  The projection that I submitted for this meeting, as I said yesterday, is rather   fragile, and it wouldn’t take much additional market turmoil or deterioration in household and   business confidence to push my near-term growth outlook even lower  So I think this risk is the   predominant one that we face today, and it is a risk that has weighed heavily on my deliberations for   this meeting   The assessment of risk language in alternative B addresses these concerns, and I was   contemplating supporting no change in the fed funds rate and the language in alternative B    However, in the climate that we find ourselves, I believe that just saying that the risk to the outlook   is to the downside isn’t enough  I do think that we should be taking out some insurance against   possible further deterioration in the near-term outlook  So I support a 25 basis point cut in the fed   funds rate target today, and I support the language that’s embodied in alternative A  I believe that   the language does acknowledge the likely slowdown in the economic expansion  It also   acknowledges that, if we take this action today, the risks are roughly balanced, and importantly, it   suggests that further policy easing may not be forthcoming  I also like the language that was added   regarding the recent inflation numbers  Finally, as Governor Mishkin pointed out, it is difficult to   express all of these issues in our short statement  It seems to me that we can draw some comfort   from the fact that the minutes will be providing the public with a greater understanding of the   October 30-31, 2007 115 of 162    different views that were expressed today and some of the challenges that I wrestled with  Thank   you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I, first of all, want to start off with   commending the staff for addressing many of the issues that were raised the last time we talked   about this proposal  However, I still have two remaining concerns regarding adopting this   facility at this time  The first concern has to do with the timing of the facility  In the staff’s   memo and then in Brian’s comments, there was a concern about the limited fashion in which this   facility can be used before year-end  This could imply that the facility may be inadequate to   address some of these current pressures and those to come in the next few weeks  I also have   some apprehension about our ability to educate the banks in a timely fashion about this facility    That’s my first concern, the timing  Is this going to be enough quickly enough?  My second   concern, and it relates to all three proposals, has to do with the stigma  We’ve talked about that   extensively here today—whether this facility is going to help deal with the stigma effect   I have been leaning toward supporting a proposal that would narrow the spread between   the primary credit rate and the fed funds rate  One reason that I was leaning toward it is that, in   recent days, several of the bankers in my District with whom I talked made that suggestion,   saying that it would go a long way in their eyes to alleviate some of their funding pressures  But   they didn’t have the option of commenting on this term auction facility  I didn’t present it as an   alternative  I don’t know whether, if they had been presented with this alternative, they would   have preferred it  The bottom line is that I was leaning toward supporting the narrowing of the   spread between the primary credit rate and the fed funds rate; however, I do believe that we need   to take some action to alleviate some of the funding pressures that we’re seeing in financial   December 6, 2007 26 of 51    markets  So I support moving ahead with the TAF and the swap agreement with the ECB    Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The conversations that I have had with my   business contacts indicate that business conditions in our region have clearly softened since the   last meeting and perhaps even more than what is reflected in the Beige Book report that we   prepared just a few weeks ago  A sense of pessimism about the economic outlook seems once   again to be sweeping over our business community, and it is not just the financial community    This is a decided change from what I was hearing in October and is clearly an added threat to our   December 11, 2007 47 of 138    already fragile outlook  My banking supervision staff reports that the District banks continue to   address the risks in their portfolios by shifting focus away from residential and commercial real   estate and by requiring more collateral, stronger covenants, and better debt-service coverage in   their deals  But our examiners are not reporting that capital positions of our financial institutions   have been impaired such that they cannot accommodate sound projects  A few of the corporate   CFOs I talk with say that credit commitments are more difficult to come by  The CEOs of the   Fourth District financial institutions advise me that what we are facing is a liquidity squeeze and   not at present a credit crunch  That said, these bank CEOs have expressed concern that their   capital positions could become impaired if the current pressure for more liquidity forces them to   sell some of their assets at large discounts   The incoming data for the economy appear to be unfolding reasonably close to my   October projection  I was fairly pessimistic about our near-term growth prospects, and that   pessimism seems to have been well founded  So the economic data by themselves haven’t been   enough to push me off the forecast trajectory that I submitted at our last meeting  But as I noted   earlier, I do observe a sharp drop in business confidence across a broad collection of industries,   not just those tied to residential real estate  What I am hearing sounds more substantial than the   transitory slowing that I was projecting just six weeks ago  What I am hearing from my business   contacts is probably more aligned with the prolonged slow growth outlook that I now see in the   Greenbook baseline, or worse  I am somewhat thankful that I didn’t have to submit a projection   for this meeting because I am torn between what my mostly data-driven model says and what I   am hearing from my business sources  About the only thing that I can say with much confidence   is that the reemergence of liquidity pressures, combined with the deterioration in business   confidence, has increased the downside risk to growth  I think it is prudent to address that risk   December 11, 2007 48 of 138    with our policy decision today, but I will hold my comments about our policy moves for later in   the meeting  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I favor a 25 basis point cut in our fed   funds rate target and the language in alternative B  More losses at financial companies, in   combination with uncertain year-end funding pressures, obviously have unsettled financial   markets again  As I said earlier, sentiment about business conditions next year have become   considerably more pessimistic in the past few weeks  In this environment, leaning toward   caution and providing the added short-term liquidity that markets appear to need makes sense to   me  Although I can see the arguments for a 50 basis point adjustment in our policy rate, I am   inclined to think that a lesser policy response is called for     As others have indicated, it may be that a 25 basis point action is going to prove to be   insufficient, and another cut might be necessary  But I am also mindful that efforts to address   the problems that are affecting the real economy have the potential to aggravate inflation   expectations  Indeed, by some cuts of the TIPS data and from a few reports that I am receiving   from business contacts about rising commodity prices and rising import prices, inflation   expectations may be tugging on their anchor just a bit  Given these considerable uncertainties, I   think smaller moves are preferable to larger ones  At this time, I simply can’t assess with any   December 11, 2007 112 of 138    useful precision how to weigh the risks we face, only that the risks we face are very difficult    Consequently, I favor the language expressed in alternative B as it is currently written  Thank   you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I, too, am troubled by the weakness in the   real economy data that we are seeing  Our Beige Book contacts confirm the weakness, and my   January 9, 2008 31 of 60    business contacts to whom I have been talking report more weakness than they did before our   December meeting  However, they are not flashing signals about a recession  Next week we   will learn more about just how weak the fourth quarter was through the retail sales and industrial   production releases for December  Next week we are also going to get the December CPI report    In my view, the October and November reports were very disappointing  In November,   60 percent of the CPI market basket prices increased at rates of 3 percent or greater   On learning of today’s meeting, I was concerned about making a large policy move ahead   of the December CPI report for fear that we would be damaging some of our credibility on price   stability, so I did not want to make a move at today’s meeting  However, I can support a   50 basis point reduction at our meeting at the end of the month if we are regarding that   reduction—and regarding our cumulative policy actions—as just offsetting the decline in the   equilibrium real rate and we are not being aggressively accommodative  That would be, in my   view, appropriate policy given my concerns about inflation  But the public could interpret our   actions as being aggressively accommodative and that we are downplaying inflation risks  So I   hope, Mr Chairman, that you will be able to communicate your thinking on this, as you have   with us today, in some of your upcoming public statements  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support your proposal for a 75 basis   point reduction in the fed funds rate today  At the time of our last call, I was hesitant about   moving because it was in advance of some important data  Obviously, we got those data, and   they were very weak  Financial conditions, as many have indicated, have also deteriorated  My   conversations with the bankers in my District indicate that the earnings reports that are coming   out will demonstrate that problems have spread beyond just the mortgage sector  They are also   seeing deterioration in credit card and other consumer debt  I think that it is important that we   move in a timely and an aggressive way  I don’t think that there is much to gain by waiting   another week  In this environment, I do believe that we should make every effort to make sure   that we are more accommodative and not stay inadvertently restrictive, as the evidence suggests   we are today  So I do support moving 75 basis points today  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  In my view, economic conditions have   deteriorated significantly since our December meeting  Taken as a whole, the stories that have been   relayed to me by my Fourth District business contacts have been downbeat, and several of the   contacts are concerned that we may be slipping into a recession  I’m hearing that consumer   spending has declined appreciably since the soft December retail sales numbers were reported  The   CFO of one of the nation’s major department store chains told me last week that her company’s   January sales are shaping up to be the worst that they have seen in the past twenty years  She said   that they had already cut back some of their buying plans because of the weak holiday sales, but   after seeing the numbers for the first three weeks of January, she is concerned that they have not cut   back buying plans enough  In December I had heard some upbeat assessments about the demand   for capital goods and exports, but in January the incoming numbers are softer, and expectations for   the coming year are less optimistic than they were just a month ago   I’m also concerned that I’m now detecting the first signals of a credit crunch  Bankers in   my District tell me that they’re finding it much more difficult to issue debt and that they are   safeguarding their capital  I’ve heard several motivations for this, depending on the institution    Some bankers are simply preparing for further losses  Some are expecting to have to bring some   downgraded assets back onto their balance sheets  Even those bankers who have adequate capital   January 29–30, 2008 76 of 249    say that they have become much more disciplined about how they’re going to allocate that capital    Collectively, the concerns that bankers have expressed to me about capital have convinced me that   credit will be less available and more expensive than it has been in quite a while  Deals that bankers   would have done for creditworthy borrowers not long ago are simply not being done today  Of   course, it’s possible that nonbank financial companies will step in and fill the gap, but it is not clear   to me that they have the capital and the risk appetites to do so   These developments have had a significant influence on the economic projection that I   submitted for today’s meeting  Like many around the table, I continue to mark down my outlook   for residential and nonresidential investment in response to the incoming data and also in response   to greater business pessimism about the economic prospects  In addition, I’ve built in a sharper and   more protracted slowing in consumer spending stemming from greater deterioration in the   household balance sheet and tighter credit market conditions  These adjustments have caused me to   cut my 2008 GDP growth projection about 1 percentage point since the December meeting, and   some of that weakness spills over to the out years  If credit conditions deteriorate further than I   have expected, then my projection would more closely resemble the persistent weakness alternative   scenario described in the Greenbook  But that isn’t my projection for the economy  Rather, my   projection is roughly in line with the Greenbook baseline   My inflation outlook hasn’t changed much from where it was in December—or October, for   that matter  Like the Greenbook, I still project inflation to moderate as commodity prices level off   and business activity wanes, but the risks to my inflation outlook have shifted to being weighted to   the upside  The December CPI report was not much improved from the troubling November data,   and my business contacts continue to report that commodity prices are being passed downstream    So I have less conviction in the inflation moderation than I did a month ago  That said, the   January 29–30, 2008 77 of 249    downside risks to the economy still dominate my thinking about the outlook today  I do believe,   however, that our policy response to date combined with an additional rate cut tomorrow will allow   the economy to regain some momentum as we move into the second half of 2008  Thank you, Mr   Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Like the Greenbook, my projection for the   real economy incorporates a sharp decline in the equilibrium real fed funds rate  Given the large   risks facing the real economy, I think we need to take precautions against having a restrictive fed   funds rate target  I think a 50 basis point cut in the target fed funds rate today may be large   enough to eliminate that possibility, although there is plenty of uncertainty around that estimate,   as we have been discussing  Based on my analysis, comments from my business contacts, and   what I have heard from all of you at this meeting, I feel very comfortable supporting this position   today  The economic environment has been volatile and highly uncertain, and I realize that my   outlook could change appreciably in the weeks and months ahead  I can imagine that my   January 29–30, 2008 118 of 249    economic projections will evolve in a way that supports even further reductions in the fed funds   rate target   At the same time, as I said yesterday, I am concerned about inflation risks and that they   may now be elevated  I can also imagine scenarios that would lead me to want to pursue a more   restrictive policy than would be appropriate based on the downside risk to growth alone  At   some point, on the margin, inflation concerns could become my dominant concern  We know   that inflation expectations play a crucial role in determining the inflation outlook  We have been   talking about that  But, unfortunately, we don’t really know all that much about what it is going   to take to unanchor inflation expectations  It is hard to know for certain how far out on the ice   we can skate without needing to worry that the ice has become too thin  I know that we are   bringing our best thinking to bear on this issue by developing diagnostic tools such as the   decomposition of inflation compensation into its component parts, as we talked about yesterday   and this morning  I hope that we are going to come to learn that these tools are useful guides to   policy, but we just don’t have enough experience with them to know how much confidence to   place in their estimates   Yesterday Governor Kohn told us about his conversation with Paul Volcker and that Paul   Volcker told him that unfortunately we do have experience of seeing the erosion of public   confidence in our ability to meet our price stability objective, and we know from this experience   that it makes the attainment of price stability more costly  But today I support the policy   directive expressed in alternative B  My concerns today are more with the downside risk to   economic growth  Given what I know today, I think it is the right course of action  I have   discovered during the past couple of weeks that I can be very nimble when it comes to the   January 29–30, 2008 119 of 249    reduction in our fed funds rate target  If inflation developments require, I want to be just as   nimble in the other direction  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Yes  I just wanted to clarify that we are being asked to authorize the   acceptance of different collateral  Who determines the size of the lending program on an   ongoing basis?  Is that determined by the Desk?     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Through my conversations with people in   the Fourth District financial community, I get the clear impression that some credit channels are   closing down  Given the uncertainties in financial markets, some of the large banks in my   District are finding it challenging to ascertain potential loss exposures in certain asset categories,   especially to residential real estate developers  Two large banks in the District have seen their   asset quality deteriorate more quickly than they had projected in January  Clearly, banks and   other financial institutions are getting squeezed from both sides of their balance sheets, and the   most highly leveraged institutions are getting squeezed the hardest  Many of the large banks in   my District are going to considerable lengths to stay liquid and to conserve capital  The largest   and most complex institutions are attempting to raise more capital     The deteriorating environment in the financial markets is clearly affecting business   conditions  Most manufacturers in the District have seen a slowing in business activity  Those   that are doing better are doing so because they are being helped some by stronger export   demand  Pessimism over economic prospects is now prevalent among the CEOs that I talked   with, and many are scaling back their business plans for 2008 by a considerable amount  The   faltering business prospects are making the financial environment even more uncertain—a   pattern that conforms to the adverse feedback loop that Governor Mishkin and others have been   warning about  Like others, I have once more cut my growth projections for 2008 and, again, by   a relatively large margin  As in the Greenbook, I have factored into my projection the weaker   March 18, 2008 37 of 127    than previously expected estimates of spending and employment as well as the sharp run-up in   energy costs     An especially important element in my current thinking is the future path of housing   values  Many of my contacts have told me that they don’t see how financial market conditions   can stabilize without more confidence about where the bottom of the housing market lies and, as   a corollary, where the bottom of the residential-mortgage-backed security prices might lie    Unfortunately, I haven’t seen evidence that we are seeing a leveling out in housing prices  The   Greenbook baseline projection carries with it nominal house-price declines of about 5 percent   this year and next  A month ago that may have seemed like a reasonably good assumption to me,   but today I fear that projection may be too optimistic  Certainly, the decline in house values that   one sees in futures markets for the markets that are covered by the Case-Shiller index indicates a   decline of twice that magnitude  My own baseline projection is closer to the “greater housing   correction” alternative than the Greenbook’s baseline projection  Even the “greater housing   correction with more financial fallout” alternative seems somewhat plausible to me   Turning to the inflation outlook, at our January meeting my modal outlook was one in   which the inflation trend declined to just below 2 percent in 2010  At the same time, I was one   of the few participants who said that the inflation risk had shifted to the upside  I still hold to   those views—that is, I still expect the trend of inflation to fall below 2 percent by 2010, but I still   worry that we are going to continue to experience upside surprises to that inflation outlook    Indeed, I can’t recall a single conversation that I have had with my business contacts recently   that hasn’t touched on the increasing cost pressures that they are facing  In most cases, they are   now successfully passing along price increases to their customers   March 18, 2008 38 of 127    Nevertheless, as I assess the economic environment this morning relative to where I was   in January, particularly given the prospects of yet larger wealth losses stemming from the real   estate market and certainly the chance for even greater impairment to the functioning of our   credit markets, I think the downside risks to economic growth continue to outweigh the upside   risks to inflation  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support your recommendation  As I said   earlier, I do see the risks to the Greenbook baseline as being skewed to the downside because of   the absence of any signs of a bottoming out in the housing market  As others have mentioned, I   am concerned about the risk that we will have a more protracted recession  At the same time, the   short-term inflation environment has deteriorated  I am also concerned about inflation   expectations becoming unanchored  As Governor Mishkin and others have said today, we face   some very unpleasant tradeoffs; but in the end, I support being more aggressive in our policy   actions today  I am hopeful that, as others have said, the language that we have added in   paragraph 3 about inflation risks and a reminder in the assessment-of-risk paragraph about our   dual mandate will be helpful in keeping inflation expectations from rising further  Thank you,   Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Regardless to whom I talk with these days,   the conversation quickly turns to both the fragile condition of financial markets and the spectacular   rise in energy and commodity prices  I had hoped that one of these problems would have gone   away by now, but clearly that is not how conditions have unfolded since our last meeting  The   bankers with whom I talked are paying close attention to their capital and liquidity positions  They   April 29–30, 2008 61 of 266    remain concerned about wide bid–asked spreads and low trading volumes in a broad array of   securities markets  Indeed, the repercussions of financial turmoil appear to have touched every   channel of credit intermediation  It appears that a rewiring of credit channels is simply going to take   some time to work out   The most significant financial news coming out of the Fourth District is the $7 billion   investment of new capital into National City Bank  National City is the country’s tenth largest   commercial bank, and its problems with mortgage-related credits are now well known  National   City still has much work to do to clean up its balance sheet, just as many other financial institutions   with impaired capital positions must do before they can stand on solid ground again  Although the   fragile state of the financial sector represents a pretty sizable risk to my economic outlook, the   National City situation, along with other stories I’m hearing, suggests that modest progress is being   made   With regard to District business conditions, the stories I hear remain downbeat  Commercial   builders are reporting mixed though generally positive first-quarter numbers  But their expectations   for retail sales in the stores that they lease out across the country have deteriorated, and they are   fairly pessimistic about 2008 growth prospects  One large national commercial developer whom I   talked with told me that, for the first time in his 45-year career, his company has seen sales declines   in March in every retail center that they own across the country  The manufacturers I talked with   indicated moderate first-quarter revenue growth as export markets, especially in Asia and Eastern   Europe, are still helping to sustain production despite weak domestic demand  At the same time,   manufacturers report intense commodity price pressures, and they report little resistance as they   attempt to pass along the rising cost of commodities to their customers   April 29–30, 2008 62 of 266    The projection I submitted for this meeting shows real GDP growth under 1 percent in 2008,   with virtually all of that growth coming in the second half of the year  This is a decidedly more   pessimistic projection than the one I submitted in January but not materially different from the   outlook when we met just six weeks ago  I have, however, boosted my headline inflation projection   for 2008 compared with what I submitted in January, and it is somewhat higher than what I was   estimating when we met in mid-March  Although I am still projecting that the slack in the economy   will be sufficient to bring the core inflation number under the 2 percent threshold sometime next   year, I am now anticipating a little more pass-through of commodity prices into core measures than   I thought probable six weeks ago  Indeed, every time I see commodity prices ratcheting up, I   become less confident that slack alone will be able to prevent an upward drift in the inflation trend    To be clear, I think the downside risks that we face in the real economy remain substantial, and I am   inclined to believe that some insurance against those risks is probably warranted  But in taking such   a step, I am inclined to judge that the downside risks we face in the real economy will be roughly in   balance with the upside risks that we face from a rising inflation trend  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  My concerns about the real economy are   similar to those that I had in March  I continue to believe that residential real estate markets could   deteriorate even further than what I have in my baseline projection and could exert even greater   downward pressure on business activity  Financial markets in my view are still fragile, and larger or   April 29–30, 2008 123 of 266    more-widespread liquidity pressures could quickly present us with an even weaker set of economic   fundamentals  At the same time, I can’t easily dismiss the ongoing escalation of energy and   commodity prices  Although many of us, as we talked about yesterday, have expected these price   pressures to abate for some time, they have not; and as I indicated yesterday, I do believe there is a   risk that core inflation will not follow the downward path that I submitted as my projection for this   meeting  So like others, I can see a case being made for alternative C  However, I think a modest   reduction to our policy rate today as a precaution against further slippage in the real economy is   prudent  But I also strongly support the language that indicates we’re very close to, if not at, a   pausing point in our easing cycle  So I support the policy recommendation and the language in   alternative B  Thank you       Thank you, Mr Chairman  Let me also start by commending the   authors of the papers that were prepared on this topic  I found the material very informative and   helpful  I agree with the objectives established by the staff to evaluate the set of proposals, and I   also support the process and the proposed timeline for moving the proposals forward  I think it is   good that the timeline provides for comments from banks so early in the process  It will be   important for us to receive their input at an early stage   I found option 2 to be preferable to option 1 because option 2, as we have discussed,   clearly reduces the administrative burdens relative to option 1  I think that option 3 leaves too   much potential for fed funds rate volatility in its corridor  I was also intrigued by option 4 with   caps  However, I ultimately rejected option 4 out of the concern that it might lead to a less   robust interbank lending market  But given the comments of President Lacker and others,   perhaps it makes sense to keep option 4 on the table  In the end, however, I am comfortable with   moving forward with our focus on options 2 and 5  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman The last two months have brought an   interesting shift in my conversations with my business contacts  Their concerns have shifted   from problems in financial markets to the rapid increase in input prices  Energy prices are the   June 24–25, 2008 61 of 253    focus nationwide, but steel prices are also capturing the attention of the business people in my   District  Several manufacturers and builders noted that the price they pay for steel has almost   doubled since the beginning of this year  Clearly, businesses are worried about signs of growing   price pressures, but their reactions to these price shocks tell a more complicated story  Many   manufacturers have not been able to pass on price increases, resulting in a clear loss to profit   margins  These businesses often report cost-containment or efficiency programs that will affect   their hiring and capital decisions for months to come   Interestingly, the consumer price data show a similar dichotomy  My staff noted that our   primary measures of core inflation are not providing a consistent story about the path of   underlying inflation  In the May CPI report, roughly one-third of the weighted price changes   increased at rates above 5 percent, and roughly one-third of prices changed by rates less than   1 percent  For example, while energy costs were up strongly and prices for a number of general   service components have been drifting higher, large declines in apparel and vehicle expenses are   imparting significant offsets  The 16 percent trimmed mean indicator showed an alarming   4 percent rise in prices, while the median rose just at 22 percent  The weight of price changes in   the 1 percent to 5 percent range was unusually small, making it difficult to estimate the central   tendency of the price change distribution with much confidence  So this makes it difficult to get   a good read on where future prices are headed   My District business contacts remain pessimistic about growth prospects  District retail   reports focused extensively on the likely effects of gasoline and food prices on the purchasing   decisions of consumers  Many manufacturers, builders, and distributors are facing complicated   output and investment decisions in the context of input price growth and weaker markets    Overall, most of the business people that I talk with are still quite cautious about their business   June 24–25, 2008 62 of 253    plans, despite the fact that most of them have found sources of credit and terms that are not too   elevated from what they have seen in previous years   In the economic projections that I submitted for this meeting, I raised my near-term   forecast for output growth slightly and for headline inflation slightly more  Over the medium   term, my outlook continues to be for modest growth because the housing market, in my forecast,   recovers slowly, actually more slowly than in the Greenbook  My staff estimated a model for   national housing starts that takes into account what has happened in the past in states that have   seen major increases in foreclosures  The real estate difficulties that these states faced were   much more persistent than anything that we have yet seen in the national data  The bottom line   of this analysis is that, if the patterns of past housing cycles from the states that experienced the   boom–bust cycles are repeated at the national level, then housing starts should remain relatively   weak over the next couple of years  Supporting this analysis, three of the large regional banking   organizations in my District are increasing their loan-loss provisions significantly in the second   quarter based on the continued deterioration in the housing sector  Based on current projections,   these institutions are projecting housing sector credit losses to accelerate in the second half of   2008 and to continue into 2009  Currently, the weak output growth contributes to my forecast of   declining inflation rates, especially the core rate, but I also see evidence supporting that view in   the “less worker bargaining power” scenario that is in the Greenbook  My contacts see very little   price pressures coming from labor costs now or in the near future     Finally, implicit in my forecast for output growth and inflation is a fed funds rate path   that includes increases later this year and into next year  Although additional risks to growth   remain, the primary risk to my forecast concerns input prices and inflation expectations  If   commodity prices continue to accelerate, they are going to put upward pressure on both headline   June 24–25, 2008 63 of 253    and core inflation and downward pressure on output  That environment could lead to a highly   undesirable increase in inflation expectations  On the positive side of risk to the outlook, I think   that the fed funds rate actions that we have taken, in conjunction with the actions that we took in   August to bolster market liquidity, have improved confidence, and I have substantially lowered   the odds I had placed on financial market meltdown and on a severe recession  In that sense,   since our meeting in April the downside risks to my outlook for economic growth have lessened   somewhat, and the risks to my inflation outlook have moved up somewhat   Regarding the issue of providing longer-term forecasts, I have long supported efforts to   clarify the underlying objectives of FOMC participants by providing our longer-term economic   projections  Of the proposals that were offered by the Subcommittee on Communications, I   favor reporting the average values for output growth, unemployment, and total inflation expected   over a five-to-ten-year period—option 3  The features of these five-to-ten-year projections that I   find attractive are that they indicate where the economy might converge and don’t imply too   much knowledge of the path to the long run  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support keeping the fed funds rate target at   its current level and the language in alternative B  I see some hopeful signs that stress in financial   markets has diminished as has the threat of a sharp recession  Despite these recent signs, I expect   that the growth momentum in the economy will build only slowly  Moreover, I continue to worry   that the residential real estate market could deteriorate even more than I had put in my baseline   projection  Nevertheless, I am somewhat more comfortable with the prospects for economic   activity than I was in April     At the same time, I can’t easily dismiss the recent behavior of energy and some other   commodity prices  I found the Bluebook’s supplemental analysis on oil prices, inflation   expectations, and monetary policy to be very useful in thinking about the dilemma that we face    The fact that oil prices have risen so sharply and have been so persistent highlights the risks   surrounding the downward projection that I have for core inflation  Without some evidence of less   inflationary pressure I don’t believe that the fed funds rate can be kept at its current level for very   long  But while I do believe that the next policy action will be a rate hike, the potential for the   recovery to sputter makes me cautious about embarking on an upward trajectory for the fed funds   June 24–25, 2008 119 of 253    rate just yet  I believe that the language in alternative B conveys the right sense of direction for the   fed funds rate path, with the right amount of caution  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I also support extending our lending   facilities to get through the year-end funding problems  As many others have already said, I   agree that we should undertake an evaluation of the changes to our emergency liquidity facilities    I think it is important that we do it more broadly and that we don’t do it in a piecemeal fashion    How the pieces fit together matters greatly  Any extension of Fed authority to provide routine   liquidity support beyond insured banks should be something that we consider as part of a   comprehensive regulatory and financial safety net reform  My own view may be that I prefer a   narrower lending facility than I think was envisioned in some of the documents that we received,   but I do think that the top priority is to have a well-thought-out, documented plan for how we   move forward  That will help us address some of the moral hazard issues that we have been   concerned about  I think it will avoid our having to create any new institutions or new facilities   to respond to future crises  I also think it will help better define some of the boundaries  Thank   you     Thank you  During the presentation, it was mentioned that many   banks were asking for this longer-term TAF  I am not getting that request here in my District,   but I wonder whether any thought was given to keeping the 28-day TAF and then adding the   longer 84-day TAF  Is that even an option?  The reason I raise this question is that I am   concerned about the credit risk  We have had situations in which it has been difficult to assess   whether an institution was going to stay in sound financial condition over a 28-day period    Obviously, it would be even more challenging over an 84-day period  So I just wondered if it 1s   even an option to keep the 28-day TAF and add the 84-day TAF   July 24, 2008 18 of 50      My preference is to have the two options, the 28-day and the 84-day  As   I expressed earlier, I am concerned that, even with improving the collateral and surveillance aspects,   the 84-day still presents some challenges  So if it is operationally feasible, I would prefer having the   two options of 28 and 84 days     Thank you, Mr Chairman  My outlook for economic growth and   inflation over the next few years is broadly similar to the one that I held last meeting, although I   think that the prospects for both inflation and economic growth in the near term have   deteriorated since June  To a close approximation, my outlook ends up looking very similar to   the Greenbook’s baseline scenario     The most significant change I am making to my outlook is to mark down the prospects   for business fixed investment this year and next, based on the reports that I am hearing from the   manufacturers in my District  There is an interesting short-term/long-term dynamic taking place   in the manufacturing sector  The manufacturing CEOs with whom I have spoken say that over   the long term they are very bullish on America  The dollar depreciation, increased transport   costs, and rising wages in China all favor more US-based production  A senior executive from   Alcoa told me that, in his 35 years of working in the manufacturing sector, he has never seen the   fundamentals point so strongly toward the United States as a profitable location for   manufacturing  The short term, however, presents a more mixed picture for manufacturers    Although some industries, such as power generation equipment and aerospace, are running flat   out and expect to continue doing so, companies in other manufacturing industries have received   or expect to receive order cancellations  In particular, the manufacturers that supply the   August 5, 2008 56 of 145    automotive and commercial construction sectors are reporting a worsening outlook  Perhaps the   best way to summarize the sentiments that I am hearing from manufacturers is to say that they   see a bright future but they see challenging conditions over the next 12 months   We all know that housing markets are extremely weak  Housing prices began their   decline earlier in Cleveland than in the rest of the country, and we are now seeing some stability   in housing prices  Despite that hopeful glimmer, we have not seen any pickup in home sales    Based on this experience, it seems that we still have a long way to go nationally before we see   any pickup in residential construction   In regard to financial markets, my chief concern is that lending is going to be constrained   by lenders needing to maintain sound capital ratios in the face of asset write-downs and loan   charge-offs  Balance sheet constraints and a declining risk appetite on the part of bankers mean   that some worthy borrowers are going to be rationed out of credit markets, further restraining   economic activity   Turning to inflation, I anticipate that price pressures will intensify further before we see   some relief, just as the Greenbook baseline scenario depicts  Manufacturers are still raising their   prices in response to rising prices for raw materials that they purchase  Some companies have   had fixed-price contracts in place for five and ten years, and as these contracts mature, the   companies are passing on huge price increases to their customers  Consequently, I think that   even after a point at which energy and commodity prices flatten out, prices at the wholesale and   retail levels are likely to adjust upward for a while longer   I just said that manufacturers are expecting some challenging times ahead  One reason is   that many of them are caught between weakening demand conditions and soaring input costs    Sherwin-Williams represents an extreme case, but I think it illustrates the situation pretty starkly    August 5, 2008 57 of 145    The CEO of Sherwin-Williams told me last week that their business is down more than   20 percent in sales channels both to new construction and to existing homes  They have been in   business for 126 years, and the last time this occurred was during the Great Depression  Despite   these dismal sales, they are having to raise prices  The CEO told me that the company typically   raises prices once a year, but in July they announced their third price increase this year  In the   entire history of the company, they have never before had three price increases in one year   So I continue to see the risk to my projection for output as being to the downside for the   reasons that we have been discussing for some time—high energy prices, severe financial stress,   and a depression in the housing markets  The risk to my inflation outlook is weighted to the   upside because I am concerned that inflation could remain elevated for too long, potentially   destabilizing inflation expectations  The Greenbook baseline scenario expects the near-term   inflation picture to worsen in the second half of this year before improving gradually over the   entire forecast period  This pattern is a concern to me  In that environment, I worry that inaction   on our part before next year could be seen as complacency on our part  So when I stack up the   two risks against one another, I regard them as fairly equal right now  But my outlook is   conditioned on a federal funds rate path that begins to increase about a quarter earlier than called   for in the Greenbook baseline  I will speak to the relevance of this factor when we discuss   monetary policy in the next go-round  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  As I indicated in the earlier go-round, I   found the balance of risks to economic growth and inflation to be essentially the same  So other   things being equal, I might prefer to have risk assessment language that is even more balanced than   the risk assessment language that is presented in alternative B  But I have a tactical reason for   wanting to see words that express a stronger concern about inflation risk  I do, as I said earlier,   expect inflation to worsen before it improves  In particular, as we have been discussing, the core   statistics are likely to worsen notably during the next several months, and I could just shrug those   worse numbers off because I have a projection that calls for those numbers to improve by early next   year  But I’m not confident that the public will shrug them off  As we have been talking about, the   cost of longer-term inflation expectations drifting up is large  I believe that we can influence those   expectations, and I think it is important that we do let the public know that we are serious about   opening the doors to a rate increase if that becomes necessary  We need the flexibility to move   nimbly, and I think the language that is contained in alternative B puts the markets on notice  I   think alternative B enables us to hold our present strategy of watchful waiting, but it does call   somewhat greater attention to inflation risks than we expressed at the conclusion of our last meeting    So I find both the strategy and the language of alternative B to be quite appropriate for the   circumstances we face today  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The recent financial market news is shaking   people’s confidence dramatically  But even before recent events, the evidence was already pointing   to more effects of the financial crisis on the real economy than I had built into my projection at our   last meeting  The reports from my District contacts and the incoming data caused me to revise   down my near-term output projection even before the latest round of financial market troubles  The   improvement in net exports that was reflected in the second-quarter GDP growth has not   encouraged manufacturers in my District to revise up their export projections  They are still holding   firmly to the opinion that the global economy is slowing and that export growth will slow with it for   several quarters  Of course, manufacturers are concerned about weakness spreading further within   their domestic customer base   The ongoing turmoil in financial markets continues to affect businesses in my District    Some of the banks in my District are finding it very, very difficult to attract new capital and to   manage their way out of trouble  I am hearing that credit is harder to come by for many borrowers   who in the recent past would not have thought twice about their creditworthiness  Last week I met   with a business contact with a very long and successful track record of buying and operating private   companies  He reported that he had reached a deal with a bank to finance a project at a 7 percent   September 16, 2008 44 of 108    interest rate with the loan amortized over a fifteen-year term  On the morning of the close just three   days later, the bank faxed him the paperwork, which reflected a 12 percent interest rate on a non-  amortizing loan with a 10-year term  So the deal obviously is not going forward  One of my   directors, who heads a very large regional banking organization, reported at our board meeting last   week that many banks are shedding assets and that in some cases they are walking away from   longstanding customer relationships in order to do so  He said that investors are very skeptical   about putting new equity into banking deals and that those who have done so in the past vow not to   be burned twice, let alone a third time   Of course, inflation remains an important issue as well  My contacts, as Dave mentioned in   his report, are not so confident that a broad array of intermediate and retail prices are actually going   to move back down as a result of the recent decline in energy and other commodity prices  Several   of my contacts report that major suppliers are trying to maintain their prices despite the decline in   raw material costs just to make up for a long period of absorbing price increases  Nevertheless,   most of my contacts agree that the commodity price environment has stabilized considerably,   making me more confident that core inflation will gradually slow over the next couple of years     At our last meeting, my forecast was broadly consistent with the Greenbook baseline    Today my forecasts for output and prices are broadly similar to the Greenbook’s for 2009 and 2010,   although I am expecting more weakness in economic activity in the second half of this year than the   Greenbook is forecasting  My contacts in the manufacturing sector have persuaded me that exports   are going to be weaker in the short term than I had previously thought, and I have also revised down   my consumption path on the basis of the credit constraints on households  Although I am more   encouraged about the recent decline in energy and commodity prices, I would like to see further   evidence of price stability in these markets and also continued stability in inflation expectations for   September 16, 2008 45 of 108    a while longer before I reduce the upside risk that I place on my inflation outlook  However, a   growing risk to my outlook is that the short-term weakness that I have now built into my outlook   extends further out into the forecast period  I worry that my outlook doesn’t fully capture all of the   many ways in which financial forces at work in the economy are actually going to restrain spending   On Friday, I was convinced that the best course of action was to keep an even keel in these   rough seas—to be flexible, of course, but to look beyond the latest wave crashing over the bow    Only six weeks ago, inflation risks were on the verge of being unacceptable, and today the troubles   of Wall Street are the focus  I was sure that we were going to be in for many more surprises; I just   didn’t know when and from where they would be coming  So I supported not only keeping our   policy unchanged but also keeping our language changes to a minimum even if that language   missed some nuances of the outlook  Given the events of the weekend, I still think it is appropriate   for us to keep our policy rate unchanged  I would like more time to assess how the recent events are   going to affect the real economy  I have a small preference for the assessment-of-risk language   under alternative A  I think it captures my concern that the downside risks have intensified    However, I can support some of the comments and changes to highlight the financial market strains   that were made by President Lockhart and President Stern  So I can support the language under   alternative B with some additional comments about the financial strains that we are facing  Thank   you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I also support your recommendation to   reduce our target fed funds rate by 50 basis points  Clearly, as has been noted, economic activity   has weakened substantially since our last meeting, and inflation concerns have lessened  For all the   reasons you articulated, especially the opportunity to participate in a coordinated effort with other   central banks, I think a 50 basis point cut in our fed funds rate target is appropriate today  Thank   you, Mr Chairman     I’m also in favor of the program, and I agree with Vice Chairman   Geithner’s comments that this announcement along with the IMF program should be sufficient  But   if there are other requests, I think it is important to bring them back to the Committee     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I concur with the view that we face a very   serious situation  In most respects I agree with the Greenbook baseline projection, with the   reasoning that the Board staff used to arrive at the projection, and with their view that the risks to   growth are to the downside  Like the Greenbook projection, my projection is heavily influenced by   judgments that we are bringing to the projection from forces that are not captured by our models    The magnitude of the judgmental adjustment has become strikingly large, as we talked about earlier,   and I realize that, if one wanted to be a skeptic about the Greenbook baseline, one would have to   look no further than these assumptions and question their significant influence on the outlook   But I am not a skeptic  During the past few weeks, in our Bank we have stepped up our   contacts with business people from large, medium, and smaller businesses, bankers, and local   government officials  We have been asking them to tell us not so much what they think and feel but   what has actually happened to their order books, production runs, and account receivables and what   October 28–29, 2008 88 of 206    actions they are taking as a result  It suffices to say that the feedback about the environment was   overwhelmingly negative  Respondents say that their situation has gone either from good to bad or   from bad to worse, and I want to share just two anecdotes that I think capture the essence of what   we are facing—one of them from a business perspective and the other from a consumer perspective    One of my directors is the CEO of a company that produces and sells forklift trucks all over the   world  He reported last week that his sales are down and orders have fallen off dramatically, and he   expects to be announcing some layoffs soon  But what was making a greater impression on him is   the fact that orders for the forklift parts have fallen off as well, and this tells him that the warehouse   operators have cut back on the use of trucks that they already own  My second story concerns the   owner of a body shop that is located in a solid, middle class community  He told us that he was   doing record business all year until last month, when business just went dead  He said it is not that   people suddenly don’t need auto repairs, but in fact, they are collecting the insurance money and not   fixing their cars  They want the cash and they don’t want to pay out the deductible   Stories like these convince me that the Greenbook baseline is on the right track  I do part   company with the Greenbook in one respect—namely, the longer-term inflation outlook  I think it   is quite likely that we are going to experience some costly reallocation of resources across some   sectors of the economy  Finance and construction are two obvious examples  Going forward, I   think there is reason to think that fewer workers and less capital are going to be employed in these   sectors  The costly adjustment is going to be characterized by slower productivity growth, higher   trend unit labor costs, and a smaller output gap than would otherwise occur, leading to somewhat   less disinflation in the outyears in my projection  Nevertheless, with output and inflation expected   to decline sharply over the coming quarters, I think it is essential for us to be thinking about the zero   bound in conducting monetary policy in a low inflation environment, and I will address the   October 28–29, 2008 89 of 206    magnitude, timing, and communication aspects of our monetary policy in tomorrow’s go-round    Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I strongly favor alternative A, a 50 basis   point cut in our fed funds target rate today  I think it is important for us to move aggressively   and quickly to offset the strong forces that are acting to depress economic activity  I know that   some prefer a more measured response, especially as we move closer to the zero bound, but the   lesson I take from history is that more and sooner is better than taking smaller steps over time    Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I also want to start by thanking the staff for   the excellent background materials they provided  While I certainly wish we were not in this   circumstance, I do think that this is a critical conversation for us to be having at this meeting, and   the background materials were extremely helpful  I am going to proceed directly to the questions   that Brian provided as I believe they cover the major issues well  I have some general answers to   the questions, but I think that we are going to be learning a lot in the process of implementing   policies into ever more uncharted waters   On the question of whether the Committee should quickly move the target fed funds rate   toward the zero bound or get there more gradually, I strongly support moving quickly  I agree with   the memos that the Japanese experience points to the value of moving aggressively  Also, we have   already moved beyond the targeted fed funds rate as many have commented, and so we are merely   confirming a reality   On the questions pertaining to the costs to financial markets or institutions and the limits to   our rate reduction, I think the notes covered very well the costs to some money market funds    Bankers in my District have also expressed concerns about additional margin squeezing that they   will face with a lower fed funds rate  So, yes, there are significant costs to financial markets and   institutions  However, I believe that the current environment and our need to allow the fed funds   rate to trade close to zero trumps these costs, and in my view a 25 basis point fed funds rate is an   appropriate minimum   Regarding the question about the communication strategy, I think another lesson that we   have learned from the Japanese experience is the role of effective communication and the role of   anchoring inflation expectations  So I do see the benefit in communicating that the Federal Reserve   December 15–16, 2008 77 of 284    intends to hold the target fed funds rate at a very low level until specified conditions are obtained,   and that the Committee sees a sizable risk that inflation in the coming quarters could be appreciably   lower than is consistent with price stability  I also see that there may be some value to   communicating that our policies might result in a temporarily higher inflation rate in the future, both   to indicate this possibility and to signal a willingness to make sure that the risk of deflation   dissipates before we alter our course  Although we have not adopted a formal inflation target, I do   believe that the release of our longer-term projections as suggested by the Subcommittee on   Communications will be helpful in managing inflation expectations   Moving to questions 4 and 5 regarding nonstandard policy tools, my own preference is for a   mixed strategy—that is, some direct Treasury and agency purchases and some expansion of our   private asset purchases using the TALF  I support your view, Mr Chairman, that we should keep   our focus on expanding the asset side of our balance sheet  I think we should consider increasing   the purchase of agency debt and mortgage-backed securities beyond the levels that we have already   announced  I also see advantages in initiating large-scale purchases of longer-term Treasury   securities  These actions should help to lower interest rates across a broad spectrum of longer-term   assets  As we have talked about, direct purchases also fit more naturally into the FOMC’s   governance structure, whereas the TALF-like approach is more awkward to fit into the FOMC’s   purview  As some have commented, direct purchases might expose our System Open Market   Account to some capital losses, but that seems an acceptable risk for monetary policy in such a   challenging environment   I do think that the focus of our FOMC meetings next year should be on evaluating and   adjusting the composition and size of our purchase of securities in response to changing economic   conditions so that the directive need not build in explicit conditioning on market and economic   December 15–16, 2008 78 of 284    circumstances  Further expansion of our credit backstop facilities under section 13(3) is also likely   to be beneficial in current circumstances  I think the CPFF has been a helpful addition to our   facilities, and I am hopeful that the TALF will be equally effective  So, in summary, I favor   applying all of these approaches and remaining flexible  I also believe that a clear starting point on   how the Committee would formulate its directive would be to direct the Desk to purchase specific   quantities of assets  As a formal matter, we might need to include “up to” in our directive language,   but we should anticipate that the Desk would be successful in meeting that objective  I think that   the uncertainty surrounding the effects of our actions makes longer-term interest rates or spreads too   unreliable to be communicated as targets   Finally, on the question of effectively communicating nonstandard policy tools, I liked the   language in some of the Bluebook alternatives for our policy options  However, because of the   historic nature of implementing nonstandard policy tools, I think that a good communication plan   should also include a formal press conference or a speech in which, Mr Chairman, you announce   the changes  That would serve to emphasize the change in our procedure and eliminate some of the   uncertainties about the role of the fed funds rate target  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The reports from my contacts have been very   weak for several weeks now  Sadly, I feel as though the data have been catching up with the   anecdotal comments that I have been receiving for a while  I have been hearing a lot of comments   along the lines of “orders have fallen off a sheer cliff,” “the lights were suddenly switched off,” and   “my business is dead in the water”  One thing I have noticed is that the negative outlook has spread   to more and more corners of the economy, even those corners that had remained robust for a   relatively longer period  For example, one of my directors, who runs a manufacturing company and   exports 70 percent of his products, is a producer of highly specialized equipment that is used in steel   production  He has few competitors and no debt, and until recently he was feeling very comfortable   with a two and a half year backlog  Last week he reported that the backlog has essentially vanished    His customers’ problems have now become his problems  This has become a typical refrain  We   had become used to hearing companies talk about their desire to hold onto liquidity  Now   businesses are also focused on how they are going to protect themselves in this weakening   economy  Even businesses with a healthy amount of cash are cutting back sharply on investment,   hiring, and production plans     In this environment, it is clear that forecasts need to be revised down sharply  Like the   Greenbook, my own projection, which seemed pretty dire just a month ago, has also been revised   down sharply with the incoming data and anecdotes  The question now is how long and how deep a   December 15–16, 2008 133 of 284    decline we will experience  At the same time, it also remains difficult to judge how far disinflation   will go  My projection sees substantial output gaps and energy prices that are likely to remain low    That has caused me to lower my inflation projection further as well  My inflation forecast now is   clearly below desirable levels for much of 2009  Still, it looks as though the risks remain very much   to the downside for output and inflation, if only because further downside misses are getting more   and more problematic  The insurance metaphor, I think, has been exhausted  We are now more in a   situation of treating mass trauma  Perhaps some of our actions will later be judged as having gone   too far  But in my view, right now it clearly is better to ensure that the treatment is large enough   rather than risk falling short  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Obviously, for us to counteract the powerful   forces that are weakening our economy and financial markets, we should provide maximum   monetary policy stimulus as quickly as possible, and conducting monetary policy on the basis of a   fed funds rate target is no longer the best strategy  I do think it is time and it would be helpful to   begin focusing the public’s attention on the unconventional approach to monetary policy, and I   think alternative A does a better job of doing that   What I like about alternative A is its straightforward characterization of the policy situation   and how we plan to respond to it  I support leaving in the language that is bracketed in alternative   A, paragraph 2, about the risk that inflation could decline for some time below rates that best foster   economic growth and price stability  The reason I say that is that we have been using the language   that the Committee expects inflation to moderate for some time now, and given the discussion, I   think we expect that situation to be getting worse  So I would support leaving that in  I would also   leave in paragraph 3 the more forward-looking language about keeping the low level of the fed   December 15–16, 2008 188 of 284    funds rate for some time  I also would keep in the language on the potential benefits of purchasing   longer-term Treasury securities  I assume that the minutes that are released in three weeks are going   to say that we discussed it and that we will be evaluating it  So I would just leave it in  Also, given   the dire economic outlook that we are talking about and the aggressive response that we think   monetary policy should take, I think just saying merely that we stand ready to expand the purchase   of agency debt and mortgage-backed securities isn’t aggressive enough  I do realize that there are a   lot of important questions that are left unanswered, such as determining the mix of assets to   purchase and how to know when enough is enough, and then how to shrink our balance sheet when   the time comes  But I do think that adopting alternative A is taking a big step in the direction of   giving the public some indication of what we plan to do   Finally, I know you just said that we will come up with some language and some framework   around what we are doing  But as discussed in yesterday’s conversation, having some talking   points even in the near term so that we are consistent in our language on what we are doing would   be helpful  At a time when there is a lot of confusion out there and markets are as fragile as they   are, having us all talk about this in the same way would be helpful  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  For many years now, I have believed that   providing the public with an explicit numerical inflation objective would enhance the effectiveness   of monetary policy for a variety of reasons  One of the principal benefits would be an improvement   in communication, thereby enhancing the FOMC’s ability to fulfill both of our mandates  I believe   that an explicit numerical inflation objective would help to anchor inflation expectations, and   strongly anchored inflation expectations should improve the efficiency of wage- and price-setting   decisions and lead to better economic performance  Although the research findings are not   conclusive, I think that foreign central banks operating with explicit numerical objectives have, on   balance, more firmly anchored inflation expectations than have other central banks  Anchoring   inflation expectations also could be especially crucial during current economic conditions, but my   support for specifying a numerical objective is based on my regard for its value in all circumstances                                January 16, 2009 37 of 69  In principle, establishing an explicit numerical inflation objective need not diminish or   assign less weight to our objective for maximum employment  Rather, establishing a numerical   inflation objective should help us achieve our employment goal over the long run  Because the   Committee has already reached a broad consensus on an implicit inflation objective, announcing an   explicit inflation objective should not materially change the way we respond to economic   conditions However, an explicit inflation objective may be most valuable in times when achieving   it appears to be more difficult  Right now, as several have mentioned, people are concerned both   about the possibilities for future deflation and future inflation  The existence of an explicit   commitment would enable us to explain more clearly to the public what we are trying to accomplish   and how we intend to do so  It would require us to explain how we plan to achieve our objective   when we see actual and projected inflation deviating from our objective   I favor an objective expressed in terms of an average over the medium term of, say, three to   five years, but the communication value I see is not that tightly connected to a specific time frame    Evidence of successful inflation targeting should be revealed in a closer alignment of inflation   expectations with the inflation objective, particularly in the case of the longer-term horizon  My   preference for a total versus core inflation measure depends on the time frame chosen, but a longer-  term target specified in terms of total CPI inflation seems like the best option to me  I favor the CPI   because it is not subject to revision, and many contracts are specified in terms of the CPI   Concerning the issue of an inflation objective versus a price-level objective, I prefer the   inflation objective  I am more persuaded by having at least the experience of some foreign central   banks in implementing inflation targets than by purely theoretical arguments for price-level   targeting  I think our objective should be stated in terms of a number with an acceptable range   around that number  While I prefer the CPI, I recognize that the PCE measure has become the focus                                 January 16, 2009 38 of 69  of our attention, and I have been on record as suggesting an objective for PCE inflation of   1¾ percent  But in light of our recent experience, I am now leaning toward an objective for total   PCE inflation of 2 percent to provide a larger buffer against zero lower bound events  I would   provide a range around that number of plus or minus 1 percent to let the public know that some   variation in actual inflation is acceptable during that time frame  But, again, the size of that range   would depend on the horizon that we select  Recognizing our dual mandate, I think publishing our   longer-term growth and employment projections would remain a valuable part of our   communication strategy   So in conclusion, I do regard the establishment of an explicit numerical inflation objective as   a natural step forward in our Committee’s progress toward better communications  I recognize,   however, that gaining support for such a framework at this time could be challenging  I would feel   much better about launching this endeavor if I thought that this step in our communication strategy   would be welcomed by the Congress and the Administration rather than resisted, but I will leave   managing the politics up to you, Mr Chairman  As you said clearly in your opening comments, you   are well attuned to the political environment  I also agree, though, with President Yellen that   extending the Committee’s economic projection horizon buys us a lot of what we are trying to   achieve without some of the political risk  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I wish I could report some improvement   in the outlook from my contacts, but sentiment in my District has not shifted  Everyone is   anticipating more bad news on the output front, and they are much less confident about when the   turnaround is going to occur Importantly, this is increasingly translating into reduced   investment plans  My business contacts who were previously uncertain about the outlook but   had not yet reduced their planned investments now seem to be joining the tide of other   businesses that are scaling back Those who had already lowered their investment plans seem to   be accelerating their reductions   I focused my conversations with my business contacts on investment decisions because it   seems to be a critical factor separating the relatively optimistic private forecasters from the     January 27–28, 2009 139 of 267  pessimists, and my contacts’ investment plans are keeping me very much in the pessimists’   camp  I guess I am balancing out this end of the table  In particular, I have revised down   business fixed investment in my forecast  I am now anticipating a steep decline of just over    20 percent in the second quarter, and this is the aspect of my forecast that changed the most   during this intermeeting period  I am now expecting to see a reduction in real GDP of    08 percent for 2009, the same as the Greenbook  Potential growth in the medium term might be   damped by some of these investment reductions, but I have not yet revised down my estimate for   potential over the five-to-six-year period, which I put at 27 percent   I do see disinflation pressures continuing, and the gap remains elevated in my forecast    But the pricing reports from my business contacts remain uncertain  This uncertainty does not   surprise me, given that the volatility we have seen in prices has been quite large  But at this   point, some people are just as worried about inflation as they are about deflation, despite the   latest headline inflation data  Obviously, they are looking at some of our longer-term policy   decisions Long-term inflation expectations in the Michigan surveys that we discussed   yesterday, though, do not seem to be shifting either up or down yet  Nevertheless, I do expect   weak demand to gradually lower inflation rates to levels that are going to require further   monetary policy actions My projection reflects this  But with inflation expectations in my   projection unchanged, unlike the Greenbook, the decline in core inflation in my projection is less   persistent than the Greenbook, and my outlook for core inflation in 2011 rises to 14 percent   In my view, our monetary policy needs to remain accommodative for a time to better   insulate us from deflation and zero bound problems  I am one of those participants who did   change their perspective on the longer-term PCE inflation objective  I had been in the              January 27–28, 2009 140 of 267  1¾ percent camp for some time, but because of my concern about deflation and zero bound   problems, I have raised that longer-term projection to 2 percent for PCE inflation   It is difficult to feel very confident, as others have said today, about characterizing the   balance of risks to the outlook in this extremely abnormal environment  However, I cannot help   but think that the risks to both economic growth and inflation are unbalanced to the downside    Without data revealing some stability, it is hard to argue against more downside risks, as others   have commented this morning  Businesses are far more focused on survival than they are on   new opportunities On the inflation front, the stability of businesses’ and households’ inflation   expectations, as we currently see them, may not remain, and so the downside risk to inflation   remains   Regarding the longer-term projections, they were proposed by the subcommittee to help   us with our communication with the public, and I have enthusiastically supported all of the   recommendations and the steps in this direction  I also support releasing our long-term   projections from this meeting  These projections should help the public solidify their   expectations for economic performance, especially when our current troubles have abated  I am   also encouraged that there is strong agreement among the participants, as Brian reported   yesterday, about our expectations for economic performance five to six years out  So I think   releasing them will be helpful  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  As you noted, we all agree that the   outlook for economic growth is bleak  To be sure, our policy actions so far have been   aggressive; but even so, I have a predisposition to provide further monetary stimulus  From a   risk-management perspective, there are very few scenarios I can think of that would suggest that   further monetary stimulus would be a mistake  But despite my bias for action, I am hesitant   about how to proceed   As I was putting my thoughts together for this portion of the meeting, I recalled the many   conversations that we have had around this table about our communication policy  Even when   we were operating in a well-defined policy regime, we often experienced great difficulty in   determining how best to express our decision and our intentions publicly  Now we are operating   in a new policy regime—credit easing—that we understand conceptually but for which no   operational handbook yet exists We don’t know how to write down the policy rule for this   environment, and we surely don’t have any empirical estimates to guide our decisions  Our   discussion yesterday about what the effect is of a $250 billion purchase of MBS or a $250 billion   purchase of longer-term Treasury securities demonstrates that we just do not have certainty   around the effects of those actions  Before this crisis began, the public had a fairly good grasp of   our policy rule Now they are trying to find the new rule, and I hope they do not find one before   we figure out exactly what it is [Laughter] I certainly hope that we find it before John Taylor   does   The serious issue is how we can best manage expectations in this policy regime when we   are so uncertain about so many things  Alternative A, in my view, conveys a stronger degree of   certainty to the public than I have at the moment about our policy rule  I don’t know the basis        January 27–28, 2009 176 of 267  for selecting $250 billion more of mortgage-backed securities or $250 billion additional in the   longer-term Treasuries  I do not want to convey or set up the expectations that, by wanting to   ease more, we are now going to use the $250 billion increase in our announcement of purchases,   whether they are mortgage-backed securities or longer-term Treasuries, just as the ¼ percentage   point change in the fed funds rate had been viewed in our prior policy regime  Alternative B   doesn’t cite specific quantities, but it does communicate a willingness to step up the pace and to   extend the duration of our credit programs, and I think that is the appropriate action for today    The alternative also reminds the public that additional credit easing in the form of the TALF and   mortgage-backed security purchases is on the horizon, and I think we will be well served to tell   the public as much as we can and then update them frequently as our own views evolve  I think   alternative B does that without overstating what we know   In favoring alternative B—and I am now the fourth person in this go-round—I am going   to offer a fourth alternative in terms of the language  I, like President Yellen, would add   paragraph 3 from alternative A regarding our inflation outlook  Then given our go-round today   and your comments about how you heard the go-round, Mr Chairman, I think paragraph 2 in   alternative A more accurately describes the view that we have had more weakening than we   thought So those changes—paragraphs 2 and 3 out of alternative A but paragraph 4 out of   alternative B—are what I would recommend for today  Thank you    Right, and we were commenting that many of us said that things had   gotten weaker  That is the only observation I would make     That sounds fine    I have a couple of concerns similar to those Governor Duke raised  I   have been hearing directly from some of the banks in my District  Two of them I believe are   among the four that Deborah said we are watching closely  They have been hit hard in the past   week in terms of stock prices because of concerns that they are not going to be able to take   advantage of some of the programs that you’ve laid out  Now, one of the things that they raised   is that markets are speculating that their financial conditions are so bad that they wouldn’t be   able to participate in these programs  What I like about what you laid out in the scrubbing of   these institutions is that they are going to be treated equally—because some of them are saying   that some regulators are being a little less stringent, so there is not equal regulation or   supervision of these institutions  I think emphasizing in the communication that they are going   to be scrubbed and treated consistently might be helpful, because, especially for a couple of   institutions, the markets are judging that their financial condition is different than might   otherwise be perceived   The other issue that they raised and you didn’t mention as part of this package is the   short-selling provision  Again, this is important to them because some of these institutions’   stocks are getting hit extremely hard, because of some assumptions that are being made  So              February 7, 2009 34 of 65  perhaps the ban on short-selling during this period of uncertainty is an option and something we   should consider again    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I have a couple of questions, and both of   them have been answered indirectly through our give and take, but I wanted to make sure I was   clear in my understanding of these issues  Both President Hoenig and President Lacker have   asked my first question, but I’m going to ask it in a third way, just to make sure I’m clear  As   we’re contemplating the extension of the TALF into these other, more narrow, categories, is it   because there are critical problems in these markets?  Or is it also a supply issue?  That is, we   can’t reach even the currently announced $200 billion if we are purchasing securities only in the   categories that we’ve already announced   The second question is somewhat related, and, again, I think you’ve already answered   this Do we know who is purchasing the lower-rated tranches of the securities, and what price   are they paying for them?  I know, Mr Chairman, you said that the securitization market isn’t   even existent, but a lot of my contacts have been saying that it is important to the functioning of   the ABS market to also get those lower-rated securities purchased and trading    So that means that there are both critical problems in that market and   that, in order to get the dollar amount that we’re trying to put into that market, we need to expand   the asset classes    If we wanted to take on less risk, we could stay in the one market    There are enough of those securities This is more about addressing the critical issues in those   other markets    Is there any activity on the lower-rated paper?  We are taking the   triple-A  Is there any activity in the lower-rated securities?    Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Given the deterioration in the outlook, I   do believe that aggressive policy action is needed  I came to the meeting prepared to support   alternative B, primarily because the simulations that the staff provided indicated that purchasing   mortgage-backed securities gave us a bigger bang for our buck than the purchase of Treasury   securities However, I am willing to consider the purchase of Treasury securities  I listened to   Vice Chairman Dudley’s comments about the fact that the TALF is slow to get up and running   and that we don’t have experience in the purchase of long-term Treasury securities  So I do            March 17–18, 2009 100 of 266  support the expansion of the purchase of mortgage-backed securities and the increase in agency   debt purchases, but I am also willing to be open-minded about the purchase of Treasury   securities Regarding the extension of the TALF, I am concerned that we are not being clear   about our objectives Some of the questions we had around the table today indicate that  So I   don’t want our periodic announcement of additional classes of securities to be interpreted as if   we are just being reactive  I think that if we do move ahead with the expansion of the program,   then making our objectives clearer will help the public understanding and help build confidence   around the program  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  The reports from my contacts have been   very weak for months now  In order to get a better sense of the outlook, I asked some of my   contacts some questions focused on whether their responses thus far to the recession have been   enough to prepare them for the weakness that they are anticipating in their markets    Unfortunately, the vast majority of them said that they had not done enough and that they   continue to curtail their activities and investments at a very quick pace  And their confidence in   a recovery later on this year is dwindling   I am concerned that this lack of confidence is translating into actions that will further   dampen our prospects in coming months  I was surprised that even some of the more successful   manufacturers in my District, such as Eaton, Lincoln Electric, and Parker-Hannifin, are all   implementing further cutbacks in investments, hiring, and production plans  In several cases,   these further cutbacks have been motivated by this deepening retrenchment that we are seeing   with our foreign partners But some of my contacts are losing confidence in the policy responses   to the recession Several of my directors noted last week at our meeting that public confidence is   obviously critical to our recovery plans, yet the public is increasingly finding the government’s           March 17–18, 2009 138 of 266  response confusing and incomplete  This lack of confidence is weighing on their expectations   for growth this year and even next year Now, my directors are certainly supportive of the   actions that the Federal Reserve has taken, particularly the stress-testing that we are doing of   banks and the long-term asset purchases  However, they are concerned that the communications   about some of the other government programs—some of the Treasury plans—have been unclear,   and, therefore, are hampering the recovery  Mr Chairman, I think that your interview on   60 Minutes played a helpful role in clarifying some of these programs, and I did receive many   calls from directors and business contacts saying that they thought the interview was well   received   Like the staff, I revised down my projection for output and inflation based on the   incoming data, and, obviously, the weakening global outlook  My projection is very much in   line with the Greenbook baseline, although in my projection the unemployment rate peaks at   10 percent, because I don’t anticipate as much of a cutback in the participation rate as the   Greenbook does Also, I do think that the outlook calls for a larger policy response  In my   baseline, I’ve incorporated the simulations on additional nontraditional policies  I know the   Greenbook hasn’t, because they are obviously difficult to include in a numeric projection  But at   this point, I have included some of that policy response in my outlook   In my view, the risks remain very much weighted to the downside for both output and   inflation Given the repeated markdowns that we’ve made to our projections, I think more   downside misses are likely to make it more difficult to restore confidence that we are dealing   with the economic crisis appropriately  At this point, neither the projections nor any of the   anecdotal reports that I have received are likely to make a difference in or shift our policy   response We are in the midst of an economic decline that doesn’t have concrete signs of a        March 17–18, 2009 139 of 266  developing recovery I think we need to react to the current crisis thoroughly, but also with as   much as clarity as possible I know we’ve talked a lot about the focus on our communications of   what we are doing I do think that is critical at this point  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  It is clear to me from our discussion of the   outlook that more action is needed, but as I said earlier, I also think we need to focus on the   clarity of our communications in order to build public confidence  Looking over the options that   were presented today, I do prefer alternative B I am clearly in favor of aggressive action, and as   I noted yesterday I am open to the purchase of longer-term Treasuries, but as President Lockhart   just mentioned, in the interest of effective communications, I think we need to better explain why   we decided to engage in the purchase of Treasury securities at this time  Brian gave us four   reasons why we might want to consider that, and as you know, Mr Chairman, in our statement in   January we did say that we would do that in order to improve conditions in private credit   markets, but I still think that may be a little too vague   While the staff comments yesterday indicated a little less certainty that we get a larger   bang for the buck if we purchase MBS versus Treasuries, I think we do have evidence that           March 17–18, 2009 209 of 266  purchases of MBS have generated significant interest rate reductions just through their   announcement effects  Also, the staff simulations highlighted yesterday the economic   importance of stabilizing housing prices and the effects on household wealth  So, with the larger   purchase of MBS along with some of the Treasury initiatives working in tandem, I think   alternative B is a preferred way to go   In terms of the statement language, the option of B′ or B, I slightly favor putting our   actions in the front line or the first paragraph  There is some premium, I think, on clear and   easily verifiable actions in these difficult and confusing times, although, after listening to   Governor Kohn’s comments about “what do we do when we don’t take actions,” I see that that   might be a little confusing  But overall, B′ is my preference at this meeting    Thank you The staff memo on the recommendations for the   expansion of the TALF mentions on page 3, in the paragraph on the TALF ceiling and credit   support, that you project that the New York Fed will make less than $150 billion in TALF loans   through December 31; and in the Bluebook baseline, it looks as though it is about $100 billion at   the end of 2009 How confident are you that we can then do $400 billion in 2010, and how   important are CMBS to the successful expansion of the TALF?    Mr Chairman, this obviously may be an issue for discussion in the   policy go-round But if there is a lack of confidence that we can expand our balance sheet with   the TALF program, at what point do we talk about other ways to accomplish this?  Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  During the intermeeting period, I heard   from an encouraging number of contacts that business conditions were showing some initial   signs of stabilizing at very low levels Relatively large companies with deep pockets and access   to credit seem prepared to wait out the recession, although many have to make some painful   adjustments  Others, especially small businesses, worry openly about running out of cash and   time  Some employers are still considering reductions in staffing, and it is rare to find companies   engaged in any net hiring Even hospitals, which are traditionally very stable employers, have   been reducing staff where possible in response to declines in demand  Public-sector and   nonprofit employment continues to be under pressure as well  Although most of the employment   declines we are observing result from cyclical forces, I think that more than the usual share of   employment losses also stem from structural factors  After reviewing the declining pattern of   job openings reported in the JOLTS data, as well as the relatively low levels of temporary layoffs   that President Yellen commented on, my staff concludes that labor market reallocations are   likely to be quite large and prolonged during this business cycle   Regarding inflation, I appreciate the concern about a continuing deceleration in our price   measures  However, I am struck by the number of people I speak with who worry that our policy                       April 28–29, 2009 72 of 201  actions will cause inflation to accelerate in the future  In fact, the people who worry about   accelerating inflation far outnumber those who express concerns about future deflation  So I am   not overly concerned at this point about deteriorating inflation expectations My view is that,   with clear communication about our inflation objectives, our large-scale asset purchase will   damp the decline of long-term inflation expectations, something that the Reifschneider–Roberts   memo tells us is not captured in FRB/US  In my projection, core PCE inflation remains in the   range of 1 percent to 1½ percent through 2011, whereas in the Greenbook baseline, inflation falls   below 1 percent   The anecdotal information that we collected, along with the data that we received, hasn’t   led me to make any material changes to my outlook for employment and output since our March   meeting  My current output projection has some differences in timing of the recovery compared   with the Greenbook baseline; however, I don’t consider them to be material  My forecast for the   unemployment rate does deviate more substantially from the Greenbook as a result of my   interpretation of the persistent weakness that we are seeing in labor markets  My baseline   projection has more labor reallocation taking place than the Greenbook does, and that drives my   forecast for unemployment to peak at a bit over 10 percent before it begins to decline  The   additional labor reallocation embedded in my outlook is another factor that puts my core   inflation forecast on a higher path than that in the Greenbook  That is, I see a somewhat smaller   output gap than the Greenbook does because I see a somewhat lower level of potential output in   my projection coming from the labor market reallocations that I commented on   It goes without saying that the level of uncertainty around my projection is unusually   great, and there are many risk factors that could render it inaccurate  One of the risks that looms   large in my mind—and it has already been mentioned by several others around the table today—        April 28–29, 2009 73 of 201  is that announcing the results of the stress test could add to the fragility of the banking system,   and it could result in a further pullback in bank lending, as others have commented  At least that   was the gut reaction I got from the bankers that I talked to as I was presenting the preliminary   results of the test  I hope that we will fully consider these concerns as we decide what   information to release publicly  Many of us are on record as saying that, in order to restore   confidence in the banking system, we have to see private capital go back into that system  I am   concerned that announcing that a majority of the 19 bank holding companies need additional   capital and that the additional capital can come from the government is going to scare private   investors away  So, on balance, I regard the risk to my outlook for both output and inflation to   be weighted to the downside, especially taking into consideration some of the announcement   effect of our stress test  Thank you, Mr Chairman    I’ll be brief Thank you, Mr Chairman  Given the high degree of   uncertainty about the outlook and the uncertainty around how to size the quantity and   composition of our asset purchases, I think the best course of action today is not to add any more   uncertainty to this environment  I hope that our meeting in June will be helpful in reducing some   of the uncertainty around our asset purchase program  So today I prefer making only minor   changes to our statement, and I support alternative B  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Trish, in your report you mentioned the potential downgrade by S&P   of some of the CMBS  How is that going to affect our participation in that program?  Is it going   to reduce the number of CMBS that are going to be available for the TALF, and does that change   any of our plans for that program?           June 3, 2009 10 of 20   Thank you, Mr Chairman  I also support Brian’s recommendations   on our credit and liquidity facilities  In regards to tools for exiting, I am also very appreciative to   the staff for the excellent work that they did  I am now more confident that we have the tools  I        June 23–24, 2009 95 of 261  am also very much in favor of using the Monetary Policy Report to describe the tools that are   available to us And I prefer focusing on those tools that we currently have available to us that   don’t require any legislation or other changes I also agree with Governor Kohn’s comments that   it’s too soon to consider a change in policy, but I also agree that it’s not too soon for the   Committee to start talking about a framework—or the process that we’re going to be using—to   decide how we are going to apply these tools   In addition, I think it would be helpful for the staff and this Committee to start looking at   some alternative language for use in statements that will describe this environment that we are   going to be in, where we are simultaneously adjusting our fed funds target and managing the size   of our balance sheet As President Yellen stated, I think that getting prepared to communicate is   just as important as getting ready to use the tools  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  The reports from my District have   revealed lingering concerns about how the economy will evolve over the rest of this year  Most   of my contacts agree that their worst fears for the economy seem less likely to be realized now,   but they are still far from optimistic  Expectations for the remainder of the year varied from   further reduction in activity levels to a very moderate resumption in economic growth  Reports   of hiring are still rare, and several contacts from larger companies suggest that they are working   on another round of layoffs From my District vantage point, it still looks like a very gradual   recovery process The inflation picture is mixed  I am hearing a growing number of contacts   expressing fears of inflation driven by rising commodity prices and ballooning fiscal deficits, but   I am also hearing widespread reports of downward pressures on wages and benefits    Synthesizing these reports and the incoming data into an outlook continues to be   challenging  I have revised up slightly my output forecast from the April meeting, as business   fixed investment, although still a considerable drag on growth, declines less steeply than in my   previous outlook While business spending on equipment is likely to pick up in the second half   of the year, spending on structures, as was mentioned yesterday, will probably take longer to   recover Some recent favorable readings from the housing indicators have also attenuated the   near-term decline in residential investment in my outlook and have raised the prospect for a   turnaround in housing in the second half of the year  My forecast still has the unemployment   rate peaking at just over 10 percent in early 2010  The continued rapid rise in unemployment              June 23–24, 2009 124 of 261  certainly remains an important drag on the economy as new jobs are hard to find for many of the   workers who were laid off   I revised up my inflation forecast for 2009, but I left my longer-term inflation projection   on a gradual path towards 2 percent As we discussed yesterday, the latest Survey of   Professional Forecasters has a broader variance around the longer-term inflation trend, but the   median inflation projection is largely unchanged  And, as we said yesterday, we have seen an   unusually wide range of inflation projections in this round of the Committee’s submissions   We know that the liquidity problems in the TIPS market have made that a more difficult   indicator to use to deem where inflation expectations are  We have done some work at the   Cleveland Fed using a different method of looking at the TIPS data, and those results suggest   that inflation expectations have returned to pre-crisis levels  Apparently, these results have been   confirmed by the staff of the San Francisco Fed, who used a different methodology but came to   the same conclusion  Consequently, although inflation expectations are still volatile, I do think   that it is reasonable to characterize them as anchored   In my view, the risks to the forecast remain to the downside for output, because the   improvements in the real economy that we are seeing remain nascent and, I think, fragile    However, I did revise my views of the risks around the inflation forecast to “balanced”—they are   large but symmetric   This remains a very challenging period to evaluate the incoming data, and even a smaller   gap doesn’t mitigate the fact that the economy is still contracting in the current quarter, and most   projections show limited growth for a considerable period  Despite my forecast for higher   inflation compared with the Greenbook, my overall outlook leaves the economy a fair distance   from needing a tighter monetary policy  Thank you, Mr Chairman        June 23–24, 2009 125 of 261   Thank you, Mr Chairman  My outlook assumes that our policy   accommodation is going to continue for some time, and yet the recovery is still quite prolonged    As has been noted, financial market conditions have improved somewhat during the intermeeting   period, but those improvements have taken place alongside of continuing significant public   policy interventions  So a little progress has been made, but I think the economy needs a   considerable amount of time to cement that progress  In this environment, I think we have room   to continue to evaluate the outlook and the effects of our current programs  So I support   alternative B   Given Brian’s comments about the uncertainty on how the language in the bracketed   sentence would be received, I would just leave it out  Given that we are going to have a   Monetary Policy Report and that you are going to give testimony in the near future, I would just   rely on those vehicles to address some of these issues more fully  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  My contacts are growing more confident   that the sharp decline in economic activity is in the process of ending  Auto producers are   benefiting from the very popular cash-for-clunkers program  The success of this program is now   showing up not just in sales but also in plants restarting or increasing production  Similarly,   housing markets in my District appear to be stabilizing, with starts actually heading up  This, of   course, is welcome news to the producers of building materials, who have been waiting a long   time to see any signs of a recovery in housing   Still, it would be hard to characterize the mood of business executives in my District as   good “Resignation” is a better summary  The declines in their activity levels have been so large   that the uptick in growth that they are now experiencing is easily being met either by inventories   or by only incremental increases in production  Most of my business contacts anticipate that   their surplus capacity will continue for months or even years to come  They agree with President   Fisher’s view that there is too much of everything relative to demand             August 11–12, 2009 89 of 165  The auto industry remains a clear example  A number of assembly plants in my District   are not going to survive the restructuring that has already been announced  When I consider only   the plants in my District that are going to continue to produce after the restructuring is   completed, I find that those auto assembly plants produced 23 million cars and light trucks in   2007 Toyota and Honda plants account for over half of the total  Now, to give you an example   of how low production has been for the past few months, in June these same plants collectively   produced less than 36 percent of their 2007 output  Honda and Toyota were operating at well   less than two-thirds of their 2007 levels, while the Big Three were at roughly 10 percent of their   2007 levels The cash-for-clunkers program has been viewed as a national success, boosting July   auto sales by 16 percent above June sales Nevertheless, while this was a sizable percentage   increase at the national level, this represents just a month’s worth of 2007 production capacity   for the surviving plants in my District  This is hardly a dent in the excess capacity available in   this entire industry   The problem is not limited to autos  Primary metal producers, as an example, are   operating at less than 50 percent of their capacity  One community banker in my District who   noted improving economic conditions cautioned that every plant in her region is operating on   some form of reduced workweek  In fact, the dominant reaction of business people in my   District to date has not been to close plants permanently but rather to hunker down and manage   output levels to match current demand by cutting back on labor or other variable inputs    Workforces have largely accepted a variety of pay and hour cutbacks to make these lower levels   of output possible This downward pressure on wages is showing up strongly both in the   employment cost index and, as we saw, in yesterday’s unit labor cost numbers  While this   pattern might sound as if it is limited just to the Midwest, international producers report similar     August 11–12, 2009 90 of 165  experiences in their locations worldwide  From the producer standpoint, it is just hard to see an   impending acceleration of prices, although the growing stability in output does seem to have   been enough to limit further discounting   To gain further insight on the output gap, I met with a group of academic advisers who   worked on different models that try various approaches of evaluating the output gap over the   business cycle  They all essentially agreed with my business contacts’ opinions that it is likely to   take a long time before this output gap is absorbed  Combining their perspective with the   information that I gathered from my business contacts, I ended up leaving my output projection   largely consistent with my forecast at the last meeting, which has been broadly consistent with   the Greenbook’s viewpoint on output I expect output to grow slowly in the second half of this   year, followed by a return to more-solid growth rates next year   Although I expect inflation to dip in the coming months, my outlook for core inflation   calls for a gradual climb back toward 2 percent in the next two or three years  My inflation   outlook runs a little higher than the Greenbook baseline, largely because of differences in our   views of where inflation expectations will settle out  And although the large output gap in my   outlook does serve as a disinflationary pressure, the research on this issue leads me to be   cautious about how much effect this output gap is going to exert on my inflation projection   So the risks to my outlook remain to the downside for output because the improvements   that I have seen, notably in housing and auto sales, have relied on stimulus programs that may be   quickly depleted and a still uncertain recovery in consumer spending  My talks with both   researchers and business people leave me with a lot of uncertainty about the inflation trend, and I   see those risks remaining symmetric  So while the news has been encouraging, I think watchful   waiting seems like the right course for monetary policy to me  Thank you, Mr Chairman        August 11–12, 2009 91 of 165   Thank you, Mr Chairman  I, too, support the revised version of   alternative B Given the large output gap that I see closing only slowly and an inflation rate   projection that remains low over the forecast period, I am comfortable maintaining the current   level of monetary stimulus  Market participants clearly recognize that our Treasury security   purchases will cumulate to a level near the stated objective around the time of the next meeting    So it seems appropriate to recognize this in our statement today, to be more transparent about our   intentions, and I think alternative B does that well  Also, as Brian mentioned, it is not necessary   to specify at this meeting changes to our purchases of agency debt and mortgage-backed   securities So I prefer to wait until our September meeting to comment on those purchases  Like   others, I believe that it is important to leave our options open, and the revised version of     August 11–12, 2009 136 of 165  alternative B gives us, I think, the appropriate flexibility that we need  Thank you, Mr   Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  My business contacts in the Fourth   District continue to be wary about developments in the economy  While most businesses   reported incremental gains in their output levels earlier this summer, many have already seen a   tapering off of those gains Other contacts reported that orders are fluctuating with no   discernible trend Overall, I would characterize the predominant mood of the business   executives I speak with as uncertain and cautious   One of the reasons there is so much uncertainty is that the improvements that we have   seen in the critical industries appear to be tied to short-term stimulus programs  District auto   sales got a clear boost from the “cash-for-clunkers” program, and auto production plans have   now been increased for both the third and fourth quarters  There is also no question that there   have been ripple effects through the supply chain all the way back to orders for steel  This   increased production in autos and industries related to autos was critical to the stabilization in the   Fourth District output that we reported in the latest Beige Book   But the limited gains in the industrial sector to date do lead me to think that this recovery   is very fragile Underscoring the fragility is the uncertainty about just how sustainable the   demand for car sales will be into and beyond the fourth quarter  For similar reasons, my contacts        September 22–23, 2009 103 of 212  in the real estate industry are concerned that sales may decline once the first-time homebuyer tax   credit expires on December 1 They certainly aren’t complaining about the support, which is   drawing in new homebuyers, yet they also report that an unusual number of sellers are renting   rather than purchasing move-up houses  One real estate executive said that, traditionally, four   out of five sales are to move-up buyers, whereas he is only seeing two out of five sales to move-  up buyers in the current market  The lack of move-up purchasing has limited the impact of the   first-time homebuyer programs, and move-up purchasing is going to be critical once the first-  time homebuyer incentives are exhausted  Again, the economy’s fragility is partly hidden by   incentives, which, in this case, are scheduled to roll off later this year   Concerns such as these weighed on my outlook for economic growth, particularly in the   fourth quarter I anticipate a gradual and bumpy recovery  My outlook does not have sustained   above-trend growth until the second half of 2010, with the unemployment rate topping off at just   over 10 percent early next year   Turning to inflation, two pieces of research done by my staff helped to guide my outlook    The first is a model of inflation expectations that does not rely on TIPS to estimate inflation   expectations Instead, the model combines inflation data, nominal bond rates, survey measures   of inflation expectations, and inflation swaps to construct estimates of expected inflation  This   model shows that inflation expectations remain stable from two to ten years out  Second, my   staff, along with the staff at the Atlanta Fed, has been examining the detailed price data by   splitting the consumer price index market basket according to whether prices of goods and   services are sticky or flexible  The stickier prices appear to be a particularly informative   measure of core inflation, in that they more reliably predict future inflation  Our staff analysis           September 22–23, 2009 104 of 212  shows that the inflation rate of the goods and services with stickier prices has shifted sharply   lower this year This trend points to suppressed inflation rates for the next few quarters   These results point to some crosscurrents I see in putting together an inflation projection    In the near term, resource slack is likely to depress core inflation numbers, while over the   medium term, monetary and fiscal policies and stable inflation expectations should support an   inflation trajectory toward 2 percent  Specifically, I expect core PCE inflation to dip below   1½ percent in 2010, but to increase gradually toward 2 percent in 2011   Overall, the risks to my inflation outlook remain balanced  Regarding the risks to my   outlook for economic growth, though, I think I appear to be in the small minority, because I still   see the risks to growth to the downside I am concerned that the gains that we have seen recently   in the real economy are limited and are potentially just temporary reflections of the policy   actions undertaken earlier this year  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I favor alternative B  It is good to see   more data showing that the economy is on a path to recovery, but, as I noted earlier, the gains   have been very limited, and the recovery remains quite fragile  My view about the direction of              September 22–23, 2009 165 of 212  inflation is more balanced Fortunately, inflation expectations have been a lot more stable than   we might have anticipated even a few months ago, when we were concerned that inflation   expectations would fall I attribute this stability at least in part to our communications strategy    Given the minimal extent of the recovery so far and the very moderate levels of inflation, I   believe the continuation of our current accommodative policy is appropriate   Regarding the language in paragraph 3, I support inserting the word “wide” in the first   sentence I also think that we will be purchasing and should be purchasing the entire $1¼ trillion   in mortgage-backed securities  In addition, I think it’s important to be as transparent as we can   be, so I would delete the “up to” in front of the $1¼ trillion of agency mortgage-backed   securities I would obviously leave the “up to” in front of the $200 billion in agency debt    Regarding the language on tapering our purchases, Brian Sacks’s comments and analysis   yesterday moved me to support using the “end of the first quarter” language in that section    Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  While I am pleased by the output gains   that the economy posted last quarter, I do remain concerned about how the economy will develop   over the coming year  So in preparation for this meeting, I focused my discussions with my   business contacts on the question, How sustainable are the third-quarter growth figures?   Despite many signs that housing prices and sales of existing homes are stabilizing, home   builders in my District are still largely anticipating a bleak outlook for 2010  They noted that   their interest costs for holding land continue to rise, even while the value of that land has sagged    Small builders reported that the increase in housing starts that we saw in the third quarter is due   in large part to the fact that big builders are working off land inventories and then selling their   homes at fire-sale prices  These smaller builders do not see the gains that we saw in housing   starts as sustainable   The commercial real estate developers, realtors, and investors fundamentally view their   circumstances as dire, and they see a lot more pain ahead  I am not expecting commercial   construction to add to GDP next year, but beyond that it is going to take a lot of skill by many   people to resolve the commercial real estate problems in an orderly way  The problems in the   commercial real estate sector add another dimension of uncertainty to my outlook   Although consumption figures picked up notably in the third quarter, many of my   contacts stressed the continuing effects of weakened household balance sheets on consumer   spending A national apparel and personal care retailer confirmed this perspective by noting that   households are turning from credit cards to debit cards to rein in their spending       November 3–4, 2009 94 of 201  An auto insurer in my District reported that households are registering and insuring fewer   automobiles as households try to reduce their expenses  The insurer also reported that more   customers stopped making payments after they received confirmation of having insurance or   proof of insurance Demands for these services are lower, but this insurer emphasized that the   patterns that he is seeing reflect general ongoing stress that is evident in household balance   sheets The progress that is evident in consumer spending in the third quarter, seems unlikely to   be sustained without notable progress on employment   I think that reports like these make it hard to extrapolate forward the full strength in the   third-quarter growth rate  So while my forecast has good growth in the third quarter, which I   think was aided by many government interventions, my expectations for the fourth quarter and   for next year are for less growth than is in the Greenbook projection  In my outlook, the   recovery does not build momentum until the second half of 2010  The restraints on economic   growth in my projections stem primarily from the continued weakness in both residential and   commercial construction and a slow recovery in consumer spending  Despite the weaker output   path that I have in my projection, my unemployment rate does look very close to the   Greenbook’s   My projection for inflation hasn’t changed materially in response to the recent good news   in output Core inflation rates continue to sag despite stable inflation expectations  The median   CPI has declined over the past several months, which points to the influence that the economic   slack is having on current pricing  I appreciate that others correctly point out that output gaps   have not always been reliable in forecasting inflation  But the compensation data show plenty of   evidence that economic slack is currently affecting our economy  Indeed, based on the rate of   productivity growth that I expect we will see posted for the third quarter, it seems that unit labor     November 3–4, 2009 95 of 201  costs have fallen sharply  Fortunately, inflation expectations haven’t declined, which helped to   prevent some of the downward pressure that we are seeing from converting into sharper deflation   in consumer prices  Still, my outlook for core PCE inflation is that it will dip below 15 percent   in 2010 and only gradually increase toward 2 percent in 2011  In sum, I view the risks around   my outlook as balanced  The risks to my outlook for inflation remain balanced because I think   that shifting inflation expectations could go in either direction  Even if we have seen stable   inflation expectations to date, we could, as President Bullard pointed out in his memo,   experience an expectation shock in this highly unusual economic environment   On output growth, I have shifted my balance of risks from downside to balanced  I still   harbor the concern that the momentum we are currently seeing may fade more quickly than I   currently have in my outlook  But the strength in the third-quarter data also shows that surprises   to the upside are possible Notably, export growth has been a surprise in the third quarter, and   stronger world growth, as Nathan pointed out yesterday, would boost my outlook considerably    And as the Greenbook points out, we just don’t have a lot of experience with systemic financial   shocks, and perhaps the economy will prove to be more resilient to these shocks next year than I   currently expect Thank you, Mr Chairman      Mr Chairman, when the first draft of alternative B came out, it   dropped economic conditions and just listed these three factors, and I commented to Brian that I   thought that was just too narrow because it was so closely focused on these three factors  So I   prefer this revised language because it leaves in economic conditions and then, as you point out,   highlights these three factors  I just wanted to highlight that it was a concern that I had raised  I   prefer the language as it is now    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I also support alternative B  I think the   language in B acknowledges the improvement in economic conditions that we saw last quarter but   limits the importance of that information in a way that I think is appropriate   When I read the initial version of alternative B, before we had the benefit of the Bluebook’s   explanation in which the staff laid out a communication strategy, I was concerned that the public   would not understand why we were making this change in the language in paragraph 3 from our   September statement around economic conditions  I was also concerned, as I said earlier, about   leading the public to focus on just the three factors that are listed  I think this new language is more   flexible in a constructive way, and yet it is still consistent with the staff’s communication strategy   that has been laid out                       November 3–4, 2009 158 of 201  In regard to the communication strategy, I also want to express my appreciation to Brian and   the staff for being so responsive to our request that a communication strategy be laid out that will   line up with and support our exit strategy  The sequence of statements that you’ve given us is very   constructive It will give us time to think about and adjust the language well in advance of our   having to take action  So I just want to thank you for doing that  It was very helpful  Thank you,   Mr Chairman    Thank you I think this follows up on the point about the meeting that   we’ll have in January to discuss tools and sequencing  Brian, on your chart 27, my staff had   conducted a similar analysis  They used the dates from December 2008 through current period   and found that there is a closer correlation between the effective fed funds rate and interest on   reserves when excess reserves are under $800 billion  It is not as clear on your chart as it was on   the chart that my staff prepared  Is this a useful analysis as we start to think about the tools and   sequencing?  When excess reserves are closer to $800 billion, will the interest on reserves then   be a more effective tool?    It might also be a good time to remind directors  There was one   occasion when it was leaked, and it was a federal crime  So it might be an appropriate time to   remind directors, as we do all the time, that any discussion of the discount rate is confidential,   and if there is a leak, it’s a federal offense    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I am pleased to see the signs of   improvement in the economic data we received during the intermeeting period, especially in the   November employment report  Nonetheless, I see the economy in 2010 as having little   momentum and as challenged by a lack of business confidence  My business contacts report that   sales are up from earlier this year, but they don’t see the momentum that is needed for a        December 15–16, 2009 72 of 247  sustained recovery  Several of my contacts noted that recent growth is unlikely to be sustained,   because it was driven by one-time gains  For example, business has been picking up in several   manufacturing industries, because they are replacing inventories at the wholesale level  They   indicated that wholesalers had not been restocking earlier in the year  Inventory restocking is   obviously welcomed, but if it is without a sustained improvement in final demand, it implies   only a temporary strengthening in economic activity   My business contacts also expressed a general lack of confidence in the outlook They   view the current environment as so alien that most of them were uncomfortable providing an   outlook for 2010 They tell me that their conventional methods for assessing their own business   prospects are irrelevant in this environment  On top of the uncertainties about the economic   outlook, as others have noted, proposals for health care reform, financial reform, and the new   environmental regulations, have the potential to affect business conditions significantly in the   near future   I am concerned that this lack of confidence in the economy’s prospects for even the next   few quarters is going to be a significant barrier to a more robust recovery  Businesses continue   to stress cash preservation and cost containment as their top priorities  They report little   incentive or motivation to invest in capital projects  To quote one CEO, “We’re not going to   invest or prepare for growth without orders in hand”  This issue of confidence was also raised in   a recent discussion at our joint board of directors meeting, among the businesspeople and the   bankers, on credit availability and bank lending standards   For large firms, which have access to the public debt markets, credit is now available on   more attractive terms than earlier this year  But, as others have commented, smaller firms, which   rely primarily on banks, are complaining about the availability of credit  Bankers expressed a     December 15–16, 2009 73 of 247  lack of confidence in the values of their borrowers’ collateral as one of the main reasons that   they have had to raise their lending standards   Many of the businesspeople criticized the higher pricing and tighter terms for lending as   being based on unreasonable assessments of their businesses  So they are losing confidence in   banks as a reliable source for funds in the face of elevated terms and additional covenants  These   reports suggest that credit availability continues to be an impediment to growth, particularly if   we are counting on small businesses to contribute to economic growth   My business contacts did have some good news, and that is that more firms are expecting   to return to profitability  With this improvement, several businesses reported that they would at   least partially restore hours, wages, and benefits that had been cut when the outlook was more   dire These actions should aid GDP growth, even if they have little effect on the unemployment   rate for a while More broadly, the speed and scale of the cutbacks many businesses   implemented earlier this year give firms substantial room to expand activities before they would   have to hire any new employees   Weighing all of these reports and the recent data, I made only minor changes to my   outlook I continue to see weaker GDP growth in the current quarter and for 2010 than the   Greenbook projection I expect the unemployment rate to remain roughly unchanged in   December, with only modest improvements through all of next year  My projection for core   PCE inflation remains low throughout 2010 before it gradually converges towards 2 percent   beginning in 2011 My inflation outlook is based on the significant amount of excess capacity   that we currently have and inflation expectations that remain close to 2 percent from one to ten   years out, according to my staff’s model for inflation expectations        December 15–16, 2009 74 of 247  I continue to see the risks as balanced around my outlook for economic growth and   inflation The potential for the recent momentum in labor markets to continue is roughly offset   by the potential for further restraints on credit availability  For inflation, uncertainty remains   elevated on either side of my projection  This uncertainty is linked closely to whether or not   inflation expectations remain anchored  Overall, the economy is certainly in better shape than   earlier this year, but it is still not clear to me that the economy has truly turned the corner  Thank   you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Before beginning to shift the current   stance on monetary policy, I would like to see the economy on a more solid footing  Therefore, I   support alternative B   I am clearly in a minority  In fact, I think I am the only person so far that was going to   raise concerns about adding paragraph 4 to the alternative B language  I agree with the   assessment that conditions in financial markets have been normalizing, and I see great value in   informing the public after this meeting about the termination of our special liquidity facilities,   but I am concerned that adding this paragraph to our statement today might imply that we are   beginning to tighten the stance of policy  So I was going to suggest that we avoid any confusion   at this point and issue a separate statement  But releasing two distinct statements doesn’t seem   practical, and no one else has suggested it One suggestion I had was to add a word like   “separately” in the beginning of paragraph 4, so it would read something like, “Separately, in   light of the ongoing improvements in the functioning of financial markets,” et cetera   But that said, the only other comment I wanted to make is that, just like many others, I   concur with President Rosengren’s comments around making changes to the primary credit rate         December 15–16, 2009 128 of 247  It would be helpful to have more discussion about that at our next meeting  And if we do make a   change, then coupling it with the introduction of the term deposit facility or other exit strategy   communications would be preferable  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I also support increasing the primary   credit rate to a 50 basis point spread, reducing the term to overnight on primary credit, and   reducing the TAF auctions to zero after March  As others have noted, we will have to   communicate that these changes are appropriate given the absence of liquidity problems and that   they are not a shift in the stance of monetary policy   Turning to the strategies for removing our accommodation, I also want to start by   thanking the staff for the background memos, and in particular Jim and Spence for providing a   coherent framework for discussing the issues that we face in exiting from the current, more   complicated monetary policy environment  The memos were very helpful to me  I also think   that it is helpful to recall that we had a fairly effective operating regime and communication   strategy prior to the crisis  So I would like to return to the more familiar, less complicated pre-  crisis policy regime as soon as practicable  Because I favor returning to the pre-crisis operating   regime—that is, relying mainly on short-term interest rates as our active policy instrument—I   prefer to keep the unwinding of our asset holdings in the background   January 26–27, 2010 80 of 260    To this end, I favor a very gradual sales strategy to reduce the size of the balance sheet    Because even a steady and gradual pace of asset sales constitutes some reduction in the current   degree of policy accommodation, we may want to commit initially to a more conservative   redemption-only policy and then only later announce plans for gradual sales  The staff memos   point out that a very gradual sales strategy enables us to smooth out an otherwise variable rate of   asset redemptions  Some forward guidance about the balance sheet would be helpful to keep   market expectations in line with this Committee’s intended path   In answer to question 2, I support the redemption of all parts of the LSAP portfolio   including all agency debt and mortgage-backed securities along with some Treasuries  On   question 3, I favor draining reserves with reserve-management tools prior to increasing our   primary policy rate  As noted in the staff memos, lower reserve levels would enhance the   effectiveness of our operating procedures by improving the connection between the fed funds   rate and the rate on excess reserves  An additional factor in my preference for early reserve drain   is that we do not have much practical experience with these reserve-draining instruments, and   therefore, we should allow some time for them to be deployed and the desired amount of   draining to build up  A clear demonstration of these tools intended as technical preparations and   not tightening per se would bolster the public’s confidence in our abilities  Additionally, an   early reserve drain may be helpful in containing inflation expectations   The Desk reports were very helpful in my thinking about question 4  It was reassuring to   me to hear both that we likely have the ability to ramp up our use of these reserve-management   tools quickly and that this action would not be a surprise to market participants prior to any rate   increase  Still, I think it would be practical to begin with small amounts, like $10 billion to   $20 billion, and then to increase the drain steadily toward a more aggressive draining of reserves,   January 26–27, 2010 81 of 260    as long as, again, the effects on financial markets remain minimal  If we do undertake this   draining of reserves in advance of an increase in our short-term interest rates, it is going to   require effective communications, as was pointed out in the Clouse and Hilton memo   My responses to questions 5, 6, and 7 are influenced by my desire to return to a pre-crisis   operating regime  There is already enough uncertainty about our policies and the state of the   economy without introducing additional changes  I would try to move toward an all-Treasury   portfolio similar to what we had prior to the crisis  I also favor working to retain the fed funds   rate as our primary policy tool  That said, I am concerned that the characteristics of the fed funds   rate might change or could deteriorate significantly, but I am not so concerned that I would want   to introduce more confusion by adding another complicating issue at this point  I think it is   important to lay out a strategy, and I think a return to our pre-crisis operating procedures is a   good starting point  Of course, we may gain experience and discover that we have no choice but   to make further changes  For the maximum effectiveness, as others have said, whatever strategy   we choose, I presume that we will find the appropriate forum for laying out our approach in as   much detail as we can in advance so that our subsequent actions and statements would be   understood within the broader context that we have in mind  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  My outlook has not changed significantly   since our December meeting or since the last forecast submission in November  My outlook for   real GDP growth for the first half of 2010 has been consistently on the softer side of the forecast   distribution, and currently my outlook for the entire year falls on the low side as well  My   outlook for growth is restrained relative to a typical business cycle recovery path for some of the   reasons that many of us have discussed before—wealth losses, credit constraints, weak labor   markets, and increased preferences for liquidity, just to name a few   However, I also have a notably more pessimistic assessment of capital spending this year   than is shown in the Greenbook baseline, and so I would like to focus my comments on that   sector  Business executives appear to be unusually aggressive about restraining their capital   spending this year  According to the survey that the Board staff asked us to conduct, capital   investment plans of the respondents in my District remain remarkably modest following last   year’s steep contraction in capital spending  In my conversations with CEOs of some very large   companies, several important factors emerged  These firms have plenty of cash, and they have   little need to borrow, so credit constraints are not the issues for many of these large companies    But with no top-line growth, holding down investment spending increases profits and adds   flexibility  Firms have been challenging themselves to see how much paring back they can do to   generate cash  One executive told me that he never thought that he would reduce capital   spending below his depreciation charges, but last year his cap-ex was equal to one-half of his   depreciation   January 26–27, 2010 141 of 260    Business executives also tell me that uncertainties over health care reform, cap and trade,   and corporate tax policies are significant impediments in their capital spending decisions  On the   margins, these factors are pushing their plans for capital spending offshore, where the underlying   longer-term growth dynamics favor investments relative to the United States  Another element   in the capital spending decision process is the underlying amount of excess labor capacity  Many   companies have reduced work hours and furloughed employees, and the CEO of one   manufacturing company that has 70,000 employees worldwide told me that his entire workforce   was required to take one week off per quarter  Just eliminating that program adds 8 percent   capacity to his workforce, and just yesterday this CEO announced that they have eliminated that   program, so that is a positive sign  Nonetheless, this CEO and the other CEOs that I talked to   said that they are going to use overtime well before they take on any new positions  Comments   like these persuade me that labor markets and, hence, household spending will be quite moderate   for a while  It also seems to me that it is going to take longer than usual to get a sense of when   the recovery is truly taking hold   Putting all of these pieces together, I continue to see weak growth in the current year, just   2½ percent over the entire 2010  In my outlook, the recovery doesn’t really start to gain   momentum until 2011, when I see GDP growth hitting roughly 4¼ percent  As job losses   moderate and many people remain out of the labor markets, I expect the unemployment rate to   edge down to 9½ percent at the end of this year and to fall to just below 8 percent in the fourth   quarter of 2011   Turning to inflation, the incoming data continue to confirm my outlook of slowing core   inflation in the near term  The Cleveland Fed’s median and trimmed mean analysis of the   consumer price data consistently points to a further moderation of PCE core inflation to about   January 26–27, 2010 142 of 260    1 percent this year  Despite the continued and substantial resource slack, renewed economic   growth and anchored expectations pull up PCE core inflation in my outlook to 15 percent in   2011 and 17 percent in 2012  That said, I am hearing some increasing reports about concerns   about commodity-price increases  Although the contacts who talk about these concerns say that   the fundamentals don’t support sustained commodity-price increases, there is some concern   emerging that in the current environment of rising federal deficits and accommodative monetary   policy, inflation expectations could destabilize as a result of these commodity-price movements   So, overall, the risks to my outlook for economic growth and inflation remain balanced,   and the uncertainty attached to my projections remains high  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support alternative B  My outlook   hasn’t changed very much since our last meeting, and the uncertainty around my outlook remains   high  So I support keeping policy unchanged at this time  In paragraph 2, I agree that we should   eliminate the reference to energy prices  In paragraph 3, I don’t think we should change the   language from “purchases” to “holdings” until we have completed our purchases  I concur with   the staff’s assessment that this change in language could lead market participants to anticipate   sales even before we are ready to communicate our plans for unwinding our balance sheet  And   in paragraph 4, I have a slight preference for leaving the language on TAF as it is currently   written  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  My outlook for GDP growth remains   somewhat below the Greenbook baseline forecast for both this year and next, and I don’t expect   the unemployment rate to fall below 9 percent until mid-2011  My weaker output growth and   higher unemployment profile resembles a combination of the Greenbook’s lower-potential-  output and persistent-caution scenarios  In my outlook, unprecedented levels of long-term   unemployment lead to a weaker recovery in output growth along the lines of the Greenbook’s   lower-potential-output scenario   Past experiences with very long-lived unemployment spells indicate that workers lose   valuable human capital during their unemployment that is not recovered for years after the   unemployment spell ends  The clearest evidence for these losses is research that examined the   consequences of permanent job losses in Pennsylvania in the wake of the severe shake-out in the   steel industry during the 1980s  Unfortunately, many of today’s long-term unemployed could   suffer a similar fate, which, when added up over millions of people, accumulates to a lower level   of potential output  The loss of human capital is likely to be extended for some time, as I’m also   seeing early evidence of a jobless recovery  The past two recoveries were characterized by low   job-finding rates, and that pattern seems to be repeating itself in the current recovery  The   comments that I’ve been hearing from a range of business people have indicated few plans for   hiring in the coming year, as many have already mentioned  This has been particularly the case   for large groups of small businesses that we’ve been meeting with throughout the District during   March 16, 2010 61 of 146    the past couple of months  Overall, what I’m hearing is that it’s likely that the unemployment   duration is set to grow even longer   I also find the Greenbook’s persistent-caution scenario consistent with widespread reports   that I’m hearing from both households and businesses in my District  The sheer magnitude of   the recession caught many by surprise and has instilled a heightened sense of caution in both   households and businesses  This is evident in a range of sentiment indicators, but perhaps most   telling in households’ expectations for their own income growth  The Michigan survey has   included that question for years, and households reliably answered that they expected their   incomes to grow about 3 percent or more, even in recession years  Since March of 2009,   respondents are now anticipating near zero growth in their income  With these types of   expectations for no income growth, it’s likely that we’re going to see the elevated saving rate   continue beyond the current year   Businesses that have made it through this recession, with a few exceptions, are just as   cautious in their investment and hiring plans  Most of the CEOs that I talk to from large and   small companies say that there’s just way too much uncertainty out there, uncertainty over health   care reform, energy, environmental, and tax policies  As President Fisher commented, the CEOs   claim that uncertainty is so great that it’s causing them either to delay investments or to divert   them to countries where uncertainty is much lower  It’s not a ringing endorsement of our   country when I hear these executives say that they see China and India as a lower-risk   investment climate   Shifting to the inflation outlook, the incoming data on consumer prices highlight   significant downward pressure on pricing, as many have already commented  I’ll add one more   data point  The Cleveland trimmed mean and median CPI series have both been on a   March 16, 2010 62 of 146    disinflationary path since mid-2008  Looking at the distribution of price changes, more than   40 percent of the consumer’s market basket has been exhibiting outright price decreases over the   last six months  This is somewhat striking considering that during the 2003 period, in which we   were worried about falling prices, that phenomenon occurred only once  This tendency for core   inflation to head lower is gradually offset in my projection by the effects of lower potential   output and anchored inflation expectations, which, in my forecast begin to push inflation higher   in 2011   Overall the risks around my outlook for output growth remain balanced, with my   business contacts citing a range of potential downside risks that are offset by the fact that   pessimism does tend to dominate at similar points in recoveries, and then we’ve been surprised   with growth to the upside  In terms of inflation, with core inflation rates edging lower and our   limited options for further policy responses, I’m now leaning towards the inflation risks in my   forecast being slightly to the downside  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’m from the boring Midwest, so I don’t   have a pithy quote on brevity, but I am going to be very brief  I support alternative B  In my   view, policy needs to remain accommodative while we’re still waiting for clear evidence of a   self-sustaining recovery and the abatement of any further disinflationary pressures  I prefer to   make minimal changes to our statement, so I would not include the bracketed language in   paragraph 2—I’m concerned that it would be a distraction  Finally, I, too, am looking forward to   a time when we can communicate our exit strategy in our statement, so I’m hopeful that our   discussion at the April meeting will move us closer to that possibility  Thank you, Mr   Chairman     Yes     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I also would like to compliment the staff   for providing a very useful set of memos that organize the many complex issues associated with   potential asset sales into a workable set of options   After examining the staff analysis of the options and the different objectives that they   seek to accomplish, I found myself looking for the best way to attain several objectives  First, I   would like to return the SOMA to an all-Treasuries composition in the intermediate term, but I   would initiate asset sales only when the economic recovery is well established  Second, I would   like to minimize market disruptions  Third, I would like to avoid having to purchase any   additional MBS down the road  Fourth, I would like to rely as much as possible on the federal   April 27–28, 2010 48 of 206                   funds rate or other short-term policy rates as the primary signal of monetary policy  And finally,   I think the realized or unrealized losses on the SOMA portfolio should be a second-order   consideration and should not drive our decisions   Comparing the five policy options in the staff memo against these objectives, I find   options 1, 3, and 5 to be less appealing than options 2 and 4  Option 1 doesn’t get us back to an   all-Treasury SOMA quickly enough  Option 3 puts the sales and potential purchase of assets in   the policy forefront rather than the interest on excess reserves or the federal funds rate  Option 5   poses the risk of market disruptions, and if the economy starts to deteriorate, it could be difficult   for us to provide the necessary monetary policy stimulus due to the zero lower bound   Option 4 is attractive to me because it returns us to a Treasuries-only SOMA within five   years and places the emphasis of monetary control on short-term policy rates  By starting with   relatively small quantities of sales and then scaling up over time, we could likely minimize   disruptions to mortgage markets and the broader economy, and, of course, by having to   announce asset sales only once, we could reduce uncertainty over at least one aspect of monetary   policy   I am concerned, however, about the extent of pre-commitment embodied in option 4,   which, I realize, is meant to be its inherent strength  I am very uncertain about what economic   and financial conditions will prevail three years or so out, and if we go down the path of this pre-  commitment strategy, it might be that as we’re ramping up these sales, we could face a situation   with an economy that is deteriorating, and that would make it very difficult for us to provide   accommodation  It would also cause us to deviate from our preannounced path and then,   perhaps, cause us to lose some of our credibility   April 27–28, 2010 49 of 206                   That leaves me favoring option 2  Option 2 doesn’t have all the benefits that come with a   pre-commitment in option 4, but in choosing option 2, we could be committing to sell all agency   debt and MBS within a specified time period, which I view as a large step forward  In addition,   option 2 contains an embedded option of its own  We can choose at any time in the future to   invoke a stronger commitment to sell along a particular path, as in option 4  For example, two   years from now, we could pre-commit to an explicit sales path, if that strategy has merit at that   time  So I think option 2 brings many of the advantages of option 4, but with more flexibility    One other consideration that tips me in favor of option 2 is the fact that the economic outcomes   associated with options 2 and 4 are very similar, at least as modeled here by the staff  I realize   these scenarios, as others have said, are hard to model and the range of real outcomes might be   wider than has been presented  But based on what I can see, the pre-commitment strategy is not   buying me enough of an improvement in the outcomes to overcome my concerns about the   inflexibility in option 4   Regarding the redemption of Treasury securities, I was prepared to support the language   that was presented in alternative B that states we would stop reinvesting the proceeds from   maturing Treasuries  I do have some of the concerns that others have mentioned that the   redemption of Treasuries will be a tightening of monetary policy, but I can support that step   because it will help us start unwinding our balance sheet  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I am seeing early signs of a recovery in   the Fourth District, and incoming information has improved my outlook for economic growth in   the first half of this year  In fact, I now expect output growth for the first half of the year to be   roughly a full percentage point better than my January forecast submission  Economic activity   has strengthened in the last quarter, and my business contacts are more confident that we are on a   sustainable recovery path than they were just a few months ago  But it’s still not clear how much   of the strength that we’ve seen recently is tied to nonrecurring factors, like inventory restocking,   stimulus programs, and other short-term supports   My economic growth outlook for the remainder of this year and in 2011 is still subdued   relative to the recoveries we’ve typically seen after steep recessions  And it’s consistent with   what most of my business contacts are telling me they expect  They remain very cautious about   growth prospects going forward  In fact, two very large manufacturers in my District had first-  quarter earnings that exceeded expectations, but they were criticized by analysts for not moving   up their earnings for the rest of the year  They are saying that they just have never been through   an episode like this one, and this first-quarter strong performance just isn’t sustainable in their   minds right now  So it’s that kind of caution, along with the immense challenges of relocating   people who have been unemployed for long spells, that is keeping growth in my medium-term   outlook below the Greenbook baseline   April 27–28, 2010 100 of 206                   These issues are also reflected in my interpretation of the high levels of productivity   growth we saw in the later part of last year  My outlook for productivity growth during the next   few years is less sanguine than the Greenbook’s  My business contacts continue to report that   they are expecting to keep hiring limited, while still easily meeting expected increases in   demand  So these reports do suggest elevated productivity growth in the near term  However,   my business contacts also report that they are being very disciplined in their capital investments,   especially in their US facilities, which will limit investment-driven productivity growth  In   addition, they report that the available labor pool contains an unusually large fraction of people   with very long unemployment spells, people who have to reintegrate into the economy with   some loss of skills and productivity  Combining these disparate trends, I expect a notable   deceleration in productivity growth over the next few years, relative to the Greenbook baseline    And my slower productivity growth then translates into a slower output expansion path than the   one in the Greenbook baseline   My assumption for relatively slower productivity growth than the Greenbook also has   some implications for my inflation outlook  My inflation outlook is already very low in the near   term  It drops below 1 percent in the current quarter  From there, it gradually increases in   response to stable inflation expectations and an accommodative monetary policy, and it reaches   15 percent by the end of 2012  If, instead, productivity were to evolve along the Greenbook   baseline, unit labor cost in my outlook would likely be even lower than I now expect, with the   result that inflation would remain fairly flat, near 1 percent, rather than edging up as in my   current outlook   A pattern of subdued inflation is quite evident in the price data  My staff, as you know,   has been calculating the median CPI for years as a measure of underlying inflation pressures    April 27–28, 2010 101 of 206                   The 12-month increase in the median CPI has fallen precipitously, to a record low of 06 percent   in March—evidence of disinflationary forces at work  And even if we exclude housing, the 12-  month trend in the median CPI still stands at an extraordinarily low 12 percent   Consulting with my business contacts on how they see the pricing developments in their   businesses has tended to confirm very low inflation rates  Businesses that are in some of the   harder-hit industries, such as commercial and residential construction, continue to talk about   significant price-cutting  But even in sectors where activity is recovering, ample productivity   growth enables companies to hold prices steady, even when commodity prices are picking up    It’s not easy to convert pricing anecdotes into retail-level price measures, but the reports on   pricing decisions strike me as unusually tame at this time   The incoming data on output have helped to confirm my sense that the risks to my   outlook for economic growth are balanced  But in terms of inflation, I see the risks as weighted   to the downside  For example, as I have noted, productivity growth along the Greenbook path   would put further downward pressure on unit labor costs than is embedded in my outlook    Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support alternative B  In my view,   policy needs to remain accommodative until we see clearer evidence that the recovery is self-  sustaining and we see the abatement of any further deflationary pressures  I also support your   suggestion to postpone the decision on Treasury securities reinvestments until we see further   staff analysis  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I, too, am supportive of giving you   approval to proceed with the swap lines, contingent upon Ecofin coming up with strong   measures, as well as some follow-up that you’re going to do to control some of the political   fallout  Like others, I believe it’s critical that we take these actions based on the economic   merits, so I’m supportive of your moving forward  Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  On asset sales, I am where the majority of   the Committee was at our last meeting, and I prefer to wait on asset sales until we start raising   interest rates  I support giving the Desk the authority to conduct the coupon swaps to facilitate   the settlement of our MBS purchases   June 22–23, 2010 41 of 213             Regarding Treasury redemptions, given my outlook, which I’ll talk about in the next go-  round, I prefer option 1  I, too, would like to reduce the duration of our Treasury holdings as   presented in option 2, but, given the communications risk that we’ve talked about and also   Brian’s comment that option 2 could put some modest upward pressure on long-term interest   rate, I prefer to stay with option 1 at this meeting  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The incoming data since our last meeting   were on balance largely consistent with my outlook for growth, although recent price and wage   June 22–23, 2010 81 of 213             data have caused me to revise my inflation projection downward slightly  What has changed the   most over the intermeeting period is my assessment of the risks to my outlook, and I want to   focus on two key risks—the European debt crisis and the downward momentum in the inflation   process   The sovereign debt crisis in Europe and the consequent financial turbulence has   dominated financial market behaviors over the past several weeks  Although this is troubling,   my outlook assumes that European policymakers will prevent the crisis from escalating further    In my forecast, the effects of the crisis on output are modest and result only from diminished   export demand and a weaker euro  Overall, I didn’t revise my forecast for output very much   since our last meeting  And with the Tealbook’s downward revision to output, our projections   now are very close—both have moderate and unspectacular economic growth this year and next    This outlook for growth is consistent with what I am hearing from my business contacts, who   generally are reporting gradual growth    At the same time, many of my contacts are reporting concerns about the potential scope   of the European debt crisis  For example, a manufacturer of capital equipment used in steel   production reported that his order backlog has already been reduced by a combination of weaker   growth in southern Europe and exchange rate movements  The effects on his output have been   limited to date, but going forward he is concerned about a potential for further depreciation of   the euro, which would likely turn his business sharply downward  The European debt crisis is   also having an effect on business sentiment  Some of my contacts are quite concerned about the   prospect of more trouble in financial markets, and they are saying that, if these concerns become   realized, then we could see a slowing of projects that might otherwise be funded   June 22–23, 2010 82 of 213             Reports like these lead me to believe that the European debt crisis poses a substantial risk   to my outlook  My staff considered some alternative scenarios to the European sovereign debt   crisis that were less dire than those in the Tealbook’s tail risk scenario but still substantial   enough to create a risk to my outlook  I don’t think these scenarios are very likely, but I do think   that the European debt crisis merits close monitoring, and it is the main reason that I have shifted   my risk to output from balanced to weighted to the downside   On the inflation front, most of the incoming evidence supports further disinflation  With   respect to the price data themselves, there is simply no momentum to signal an imminent upturn    Core inflation, as measured by the Cleveland Fed’s median CPI, continues to drift lower  It   dropped to 05 percent on a year-over-year basis in May, and that’s an all-time low    Compensation growth also continues to weaken, pushing unit labor costs lower  Furthermore,   some of this downward momentum in inflation may be spilling over to inflation expectations  In   the past month, the Cleveland Fed’s inflation expectations model, which limits the effect of   flight-to-quality issues, shows a drop of over 15 basis points at all horizons less than 10 years    These developments have caused me to revise down my inflation forecast, and it’s now more like   that in the Tealbook in the medium term   Given that I have repeatedly revised down my inflation outlook, I am concerned that   there may be downward momentum in the inflation process that I am not incorporating in my   outlook  And the European debt crisis also presents further downside risk to inflation through   the exchange rate and weaker foreign growth  In summary, the risks to my outlook for growth   have shifted to the downside, and the risks to my outlook for inflation continue to be to the   downside  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support alternative B  I think the   uncertainties are too great to adjust our policy in either direction at this meeting  The economy is   recovering gradually, but the European debt crisis and the resulting lower appetite for risk in   financial markets are risks to the recovery  The inflation data continue to show a broad   disinflationary pattern, and compensation data have been weak, and have led to yet another   round of lower inflation projections   My baseline outlook is still consistent with alternative B, but, in my view, the risks for   both inflation and output are weighted to the downside  I do think that these downside risks   warrant discussion of actions we could take in the event of an adverse shock  While I’m still   satisfied with the state of our exit strategy discussion, I do think we should devote some time to   talk about policy alternatives that we have if the downside risks materialize  Thank you, Mr   Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  My outlook hasn’t changed by that much   over the intermeeting period  In fact, since spring my projections for output have generally been   among the weakest on the Committee and weaker than the Tealbook path  Coming into this   meeting, I find that my baseline outlook for both output and inflation is very similar to that of the   Tealbook  Misery, as they say, loves company, but in this case, I wish I had less company   We all recognize that this has been a very difficult forecasting environment  We are all   trying to figure out how to account for the effects of such factors as tight credit conditions, weak   August 10, 2010 31 of 160             housing markets, poor consumer confidence, and long spells of unemployment I have been   fairly skeptical about how quickly these elements of the economic environment would improve,   and, unfortunately, my skepticism appears to be warranted  Financial markets had not been as   skeptical as I have been, but the weaker labor market reports and the benchmark revisions to   GDP appear to have convinced many people that we are in for a long slog   The banking sector provides a good example of the headwinds that I am trying to   quantify  While financial market conditions have generally improved, as the staff memos   indicate, they continue to carry downside risks  I asked my bank supervision staff for an   assessment of Fourth District banks, including our three SCAP banks  On the plus side, the loan   losses to date have not been as bad as projected under the adverse scenario  However, many   banks are seeing less revenue growth than was anticipated, primarily as a result of sluggish   lending conditions  Moreover, commercial real estate exposures still lurk on bank balance   sheets  To me, these results validate incorporating substantial limits on both credit availability   and credit demand into my outlook throughout the recovery period  As I said, I have tried to   include all the various headwind factors into my baseline projection since the spring, but I still   worry that I have not fully accounted for the degree of restraint that these factors might be   imposing on output and inflation   When I speak to my business contacts, very few admit to optimism  Nearly all of them   express uncertainty about the environment, and nearly all of them wonder where the strength in   the economy will come from  If I were to transform these emotional sentiments into numbers,   they could very well look like the weaker recovery scenario in the Tealbook  Clearly, this   scenario brings with it very large social costs and would justify an even more aggressive   monetary policy response   August 10, 2010 32 of 160             On the inflation front, the GDP revisions bumped up the PCE inflation numbers over the   last two quarters, but this was largely in the nonmarket items that are very difficult to forecast   and are likely unobserved by households  When looking at either the CPI or the market-based   PCE components, the disinflationary trend is evident and is consistent with my forecast that   inflation will remain below my longer-term objectives for the next few years  My baseline   projection for inflation assumes no change in inflation expectations  Unfortunately, as President   Bullard pointed out, my staff’s model-based measures of inflation expectations have detected a   slight decline in expectations at all time horizons  If a pronounced decline in inflation   expectations were to develop, it would be all the more difficult to prevent actual inflation from   declining further   Ordinarily, I like to develop my outlook so that the risks are balanced, in the sense that   the probability of output or inflation falling below my projection is equal to the probability of   their running above my projection  In this environment, if we are surprised to the downside, our   limited and untested policy tools raise the risk that we would find it even more difficult to   achieve our objectives  We face no such risk for upside surprises  For this reason, I regard the   risks to my outlook for both output and inflation as being skewed to the downside, as I have been   indicating since the spring  And I will hold my views on how to respond to this situation for our   upcoming policy discussion  Thank you, Mr Chairman     And it’s not Cleveland  [Laughter]     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support alternative B  As I mentioned   earlier, my outlook has not changed substantially over the intermeeting period  I have been   anticipating weak economic growth and very low inflation, and the risks to my outlook have   been skewed to the downside  Clearly, the economy remains far away from our long-term   objectives, and I have strongly supported maintaining an accommodative monetary policy   Time is probably the most essential element for the recovery  I think the Committee has   recognized this with the use of our “extended period of time” language  During the last several   months, we have seen financial markets respond to the incoming data in ways that indicate more   people are becoming more aware of just how extended an “extended period” might prove to be    Over the last year, the Committee has generally expected the liftoff in the fed funds rate to come   later than financial markets had anticipated  But, during the past few months, financial markets   have pushed out substantially their expectations of when the fed funds rate would lift off    August 10, 2010 124 of 160             Longer-term rates are exceptionally low, and, over time, if maintained, this should encourage an   expansion of credit   Nonetheless, with my balance of risk to output and inflation to the downside, I would like   to guard against any passive tightening in monetary conditions engendered by the runoff in   MBS  I realize that one feature of the policy environment is that prepayments accelerate   somewhat as long-term interest rates come down, and that decline in long-term rates itself can be   taken as evidence of some policy success  However, maintaining the size of the SOMA portfolio   at its current level seems to me to be an appropriate insurance measure  So I think that we   should take steps to keep the balance sheet from passively shrinking, and I think that we ought to   do it in a way that results in a heavier concentration in Treasuries for all the reasons that the staff   memo points out  Maintaining the SOMA holdings at their current level seems to be a   reasonable and prudent measure that could prevent a sputtering economy from stalling  So I   support the language in paragraph 4 of alternative B   I also support including the language Governor Kohn proposed in paragraph 2 for the   reasons that he articulated   Because we have seen the financial markets extend their time frame for policy action   from this Committee, I am persuaded that our statement language on the extended period of time   is being interpreted sensibly  As such, I don’t see a compelling reason to move away from that   language  I realize that market expectations could change in the future, and I do see some value   in having the kind of language that was presented in paragraph 3 of B1 at some time in the   future, if we need it to signal with more clarity than I think is necessary today Thank you, Mr   Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  During the intermeeting period, I focused   my conversations with directors and other business leaders on the issue of uncertainty  The good   news is that many were feeling more certain about the outlook now than they were in the spring    The bad news is that they are now more certain that economic growth will be slower the   remainder of this year than they thought in the spring  This is leading many business executives   to keep a tight grip on hiring and capital spending   September 21, 2010 35 of 151             Most large company executives reported solid earnings, strong balance sheets, and the   ability to remain profitable, even at the current operating levels  Many have adjusted their   business models several times to be profitable at the current low levels of output, yet they have   the financial and physical capacity for more growth  And it is worth noting that GDP profit   measures have regained their pre-recession levels, unlike many of the other data series that we   have been watching   Of course, smaller businesses have tended to struggle more in this expansion  It is harder   to assess the prospects of small businesses, because they are so diverse, but the survey of small   businesses that was conducted by the National Federation of Independent Business is pointing   very consistently to a lack of demand as the single most important problem facing the   respondents  At this point, they are not expecting more than a gradual pickup in demand  But   they are also not expecting a further decline in demand  The bankers I spoke with remain   particularly uncertain about their prospects  Continuing regulatory reform discussions and the   proposals for further capital requirements were the major sources of their concerns  But they   also continue to report weak loan demand, and most of them are still looking for profitable   lending opportunities   On a more positive note, there is growing evidence that higher saving rates and debt   reductions are gradually restoring health to household balance sheets  This appears to be   reflected in continuing retail sales growth; it is also showing up in reduced delinquencies in the   banks in my District  Of course, further improvements in consumer spending are going to   require stronger labor markets  Unfortunately, the hiring reports that I am hearing are still   consistent with limited employment growth in the near term   September 21, 2010 36 of 151             Like others, my staff has been revisiting the natural rate of unemployment, and they   applied statistical filters to calculate trends in job-finding and job-separation rates to impute the   natural rate  This approach leads to an estimate that is currently similar to the Tealbook’s, and it   suggests only a slow decline in the unemployment rate, because the underlying trend in the job-  finding rate is substantially lower than in past recoveries   Although my outlook today is a little softer than it was at last month’s meeting, I have   long expected the recovery to be gradual and bumpy  And the recent information on economic   activity is in line with that expectation  My projection for GDP calls for roughly 2 percent   growth for the second half of this year, with labor markets improving quite slowly   On the inflation front, we have been getting early signs that disinflation is abating  This   stabilization is evident in the price change distribution of CPI components  On average, just a   third of the overall index has been exhibiting outright price declines over the past three months,   compared with nearly a half of the index exhibiting outright price declines over the first five   months of this year  Although these are encouraging signs, at this point inflation expectations   are still well below my longer-run objective of 2 percent  President Bullard commented on the   Cleveland model  One more observation from that model suggests that expectations embedded   in markets are less than 2 percent from the current year to 30 years out   In sum, feedback from my contacts and analysis by my staff indicate that neither a   stronger second half of the year nor a double-dip recession seems likely  So I continue to see the   risks for both output and inflation as tilted to the downside  The current policy environment   makes it more challenging to respond to downside risks, and the need to balance the costs and   benefits of further policy actions add to my reasoning that the risks to both output and inflation   remain to the downside  Thank you, Mr Chairman   September 21, 2010 37 of 151               Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support alternative B  I expect to see the   economy expand at a rate of about 35 percent next year and for inflation to stabilize at about   1 percent  My projection is that it will take several more years for the economy to reach full   resource utilization and for inflation to move back to near 2 percent   The question is whether this rate of progress towards our longer-term objectives is   acceptable  My outlook is certainly acceptable to me, in the sense that I put low probability on   September 21, 2010 109 of 151             either entering another recession or experiencing a bout of deflation  However, I would certainly   prefer the economy to be on a path that achieves our longer-term objectives for price stability   and employment much more quickly than the path that I am forecasting  I recognize that, in   theory, there are monetary policy strategies that can put the economy on a faster growth path, but   any strategy or framework that we choose will need to cope with the fact that central banks have   very limited practical experience in dealing with the circumstances that we face  In addition, we   need to recognize the potential adverse consequences from unconventional policies  So with   these reservations in mind, Mr Chairman, I agree with you that a new framework would be   useful, and I support your recommendation that we work on developing that framework   President Lockhart just laid out four elements that he would like to see in that framework    I have some similar thoughts just using some different wording  I think a new framework is far   more likely to be successful if it has a clear target, an operating procedure, a feedback   mechanism for guiding policy adjustments, and a communications plan  Clearly, it’s going to be   challenging to identify a satisfactory framework that contains all of these elements, but I think   that it is critical that we work on developing such a framework   Adopting alternative B today has several advantages  First, it provides some continuity   with the decision we agreed on at our last meeting; also, the language in alternative B is   consistent with the language, Mr Chairman, that you used in your Jackson Hole speech a few   weeks ago  Second, alternative B opens the door to further stimulus  Third, choosing alternative   B at this meeting also gives us additional time to develop the framework that I would find more   suitable for deploying even if the outlook continues to be for moderate but still suboptimal   economic growth  Finally, I also am open to President Kocherlakota’s language in paragraph 4,   September 21, 2010 110 of 151             which would say that we are prepared to act as needed to support economic recovery, and then   the rest of the statement  Those are my thoughts  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I also want to commend the staff for putting   together a very useful set of materials and questions to guide our discussion today about a new   policy framework  I favor adopting an inflation objective as described in the second option in the   staff memo  An explicit inflation objective would provide us with more flexibility to achieve our   dual mandate, and I think it would be helpful in anchoring inflation expectations around our   objective  Option 1 leaves our inflation objective too vague, and, in the case of option 3, I am not   sure we could effectively communicate about the transition to and from a price-level target    Additionally, the memo that I circulated suggests that a price-level target could result in a fairly   large overshoot, which could complicate the management of inflation expectations   October 15, 2010 29 of 62             While I support specifying an inflation objective, like others, I would prefer that we not   provide quantitative information about maximum employment  As others have already noted,   measures of the natural rate of unemployment are not observable, they are subject to various   conceptual differences, and they pose considerable measurement challenges  Putting greater   emphasis on our employment objective, I think, also creates some additional policy risks; for   example, it is fairly typical to begin a tightening cycle even when the unemployment rate is high,   because the unemployment rate tends to be a lagging indicator  I think we should, instead, argue   that the two mandates are generally complementary and that maintaining stable inflation helps to   promote maximum employment over the long run   Although I favor option 2, a number of important issues still need to be resolved  I found   the contingent policy approach in option 3 attractive, but, as I said, I personally find the price-level   target a bit too aggressive  I would advocate a state-contingent action based on medium-term   inflation objectives rather than a price-level path  The statement could provide forward guidance by   linking the removal of accommodation to exceeding a pre-stated inflation threshold  I think this   approach would clarify what we are committed to achieving over the next several years  This   approach would most likely lead to some overshoot in inflation rates, as price-level targeting would,   but it would help to center inflation expectations around our longer-term objective or target  We   would have to determine as a Committee the specifics of how we interpret our inflation objective    Is it an annual objective as measured by core PCE?  Do we need to center inflation around the   target, as the Bank of England does?  Or do we want to set an upper bound, more like the ECB?  We   have discussed these issues before, so I think it is feasible that we could agree on an approach to a   numerical objective for inflation at our November meeting   October 15, 2010 30 of 62             Turning to questions 2 and 3, if additional accommodation is necessary for the timely   achievement of our dual mandate, I would support additional asset purchases  I would prefer large,   discrete adjustments, consistent with those that are proposed in the draft statements  We have had   experience with this approach, and I have some confidence that it would be sufficiently reliable    However, I think that the uncertainties around the effects of purchases make trying to formulate a   rule to calibrate them somewhat problematic    On question 4, I certainly find draft statement 2 an effective statement structure, particularly   if we leave the numerical unemployment rate out of the statement  A version of statement 2 would   be enhanced if we provided some supplementary information and media communications, such as a   press conference  Obviously, these remain challenging times, and I believe that clarity in our   framework will aid in setting monetary policy, both now and once the economy is on a more   sustainable recovery path   Let me close with a comment on setting precedents  As we move forward with our work, I   think we should recognize that some of the steps that we are contemplating are intended to be   temporary, while we may want to make others more permanent  So, if possible, I think we should   try to identify these issues before we move forward with a new policy framework  Thank you, Mr   Chairman       Thank you, Mr Chairman  I had a number of opportunities to hear   from business contacts throughout my District since our last meeting  In general, business   leaders have become more positive about their own situations, but they remain wary about the   overall outlook   My projections for output are broadly in line with their sentiment that the recovery in   business activity will be slow and unemployment will remain elevated  Specifically, my GDP   forecast is similar to the Tealbook’s in 2011, although it is somewhat lower in 2012 and 2013    What’s really striking about both my outlook and the Tealbook is how weak the second half of   2010 looks compared with our forecast in June  I’m still expecting to see economic growth, but   I’m concerned that the slow growth rate in my outlook leaves the economy susceptible to another   slump   My business contacts continue to tell me that lending to small and medium-sized   enterprises remains constrained, and the very slow return to a more normal lending environment   November 2–3, 2010 53 of 238             is holding back economic growth  Last week I spoke with an industrial builder who owns and   leases out a large number of his own industrial facilities  As his loans come due, he’s finding   that the properties are being appraised at lower values and that the banks will only finance   65 percent of those lower valuations  Consequently, even though the cash flows from these   properties are still intact, his company will have to put up more equity to refinance the loans    His company has been building cash balances as a precaution against just this kind of event, but   that limits his ability to put his capital to work for his own use  Several CEOs from large   companies in my District have also expressed concerns about the ability of some of their   suppliers to obtain bank financing  The CEO of a major steel company, whose orders are   growing rapidly, told me that his company is financing one of its suppliers who couldn’t obtain   bank financing to meet his orders  I think these stories illustrate that banking conditions still   have a way to go before we can say that they have normalized   On unemployment, I project only a moderate decline in the unemployment rate over the   next few years, moving down to just under 8½ percent by the end of 2012  This result is   consistent with research being done at the Cleveland Fed that uses labor market flows to estimate   the longer-term unemployment rate  Estimates generated by this method predict a higher longer-  term unemployment rate than is contained in most of the projections submitted for this meeting    An interesting implication of this research is the conclusion that labor markets have been less   dynamic over the last 10 years than they were over the rest of the postwar period, particularly in   terms of job-finding rates  My business contacts corroborate these findings, citing many reasons   for their slow hiring  Nonetheless, they generally tend to expect that this slowness will be an   ongoing feature of their hiring process, rather than just a cyclical response  This result tends to   support our recent research indicating that progress on the unemployment rate will be slower   November 2–3, 2010 54 of 238             than in past recoveries  However, this does not imply that nothing can be done about   unemployment, as the job-finding rate would still improve with stronger growth in demand   Turning to inflation, my projection continues to agree with the Tealbook that the   disinflation process is most likely not yet finished  My staff has been looking into the growing   distinction between the CPI and the PCE price index, and the results are not very reassuring    The core CPI has run 04 percentage point below the PCE over the last year  A little more than   half of this difference is due to the prices of the nonmarket components included in the core   PCE  It’s interesting to note that the PCE median that the Dallas Fed reports looks much more   like Cleveland’s median CPI, because it deemphasizes the nonmarket components in the PCE   that are running higher than most of the market components  This leaves me concerned that the   ongoing disinflation process may be materially understated in the PCE inflation rates  On a more   positive note, as Brian mentioned in his report, market measures of expected inflation have   moved up during the intermeeting period, and break-even rates from TIPS show a similar   pattern  The acceleration was particularly pronounced after the release of the FOMC minutes on   October 12, which, I think, underscores the importance of our policy decision at this meeting   In sum, the risks to my outlook for inflation and output remain to the downside  My   projection for only moderate economic growth and very low levels of inflation leaves the   economy susceptible to shocks  And I continue to be concerned that our options for responding   to falling inflation are more limited than our options for responding to rising inflation  Thank   you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support alternative B  I see the   additional asset purchases as appropriate insurance during a challenging phase of the recovery    My baseline forecast hasn’t changed meaningfully since our last meeting  I still expect output   growth to remain weak to moderate and inflation rates to remain well below the levels that I   would consider consistent with our price stability objective   On several occasions in the past, after a long sequence of federal funds rate reductions,   with a gradually improving outlook, the FOMC still chose to lower the fed funds rate as an   insurance policy to reduce the likelihood of worst outcomes  Although the alternative scenarios   for further asset purchases described in the Tealbook suggest limited impacts on the real   economy, a decision at this meeting to go ahead with some additional policy accommodation   November 2–3, 2010 148 of 238             should help to limit further disinflation  I think there is some insurance value to be derived from   solidifying recent progress and moving inflation expectations higher and closer to our long-run   inflation objective  I was concerned when financial market estimates of inflation expectations   appeared to be dipping following the September meeting  Inflation expectations have since   recovered  I view this as evidence that additional accommodation will help to lock in some of   the progress that we’ve made to date in moving inflation expectations up toward our price   stability objective   Also, with inflation already so low, particularly for CPI-based measures, I think some   insurance against further declines in inflation and inflation expectations is appropriate  It’s true   that not all of the insurance moves exercised by past Committees were viewed as necessary after   the fact  However, it’s also true that some insurance moves taken by past Committees when the   economy seemed to be doing better sometimes turned out to have been insufficient  Determining   when to do a little more, or when to stop, is never easy  But I can support additional   accommodation to help stabilize inflation expectations  Following such a strategy also enables   us to do what we can to support an improved employment picture   On the statement language, I am concerned that in the minutes of our September meeting   we indicated that we discussed providing a policy framework for further accommodation  But it   was evident during our videoconference call that finding a compromise for a framework is   proving to be challenging  In its current state, I see the language in alternative B as providing   only the most general feedback mechanism for guiding policy adjustments   One way to provide a feedback mechanism would be to modify paragraph 4 from   alternative A and insert it into alternative B  I would simplify the language around the inflation   outlook and make unemployment the last item in the list  My proposed language for paragraph 4   November 2–3, 2010 149 of 238             would read, “The Committee expects to maintain the target rate for the fed funds rate at 0 to   ¼ percent at least until mid-2012, so long as the Committee’s outlook for inflation in the   intermediate term remains consistent with its mandate, longer-term inflation expectations remain   well anchored, and the unemployment rate remains elevated”  Language along these lines helps   to link potential policy changes to inflation and inflation expectations, in addition to   unemployment, which we all expect will remain elevated beyond 2012  By providing this   feedback mechanism, we can help to stabilize inflation expectations around our price stability   mandate while also acknowledging our mandate for full employment in the long run  Thank   you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The general sentiment of my Fourth   District business contacts hasn’t changed much since our last meeting, and my outlook hasn’t   changed substantially either  Despite the positive tone set by some of the recent data releases,   the weak November employment report highlighted that labor markets are still struggling for   sustained gains, and the pace of the recovery remains slow   Even though we saw some positive retail sales numbers, my retail contacts noted that   they are seeing a problematic pattern  They suggest that much of the recent progress in retail   sales has been in the high end of the market  In their accounts, relatively well-off households are   purchasing more luxury goods  They say that many of the mid-market households are shopping   down in the value chain by sticking to necessities and selecting house brands or other value-  priced items  My contacts note that retail sales growth can potentially look pretty strong with   this increased spending by wealthy households, but retailers believe that the longer-run growth in   personal consumption expenditures is going to require more progress on the other side of the   income distribution, and job growth there remains the key  This concern tempered several of my   contacts’ outlooks in the face of the relatively positive sales figures   Banks in my District report that business lending has not grown very much and that new   commercial originations are being driven primarily by companies in the energy, health care, and   manufacturing sectors  Merger and acquisition activities have also picked up and are a growing   source of credit demand  My banking contacts also reported that their credit quality was stable   or showed a slight improvement  But as the financial stability memo highlights, the US   December 14, 2010 38 of 127             banking industry faces a wide range of potential risks  Nationally, many of the smaller banks   have large amounts of nonperforming assets on their books, and, as was noted earlier, a very   large number of banks still have adverse ratings   My outlook for employment is also little changed from our last meeting, and my business   contacts have tended to corroborate my outlook for sluggish employment growth  Although   there has been some improvement in hiring, especially among manufacturers, employers are   inclined to hire on a temporary, part-time, or special project basis  Employers also seem more   interested in hiring recent college graduates, and this is interesting because the unemployment   rate, even among young college graduates, is still nearly double its pre-recession levels  The   higher unemployment rate seen in this group seems likely to be cyclical, unless you think that the   recent college graduates are less prepared than those who graduated before the recession   My staff’s analysis continues to show that the elevated overall unemployment rate is a   cyclical phenomenon  They also note, though, that the job-finding rate in our economy has been   trending downward for the past 25 years, which is going to slow the rate of convergence toward   the natural rate of unemployment relative to past expansions  The lower job-finding trend does   increase the implied natural rate of unemployment, but it only moves up to 6 percent   On the inflation front, I have found little comfort in the most recent data that the   disinflation process is nearing an end  At our last meeting I reported that my staff had been   looking into the growing distinction between the CPI and the PCE price index, and suggested   that the lower CPI figures might be a more accurate indicator  Over the intermeeting period, the   core PCE inflation measures fell sharply, including the median PCE, and they are now more in   line with the already very low core CPI number  On a more positive note, market measures of   expected inflation, which began moving up prior to our November meeting, stabilized in a   December 14, 2010 39 of 127             comfortable range  The expected five-year inflation rate derived from inflation swaps has now   settled near 2 percent, and break-even rates from TIPS show a similar pattern   Regarding the risks to my outlook, my view is that the risks for both inflation and output   remain to the downside  I continue to be concerned that our options for responding to falling   inflation are more limited than our options should inflation head higher  And a variety of   cautions—from the continued weak banking conditions to the sovereign debt crisis in Europe—  lead me to see the risk for output growth also weighted to the downside  Thank you, Mr   Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support alternative B  The data since the   last meeting haven’t changed my outlook substantially, and I see little evidence of any   significant financial market problems following our announcement of additional asset purchases    I favor a fairly high hurdle to make changes to the program  In other words, it would take a   surprising change to the outlook for inflation or output to cause me to want to make an   adjustment to the announced program  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The most recent data have led me to raise   my estimate of growth in the near term, but this morning I’d like to focus my comments on the   more policy-relevant medium-term outlook  My outlook is for less rapid growth in 2012 and   2013 than the Tealbook baseline  My outlook for inflation gradually heads higher through 2012   and 2013 and is above the Tealbook baseline   January 25–26, 2011 102 of 282              Given the importance of this outlook for my policy perspective, I want to talk about the   key aspects of my projection  First, I see the economy as only slowly adjusting to the shocks of   the recession  As one of my business contacts noted, the recovery seems to be a “tale of two   cities,” where parts of the economy are more or less recovering, while other parts are still facing   considerable demand uncertainty and receiving little working capital  I suspect the more positive   aggregate data are masking some of the current unevenness of the recovery  Major sectors of the   economy are still facing significant headwinds that will only slowly abate   With the employment-to-population ratio still 5 percentage points below its pre-recession   levels, it is important to look for clues about hiring plans  The special Beige Book survey tells us   that there are just as many firms seeking to expand their workforce this year as there are firms   planning on holding their workforce steady  That could be read as a pretty optimistic indicator   for employment growth, but, based on what we’ve learned from our Beige Book respondents, I   think these survey responses are unlikely to result in a dramatic increase in employment growth    Specifically, in follow-up questions we asked these respondents, we discovered that, while most   of them anticipate some hiring, it’s not that much and primarily will be on a highly selective   basis   The path toward higher aggregate employment is still complicated by the large fraction of   small businesses that are not expanding  For many of these firms, job growth is likely to be   slowed by problems of credit availability  My staff recently published some estimates using the   New York Fed’s credit panel and other data sources to quantify an ongoing problem of credit   availability for small businesses linked to home equity lending  They found that roughly one-  quarter of small businesses rely on equity in their homes for financing, whether through personal   guarantees or home equity lines  As a result, declining home prices can reduce the amount of   January 25–26, 2011 103 of 282              collateral and, hence, the amount of credit available for many small businesses  The affected   businesses are predominantly smaller firms, yet our researchers found that the aggregate   reduction in credit through home equity is potentially quite large  A banker on my board of   directors confirmed that this was a critical issue for small businesses and that it would continue   until the owners’ residential equity positions improved  Thus, it seems likely that weaker credit   availability for start-ups and other small businesses constitutes an ongoing headwind  These   tepid hiring plans and the small business credit issues are just a couple of examples of ongoing   headwinds that I see dampening output growth over the medium term  Partly for these reasons,   my GDP projection is at the low end of the Committee’s range and below the Tealbook path   Even more critical to thinking through the policy environment is the medium-term   outlook for inflation  The Committee’s projections for 2013 range from 06 percent to 20   percent, a range that’s wide enough to be associated with very different policy paths  As I noted   earlier, my projection for inflation is above the Tealbook’s, but it’s in the middle of the   Committee’s central tendency  PCE inflation statistics reveal that the typical US consumer’s   purchases have experienced a significant disinflation since 2008  The good news in this area is   that my staff’s analysis of the incoming CPI data point to a leveling-off of the underlying trend   inflation rate  Indeed, the median CPI was up 1 percent over the last six months of 2010 on an   annualized basis after being up just 03 percent for the first six months in 2010  A little over a   third of the consumer’s market basket had prices that were lower at the end of 2010 than they   were at the end of 2009  However, the disinflation momentum was more prevalent in the first   half of 2010   While these developments suggest that disinflationary pressures may be drawing to a   close and that the risk of outright deflation has diminished, inflation clearly remains very low    January 25–26, 2011 104 of 282              At this point, in the face of continuing weak labor markets, labor costs are likely to increase only   gradually, which should limit the upward momentum in inflation even if the recovery   accelerates  The BVAR model that my staff uses has the characteristic that inflation is quite   sensitive to unit labor costs and not so tightly connected to GDP growth  Inflation expectations   are also a critical factor in the inflation forecast, but I see current inflation expectations as being   consistent with my outlook  In the Cleveland Fed model, which accounts for a time-varying   inflation risk premium, inflation expectations are at or below 2 percent over the projection   horizon  Inflation expectations near mandate-consistent levels, but above current inflation rates,   should support a gradual rise in inflation toward 2 percent  And my projection has core inflation   reaching 17 percent by the end of 2013   Given the improving data and stronger sentiment we have recently seen, it is tempting to   boost the outlook for output and inflation  But we’ve seen swings in the data before that have   proven to be only temporary  I prefer to think about the stronger incoming data as helpfully   offsetting some of the downside risks to the economy that I’ve been worried about for some   time  Accordingly, my near-term outlook is now brighter relative to December, and I’ve shifted   my balance of risks for both growth and inflation from being on the downside to being balanced    Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support alternative B  The data since the   last meeting have been more positive, but I do not think the change has been significant enough   to warrant a shift in our policy  The economy is still facing substantial headwinds, and the   inflation rate remains very low   I did find the mention of an inflation target in alternative C to be an intriguing addition    I’m quite supportive of more firmly establishing a numerical objective for price stability, and I   look forward to being able to put a sentence such as the one that is in alternative C into our   statement in the not-too-distant future  But, as Bill English mentioned, I don’t think we are   ready to take that step today  We still have some work to do to prepare the public to understand   why a numerical objective should be seen as an improvement in our policy framework and how   we intend to operationalize the objective  I also recognize that, before we can prepare the public,   we need to work through some of our own differences of views on the role of the numerical   objective in our policy process  Nevertheless, I do believe that there is much common ground   within the Committee on this issue, and I would be in favor of having a structured discussion of   this issue very soon   Regarding the language options in alternative B, I favor adding the updated $80 billion   pace of asset purchases  And given that every word change is scrutinized, I have a slight   preference for keeping the last sentence in paragraph 3 the same as it was in our December   statement  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I also want to thank the subcommittee for   their work on this important issue  As I was developing my answers to the questions, I found   myself gravitating to the second issue, which is the potential limitation on content  By limiting   what we communicate to information that’s already available to the public, we greatly minimize   the actual or perceived problems associated with individuals who stand to gain financially from   their interactions with us   There is an analogy in the private sector to this—the SEC’s fair disclosure rule  That rule   prohibits the selective disclosure of material and non-public information to selected persons,   such as securities analysts or institutional investors, before that information is disclosed to the   general public  The regulation requires that, when material information is intentionally   disclosed, it be disclosed publicly and not selectively  That line of thinking helped me answer   some of the questions   In question 2A in the subcommittee’s memo regarding content, I think the strict   adherence to the Program for Security of FOMC Information that we approved yesterday is   essential  That means not sharing the views of others, or even characterizing the FOMC   conversations, and letting the minutes provide the summary   In question 2B, I also don’t think that anyone should have non-public information, even   about a Committee member’s own views  Our own views would have to be presented publicly   before they are given to any individual   Regarding question 1 on access, I think that FOMC participants should strive, as others   have said, to avoid being in situations where it might appear that we’re giving confidential   information or information that isn’t available to others  That means paying close attention to   January 25–26, 2011 211 of 282              the venues that we select, as we’ve been discussing, as well as to the frequency of questionable   contacts, so that, again, we avoid the appearance of any favoritism   Finally, regarding whether this should be informal or formal, I agree with Governor   Yellen that it should be formal, and I think that sharing it with the public will help us respond to   requests and help us explain why we aren’t accepting some of the requests  Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Over the past few weeks, I have been   hearing more comments from my business contacts about the need to begin thinking about   tightening monetary policy  In part, these comments reflect continuing improvements in the   economy  But, more importantly, the recent surge in oil prices has heightened concerns about   inflation   I realize that we have differences of opinion about the outlook for GDP growth over the   next few years, but I think the growing public attention on inflation merits a careful review of   our inflation projections  So this morning I am going to focus my comments on why I expect   core inflation rates to only drift up gradually from current levels and to remain below 2 percent   for the next couple of years   I see three key pieces of evidence to support my moderate inflation outlook—the current   low underlying inflation rate, limited pass-through of commodity prices, and low inflation   expectations that are embedded in financial markets  On the first point, the current low   underlying inflation rate, we have only recently seen clear evidence that the disinflation that   started in late 2008 has ended  I could use a variety of statistics to make this point, but I think   the median CPI illustrates this point particularly well  As recently as late 2008, the median CPI   March 15, 2011 40 of 165              was running at 3 percent  It bottomed out in the third quarter of last year at just ½ percent, and   today the increase in the median CPI stands at 08 percent  While the disinflation trend appears   to have ended, the median CPI and other core inflation measures have bottomed out substantially   below 2 percent  In light of the fact that history shows us that core inflation is highly persistent,   and research has shown that core measures are superior predictors of future inflation, this is one   set of reasons that I think underlying inflation will likely remain moderate   On the second issue of commodity prices, my staff conducted an analysis of the effects of   larger-than-expected increases in energy and commodity prices that persist through 2012  Their   results show only limited effects from these persistent shocks on core inflation  These results are   consistent with the estimates from models like FRB/US and the one that President Evans used in   his memo  The most important result from these analyses is that this Committee has time to   offset any upside surprises in inflation if we were to see such a scenario develop  The modest   pass-through reflected in my inflation forecast is also consistent with the anecdotes that I am   hearing from my business contacts  My contacts have been talking a lot about trying to pass   along input price increases  And while many businesses would like to pass on commodity price   increases, my business contacts have also revealed that there are important limits to pass-  through  The CEO of a construction firm reported that many construction contractors are simply   eating cost increases because of the hypercompetitive construction market  His view is that   some of these contractors will not make it, but they also would not survive if they raised prices    A plumbing fixture company described in detail the engineering process that allows them to   experience a large increase in copper prices and then, through efficiencies and product redesign,   convert that into minor price increases at the wholesale level  At that point, they evaluate how   much of a price increase a particular customer will tolerate, and right now it’s not much  I read   March 15, 2011 41 of 165              the comments from my business contacts as indicating that, yes, firms are interested in passing   on price increases, and some are succeeding  But the dynamics that limit pass-through help to   explain why consumer price increases have been so limited after months of commodity price   increases   Turning to inflation expectations, my third point in the inflation outlook, the big worry is   that if commodity prices persist, they could push up long-term inflation expectations, leading to   higher core inflation over the medium term  This is well represented in the Tealbook’s   “persistent rise in inflation” scenario  In addition to monitoring inflation expectations five and   more years out, I like to consider the expectations over a policy horizon of just three years  The   Cleveland Fed inflation expectation model identifies inflation expectations, real interest rate, and   risk premium components over a three-year horizon  Our model shows that inflation   expectations remain low, although expected inflation over the next three years does show an   increase of 30 basis points from December to March for the headline CPI  However, that   30 basis point increase is front loaded, with most of the inflation expectations increase occurring   over the next 12 months when we would expect pretty significant headline inflation numbers,   just on the basis of recent energy prices  In fact, since December, our estimate of inflation   expectations for the coming 12 months has increased by nearly ½ percentage point  In the next   two years, though, expected inflation stays 20 to 30 basis points below 2 percent   I think the evidence that I have discussed supports a baseline outlook where underlying   inflation is only gradually increasing  However, I certainly recognize that the risks to the   inflation outlook are numerous, and that they may be growing  The heightened inflation concern   expressed by some of my business contacts is worrisome  These views may make inflation   expectations more volatile, particularly when the nation is facing significant, if likely transitory,   March 15, 2011 42 of 165              commodity shocks  This concern has caused me to shift the balance of risks on inflation to the   upside  The risks to the outlook for economic growth have also expanded with the tragic   developments in Japan and continued unrest in the Middle East  However, with the recent labor   market news surprises to the upside, I still see the risks to growth as balanced  Thank you, Mr   Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support alternative B, and I also support   the changes that President Kocherlakota has recommended in the language in paragraph 2  I am   more confident today than I was at our January meeting that an expansion is taking hold, and   although I expect headline inflation to be close to 2 percent this year, I expect core inflation to   rise only gradually toward 2 percent over the next few years   The most significant risk I see on the horizon is that the pass-through from oil and other   commodity prices to core inflation proves to be much greater than the empirical evidence   suggests it will be  As we talked about today, one mechanism through which this could occur   would be for persistently high headline inflation to destabilize longer-run inflation expectations    Of course, the key to stability of long-run inflation expectations is policy credibility, and we   should do everything we can to buttress the confidence in our resolve to maintain price stability    That’s one of the reasons, like President Plosser just mentioned, that I support publicly   announcing an explicit numerical inflation objective  And with the potential for inflation   expectations to be more volatile with energy and commodity price shocks, I think the sooner we   clarify our inflation objective the better   March 15, 2011 105 of 165              Finally, given Brian’s comment, tapering of our final asset purchases doesn’t appear to be   necessary  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I also want to compliment the staff on the   background memos and an excellent summary of the options for the exit strategy  I found them   to be quite helpful   As I look around the table, it appears, as individuals, we look like we’re in pretty good   shape, but our balance sheet has put on quite a few pounds  The staff has given us two paths to   weight loss, a gradual path of weaning us off second helpings and bad calories and a more   aggressive strategy of balance sheet bariatric surgery  [Laughter]  Although we don’t have to   accept either one of these options in its entirety, I personally prefer option 1 largely as it is laid   out in the staff memo  I favored this option last year, and I still find it to be a framework that is   clear and reasonably simple to articulate   I’d like our exit process to appear as familiar and understandable to the public as   possible, with the effects that we can reasonably predict from past experience  Therefore, I’d   like short-term interest rates to be our primary policy instrument   Turning to the questions that were provided, in response to question 1 on sequencing our   actions to remove policy accommodation, I support beginning the exit process by halting   reinvestment of principal payments for agency and Treasury securities  I prefer to get to an   all-Treasuries balance sheet over time, which taken by itself would favor halting only the   reinvestment of agency securities  However, there are other issues to consider, and we could   shrink the balance sheet somewhat faster and explain our actions more simply and effectively in   April 26–27, 2011 58 of 244              this first phase by halting all reinvestments of both agencies and Treasuries  Next I would begin   to increase our fed funds rate target and the IOER   In response to question 2, I would prefer to commence asset sales some time after we   begin to increase interest rates  I would sell agency debt and agency MBS over a five-year   period  I strongly prefer to sell them gradually and on a preannounced path  I think that a   preannounced path would help to minimize market concerns about surprise asset sales  That   approach would also reinforce a focus on short-term interest rates as our primary policy   instrument  I’m not in favor of tying asset sales to changes in the economic outlook unless the   outlook were to shift significantly  By putting our asset sales in the background, we can again   better focus the public on our adjustments to the fed funds rate and the IOER   In response to the third question, as I said, I do prefer to sell assets some time after   increasing the fed funds rate  I don’t place a high priority on rapidly reducing the size of our   balance sheet  Instead, I envision us operating for some time with total reserve balances in   excess of what would be required in a mature interest rate–targeting framework, even though we   would be shrinking the balance sheet over the intermediate term through redemptions and   passive asset sales  As we shrink our balance sheet through asset sales, I would put greater   priority on reducing our holdings of agency securities than Treasuries  As the economy   strengthens and we renormalize policy, we should return to the bedrock principle of   Treasuries-only that we’ve followed in the past   I agree with the statements listed under question 4  I would make one clarification to the   third statement because, as I said, I would adjust the pace of asset sales only if there’s a   significant change in the economic outlook  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The incoming data point to a more mixed   picture than I was expecting when we last met  We are again in the position of trying to judge   whether a slowdown early in the year will extend further into the year  Overall, I agree with the   Tealbook that most of the slowdown is transitory  In my remarks, I will focus on how I revised   my projections since our last submission in January   First, I do see the incoming data as pointing to a surprisingly weak first quarter  Given   the range of weak indicators, I agree with the staff estimate of 17 percent GDP growth in the   first quarter  There is no shortage of potential explanations for a softer quarter, ranging from   April 26–27, 2011 121 of 244              severe winter weather to the run-up in oil prices related to the developments in the Middle East   and North Africa   While much of the softness looks temporary, there is reason to take some signal from the   recent data and expect some additional softness in growth beyond the first quarter  In projections   from our econometric model in Cleveland, rising materials prices play a lead role in slowing the   anticipated pace of GDP growth relative to a few months ago  While I have previously reported   small effects of commodity price changes on GDP growth, in our model, overall materials prices   affect the economy more than commodity prices do  While I don’t anticipate that materials   prices will continue to soar, the increases that we’ve already seen were enough to modestly slow   the projected pace of growth  I should also note that my manufacturing contacts have mentioned   that materials price increases are importantly affecting activity and profit levels, although not   enough to derail growth in their businesses  Putting all of this together, since January I have   pulled down my forecasts for GDP growth for 2011 and 2012 by about ½ percentage point to   around 3 percent in both years   The one bright spot among an array of disappointing data releases was the April report on   labor market conditions, which confirmed the downward trend in the unemployment rate and   confirmed a pickup in private employment gains  Taking a closer look at the implications of   unemployment for slack in the economy, my staff presented evidence that labor market slack is   not going to go away very quickly  One reason is that despite recent declines, unemployment   remains stubbornly high  A second reason is that, based on historical norms, firms have plenty   of room to increase both hours per week and the number of workers  Finally, the labor force   participation rate is likely to rise as many individuals who would normally be participants in a   stronger economy finally return to the workforce  So while labor markets are improving, there is   April 26–27, 2011 122 of 244              still a lot of slack in labor markets, and therefore, I don’t see wage pressures picking up any time   soon   Labor market slack aside, the upward drift in core inflation in recent months and the rise   in materials prices have led me to bump up my core inflation projections from my January   submission  I now expect core PCE inflation of about 1¼ percent in 2011 and 1½ percent in   2012   At our last meeting, there was some discussion about how quickly core inflation can rise   in light of the significant increase in core inflation that surprised the FOMC in 2004  My staff   examined the chances of a similar rise in core inflation in the current environment  To formally   assess this risk for 2011, they relied on a small forecasting model that incorporates current   conditions, which include variability of economic growth and inflation that is somewhat higher   today than it was in 2004  According to that model, even with today’s elevated volatility, the   chance of a significant jump in core inflation, combined with modest GDP growth, is only about   20 percent  Now, clearly, this is enough of a risk to merit paying attention to, but we should not   react too hastily when higher probability outcomes show a more gradual increase in core   inflation  In my view, the chance of a surprise rise in core inflation is much lower today than in   2004, because our economy is much weaker today than it was then  For example, the   unemployment rate is more than 3 percentage points higher than it was in the first quarter of   2004   On inflation expectations, in the Cleveland Fed model, which accounts for a time-varying   inflation risk premium, inflation expectations are at or below 2 percent out to 14 years  That   said, inflation expectations at horizons of three to five years ahead have risen and are now   similar to the levels they were last spring  After the spring of last year, inflation expectations   April 26–27, 2011 123 of 244              started to drop with the growing signs of weakness in the economy  This was a critical factor in   my decision to support additional asset purchases  So we should not be worried about inflation   expectations at these levels, but I would not want to see them continue to rise   In my judgment, the risk to the outlook for GDP growth remains balanced  While the   recent weakness in most of the incoming data point to a risk of a sustained soft spot in the   recovery, the surprising strength of employment suggests the potential for a stronger recovery   On inflation, I think the risks are more to the upside than the downside because of the rise   in input costs and the threat that inflation expectations could move higher in response  Still, the   most likely outcome is a gradual rise in core inflation with moderate GDP growth  Thank you,   Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support alternative B  In general terms,   my outlook is not that dramatically different than it was in March  My forecast is for moderate   output growth, unemployment rates that remain elevated, and core inflation rates that are still   below our mandate-consistent levels   Like the Tealbook, I revised up my projection for core PCE inflation  This revision   moved up my expected date for the first increase in the fed funds rate by one or two meetings    However, my outlook is still consistent with the “extended period” language in alternative B   While my outlook does not support the quicker policy response offered by alternative C, I   am concerned about the upside risk to inflation  Temporarily high headline inflation presents a   price stability risk if we’re not able to keep longer term inflation expectations anchored    Fortunately, as I mentioned yesterday, a range of financial market indicators suggests that   longer-term inflation expectations remain mandate consistent, and, in my view, I think we need   to maintain those expectations right where they are   April 26–27, 2011 192 of 244              I would not use “generally” in front of “inflation expectations” in the last sentence in   paragraph 1  I would leave it as it is  I also think that providing greater clarity on our exit   strategy would help us with our policy credibility and help us to maintain inflation expectations   at their current levels  Being more specific with the public about our policy intentions and the   methods that we’re going to use would help to offset some of the public concern about our   ability to control inflation with such a large balance sheet   I think another step in helping us with policy credibility and maintaining inflation   expectations anchored would be to publicly announce an explicit numerical inflation objective    As we have been discussing, I think this is going to be a difficult time to describe our outlook for   inflation to the public  Setting an explicit numerical objective would help with that   communication  It would also force us to be clear on which measure we are targeting  So I hope   that we can return to that issue at a future meeting   I also share the concern that has been raised by several of my colleagues about the new   language in paragraph 2  That is, stating in paragraph 2 that underlying inflation is low, but then   stating later on that we are going to see a decline  But, Mr Chairman, given your comments that   you will address this at the press conference this afternoon, I am comfortable with the language   as it is in this new alternative  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I am very comfortable with this broad set   of exit strategy principles  I agree with the sequencing of steps in the normalization of policy,   but I also favor, as others have already mentioned, removing the time references to give us more   flexibility  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The latest economic news has been pretty   discouraging  I have been wrestling with determining how much of the surprising information   represents temporary noise or a more fundamental change in momentum  At this point I judge   the recent slowing in output and employment as mostly temporary, but I regard much of the   increase in core inflation this year as signaling a lasting upward shift in the path of inflation   The uncertainty surrounding this assessment is extraordinarily high  In my view, the   level of uncertainty around my outlook is higher than it was at the April meeting, and the balance   June 21–22, 2011 118 of 282              of risks is even less favorable  Let me explain my reasoning  In terms of the most likely   outcomes, there are a few reasons that I view the recent slowing in the pace of the recovery as   mostly temporary  First, some portion of the deceleration of GDP growth has been due to a   pullback by consumers in response to past increases in food and energy prices  We’re now   seeing those prices level off or, in the case of gasoline, decline  So these effects should start to   wane  Second, economic growth has also been temporarily slowed by disruptions to motor   vehicle production and sales associated with the earthquake in Japan  Third, while the pace of   job growth in May was disappointingly slow, gains were much stronger in previous months  As   the temporary negatives dissipate, I expect that GDP growth will pick up to about 3 percent and   remain at that rate in 2012 and 2013   My forecast for these years continues to be more pessimistic than the Tealbook’s because   I continue to see the headwinds as being greater  Housing poses such a headwind  With house   prices still falling and inventories still high, I don’t expect residential investment to add   significantly to GDP growth in the next couple of years  In contrast, the Tealbook forecasts that   residential investment will grow at 6 percent next year  Through the effects of house prices on   household wealth and consumer confidence, the continued woes of the housing market are also   likely to hold back consumer spending, which is the key to the pace of the recovery  I expect   consumer spending to expand a little more than 2 percent this year and a little more than   3 percent in 2012 and 2013  The pace of the recovery will also be slowed by cutbacks in   government spending  On a medium-term basis, budget pressures likely mean that federal   spending will grow more slowly than in the decade before the crisis or perhaps even fall  Many   state and local governments will have to cut spending through the next year as stimulus funds   from the federal government wind down and property tax revenues continue to fall  Even if   June 21–22, 2011 119 of 282              governments can avoid cutbacks, they won’t be able to increase spending, as in past economic   recoveries   Turning to the inflation outlook, with gasoline prices easing off, overall consumer prices   should slow in coming months  As to the underlying trend in prices, measures of core inflation,   including the median and sticky price measures that are produced at the Cleveland Fed, have   clearly moved higher this year  That said, in May the median and sticky price measures   suggested less inflation than did the CPI excluding food and energy  Whether the broader   increases in core inflation will last or lead to yet higher inflation is uncertain  The Tealbook   interprets a fair chunk of the recent increase as temporary, and forecasts have fallen for core   inflation from 2011 to 2012 in response to a large output gap and other forces  I’m instead   inclined to treat the increase in core inflation this year as an upward shift in the path of inflation,   although it does not signal an ongoing rise in inflation  I expect PCE inflation to gradually rise   from about 1½ percent in 2011 to 2 percent over the next two years   I base this inflation assessment on a few key factors  First, I have shifted the path of   inflation up in light of the historical sluggishness of inflation, which suggests a lasting effect of   the increase in core inflation this year  Also, the historical tendency for core inflation to rise   during economic recoveries leads me to expect increases over the next few years  The reasons I   expect only a small increase in inflation are that longer-term inflation expectations remain stable   and labor cost pressures are very subdued  According to the model maintained by my staff,   inflation expectations a few years forward have recently dipped a little and remain below 2   percent  With unemployment still very high, growth in labor costs is likely to remain low  New   research done by my staff shows that recessions have long-lasting effects on growth in   compensation   June 21–22, 2011 120 of 282              I’ll conclude by returning to the considerable uncertainty surrounding my outlook  While   I’ve been saying uncertainty is elevated for the past few years, I believe that the level of   uncertainty surrounding the economic growth outlook has increased since the last meeting  I   base this assessment in part on the string of disappointing data releases and in part on the reports   from my business contacts  A number of my contacts noted a growing sense of unease in the   business community, and some reported a sharp falloff in activity in the past month  At this   point my contacts haven’t reacted too much to the swing in sentiment, but an increase in   uncertainty makes a further erosion of business and consumer confidence a significant risk   At the same time that the level of uncertainty has risen, the balance of risk has shifted in   an unfavorable direction  In my view, the risks for GDP growth have shifted to the downside for   some of the reasons I just mentioned, but in my view, the risk to inflation remains tilted to the   upside  I worry that core inflation could continue to increase more than projected, especially if I   prove to be wrong on the direction of energy and other commodity process or if longer-term   inflation expectations become unanchored  As we’ll no doubt discuss in the policy go-round,   these recent changes in risks have added to the challenges for monetary policy  Thank you, Mr   Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support alternative B  From a policy   perspective, recent developments have raised concerns about the degree of uncertainty and the   balance of risks  As I indicated yesterday in my outlook comments, I believe that we now face   the difficult combination of still more uncertainty surrounding the outlook for economic growth   and risks that are primarily to the downside for GDP growth and to the upside for inflation    Under these circumstances, the economy could easily evolve along very different paths that   could lead me to support either delaying or pulling forward the launch of our exit strategy  So I   believe this is an appropriate time to watch and wait, and alternative B strikes that right balance   for today   Regarding the language, I agree with President Plosser’s suggestion to drop the second   sentence in paragraph 1 on the loss of momentum in the labor markets  One month’s data for me   didn’t indicate a change in momentum  So I would support dropping that sentence  I think that   the changes to the wording around inflation in alternative B will be viewed as another positive   step in our effort to improve communication, but like President Plosser, I continue to believe that   a useful next step would be to publicly announce an explicit numerical inflation objective with   an identified time period  A more specific time period for the objective could help the statement   to be more specific on the inflation outlook when there is considerable uncertainty about when   we are going to reach that mandate-consistent level of inflation, and I am pleased to hear that   Governor Yellen’s subcommittee will continue to look at ways to improve our language and our   communication  Thank you, Mr Chairman   June 21–22, 2011 182 of 282                Thank you, Mr Chairman  The economic news since our last meeting   has been very discouraging, and it’s getting harder to argue that the weakness that we saw in the   first half of the year was an aberration  After the GDP revisions, the recovery now looks like a   tough slog with occasional bright spots that have been increasingly rare  So, like many of you, I   revised down my forecast for GDP growth over the next year and a half  While a variety of   inflation measures have been surprising to the upside, I think the sources of those pressures will   prove to be temporary   I’ll briefly elaborate on my assessment of the outlook  For some time now, I’ve projected   a pace of recovery that’s been on the lower end of the Committee’s range of forecasts, but the   incoming data have been even weaker than I have anticipated  While some estimates of   recession probabilities have moved into the danger zone, I don’t think a decline in GDP is the   most likely scenario  Instead, I expect output growth to pick up, albeit to a still-disappointing   rate, in the second half of the year  In my judgment, the key source of restraint on the pace of   GDP growth is consumption  Household spending is likely to remain soft while income growth   is limited and households continue to repair their balance sheets  The recent revisions to the   NIPAs have highlighted these forces by significantly marking down income and consumer   spending over the past three years  My business contacts have long stated that retail sales have   August 9, 2011 63 of 162              been unusually bifurcated, with lower-income consumers still struggling and behaving as if the   recession hasn’t ended  Still, my business contacts are reporting some growth, although most are   reporting only small gains  That said, on a more positive note, households are making grudging   progress on debt reduction, and in my view, this progress will support modest growth in the   economy and not lead to further deterioration   Key auto plants in my District are swiftly returning to normal production levels, which   are about 50 percent higher than production levels were as recently as June  This pickup in   production is occurring despite some risks of a slowdown in overall retail sales, because dealer   inventories have been left exceptionally low by the disruption in production stemming from the   earthquake in Japan  As the Tealbook suggests, the planned acceleration of auto production   should provide a pretty sizable increment to output growth  The last dramatic recovery of auto   production was in 2010, and it was an important factor in one of those rare bright spots in the   recovery  Nevertheless, like the Tealbook, I’m concerned by the risk that this bump-up in   manufacturing activity is going to prove to be transitory   Turning to the inflation outlook, I had been expecting to see measures of both total and   underlying inflation moderate in the second half of this year  And overall inflation has   moderated, but inflation excluding food and energy has not  I still consider underlying measures   of inflation to be useful predictors of future headline rates, and the Cleveland Fed’s median and   sticky price measures both indicate a lower underlying rate of inflation than does the measure   excluding food and energy  In addition, my downward revisions to the pace of economic growth   induce me to expect reduced price pressures as the months roll by  It also appears that financial   markets are less concerned about inflation amid the signs of a global slowdown  Inflation   expectations, as measured in the Cleveland model, fell significantly across most durations   August 9, 2011 64 of 162              following the debt agreement and the S&P rating announcement  For example, the three-year   expectation two years forward, which I think is perhaps the most relevant policy horizon, has   declined 23 basis points to just under 1½ percent since the July CPI release  It looks like   inflation expectations could again be shifting, and if inflation expectations dip much further,   inflation itself may move away from our price stability mandate   Turning to the risks surrounding my outlook, with the momentum to economic growth   already so weak, I would put the risk to output as largely to the downside  In recent meetings, I   have viewed the inflation risks as skewed to the upside, in light of both inflation rates and   expectations coming in higher than anticipated  But today, the shift to lower inflation   expectations that I’ve observed in the data has caused me to return the risk to inflation to being   balanced  These recent changes in risks have added to the challenges for monetary policy, and I   think they suggest carefully exploring a range of policy options  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support your recommendation of   alternative B with the firmer “extended period” language from alternative A  As I noted during   August 9, 2011 122 of 162              our economic go-round, I revised down my outlook for economic growth, and I see further   downside risks since our last meeting  In addition, I have greater confidence than I did at our last   meeting that inflationary pressures are gradually subsiding  If we had a fed funds rate well   above zero, given my outlook, I would be supporting a rate reduction  But instead, we have to   contemplate using tools that are less well understood and are more difficult to explain to the   public  Clearly, as many have said, and as you have just repeated, monetary policy can’t solve   all of our problems  But we should do what we can on the margin  So I am open to providing   further accommodation using nontraditional tools  As others have said, I look forward to our   meeting in September, where we can carefully weigh the costs and benefits of the options that   were laid out in the staff memo  In my view, Mr Chairman, you have clearly laid out the   reasons for taking some actions today  I also agree with your comments regarding your desire to   control the QE3 speculations   As others have noted, I have a strong preference for our policy responses to be contingent   on evolving economic conditions rather than a date specific; however, I think it’s going to be   difficult in the short time we have left today to come up with that language and those measures,   although I like the language that Governor Yellen has suggested  In fact, if the FOMC was   currently publishing the fed funds rate path that underlies our current economic projections, then   the public would already know that we don’t expect to raise the fed funds rate until about mid-  2013, that we expect at that time the unemployment rate is going to be at 7½ percent, and that we   anticipate having subdued inflation until mid-2013  I would encourage you, Mr Chairman, to   use the Jackson Hole speech to elaborate on some of these economic conditions, and I also think   it would be helpful for you to articulate how the firmer “extended period” language, and perhaps   August 9, 2011 123 of 162              some of the other policy options, would be expected to affect our economic outlook  Thank you,   Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Actually, I think President Rosengren just   answered my question  Because this idea that we might lower the interest rate on excess reserves   has been in the public for some time now, I was going to ask whether the Desk or the Board staff   had conversations with money market fund managers about how they viewed the effect  And   President Rosengren’s response about the managers he has talked to answers it     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I want to start by thanking the staff for the   helpful background memos  I found them very beneficial  I am going to focus my comments   around the questions that were circulated, starting with the potential efficacy of policy tools  In   my view, the efficacy of balance sheet tools depends in part on the problem that we are trying to   solve  Our experience with the second LSAP program leads me to believe that when the   problem is an elevated risk of deflation, these tools, particularly balance sheet expansion, can be   helpful  Balance sheet expansion seems to be effective in boosting inflation expectations  When   the problem is a deteriorating outlook for the economy, the efficacy of balance sheet tools is   more uncertain and likely to be more limited  As the staff memo indicates, either asset   September 20–21, 2011 68 of 290              exchanges or purchases would have modest effects on bond yields  The associated effects on   borrowing rates faced by consumers and businesses are likely to provide little further stimulus to   the economy, in part because rates are already so low and in part because the effects of low rates   are being hindered by other factors, including deleveraging by consumers and the uncertainty on   the part of businesses   Regarding reducing the rate of interest on excess reserves, in current circumstances, with   short-term interest rates so low, the additional accommodation we could achieve by reducing the   interest on excess reserves is likely to be pretty small  That said, it is generally a good idea to   keep the interest rate on excess reserves close to the federal funds rate to limit the perceived   subsidy to banks  So I can see some merit in the desire to reduce that subsidy, which seems to be   a little large now  However, for the reasons laid out in the staff memo, I do worry about the   potential for the reduction in the interest rate on excess reserves to disrupt markets for short-term   funding   Turning to the second set of questions, I support expanding our communication efforts   more or less as laid out in the memo, but I would prefer to expand our communication efforts   within the broader context of our existing economic projection process  I will comment on the   specific questions  As I have indicated in previous meetings, I firmly believe that providing an   explicit numerical objective for inflation would significantly improve our communications and,   in turn, would improve the effectiveness of our policy  This is especially the case now as we   face an uncertain inflation trend and with the unemployment rate still above 9 percent  In light   of our dual mandate, it would also make sense to clarify our view of the longer-run equilibrium   rate of unemployment, and I think the offered language does a good job of expressing the   limitation of policy effects on unemployment   September 20–21, 2011 69 of 290              I also believe that providing quantitative information on our reaction function could   improve our communications  In particular, I think that coupling our Summary of Economic   Projections with forward guidance based on economic conditions would allow the public to draw   its own inferences on the likely timing that we would start to remove our policy accommodation    It would also lay out the conditions to which the Committee is likely to respond  For the reasons   discussed in the background memo, using economic conditions would offer a number of   advantages over using just a date, and in fact, it would eliminate the need for a date  When we   are able to find a way to eliminate the date from the current forward guidance, including our   federal funds rate forecast in our SEP could provide a viable alternative to the use of economic   conditions in the forward guidance   Finally, I think that some version of the draft language in alternative A could   significantly improve our communications when coupled with information conveyed in the SEP    So, Mr Chairman, I support the suggestion that you made earlier that we might want to make a   reference to the SEP in our statement  The draft wording on the long-run objectives in   alternative A, paragraph 2, seems effective as written  I think that the language elaborating on   our forward guidance in alternative A, paragraph 4, could be effective with some modifications    First, as I just indicated, I would prefer to modify the language by dropping the date condition    Second, I would prefer a slightly different wording for the inflation condition  Specifically, I   would prefer not to state that we are willing to allow inflation to rise to 2½ percent in the   medium term, because I am concerned that that statement would take away some of our hard-  won credibility on price stability  To me, it would be much better to use a condition of, for   instance, “as long as inflation is projected to remain near 2 percent in the medium term”  This   keeps the focus on our long-term target, but it recognizes that inflation could at times run above   September 20–21, 2011 70 of 290              or below our target  Mr Chairman, you would undoubtedly be asked what “near 2 percent”   means, which could easily be described as “plus or minus ½ percent on a four-quarter basis”    You could also acknowledge that the Committee would feel obligated to comment on   circumstances where the inflation rate might go beyond these bounds  Thank you, Mr   Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Since our August meeting, I, too, have   made further downward adjustments to my outlook for growth, and I have made upward   adjustments to my near-term inflation outlook  However, I think the critical issues today are not   so much differences in the point forecast but rather the overall likelihood of turning points in the   level of output and in the inflation rate  In simple terms, the key questions are, are we headed   September 20–21, 2011 142 of 290              into recession, and have we turned the corner toward lower inflation again?  Turning points are   inherently hard to judge, but the answers to these questions will have major implications for   policy beyond the current meeting  Past experiences indicate that if we believe a recession is   likely, then we will want to act early and aggressively  Our flexibility to act early or more   aggressively in this current environment depends on the extent to which the recent acceleration   in inflation numbers has been reversed  It often takes months to definitively answer questions   like these, but I will offer my current thoughts on both   Overall, I agree with the Tealbook’s assessment that the most likely scenario is for the   economy to make it through this period of anemic growth without a recession  This forecast is   easily supportable with hard data  But with such slow growth, there are many possible shocks   that could easily push us back into recession  Of course, right now, the potential for a crisis in   Europe looms large as a potential recession trigger for the United States  Also, like the   Tealbook, I find myself concerned about changes in business and consumer sentiment, even   while the hard data continue to show slow economic growth  As the “Recession” scenario in the   Tealbook shows, shifts in business and consumer attitudes can interact to produce a recession    So what can we infer from the recent business and consumer evidence?   On the business spending side, most of the data show slow growth, while sentiment   indicators are more worrisome  In my discussion with Fourth District business leaders, many   reported that their output and sales had slowed, but they are projecting flat demand for their   products rather than a significant pullback  In this environment, they are not yet adjusting their   production plans in response to weakening sentiment  Nonetheless, the same business executives   are watching developments carefully and generally report that they are poised to quickly cut back   if necessary  One interesting example came from a global capital goods producer headquartered   September 20–21, 2011 143 of 290              in my District  Because there is a long lead time for the firm’s orders, this capital goods   producer is still very highly profitable and busy filling existing orders  But it is also starting to   plan for possible cutbacks in production based on a weakening economic growth profile here and   abroad  It recognizes that today’s consumer spending slowdown could produce a sharp pullback   on capital spending in the quarters to come unless consumer demand recovers in the next few   months  Responses like this are sufficiently common to make clear that, while the economy has   not entered a sharp slowdown, it may also not be far from tipping into recession   Compared with businesses, consumers look even more cautious during most of the   recovery  On the positive side, as the Tealbook notes, the data clearly show declining consumer   debt burdens, but these declines could be either the result of households’ decisions to borrow less   or a result of banks’ decisions to cut back credit to riskier customers  Economists at my Bank   have been examining credit bureau files of millions of consumers with widely differing levels of   debt and differing levels of credit scores  Interestingly, both low- and high-risk individuals are   cutting back their use of credit, the number of open accounts, and the application for new credit    Our analysis points to an ongoing pullback on the part of consumers rather than banks    Unfortunately, the data also reveal no significant recovery in credit, even among the high-credit-  score borrowers  So it appears that today’s consumers are still pulling back from borrowing,   although not as rapidly as they were during the recession  In the long run, this household   deleveraging will benefit the economy, but obviously in the short run, further deleveraging by   consumers is likely to continue to hold back the pace of GDP growth   With the pace of recovery so sluggish, recent inflation data continue to be a worry  A   key question is whether the recent upward momentum in core inflation will die out  I think it   will, but I wish I could be more confident  On the one hand, I continue to see significant factors   September 20–21, 2011 144 of 290              restraining inflation in the next year or two  Among them are low employment cost growth,   continued productivity growth, and weakened international demand for commodities  Yet, on   the other hand, in recent months I have been seeing more pressure in my preferred measures of   the underlying inflation trend—namely, the median and trimmed mean CPIs  Both are close to   2 percent on a year-over-year basis but have been up much more sharply over the past three   months  This pickup in measures of underlying inflation reflects acceleration in prices of many   CPI components  In fact, in the latest release, almost two-thirds of the consumers’ market basket   saw price increases above 3 percent in the month of August  Given the inertia in prices, I am a   little skeptical that disinflation is just around the corner, but it is likely to develop  Fortunately,   financial market participants appear to have shrugged off the latest CPI data  In the latest   estimates from the Cleveland Fed model, there continues to be a downward shift in inflation   expectations  Most notably, in inflation expectations at the policy-relevant range of three years   out, two years forward, we have seen a dip to just under 1½ percent  This is, again, reason to   anticipate that inflation rates will come down   Considering all of this evidence, I think the most likely scenario is that economic growth   will gradually pick up while inflation rates will remain close to 2 percent  Of course, there is   enough uncertainty in the air for this outlook to shift dramatically, as it did over the summer  At   this point, I see the risks to growth as primarily to the downside, and the risk of a recession is   significant  While inflation risks have gotten more complicated, I think the inflation risks remain   balanced  Thank you, Mr Chairman     I have a question, but not on this issue     Bill, in your comments about reinvesting our MBS into Treasuries   versus reinvestment into MBS, you made a comment that it reduces the effect of the program  I   know we only put this possibility on the table yesterday, so you didn’t have time to think about it   further or talk to anybody, but what kind of market reaction will we get?     Thank you, Mr Chairman  This is a difficult decision in a highly   uncertain economic environment, but today I support alternative B  Over the last several months   the incoming data have made it clear to me that the slowing of the pace of the recovery has   persistence  It isn’t just a temporary response to supply disruptions and high commodity prices    In addition, the incoming data have significantly increased the downside risk to growth  While it   is extremely difficult to forecast recessions, I think the deterioration in consumer and business   sentiment and in the international economic conditions have left us on the cusp of a recession  I   still project that the economy will avoid a downturn this year, but I think that a little extra   accommodation would help lower the risk of a downturn   My primary concern about providing more accommodation is the inflation risk  As I   mentioned in yesterday’s economic go-round, I think it is most likely that inflation will be at or   below the rate consistent with price stability in the medium term, but with core inflation   September 20–21, 2011 232 of 290              measures coming in higher than expected for several months now, including in August, there is a   risk of underestimating underlying price pressures  In judging the inflation risks, I do take some   comfort from the stability of various measures of inflation expectations at rates that are   consistent with price stability  I think this leaves us room to adjust policy in response to the   increased risk of recession, but because the margin for error on the inflation outlook is not large,   I would prefer that the maturity extension program be structured at a monthly pace as described   in the language in alternative B(3′)  This approach would give us more flexibility to alter the   program if underlying inflation does not moderate   I prefer to continue to reinvest maturing agency debt and MBS into Treasuries  We told   the public that we wanted to return our portfolio to a Treasury-only portfolio  If we decide that   this is an appropriate way to go, I would rather wait to do this at our November meeting because   that is a meeting where you will have a press conference  It will give you an opportunity to talk   about the change in our reinvestment strategy   I also hope that at our November meeting we will be able to incorporate into our   statement some of the elements of an enhanced communications strategy that we discussed   yesterday  I would especially support including language along the lines of paragraph 2 in   alternative A  I would leave the language in that the Committee discussed the range of policy   tools  We announced that we changed this meeting to a two-day meeting in order to provide us   time to discuss our alternative policy tools  And finally, in paragraph 1, I do prefer changing the   language around the inflation situation to “inflation appears to be moderating”  Thank you, Mr   Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I also want to thank the staff for the   excellent work they did on this important issue  I am going to focus my comments on the   questions   My answer to all parts of the first question is yes  I view flexible inflation targeting as   consistent with our dual mandate, and I think that we should enunciate this framework  As I   have indicated in past meetings, I think that adopting an explicit numerical objective for inflation   would enhance our accountability, our transparency, and our communications  We can and   should go farther than simply saying the Committee seeks price stability, and we should define   numerically what price stability means   I would also be comfortable with indicating that the Committee estimates an   unemployment rate of, say, around 6 percent to be consistent with maximum employment, as   long as we make it clear that monetary policy does not determine what rate of unemployment is   consistent with full employment  It would be helpful to try to formulate a consensus statement   on the Committee’s monetary policy framework as we did with our exit strategy   Moving to the second set of questions, broadly, I see some form of conditional   commitment as having value for improving our communications by providing more information   on the policy reaction function  In principle, I think we could help the public to better   understand how the Committee is likely to respond by using the SEP to provide the economic   conditions underlying our forward guidance   November 1–2, 2011 66 of 282              Paragraph 4′ in policy alternative A1 strikes me as presenting an approach that could be   helpful  I think it would be more difficult to go further, as paragraph 4″ does, to set policy   thresholds, because simple thresholds cannot capture the range of factors we will want to   consider in determining the future course of policy   Moving to question 3, of the options considered, I agree with the Board staff assessment   that targeting the level of nominal income appears to work well in some challenging scenarios    But I would reserve a change in our operating procedure for an extreme event, such as a   significant risk of deflation or another recession  Should we face such prospects, I think that   nominal income targeting would be our best option for providing significantly more policy   accommodation while making clear our commitment to both components of our dual mandate   Finally, in response to question 4, as I have already suggested with my responses to the   other questions, to improve our communication and effectiveness of policy, I would favor   enunciating our flexible inflation-targeting framework and adopting an explicit numerical   objective for inflation  I would also favor providing forward guidance more clearly linked to our   SEP  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  For the first time since last March, I’ve   been encouraged by some of the economic news that we got during the intermeeting period    That news has lessened the odds of another recession, but with so many indicators still weak, the   bit of good news we received hasn’t been sufficient to change my baseline outlook beyond this   year, and I’ll explain the basis of this assessment   Like the Tealbook, since our last meeting I have edged up my forecast for GDP growth in   2011 but otherwise left my growth forecast essentially unchanged  From the fourth quarter of   this year onward, I expect GDP to grow at a moderate rate of about 2½ percent through the end   of next year and about 2¾ percent in 2013 and 2014  With this growth profile, unemployment   will decline slowly by roughly ½ percentage point per year, leaving it at 7½ percent at the end of   2014   In my judgment, there was enough strength in the third-quarter figures to make the risk of   recession lower than I feared at the time of our last meeting  I have also been somewhat   encouraged by reports from my business contacts that bankers have become more optimistic and   are a little more willing to lend  As one example, a builder of commercial properties reported   that he is now starting to see a renewed willingness on the part of bankers to extend loans for the   value of a project rather than the cost, allowing the borrower to take away cash, which then can   be invested in other projects   Despite this good news, a range of concerns lead me to believe that the pace of recovery   is likely to remain slow over the next few years, with risks to my outlook that are still higher than   November 1–2, 2011 154 of 282              historical norms  Some of those concerns include, first, that the economy continues to see   considerable headwinds, including the ongoing woes of the housing sector, consumer   deleveraging, and cutbacks in state and local government spending  A second concern is that,   based on the most recent purchasing managers survey, Europe now seems likely to be headed for   recession  And third, the overall stress in financial markets seems likely to remain elevated until   the European situation is fully resolved  This stress is going to continue to impair credit market   functioning and hold back growth  I am also concerned that the continued high level of   uncertainty, which others have mentioned, is holding back the pace of recovery by restraining   business spending  Virtually every CEO I talk with has said that uncertainty is preventing some   projects from going forward  Among the uncertainties they mention are weak sales outlooks, the   direction of health-care requirements, the broader regulatory environment, and future tax rates    That said, even though uncertainty is limiting the expansion of capacity, it doesn’t seem to be   detracting from earnings and profits  Many companies in my District are reporting record   earnings and profits, apparently because they have figured out how to manage their business to   stay profitable in this environment   Turning to the inflation outlook, I have made little change to my forecast of inflation  I   continue to expect core inflation of about 2 percent from 2011 through 2014  As pressures from   energy prices continue to dissipate, the rate of headline inflation should slow to the core rate by   the end of next year  As others have mentioned, I saw some good news in the September CPI   and PCE releases  The headline rate of inflation continued to drift downward  Surprisingly, the   core CPI inflation rate dipped below 1 percent on an annualized basis, but the decline in core CPI   inflation is probably overstating the slowing of the underlying trend  The core CPI was pulled   down by significant reversals of apparel and auto prices, which finally dipped in September after   November 1–2, 2011 155 of 282              rising unusually sharply for much of the year, and these were likely relative price movements   that don’t tell us much about the underlying inflation rate  Consistent with this reasoning, the   Cleveland Fed’s median trimmed-mean and sticky price measures of underlying price trends   didn’t slow nearly as sharply as the core CPI did   Still, I think the most likely outcome is for a gradual decline in inflation to about   2 percent, reflecting several forces  Critically, inflation expectations remain low and stable  The   inflation expectations model that we maintain at the Cleveland Fed shows that inflation   expectations over the next few years are still below 2 percent  The other important forces giving   me some confidence in my inflation forecast are for continued slow growth of labor costs and   reduced pressures from commodity prices   Putting all of this together, while there was important good news in the economic   information received since the last meeting, the news hasn’t been sufficient to materially change   my outlook for the economy  I continue to think that the most likely outcome is for slow growth   and inflation stable at about 2 percent  While the risks to the economy now seem somewhat   lower than they did a meeting ago, they remain considerable, particularly with respect to the   European crisis  So I still see that the risks to growth are primarily to the downside, while the   risks to unemployment are primarily to the upside, and the risks to inflation still seem balanced   to me  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support alternative B today  Since our   last meeting, we received some good news on the economy that signals a reduced chance of   recession  But as I said yesterday, the news hasn’t been sufficient to change my view of the most   likely path of the economy, which is for slow growth in the 2½ to 2¾ percent range through   2014  We also had a bit of good news on inflation, although not enough to be certain that we are   seeing a reduction in the underlying trend of prices  Nonetheless, I continue, as I said yesterday,   to expect inflation of about 2 percent for the next few years  With my outlook little changed   since we eased policy at our last meeting, it makes sense to me to keep policy unchanged at this   meeting   As we move forward, I think the course of policy is going to be highly dependent on how   the considerable risks to the outlook play out  While the risks don’t look as dire today as they   did at our last meeting, they may yet pose some challenges for policy  For example, we could   easily face circumstances in which risks to price stability prevent us from easing in response to a   faltering recovery or circumstances in which rising inflation prevents us from maintaining the   current degree of policy accommodation in response to a still-weak recovery   November 1–2, 2011 211 of 282              In terms of the language, I wouldn’t change the “mid-2013” date at this meeting  In   paragraphs 1 and 2 of alternative B, we are making comments that show somewhat improved   economic conditions, and we didn’t really change our economic outlook very much since our last   meeting  Drawing on yesterday’s discussion of policy frameworks, though, I would prefer to use   the SEP to clarify the forward guidance in alternative B by referring to our forecast for   unemployment and inflation in mid-2013  Adding some form of the language in the last   sentence in paragraph 4′ in alternative A1, I think, could help the public better understand our   reaction function   Mr Chairman, because you’re going to have a press conference after this meeting, I   would encourage you to use that opportunity to draw the public’s attention to what we expect   economic conditions are going to be in 2013, if we don’t use that language in our statement   today  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Just a question, though  When you say we’re going to keep it the   same as the last meeting, does that mean the word “remain” comes out?     The exact same statement from last—     So “remain” comes out     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The economic data have continued to   come in a little better than I was anticipating, but the environment for growth next year still looks   very challenging with critical risks for both the international and domestic outlooks  Under the   circumstances, I left the basic contour of my forecast for GDP growth unchanged, but I did lower   my projections for output and inflation  That leaves me with an outlook fairly similar to the   Tealbook  I have real GDP growth for 2012 at 2½ percent and growth for 2013 at 3 percent   Like others, I was surprised by the large dip in the November unemployment rate  While   some of this dip was driven by a decrease in labor force participation, some portion also reflected   a meaningful gain in employment, as measured by the household survey  As David mentioned in   his remarks, compared with the payroll survey, the household survey has been showing stronger   employment gains for the past few months  We have seen many episodes in which the payroll   and household estimates deviate from one another for a while, so I am not placing too much   stock in the household survey just yet  What is more important is that even at the stronger pace   of employment growth that is embodied in the household numbers, it would still take a long time   to recover the jobs lost during the recession and even longer to get the employment level up high   enough to absorb the expansion of population over the past few years   December 13, 2011 50 of 198              A number of headwinds are still holding back the pace of recovery, as others have   mentioned  And while I have commented on this issue before, and Presidents Lockhart and   Williams have already noted, my business contacts do continue to emphasize that in the current   environment uncertainty is importantly affecting their decisions  They suspect that a large   decline in European economic growth would directly affect demand for some US products    More worrisome, however, is their concern that a European crisis could shatter US consumer   and business confidence at a time when many people thought we had finally come safely off the   bottom  In addition, uncertainty over health care reform, tax policy, and energy policy are   causing businesses, especially hospitals and energy companies, to hold back on spending   initiatives   Small businesses are obviously feeling the effects as well  The Tealbook had a nice   summary of small business hiring patterns, which suggests that tight financing conditions are   hampering hiring at small businesses and new businesses  Our research at the Cleveland Fed   clearly shows that declines in real estate valuations have made it more difficult for borrowers to   meet collateral requirements  But in more recent work that is being done by my staff using the   NFIB data, they found that increases in measures of economic policy uncertainty predict   reductions in the expansion plans of small businesses, and we are currently in an environment of   heightened policy uncertainty   Turning to the inflation outlook, I have adjusted down my PCE inflation projections  I   now expect both core and headline inflation to dip below 2 percent in the first half of next year    Behind these projections are softer incoming inflation data for a broad range of goods,   commodity prices that are no longer trending higher, and ongoing restraints in labor   compensation  The latest GDP release revised labor compensation sharply lower  It is now   December 13, 2011 51 of 198              evident that compensation growth has remained quite low in recent months, even while labor   productivity growth has recovered  Such an environment, combined with competitive product   markets, should keep inflation low  We may need to start paying attention to how much inflation   slows  For now, inflation expectations appear to be stable and remain below 2 percent for more   than a decade   In summary, the economy is still making gradual progress, but it is fraught with fragility    Europe’s crisis keeps extending further and further, both in terms of the calendar and the map of   Europe  As Europe’s problems continue, our own situation looks more worrisome  For that   reason, I judge the risks to growth to be primarily to the downside, while the risks to inflation   remain balanced  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support Alternative B  Based on the   incoming data, I continue to expect the economy to recover at a gradual rate and underlying   inflation to remain stable  However, I do believe that there are significant downside risks to the   outlook  In particular, Europe’s continued problems have increased the risk to our recovery   In more normal circumstances, these conditions by themselves might warrant a little   further easing of monetary policy  However, in today’s unusual circumstances, several   considerations lead me to favor an unchanged policy  One consideration is the effectiveness of   the tools available to us  While I would like to see the unemployment rate decline faster, it is not   clear that further easing of policy would materially boost employment  Certainly, I wouldn’t   claim that the monetary transmission mechanism is broken, but we have reason to think it is   impaired   A second consideration is that using the limited policy tools available to us could create   future challenges  I have supported both the use of forward guidance and our balance sheet, and   I remain open to further action, if warranted  But I am mindful of the analysis done by the staff   that has shown that there are scenarios in which further use of these tools could create problems   down the road  For example, as Bill mentioned in his comments, further expansion of our   balance sheet would significantly increase the chances that our Treasury remittances fall to zero   December 13, 2011 91 of 198              The final consideration is that more monetary accommodation could cause inflation   expectations to become unanchored  While inflation expectations have been stable, we are just   now seeing the headline PCE inflation rate move lower  With inflation still above 2 percent,   more easing of policy could cause an unwelcome backup in inflation expectations   Under these circumstances, I believe that we need to proceed very cautiously and to   strike the right balance between costs and benefits of further action  In today’s challenging   environment, with my outlook for a stable pace of recovery, I think that Alternative B is   appropriate  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Before providing my thoughts on the   proposal, I also want to add my thanks to the subcommittee and the supporting staff for all of   their work on enhancing our communications  They had a tough job, and they carried it out very   well   In broad terms, I support both of the subcommittee’s proposals for improving the   communications of the Committee  I believe that each proposal represents a logical next step in   our longer-term efforts to enhance transparency, accountability, and the effectiveness of   monetary policy  By combining the statement of our longer-run goals and policy strategies with   the extension of the SEP, we would be providing the public with much more information about   our flexible inflation targeting framework  And over time, the implementation of the proposals   would give the public a better sense of the Committee’s policy reaction function   With that broad overview, I will answer the specific questions posed to us, starting with   incorporating our policy projections into the SEP  In general terms, the approach the   subcommittee has recommended seems reasonable  Providing our funds rate projection will give   the public important information on the Committee’s reaction function  Describing the reaction   function in simple words would be very difficult, especially given the diversity of views on the   Committee  Publishing our policy projections is an easier way of conveying much of the same   essential information   December 13, 2011 154 of 198              Certainly, I recognize that there are risks to publishing interest rate forecasts  For   example, we will have to be sure to explain that the projections are conditional on the state of the   economy, and, therefore, subject to change  But other central banks, as has been noted, have   been able to address these kinds of challenges and use interest rate projections to improve their   communications, and we should be able to achieve the same   Once we start to publish our policy projections, though, there is no turning back  While   the Committee’s approach seems reasonable, I didn’t see a reason to rush  I would have   preferred to take a little more time to be sure that our communications approach in the SEP is   effective and doesn’t yield some unintended consequences  More specifically, to be sure that the   fed funds rate projections are helpful, I would have liked to have seen how they evolve as we   update our economic forecasts in coming months  We have only had one trial run   I was going to suggest that we take a little time to consider also some of the different   approaches that we might use to present the forecast in charts  While the proposed figure 2 is   useful in some important ways, it is very specific to the circumstances we face today  Once we   have moved closer to a normal policy stance, we will have to decide what figure we will replace   it with  I had preferred to see us think through some of these things before moving ahead, but I   can support moving ahead in January with the provision that we continue to smooth out any of   the rough spots that develop along the way   Regarding other potential enhancements, between now and January, I would suggest that   we spend some time looking at whether we want to refer directly to the SEP information in our   forward guidance and our statement  Policy Alternative A in the Tealbook provided the specific   example of the use of our forecast and forward guidance  In principle, the use of the SEP   information is going to be helpful in forward guidance, and it could improve our   December 13, 2011 155 of 198              communications  But in practice, if we use the SEP information in forward guidance, we might   want to adjust the schedule that we present our SEP, because right now three of the SEP   meetings occur in the first half of the year, and we only have one SEP meeting in the second half   of the year  It would be useful to take a look at this practical issue and the potential merits of   using the SEP information in our forward guidance   Turning to the statement regarding the Committee’s longer-run goals and policy strategy,   I strongly support the draft statement  As you know, I have for some time favored the adoption   of an explicit numerical goal for inflation  To me, that is the most important achievement of the   statement  But I also see the value in clearly indicating that we place equal weight on our dual   long-run goals of price stability and maximum employment, and in explaining why one goal has   a more precise numerical objective than the other  The statement does a good job of describing   our broad strategy for achieving the goals over time   Finally, I view the statement as a broad set of principles that guide the conduct of   monetary policy  Because it focuses on principles the bar for changes should be high and the   statement shouldn’t need frequent adjustments  That said, it is certainly possible that the need   for adjustments could arise occasionally over time, so I do support a plan to reaffirm the   statement at our annual organizational meeting in January  Thank you, Mr Chairman     I was just going to make the comment that we couldn’t hear Esther’s   comments  But listening to Simon’s response, I think we got the gist of it     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I, like others, support giving you the   authority to take actions along the lines of 6 and 7 for financial stability reasons or for our   monetary policy objectives  And then I also believe that the threshold for actions 8 and 9 would   be very, very high  I’d be very reluctant for the Federal Reserve to take those actions   I want to go back to the issue of communications  On 6 and 7, I was going to comment   that I would avoid early communication of our willingness to take these actions  I am concerned   that announcing them in advance could lead some market participants to assume that the Federal   Reserve expects problems to occur, and, thereby, we would foster some uncertainty in markets    For other market participants, though, announcing these potential tools in advance might   engender overconfidence that the Fed could substantially offset market disruptions  And so I   October 16, 2013 49 of 50    would prefer to hold off communications about 6 and 7 until it becomes clear that action is   warranted  That raises the question of how what we’ve talked about today is going to appear in   minutes  When this happened back in 2011, the minutes of that discussion were very brief  I’m   just wondering whether minutes are going to be more detailed this time around, given the   discussion we’ve had today
