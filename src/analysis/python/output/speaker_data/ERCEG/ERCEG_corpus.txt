  As evidenced by the turbulence in sovereign bond spreads shown   in the upper panel of exhibit 6, financial stresses in Europe have intensified, on net,   since April  Faced with a deepening crisis, the European Union announced a   European financial rescue plan on May 10, with details summarized in the middle left   panel  In addition to €110 billion previously committed to Greece, the package   includes €60 billion in lending from the European Union, a special purpose vehicle,   which could issue up to €440 billion in debt guaranteed by euro area countries, and   bilateral programs with the IMF  The ECB simultaneously announced and began   implementing a program to purchase European sovereign debt and modified its short-  term refinancing operations to provide markets access to additional term funding    Along with several other foreign central banks, the ECB also reinstated dollar swap   arrangements with the Federal Reserve   As shown to the right, many European countries have announced aggressive fiscal   consolidation plans  The fiscal consolidation measures planned by periphery   countries are drastic in both magnitude and speed  Moreover, they are expected to be   implemented against the backdrop of very weak economic conditions  As shown in   the lower left panel, we estimate that these measures will enable Spain and Italy to   turn the corner in stabilizing their debt-to-GDP ratios  Greece and Portugal, however,   face greater challenges   Broadly, we think that the European financial rescue plan and strenuous efforts at   fiscal consolidation will eventually succeed in restoring financial market confidence    Spain and Italy should be able to differentiate themselves progressively from other   countries whose prospects are more uncertain, such as Greece and Portugal, and the   possibility of a systemic European crisis will wane  Financial market conditions are   likely to remain unsettled through early next year, weighing on the global outlook,   but thereafter we expect some easing of financial stresses   The table in your next exhibit presents the details of our outlook for the euro area    We project that euro-area GDP will rise only 1 percent in the second half of this year   and 12 percent next year  This forecast is about 1½ percentage points weaker   through 2011 than we projected last winter at the time of the January chart show  As   shown in the upper right, domestic demand (the blue solid bars) is expected to barely   June 22–23, 2010 60 of 213             expand the remainder of this year and next, in contrast to our projection in January   (shown by the blue striped bars), before the Greek crisis intensified  Budget cutting   will restrain growth next year for all major countries in the euro area, and private   demand—which has shown little improvement in the past year, as suggested by the   retail sales data in the middle left panel—is likely to be restrained by weak   confidence and tight credit conditions  We now expect net exports, the red bars in the   upper right panel, to account for most of the euro area’s growth through the end of   next year, spurred by a 15 percent depreciation of the trade-weighted euro, the middle   center panel  Given the weak outlook for overall economic growth, monetary   conditions, the middle right panel, are likely to stay highly accommodative, and   inflation, the bottom left, to remain subdued   Returning to the table, we see “core” European countries, especially Germany,   line 2, as likely to outperform the periphery substantially  German industrial   production, the black line in the lower center panel, expanded solidly in the first few   months of this year, and the unemployment rate, the lower right, has declined  Going   forward, we expect that Germany will benefit relatively more from euro depreciation,   given the importance of manufacturing in its economy, and will be less impacted by   financial fallout than most other European countries  In contrast, real GDP in Spain,   line 5 in the table, is likely to remain nearly flat, which will keep unemployment near   20 percent   Turning to your next exhibit, we project that total foreign growth will average   about 3¼ percent through the end of next year  Recent data have generally surprised   us on the upside, especially for emerging Asia  But in light of the European situation,   we have marked down our aggregate growth forecast by ½ percentage point through   the end of next year relative to your last meeting  Indicators for Canada, including   buoyant retail sales (the middle left panel) support our outlook for continued domestic   demand-led growth in that country, though growth is expected to slow as monetary   policy (the middle center panel) is tightened and as European problems weigh on   confidence and exports  Although consumption has expanded steadily in Japan (the   middle left panel) recent strong GDP growth has mainly been underpinned by   exports  With the fiscal impulse turning negative next year, we see GDP growth in   Japan (line 6) as likely to decelerate markedly going forward   Emerging market economies (line 7 of the table) continued to grow briskly in the   first half of this year  China’s economy roared ahead, with real GDP (line 9)   estimated to have expanded 95 percent in the second quarter  Industrial production   has risen markedly across the Asian EMEs, especially in China (the green line in the   middle right panel), but also elsewhere in the region (the blue line)  GDP growth in   Latin America (line 10), appeared to have stalled in the first quarter, but this reflected   a contraction in Mexican GDP that probably understates that economy’s actual   strength, and we see growth rebounding in the second quarter  EME imports (the   lower left panel) have continued to surge, helping to support global growth  Going   forward, we expect EME growth to hold up relatively well and expect these   economies to continue raising policy rates in concert with other steps, such as   imposing higher reserve requirements  Even so, we have marked down our outlook   June 22–23, 2010 61 of 213             for the EMEs by about ½ percentage point on average since your last meeting to take   account of euro depreciation against EME currencies and other adverse spillovers   from Europe’s crisis  Substantial outflows in May from funds that invest in EME   equities (the lower right) suggest some risks of deeper contagion, though most of   these countries appear to have scope to respond to such shocks through monetary and   fiscal policy  China’s recent announcement to allow more flexibility of the renminbi   was largely anticipated by staff, and we continue to forecast a modest appreciation of   the renminbi against the dollar this year     Your next exhibit considers the US external outlook  Europe’s difficulties   prompted flight-to-safety flows that pushed up the broad real dollar by about 3½   percent since our last forecast in April  We expect that the dollar’s path will remain   well higher than we envisioned in April even as the gradual projected improvement in   European financial conditions causes safe-haven flows to begin reversing early next   year  Oil prices and nonfuel commodity prices (the upper right panel) have declined   noticeably in the intermeeting period, and we expect most of this decline to persist   through next year   We have revised down our path for growth in real exports (the middle left panel)   based on weaker growth abroad and a stronger dollar  Our forecast for real import   growth (the middle right panel) has also been marked down, as the effect of weaker   US activity more than offsets the boost from a stronger dollar  Real net exports (line   3 of the table) are expected to make a negative contribution of less than ¼ percent of   GDP over the forecast period, compared with the neutral contribution projected at   your last meeting  This apparently small revision does not represent the entirety of   the European crisis effect on US trade; were it not for the markdown in US GDP   growth, we would have predicted a larger shortfall in US net exports   Your next exhibit examines vulnerabilities in the European banking system  As   noted in the upper left, European banks experienced substantial losses on their loans   and securities in the aftermath of the global financial crisis  In its April Global   Financial Stability Report, the IMF estimated that euro-area and UK banks faced   about $350 billion in additional write-downs on top of the roughly $750 billion in   write-downs they have recognized since 2007  From a systemwide perspective,   capital and loan loss reserves (the upper right panel), together with retained earnings,   are generally regarded as providing an ample cushion to cover remaining expected   losses, including by the IMF and ECB  Even so, the capital levels of major European   banks are generally lower than their US counterparts  Moreover, the distribution of   problem loans falls unevenly across financial institutions  As information about the   financial condition of particular institutions is often sparse, uncertainty about   counterparty risk is likely to burden the financial sector until more aggressive steps   are taken to differentiate strong and weak institutions   Europe could experience even more formidable challenges if sovereign debt   problems intensify in major European economies, such as Spain and Italy, rather than   gradually abate, as in our baseline  As seen in the middle left, European governments   took strong actions in the fall of 2008 to boost confidence in their banks, including   June 22–23, 2010 62 of 213             through expanding deposit insurance, guaranteeing nondeposit liabilities, and making   capital injections  These efforts helped to limit the rise in five-year CDS premiums   for highly rated European financial institutions (the middle right) to less than 200   basis points through 2008 and 2009  Europe’s current fiscal crisis appears to have   reduced market confidence in the ability of sovereigns to backstop their banks  As   seen in the lower left panel, the ratcheting up in Spain’s sovereign CDS premium has   driven a similar run-up in the CDS premiums of highly rated and well-capitalized   Spanish banks, including Santander and BBVA, to levels well above previous peaks   reached during the financial crisis   We see elevated sovereign spreads and higher associated borrowing costs as a   major drag on Europe’s near-term growth prospects  But, as noted in the lower right,   there is still some chance that Europe’s sovereign debt problems could ratchet up   even more, perhaps due to the failure of some countries to implement fiscal   consolidation measures or to a weaker economy causing banking sector problems to   become more severe  In such an event, private borrowing spreads would also rise,   risk aversion would increase, and government budget positions would deteriorate   further, creating a potentially severe adverse feedback loop to Europe and the global   economy   Turning to exhibit 11, in a memo circulated to the Committee earlier this month,   the staff attempted to gauge the potential quantitative impact of a full-blown   European sovereign debt crisis using simulations of the multicountry SIGMA model    We developed a scenario in which  higher sovereign spreads boost euro-area   corporate borrowing costs about 275 basis points, somewhat less than occurred in the   United States in the fall of 2008; the euro declines an additional 30 percent against   the dollar; and European governments are pushed into additional fiscal consolidation   amounting to 2 percent of GDP on average  Finally, the United States and major US   trading partners outside the euro area are hit by somewhat smaller financial and   confidence shocks that are associated with a 100 basis point rise in US corporate   yields   The middle left panel shows that the shocks depress European real GDP (the blue   line) by about 9 percent relative to baseline after two years  Domestic demand   contracts substantially due to higher borrowing costs, weakened confidence, and   fiscal consolidation  European net exports rise due to euro depreciation, providing   some offset  The constellation of shocks sharply depresses US real GDP (the red   line) as dollar appreciation restrains net exports, and because domestic demand   contracts as credit conditions tighten and confidence wanes; roughly ¾ of the US   output decline in the simulation is attributable to financial market spillovers to the   United States and our non-European trading partners  The rest of the world (the   green line) experiences a much smaller GDP contraction, as policy rates are reduced   substantially and their currencies depreciate sharply against the dollar   We regard the foregoing as a “tail risk” scenario, and our sense is that European   policymakers and governments have taken substantial action that will help financial   conditions eventually normalize  As noted in the bottom panel, it is entirely possible   June 22–23, 2010 63 of 213             that conditions in Europe may improve more quickly than envisioned in our baseline,   as highlighted in an alternative scenario in the June Tealbook  Even so, the weak   condition of Europe’s economy, limited scope for monetary or fiscal policy action,   and diminished ability of sovereigns to backstop their banks make it desirable to take   additional steps to help avoid a crisis  These steps should involve facilitating the   efforts of cash-strapped sovereign governments to clean up and recapitalize their   banks, as well improving transparency to help markets more easily differentiate sound   banks from problem banks  In that regard, the recent announcement that the   European Union will perform stress tests of major banks, and that some national   governments will follow suit, is a positive development   We are skeptical that some countries, including Greece and Portugal, will adhere   to a strict diet of austerity, and they may eventually default  But even delaying a   crisis—including by taking the steps mentioned above—to a time when larger   countries have regained market confidence, macroeconomic conditions have   improved, and there is some scope to adjust policy rates can have a high payoff  In   this vein, the middle right panel shows an alternative to our crisis scenario in which   the emergence of the crisis, which involves the same shocks as in the benchmark, is   delayed by six quarters to 2012Q1  At this point, the European economy has more   underlying momentum, and the expected path of the policy rate is sufficiently above   its lower bound to provide greater scope for cutting policy rates in the near term after   the crisis actually occurs  The contraction in European GDP is reduced by nearly half   relative to the benchmark crisis scenario just discussed, revealing the value of   “buying time” to avert a crisis when underlying conditions are especially weak    Nellie Liang will continue with the chart show              Just to reiterate, certainly it’s not our expectation that Greece or Portugal   would leave the euro area  We think that, given the financial aid package to Greece, they have a   strong incentive to continue with their program to try to reduce the primary deficit over the next   couple of years, and we think it’s very unlikely that they would want to default  At some point   June 22–23, 2010 70 of 213             down the road, when their primary balance actually shifts back towards zero, then it’s quite   possible that they would consider a strategic default  It’s probably more likely under those   circumstances that they would seek a restructuring, and we don’t think it’s very likely that they   would actually attempt to leave the euro area  Perhaps Nathan wants to add something     Thank you for that     Certainly, Chinese trade has continued to boom in both directions    Imports have been extremely strong and exports were extremely robust in the May data, which   are the most recent  Presumably, that has put upward pressure on transport prices  Regarding   those relative price changes, I’d be happy to defer to anyone who knows more about these   particular markets, but, certainly, I think that Chinese demand really has steamed ahead  It’s   worth noting that in marking down our forecasts, it really is primarily in the expectation that   June 22–23, 2010 72 of 213             Europe’s woes will damp confidence  If we look just at the incoming data, these economies look   like they’re roaring ahead  So, in formulating our forecast, there’s some tension between   extremely strong economic growth numbers that are surprising us, as I mentioned, on the upside   and concerns about how developments in Europe are likely to affect business confidence and   what the effects through asset prices might be on financial markets, for instance   Regarding your second question about whether the somewhat weaker global outlook   might mitigate these pressures boosting prices, certainly it stands to reason that the weak   domestic demand in Europe could serve to diminish upward pressures on prices of traded goods    Now, some of the price pressures could reflect secular developments in the Chinese economy,   where they’re moving towards increasingly specialized goods and moving out of the low-tech   areas, so those sorts of relative price changes could well be more enduring  I would think of it as   part of the transformation of the Chinese economy that we have seen in many of the emerging   market economies that are further up the growth ladder, such as Korea; so some of that is   probably enduring
