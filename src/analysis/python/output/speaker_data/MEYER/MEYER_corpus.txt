 Mike, at the top of Chart 14 there is a red line labeled productivity trend "Trend" tells us about slope and growth rate, but is there a level connotation here as well? Is that similar to what we would get if we were asking what the level of output is relative to potential?   Do you measure separately an actual potential output gap as opposed to a labor market utilization gap?   And is it just an Okun's Law transformation or is it done separately?   And what would it be showing right now?   You mentioned that you are discounting recent increases in average hourly earnings and, I take it, in the employment cost index measure of wage gains Why?   I have a question about the role of the stock market in the forecast It seems to me that it has some important role in the slowdown scenario in two ways One, am I correct that you have not passed through the full wealth effect of the stock market rise relative to what the models would suggest?   As you know, I have done the same thing, so I can sympathize with that You are leaning a little against the wealth effect relative to the historical regularity   Secondly, on top of that you have a mild stock market correction built in   How "mild" is the mild correction?   I would take it the source is twofold To what extent does it depend on your judgment that the current market is high relative to fundamentals, and to what extent is it driven by expectations of an earnings slowdown?   I think gravity is underappreciated in economic forecasting!   Thank you, Mr Chairman During the last couple of months, I have had plenty of time to anticipate my participation [Laughter] in the discussion around this table, and I am delighted finally to have this opportunity   Thank you It is nice to begin by finding myself in such strong agreement with the staff forecast, both in anticipation of a slowing toward trend immediately ahead and in appreciating upside risks in the current environment Now this agreement is both pleasing and disappointing at the same time I am pleased on the one hand to find that the approach and the judgment of the staff is so similar to mine and, in that respect, it feels like home On the other hand, I have to admit that this robs me of some potential value-added that I might otherwise bring to this group  I want to focus my remarks on what I view as the two key issues in the forecast in relation to the decision that is before us If it sounds like there is an echo in this room, it is really my fault for allowing Governor Yellen to slip her remarks in before mine! The first issue is, is growth likely to remain above trend? If so, then given the already high levels of resource utilization, we will certainly have to tighten sooner rather than later Second, even if growth quickly returns to trend and the unemployment rate stabilizes at the prevailing level as in the staff forecast, are utilization rates already so high as to make a gradual increase in inflation inevitable? If we are going to reach this conclusion, a tighter policy would also be called for, though the small gap implied by the staff forecast makes such a move less urgent than in the case of persistent, above-trend growth I want to comment a little further on each of these two points  -38-    7/2-3/96  First, with regard to a slowdown toward trend, I expect the economy grew at a rate of about 4 to 4-1/2 percent in the second quarter If the staff forecast is correct and if mine is correct, this will be the only quarter during the year when growth is significantly above trend, and it will follow a year when growth was decidedly below trend I think Governor Kelley did a very excellent job of putting that in historical perspective by looking at four- quarter growth rates That would produce growth for the year of about 27 percent on a fourth-quarter to fourth-quarter basis, but I am looking for a growth rate of 2 to 2-1/4 percent both in the second half of 1996 and over 1997  Now, why do I think the expansion is likely to slow? As has been well documented, part of the largess in the second quarter is due to special factors, including the end of the first-quarter GM strike, reversal of the effects of the government shutdown and a rebound from adverse weather Of course, these special factors have just shifted growth between the first and the second quarters, and they do not take away the fact that the expansion accelerated to a rate of about 3 percent over the first half of the year Still, the strength now apparent in the second quarter overstates significantly the sustainable momentum in the economy going forward I expect that final sales actually will have slowed in the second quarter and that the inventory investment that was such a powerful contributor in the second quarter will provide a declining contribution to output growth in coming quarters, setting the stage for trend growth The projected slowdown in final sales is suggested by both the rebound in long-term interest rates this year and the appreciation of the dollar It is consistent with at least some hints about what is going on in some key sectors There is no question that housing has been a lot stronger than I expected in the first half, but I believe that the decline in housing starts we saw in May is the beginning of a gradual erosion of strength in the sector largely due to the rebound in long-term rates Contract data suggest that nonresidential construction activity is also on a slowing path There appears to be very little life left in equipment spending other than computers, reflecting a combination of accelerator and cash flow effects Having said that, I can see the upside risk in this environment and I will say here that if it were to persist and the economy were to be a lot stronger, I would not have to be dragged kicking and screaming into another view of monetary policy  Let me talk about the uncertainty, which I think is also important, about the implications of current utilization rates Utilization rates have eased in manufacturing since the cyclical peaks in late 1994 and early 1995 and have remained nearly constant for almost the last two years in the case of the labor market The unemployment rate is admittedly below the staff estimate of NAIRU, which in turn is virtually identical to my own point estimate However, there is no broad-based evidence of a demand-induced acceleration of inflation despite the persistence of a low unemployment rate for nearly two years Indeed, core measures of inflation for both the CPI and the PPI actually have moved lower this year So for my part, if there is any surprise about inflation, it is how well contained it is rather than how high it is The staff continues to project, based on the unemployment gap, a gradual acceleration of inflation pressures in coming quarters But there is certainly some hint in the recent data of a change in the fundamentals governing the wage-price process In the current context, I wonder if  -39-    7/2-3/96  it would not be useful to think of NAIRU more as a range than as a point--say, 5-1/2 to 6 percent If the unemployment rate remains within this range, then there is no case for intervening As the unemployment rate moves toward the bottom end, then we should become increasingly alert to the potential need for a tighter policy but action should be postponed until the rate moves outside this range Now, we seem to have a pattern where we see scattered evidence of wage pressures but little evidence of price pressures, and I wonder whether or not what we are seeing is some reversal of the pattern of widening profit margins that occurs early during a recovery when wages lag price inflation If so, we can accommodate the somewhat faster wage gains without having them pass forward in the form of higher inflation  I also want to say a few words about special-factor inflation, which clearly has boosted inflation so far this year I am leery of supporting what I might call "counter-weather," as opposed to countercyclical monetary policy that would seek a tighter policy to offset the temporary blip in food prices that has not yet even arrived In addition, I have some strong priors favoring a sharp decline in oil prices by the fourth quarter, and I expect that oil prices are going to be below the staff forecast in 1997  In summary, I expect growth to slow to trend in time to prevent the unemployment rate from moving below the narrow range that has prevailed over the last two years The current level of the unemployment rate is not definitively below NAIRU I am happy with the current environment Thank you   Thank you What I want to do is to sort out a little of the evolution of the debate on the costs and benefits of inflation and emphasize what is really novel in the points that Governor Yellen was making What she has introduced with a much stronger theoretical basis is the notion of a permanent tradeoff That is what is really novel to the debate I also want to tell you why I think the Feldstein estimates of the benefits of lower inflation are wildly high Secondly, I think we all can see, and it is remarkable to me at my first meeting, that we are moving very quickly to a consensus on, if not a very long-term policy, at least a policy that goes more than from meeting to meeting That, I think, is a great thing Finally, I do want to respond to Al's questions about opportunistic disinflation, and I want to explain to you perhaps a little more clearly how it actually works  First of all, what do we know about the costs and benefits? I think it is very clear, from the Stockton paper in particular, that the benefits from reducing inflation when it is already high are large and clearly justify the cost associated with disinflation What is high? What are we talking about--15 percent, 10 percent, 7 percent, all of those? We would not be sitting here arguing if inflation were in that vicinity, and we would not be having a debate on deliberate or opportunistic strategies Unfortunately, the benefits of reducing inflation from an already modest rate are very difficult to pin down, surprisingly so, and may not justify the cost of disinflation What people have been saying, I think, is that the benefits of very low inflation are there; it has to get to zero; price stability is always better And yet we have difficulty actually pinning that down in our cross-country and time-series analyses In my view--not everybody would agree--there is clearly a sizable one-time cost associated with disinflation and absolutely not a shred of evidence that enhanced credibility of the Fed from announced or legislated inflation targets reduces that cost  One thing we should take into account is that while the cost of disinflation is high, to the extent that it is a one-time cost, we have to balance that cost against the permanent flow of benefits from price stability or low inflation That is a very powerful argument, one that Feldstein also has made But here is the key There are hints that inflation can be too low as well as too high from the perspective of achieving optimal resource allocation and hence the highest possible living standards But the evidence here remains inconclusive This is what is really new to the debate The debate was always between the one-time cost of disinflation and the permanent  -57-    7/2-3/96  benefits of lower inflation Now all of a sudden we are confronted by the fact that it is not only a one-time cost that we might be willing to pay, but there might be a permanent cost of lower inflation, particularly when it gets below 2 percent This is a theme that was not emphasized in the Stockton paper, but I think it is important There is a stronger case that deflation is harmful to macroeconomic performance This weighs against the price level as opposed to an inflation target I do not think anybody has a real difficulty with that notion, but I think that is important So when we talk about price stability, we do not exactly mean price stability in the sense of a fixed price level that we get back to  Having said all this, I see all the different sides converging to a debate about what our provisional targets should be, not having decided whether we as a Committee believe in a deliberate or an opportunistic strategy, and I will come to that in a minute But without deciding on exactly what the path is, we have an agreement that we want to hold the line at about 3 percent on core CPI and that provisionally we want to set a very explicit target for ourselves We seem to be headed toward agreement on 2 percent inflation We still have to debate how we get there, but this is a lot of progress I think this is a good idea in terms of testing the waters, because all of these issues are still quite unresolved in my own mind I am very worried, and again I really have not made up my mind as to whether or not there are permanent costs to price stability or very low inflation I never taught it that way, but I am quite prepared to consider that possibility, and I think testing the waters gives us time As Governor Lindsey said, quite possibly when we get to 2 percent inflation and we find how much we like it and perhaps how much the real economic environment may have improved, it will give us new confidence to take the next step  Now that we seem to have all this wonderful agreement, that leaves us with one issue How do we get from 3 percent to 2 percent inflation? That brings us to the difference between the deliberate and the opportunistic strategies There is one strategy that was articulated by Jerry Jordan in previous meetings--I enjoyed going through the transcripts for those meetings--where he said that he would measure economic performance over 1996 and 1997 and evaluate monetary policy solely by whether inflation was lower over that period That is not the way I would do it at all This leads me to comment on what the opportunistic approach says and how it achieves its objective What Al Broaddus was worried about was that recessions are temporary They come and they go How do we get permanent declines in inflation with an opportunistic strategy? The answer is that there is an asymmetry built into an opportunistic strategy, and here is how it works During good times, we only get up to full employment; we never go beyond it During other times, the unemploy- ment rate is always above the NAIRU If the unemployment rate averages above the NAIRU we are disinflating on average That is what the opportunistic strategy does What goes with that is that if you want to stop at 2 percent inflation, that has interesting implications It means that once you get there, for every recession you treat yourself to a boom You treat yourself to a little overheating because that is what it will take to keep the average inflation rate constant  -58-    7/2-3/96  My final comment is, gee this is even more fun than I thought it was going to be! [Laughter]   Let me tell you why I think Feldstein is wrong The issue here is the existence of inflation non-neutralities in the tax system, for example, tax depreciation based on original cost Inflation essentially raises the cost of capital to firms Think of these inflation nonneutralities as being like an excise tax that is imposed on firms What are they going to do with that? They are going to try to shift the burden How do they do it? They shift the burden by in fact lowering investment, which lowers interest rates and forces lower interest rates back to consumers Now, consumers can say they do not want those lower interest rates, and they can try to escape the burden of that "excise tax" by lowering their savings But here is the rub It is a battle between who is more sensitive-- business firms or households--just as in the typical excise tax example If firms are a lot more sensitive to interest rates than households, and that is what I believe--my best guess at this is a zero responsiveness of savings to interest rates--then Feldstein is completely wrong, blown out of the water I have written a paper on this, though I would not want the staff to delve into my econometrics too much, but as a best approximation I find that what actually happens is that inflation induces firms to shift back the burden entirely to households in the form of lower after-tax real interest rates Households do not escape that at all In the process, the after-tax real cost of capital to firms is unchanged, and there is no inflation bias to the savings-investment process That might be as extreme as Feldstein's argument   Yes   Yes That might be as extreme as Feldstein, but I want to say it is no more extreme than Feldstein because the interest elasticities he has picked are so wildly out of sight from any empirical evidence, whereas mine are quite reasonably based relatively [Laughter]   Even if there is no change, it is still unfair if savers are forced to accept that lower rate of return   What do you think the PCE deflator is now?   So we are there Congratulations   I came too late to take credit for it but I am an instant winner [Laughter]   But the PCE is clearly a superior measure   We know that there is a measurement issue Let us say that the PCE has less of a measurement bias but not a zero measurement bias It may be 1/2 percentage point; it may be a percentage point, and you still have the issues of the permanent tradeoff that Governor Yellen talked about I do not know that you can say that you should go from 2 percent to 1 percent Maybe 2 percent inflation as measured by the PCE is where you want to be   But we get back to the issue of whether inflation can be too low as well as too high We have to take up that point What are the benefits of a percentage point reduction in inflation, given that it is already 2 percent? Those are the things we have to weigh   Mr Chairman, I am uncomfortable with the current procedure embodied in Alternative I for setting the target ranges of M2 and M3, particularly M2 in this discussion It seems to me that this approach is quite inconsistent with the spirit and the letter of Humphrey-Hawkins I believe it also differs from the public perception of the logic underlying those ranges among even the relatively well-informed Fed watchers in the private sector I think it fails totally in communicating policy intent Many believe that we are trapped here and they fear the loss of credibility that, they assume, would follow the upward adjustment of the target ranges that is required to make them consistent with both the staff forecast and the spirit of Humphrey-Hawkins Now, in commenting on that, my particular approach may be sharper than I intend, but it seems to me that it is like trying to use bad policy to compensate for bad communication What I mean is that if we are worried about communicating policy intent to the public, we have a lot of opportunities to do that in testimony, speeches, and otherwise and we ought to do that I do not feel that we ought to compensate for our inability to communicate effectively by setting target ranges that are so inconsistent, or that are at least mildly inconsistent, with the staff or our Humphrey-Hawkins forecasts  Now, I am uncomfortable about maintaining indefinitely what I consider to be a ruse, and I think at some point we will probably regret it At this time, however, I am going to defer to the judgment of the Chairman, but I hope that between now and the next time I have to vote on this issue, we will find some means to improve the way that we handle the monetary growth ranges   Mr Chairman, while I recognize that I arrived at an interesting moment for monetary policy, I must admit nevertheless that I did not agonize over my position for the monetary policy directive for this meeting Although it may still turn out to be a close call as to whether or not we tighten going forward and as early as August, I am very comfortable with your recommendation for no change in policy at this meeting and an asymmetric policy directive  There are four good reasons for no change in policy at this time First, if you accept the staff forecast and take an opportunistic approach to future disinflation, then I think there are no strong grounds for tightening today The staff forecast suggests that, with the current monetary policy settings, we can sustain an expansion at a trend near capacity with nearly stable core inflation through 1997 I fully support an effort to achieve this outcome  Second, and I think quite importantly, my own perspective on the outlook reinforces this desire to the very minor extent that my outlook differs from the staff projections While the staff simulations provide a plausible picture of the acceleration of inflation if the unemployment rate is slightly below the NAIRU, my normal high confidence in this gap story is undermined by the extraordinarily well-contained state of core inflation across virtually all measures I for one would need to see either a decline in the unemployment rate below its recent range or an acceleration in core inflation measures to justify a tightening  My third argument is a little different, Mr Chairman In recent testimony you presented a compelling discussion of the Federal Reserve's position vis-a-vis growth I have, as you might suspect, a heightened awareness of the political sensitivity of this issue as I spent several months with little else to think about [Laughter] As I understand your position, the Federal Reserve does not have a growth objective per se Once we achieve acceptable resource utilization rates and acceptable inflation readings, at least on a near-term basis, we will happily accept all the growth the economy will produce I accept this logic Tightening today would contradict that position We should not tighten solely on the basis of one quarter of above- trend growth when utilization rates are not definitively signaling  -89-    7/2-3/96  overheating and when inflation readings suggest inflation remains in check This is perfectly consistent with a transition to price stability over the longer run, albeit by the opportunistic camp's time schedule  Fourth, we will have a wealth of additional information at the August meeting At that time, we will be in a much better position to assess the potential that growth will remain above trend As we enter the second half we will be better able to determine whether the strong growth over the first half has depressed the unemployment rate below its recent range and to judge the degree to which wage pressures may indeed have intensified and whether or not there is any pass-through to prices I am referring here specifically to the advance report on second-quarter GDP, where the mix will be very interesting; the next two employment reports; a second-quarter employment cost report; and a whole variety of monthly data that will condition our understanding of the economy's momentum heading into the second half My first two points make clear that there is little danger in waiting, and my last point indicates there is great benefit from doing so  Now, a word about symmetry versus asymmetry I had a quite interesting time reading the transcript of the last FOMC meeting, and I am somewhat acquainted with the various meanings of the words But it really is interesting how symmetry means so many different things to different people We are all asymmetric in our policy posture, deciding here whether we are going to hold or increase the federal funds rate Nobody envisions a decline in the rate between this meeting and the next Most of us can envision situations where we would have to raise the rate All of us recognize that it will be a tough call at the next meeting, so I would have thought that the tilt in the directive for this meeting would be an easy call Personally, I am asymmetric and would feel more comfortable with an asymmetric directive From my reading of the last transcript, it does appear that some members of this Committee read into the distinction between symmetry and asymmetry differing degrees of permissiveness with respect to a move between meetings initiated by the Chairman This may be a fair interpretation also I am confident, Mr Chairman, that you would consult with the members of this Committee in the intermeeting period before initiating a reversal of the direction of monetary policy With that caveat, I fully support an asymmetric directive   Mr Chairman, I found a lot on my plate as I prepared for this meeting, and you were the chef! [Laughter] Absorbing the memo on swaps got me very close to a form of intellectual indigestion So I am not prepared to take a very firm position at this time, but I do want to share a few initial impressions First, the current swap network certainly appears to be for the most part an historical relic In her comments, Cathy said that this may be fortuitous, and that reminded me of a mutual fund prospectus stating that past performance is no guarantee of future returns That may be the case here However, the staff memo certainly left me with the impression that not only have these swaps, except in the case of Mexico, not been used since 1982, but in the staff's judgment there was no particular prospect that they would be used for the foreseeable future So, eliminating the swaps would be like paperwork reduction, the 303 streamlining that we are engaged in Why do we have to meet every year and renew these arrangements when we know they are not going to be used?  The main case for retaining them seems to be that it is not very costly, and there might be some political cost in dismantling them because we could be perceived as disengaging or not being a cooperative member of the team Now, while the topic here is presumably swaps, that is not really what we are talking about for the most part We really are talking about whether or not we believe in intervention in the exchange markets and how we feel about emergency actions when there are payments system crises as in the case of Mexico That is the real issue despite the fact that the swap agreements have nothing to do with intervention in foreign exchange markets, except perhaps as a backup source of foreign currencies at some point down the road Even that remains to be seen I am not going to reach any judgment at this point about intervention in the foreign exchange markets I will say that I start out with a degree of skepticism, but I am not so skeptical that I would remove this policy option from the table at this point  With respect to the situation of Mexico, it is interesting that their drawing is the only example of the use of our swap line recently, and it is precisely that use that is the main reason why some people want to scrap the swap line network This might have been an ugly way of dealing with the problem, but it may be that there were no less ugly options available Again, I want to withhold judgment on that  In terms of RPs and the merits of reverse RPs, I absolutely withhold any judgment on those issues until I have learned much more about those instruments    Thank you We clearly are still struggling with the same two questions that occupied us at the last meeting First, is the economy slowing or likely to slow quickly enough to trend to at least stabilize the unemployment rate at the current level? Secondly, is the current level of the unemployment rate definitively below NAIRU so that it ensures a trend toward higher inflation? The Greenbook gives us an optimistic answer to the first question and a pessimistic answer to the second The data available since the last meeting gave me a little more confidence in my answer to the first question but still left me with uncertainty about the second  There has been a lot of mention around the table already of the risks of higher inflation as a result of that uncertainty But I hope that we won't ignore the fact that the slowdown has the potential to allow the economy to sustain trend growth at the current level of unemployment with modest, stable inflation at least for some period While the persistence of the slowdown is hardly assured, the data that have become available since the last meeting provide evidence of slowing that we could only anticipate then This certainly reinforces my confidence in the slowdown projected by the staff, and that is also very consistent with the consensus of private sector forecasters So, I think a provisional "yes" is in order for the slowdown scenario Of course, what we are talking about here is really a knife edge--slowing just to trend So we obviously are going to have to revisit this issue and adjust as necessary  The real key is the second question; that is the heart of our problem The staff forecast answer to the second question is as follows The unemployment rate is already below NAIRU and will remain so after the projected slowdown, resulting in a gradual, persistent deterioration in inflation The minimum wage increase is an ingredient in the staff forecast of higher inflation, but it is a spice not the substance The fundamental source is the conviction that the current unemployment rate is incompatible with stable inflation The problem we face in acting on this forecast is that the pattern of rising inflation that it projects going forward should have been under way for some time and in fact is not yet evident The data available since the last meeting, while somewhat mixed, did not alter this interpretation The staff views the benign inflation environment in recent quarters as a temporary aberration relative to longer- standing regularities Technically, the excellent inflation performance is a mirror image of poor model performance The forecast of higher inflation going forward simply reflects confidence that this model error will diminish or disappear But it is very hard to dismiss the fact that the extraordinary performance of inflation in recent quarters raises serious doubts about the estimate of NAIRU compared to what it was in earlier periods As a result, my answer to  -29-    8/20/96  the question of whether or not the current unemployment rate is below NAIRU has taken into account not only the estimate of NAIRU based on a longer period, but also the details of the inflation performance over the last couple of years Indeed, estimation techniques that weigh the more recent data more heavily suggest that NAIRU has declined recently and may be close to 5-1/2 percent today  The inflation picture is even more impressive than many acknowledge More broad measures of inflation have declined than have appreciated; they show no signs of broad-based acceleration and in many cases even hint of ongoing disinflation Consider particularly the recent patterns in the chain measures of the GDP price index, the gross domestic purchases price index, and the PCE price index The inflation rate in each case is about 2 percent over the past year and below 2 percent if it is measured net of food and energy components when that breakdown is available Each of these measures posted a lower inflation rate over the year ended in the second quarter than over the preceding year At least for the available core measures, each of these inflation measures was near its recent low in the second quarter The CPI in contrast is closer to 3 percent than 2 percent, and there is less evidence of ongoing deceleration But even for the CPI, both overall and core inflation rates were lower over the four quarters ended in the second quarter than over the previous year The ECI data do challenge us, and we are seeing some signs of higher wages I think we ought to take into account that, given the slowdown in the rise in benefit costs, some increase in wage pressures should be passing forward the benefits that firms have received from those lower benefit costs So, we want to focus on total compensation, not just on wages There has been some edging up in compensation; it is fairly small so far, and given the projection of some compression in profit margins, it is also quite compatible with stable inflation at least for some time  In case all this may seem too optimistic, let me end with a cautionary note There has been some discussion around the table of the potential, or even the reality, that we are already facing fast productivity growth or that we might see some in the future or that faster productivity growth might offset any increase in compensation My reading of the data leaves me somewhat concerned about that interpretation Productivity growth over the last three years has been very low, below 1 percent If we look at the productivity trend over that three-year period--when, after all, the economy has been growing at a rate averaging close to what we thought was trend over that period--one would think that productivity growth during that period also would be close to trend In that case, we might reach the judgment that the productivity growth trend is a half percent rather than a percentage point I think we need to monitor this path very closely But if the trend rate of productivity growth has in fact downshifted, then the growth of potential will turn out to be much slower than the Greenbook projects The slowing in growth that will be required to reach trend will need to be more aggressive and less certain, and the price inflation that we should expect from the current trend in nominal compensation will be greater But for now, steady as she goes   Mr Chairman, I also support your recommendation that we make no change in policy at this meeting and retain an asymmetric directive This position reflects my willingness to support trend growth at full employment with stable modest inflation in the near term, patiently awaiting opportunity down the road for renewed progress toward price stability I simply am not persuaded at this point that the current policy setting is inconsistent with stable inflation Given the lags in response to monetary policy, particularly when it comes to inflation, it is often prudent to move to change policy on the basis of forecasts, and that is the challenge that the staff forecast presents to us today But my willingness to move preemptively in this case has to be conditioned by what seems to me the inconsistency in the story that the current unemployment rate is too low to sustain stable inflation, given that we have seen stable inflation for the last two years So at this point, I think it would be prudent to hold the line and wait for additional data Nevertheless, I think there are risks of higher growth and there are undoubtedly risks that inflation at the current unemployment rate might move up Therefore, I think the asymmetric directive is very reasonable Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman The data that have become available since the August meeting have provided a quite interesting set of crosscurrents On the one hand, the data indicate that growth has slowed much more sharply in the third quarter than I previously expected, moving down to a pace close to trend Moreover, the apparent mix between final sales and inventory investment suggests a diminished prospect for above-trend growth in the period immediately ahead On the other hand, the August employment reports suggest that labor markets have become even tighter, raising the danger of a still faster acceleration of wages and therefore increasing the risk of higher price inflation going forward even if growth has slowed to trend Thus, the case for tightening to slow growth to trend has diminished in my judgment, while the case for tightening to counter inflationary utilization rates may have increased Well, it never gets easy At the same time, the August CPI and PPI reports challenge us with further evidence that core inflation continues to edge lower despite utilization rates that historically would already have been associated with rising inflation Let me elaborate on these two issues, beginning with the prospects for growth  While I am comfortable with the broad outline of the path for real GDP in the Greenbook forecast, I would have been a bit more aggressive in lowering my forecast for third-quarter growth There were three significant reports since the last meeting that suggest slower growth the August retail sales report, the July construction put-in-place report, and the July foreign trade report Cathy, you mentioned earlier that you were concerned that consumer spending might be even stronger than in the Greenbook forecast My concern would be quite different I suspect that consumer spending is growing at least 1/2 percentage point more slowly in the current quarter than the Greenbook is projecting So, I think the central tendency right now appears to be growth around trend, and I would even say there are about equal chances that third-quarter GDP growth will be below trend as above trend While the details of one quarter are of little importance to our task here, the sharpness and widespread nature of the softening of demand in the third quarter might make us cautious about the timing of the tightening that still appears to be the most likely direction of policy going forward I expect an increase of only 1 percent in final sales in the third quarter compared to 4 percent in the previous quarter At the same time, production-side data--payroll employment, aggregate hours, and industrial production in particular--look stronger The contrast between the softness in demand and the strength in employment and production is likely to be reconciled with strong third-quarter inventory growth consistent with the rapid inventory buildup reported for July However, if the rebound in inventory investment leaves the third-quarter growth closer to 2-1/2 percent in the context of softening final sales, the prospect of slower fourth-quarter growth becomes still more persuasive  I think the most important implication of the developments in the third quarter may be that the unexpectedly sharp slowing in the growth of final sales has made room for a rebound in inventory investment to a trend level, perhaps removing the danger that inventory building will sustain above-trend growth in coming quarters My strong expectation is that we are in a temporary lull Fundamentals do not suggest to me a serious likelihood that the expansion is tiring to the point of slipping into protracted below- trend growth Indeed, I continue to expect that, with an unchanged  -19-    9/24/96  policy, growth will be near trend or slightly above in coming quarters Nevertheless, the sharpness of the weakening in final sales in the third quarter adds a cautionary note to this forecast and provides the rationale for waiting for data to confirm the expected stabilization in final demand  Second, utilization rates The decline in the unemployment rate to 51 percent in August was another significant piece of data It suggested that the labor market may have tightened in August from the 5-1/2 percent area over the last couple of years, to a 5 to 5-1/4 range in the period immediately ahead There are good reasons to believe that the decline in the unemployment rate in August was exaggerated, for example, because of the late survey date But there is also reason to believe that the above-trend growth over the first half has left a legacy of somewhat higher utilization rates going forward The staff completely discounts the August decline in the unemployment rate as a statistical quirk and assumes that it will be reversed in coming months As a result, they project the same 54 percent unemployment rate going forward as in their last forecast The difference between a shade below 5-1/2 percent and a shade above 5 percent is a very important one to me Personally, I might buy provisionally into a NAIRU as low as 5-1/2 percent I do not buy into a NAIRU as low as 5 percent As a result of the August employment report, there is more uncertainty about the degree of labor market tightness, and in my judgment the danger of higher inflation going forward is also somewhat greater now than earlier  Third, a word on inflation performance The 12-month inflation rate, as measured by the core CPI, declined to 26 percent in August, a tenth lower than in the previous four months, and it has declined nearly half a percentage point since the end of 1995 The 12-month core PPI inflation rate was 14 percent in August, close to half the pace at the end of last year Not only has inflation not begun to rise, but by some measures it has continued to decline While monetary policy should be forward-looking, the disparity between inflation performance and inflation forecasts looking backward might temper our aggressiveness in adjusting policy in response to forecasts of higher inflation, at least until inflation stabilizes   My decision at this meeting is more difficult than at the past two meetings Indeed, leading up to this meeting, I was feeling the pain associated with fence sitting, hoping the data would push me decisively in one direction or the other No such luck I believe that increases in utilization rates should in general be followed by increases in short-term interest rates That is, pro- cyclicality in short-term interest rates is one of the most important rules of prudent monetary policy If the unemployment rate stabilizes near 5 percent and if the economy settles into trend growth, I expect I will be moved to support a tightening of monetary policy I could make that case even today given the increased tightness of labor markets indicated in the August employment report and with fundamentals supporting trend growth ahead I could make the case that, even here, a cautious step toward restraint would be prudent  Nevertheless, Mr Chairman, I am prepared to support your position for three reasons First, there is a small risk that a tightening at this moment would be badly timed into a sharp slowing in GDP growth to below trend in the current quarter and the period immediately ahead Second, the prospects of either higher productivity growth or some compression in above-normal markups going forward will give us some room to clarify both the prospects for growth and the degree to which labor markets have indeed tightened Third, given the recently stable or even declining trend in core measures of inflation, failing to tighten today does not in my judgment leave us seriously behind the curve That judgment is reinforced by the Taylor rule projections that, as Governor Yellen pointed out at the last meeting, suggest that monetary policy is appropriately positioned today in light of prevailing inflation and utilization rates  I certainly respect the judgment of any colleagues on this Committee who would prefer a modest move toward tightening today Nevertheless, I would second the wise counsel of the Vice Chair and encourage those on the Committee who believe as I do that the decision today is a close one and that either no change or a 25 basis point increase could be justified, to join me in supporting alternative B today   Peter, let me ask you a question to help further my education I took two things out of the memo One, you want to switch to an average duration limit as a way of measuring the overall liquidity of the portfolio The second issue was more interesting and seemed to be the real question, ie, whether there was a case for increasing average duration You note that reserves are invested without price exposure and that liquidity is the primary objective That would seem to suggest a low average duration So, I need to understand what you buy by increasing the duration Let me bring it down to the story about the 10-month versus the 18-month average duration; that was a good example You started by saying you would like to have a 10-month average duration as the target, but you want to have 18 months as the limit and that is in case of the necessity for significant intervention But that brings to a head the point because you implied in your discussion that, of course, we are going to sell only at the short end You did not actually say that, but the implication was that you would sell from the short end of the portfolio So, why are you holding long-term securities?   I thought the compelling story was the German balance sheet, but some of the same issues come up when we talk about the liquidity of the SOMA portfolio   The difference is that the way you buy differs from the way you sell, and that is really my question You have the same situation domestically in that liquidations occur at the short end but buying occurs over a wide maturity range I want to understand what you achieve by buying over a wider maturity span than you intend to sell   I think this is where the issues come up that I started to get into with respect to the investment of our foreign currency reserves It seems to me that what you are talking about in terms of the portfolio is a compromise between two ideas that I call buy-side neutrality and sell-side liquidity I am struggling to learn how you deal with that Buy-side neutrality says that you mirror everything so that you do not have an impact on particular markets The sell-side liquidity says that when you sell, you sell short-term securities That is obviously how you deal with it But it seems to me that the current practice is an attempt to deal with that compromise by segregating out a bills portion that you sell and then the rest is for mirroring The question is whether or not we could be more systematic in how we decide on what those proportions should be It seems to be very similar to the story we tell in our own regulation with respect to internal models, market-based risk, self assessment, stress testing, and all the rest The Meulendyke memo on liquidity seems to be at least an attempt to get us to think in that way But the question it seems to me is whether that procedure should be the  -48-    9/24/96  one that determines the correct proportion of bills in the total portfolio, whether it is 50/50 or 70/30 Is that the right spirit?    The data available since the last meeting confirmed that the economy has slowed to trend growth They suggested that an unfavorable mix between final sales and inventory investment in the last quarter weighs heavily against a rebound to above-trend growth in the period immediately ahead The data also indicated that the acceleration of wage and compensation costs that is under way is somewhat more modest than previously anticipated And despite the stabilization of the unemployment rate at a level that may yet prove to be below NAIRU, inflation remains remarkedly well contained On balance the data, if not precisely consistent with every aspect of that forecast, at least matched our fondest hopes and rewarded our patience  The prevailing economic environment, however, is not without risk going forward The main challenge in my view lies in the suspicion of many of us, precisely as set out in the staff forecast, that trend growth at the prevailing unemployment rate will ultimately  -20-    11/13/96  prove to be inconsistent with stable inflation going forward Nevertheless, in the near term there may be more downside than upside risk with respect to GDP growth, particularly given the absence so far of any clear evidence that the collapse of final sales in the third quarter has been reversed and given the restraint to production in the period immediately ahead from the projected slowing in inventory investment  Over the more important intermediate-term horizon of the staff forecast, on the other hand, favorable underlying fundamentals do I think support expectations of growth near trend Such growth might be incompatible with stable inflation, given the current low unemployment rate Still, this outcome is far from preordained Given the current federal funds rate setting, growth could easily be below trend, especially in the near term but even over the forecast horizon The unemployment rate could gradually increase to NAIRU before the building wage pressures are passed through to higher inflation If this sounds too good to be true, one should note that this is essentially the Blue Chip consensus forecast The Blue Chip panel projects 2 percent GDP growth over 1997, measured on a fourth- quarter-to-fourth-quarter basis While this is just below the 22 percent rate of the Greenbook forecast, it is enough to produce a modest but sustained increase in the unemployment rate The latter reaches 5-1/2 percent by the end of 1997, a level almost identical to the downward revised estimate of NAIRU in the staff forecast As a result, inflation stabilizes at 2-1/2 percent for the GDP deflator and 3 percent for the CPI Even if the staff forecast proves to be correct, a more likely prospect in my own mind, the projected acceleration in labor costs over the forecast horizon is modest, thereby containing the threat to our long-term price stability objective over the time period required for a tightening of policy to reverse the rise in inflation  For the moment, a continuation of remarkably subdued price inflation gives us the luxury of waiting for the data to clarify whether growth will remain at or above trend and whether the unemployment rate will begin to rise while we continue to monitor wage pressures and benefit costs We should not, however, be lulled into believing on the basis of the most recent data on wages and compensation that the acceleration in wages that we have been monitoring and worrying about at recent meetings has abated In particular, I find the third-quarter employment cost report literally too good to be true Rather than taking at face value the deceleration in wage costs from a 43 percent annual rate in the first quarter to a 2-1/2 percent rate in the third quarter, I believe it is prudent to focus on the gradual but unmistakable uptrend in the four- quarter growth rate to 33 percent in the third quarter from 28 percent a year ago Part of the explanation for this surprising pattern of deceleration in the quarterly wage data may be the volatility of quarterly wage changes for sales workers associated with their commissions Leaving out sales workers, the uptrend in annual wage increases is both more consistent and steeper; it rises from 27 percent a year ago to 34 percent in the year ended in September For the moment, the slower acceleration in benefit costs has damped the effect on labor costs of the rebound in wage changes In addition, the effect of higher compensation costs on prices may be damped for a time by declines in markups, especially in light of the widespread expression by firms of the lack of pricing leverage Nevertheless, if  -21-    11/13/96  benefit costs accelerate toward the rate of increase in wages, we will move very quickly toward the staff forecast of an increase in compensation per hour near 3-1/2 percent At some point, firms will exhaust their willingness to accept compression in their markups We may therefore be living on borrowed time, but given the slowdown in growth and the recent pattern of price inflation, we still have time to make sure   Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation for no change in policy Indeed, given that the recent data suggest that  -37-    11/13/96  the risks have become more balanced, I am more comfortable supporting a proposal of unchanged policy than I was at the last meeting I still think the major risk is that inflation will begin to rise over the next year An asymmetric directive reminds us of the importance of remaining vigilant in the face of this risk, and I therefore support your proposal to retain the current policy posture    The limited amount of data that we now have available since the last meeting does not alter the picture of the economy, and that picture is a remarkably good one Economic growth has now slowed to trend I read core measures of inflation as stable to still declining The unemployment rate remains locked in a low but narrow band Still, I think we all appreciate that good monetary policy is forward-looking So, the relevant question is, what change can we look forward to with enough confidence to justify a change in policy today?  Given that we are beginning from full employment, one justification for a policy change would be a strong conviction that growth over the forecast horizon will be persistently above or below trend But the risks related to growth have really become more balanced over the last several months The Greenbook forecast indicates trend growth immediately ahead The discussion around the table suggests that few of us have a conviction that would justify a very different forecast I compared the Greenbook forecast to five of my favorite private-sector forecasts, and the range is remarkably tight On a fourth-quarter-to-fourth-quarter basis, the range for next year is from a low of 20 percent to a high of 24 percent This is a very narrow range Unemployment rates tend to be slightly higher than in the staff forecast; they jump off from about 54 percent, which is the current rate, rather than the lower 52 percent rate in the Greenbook, but again these forecasts are in a very narrow range that pretty much encompasses the estimates of trend growth  When we begin from trend growth, I think one thing that we might also recognize is that slight differences in the forecast for GDP growth, differences that are much smaller than the margin of forecast error, produce qualitatively different forecasts A forecast of slightly slower GDP growth at the lower limit of that range, like 2 percent, produces rising unemployment rates, as in the consensus Blue Chip forecast, whereas a slightly higher forecast of GDP growth produces a degree of further tightness in the economy and further risks of rising inflation that none of us views as acceptable  -27-    12/17/96  A second justification for policy change would be the conviction that we are already below NAIRU and not likely to move back to it quickly enough to prevent an uptick in inflation This is basically the staff forecast, and my view has been and continues to be that this is the most serious risk factor in the outlook Yet, we get stuck in place because we continue to be confronted by the reality of stable to declining core inflation in the face of this prevailing low unemployment rate So, we wait for additional data to resolve our doubts The risk of waiting, judging from the modest rise in inflation in the staff forecast, is not very great Still, it is probably worthwhile noting that in all of the five private-sector forecasts that I looked at, there are increases in core inflation over the next year or two That is a pervasive tendency that just about everybody is worried about I think we need to keep that in mind  Just a little historical perspective I think the major threat to an expansion comes from an ultimate overshooting of demand relative to productive capacity and from the resulting acceleration of inflation I do not believe that business cycles are dead Rather, I think there has been a coincidence of events that so far have permitted us to avoid pervasive excess demand and rising price pressures I want to suggest a few of them that we have not discussed very much Demand is always chasing supply during the expansion, but I think supply has been more elusive than normal in this particular cycle Effective labor supply has been increased by an apparent decline in NAIRU, so the unemployment rate has been chasing down a falling NAIRU In addition, we have had very strong capital spending in this expansion, and as a result we have seen very rapid growth in industrial capacity So, if we look at the price pressures in the product markets, they seem even better contained than the price pressures in the labor markets I think that is an important distinction One reason why this absence of pricing leverage makes sense is a lack of excess demand pressure in the product markets that makes firms more cautious about raising wages in response to labor market pressures and also more cautious about passing on wage increases that do occur Other factors that have inhibited the normal buoyancy in demand at this stage in the cycle have been the continuing fiscal restraint and the persistent drag from net exports So, supply has been increasing more rapidly perhaps than normal, demand has been less buoyant, and that is what has created the current environment  But as I said, the business cycle is not dead; history suggests that the risks are tilted in favor of demand ultimately overshooting productive capacity and causing higher inflation While this should not prevent us from enjoying the current balanced prosperity and good performance, it does suggest vigilance rather than complacency as we move into 1997   Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation As the risks have become more balanced over the last few months, it has clearly become a closer call as to whether the directive should be symmetric or asymmetric Nevertheless, the major risk seems to be a  -39-    12/17/96  rise in the inflation rate and I therefore concur with that asymmetric directive  Let me just preview our next discussion since we seem to be focusing in advance on the February meeting and the potential discussion of longer-term targets and strategies I would certainly respond well to some notion of a cap like 3 percent on inflation, but I am going to be very troubled from my opportunistic perspective about laying out a specific year-to-year path I would not want to feel committed to a specific path Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman The fourth-quarter GDP report marks an  extraordinary end to an extraordinary year The defining feature of both the fourth quarter and  the year as a whole was a pleasing combination of higher-than-expected growth and lower-  than-expected inflation, including declines in core measures of inflation How did we do it and  can we do it again? Three developments I think contributed importantly to the extraordinary  performance last year  First, a sharp rebound in the participation rate and hence in labor force growth  prevented the strong output growth from pushing the unemployment rate even lower and thereby  pressuring inflation Second, a coincidence of what I would refer to as positive supply shocks,  including the further slowing in the rate of increase in benefit costs, the decline in nominal  import prices, and the sharper-than-normal decline in computer prices collectively restrained  core measures of inflation And third, the level of NAIRU may have declined or at least we  came to recognize during last year that NAIRU had recently declined from its average level over  the last decade  The message here is that while we should certainly celebrate last year's remarkable  performance, we should not expect to repeat it Growth must now slow or the risk to inflation  will become unacceptable True, I came with this message last July, but now I really mean it    2/4-5/97  [Laughter] I also said then that even if growth slows to trend, there will remain an inflation risk  from the prevailing low unemployment rate Still, the immediate prospects are for a benign  economy in the near term, assuming, of course, a significant slowing in growth and thanks in  part to inertia in the inflation process and a projected reversal of last year's decline in oil prices I  am still in the camp of those who firmly expect a decline in oil prices  The unexpected strength of fourth-quarter growth does, however, put back into the  picture what I have referred to as the growth risk in the outlook--the risk that going forward  growth will remain above trend and push utilization rates even higher beginning from a level  already at or beyond capacity To be sure, the growth in several components of GDP in the  fourth quarter, specifically in consumer services, nonresidential structures, and exports, is  unsustainable, and there is little doubt that the expansion will slow as a result in the first quarter  The surge in net exports, the most important contributor to the fourth-quarter growth spurt, in  my judgment reflects importantly the residual seasonality in that component But this means that  the sharp rebound in net exports posted in the fourth quarter more likely occurred more evenly  over the entire year The bottom line is that although the fourth-quarter growth rate may be  biased upward, the growth over the entire year is not  In light of the likelihood that several components of GDP posted unsustainable spurts  in the fourth quarter, I am comfortable with the staff forecast that growth is likely to slow to near  2 percent or even below in the first quarter Still, what happens in the first quarter is not the key  to the forecast After all, growth over 1996 proved unusually bouncy--2 percent in the first  quarter, 47 percent in the second, back to 21 percent in third, then back to 47 percent in the  fourth Reverting back to 2 percent in the current quarter will not, therefore, settle the bigger  question What happened to the second half slowdown and how confident are we that the    2/4-5/97  economy will slow over 1997? If we could correct for the residual seasonality in net exports, we  might actually see the second-half slowdown At any rate, as my former partners at  Macroeconomics Advisers have noted in their most recent weekly commentary, the second-half  slowdown is evident in a variety of measures of economic performance not directly polluted by  net exports--for example, industrial production, payroll employment, aggregate hours worked,  light vehicle sales, housing starts, personal consumption expenditures, real gross domestic  purchases, and real final sales to domestic purchasers  On balance, therefore, I still view the economy as having slowed over the second half  of 1996 and this helps me to be comfortable with a forecast of a further slowing to a 2 to 2-1/2  percent rate over 1997 This judgment is reinforced by my expectation that federal purchases  and net exports will decline, that inventory investment will trend lower, and that key cyclical  sectors such as housing and auto sales have achieved cyclical peaks and will decline at least  modestly However, I continue to believe that the most serious risk to the outlook does not  come from continued above-trend growth but from the possibility that we are already operating  above capacity and face as a result a gradual but progressive worsening of the inflation outlook  My interpretation of inflation for the year is that, while sharp increases in food and  energy prices boosted overall CPI inflation, the coincidence of positive supply shocks that I  mentioned earlier put downward pressure on core inflation I do not believe, therefore, that the  decline in core inflation experienced over 1996 suggests that NAIRU is below the 54 percent  average unemployment rate for the year I suspect that NAIRU, at least for the near term, is near  5-1/2 percent Assuming the coincidence of positive supply shocks will not be repeated this  year, at least not as uniformly as last year, I expect an increase in core inflation even if the  unemployment rate stays at its current level Cost pressures on firms nevertheless appear to be    2/4-5/97  well contained, given the modest acceleration of compensation over 1996 and the absence of  pipeline inflation pressures coming from core intermediate and crude components of the PPI  Still, the acceleration of wages over 1996 indicated by the fourth-quarter ECI report is consistent  with tight labor markets and prevailing excess demand Some further acceleration of wages  combined with a rebound in benefit costs certainly supports the staff forecast of an increase in  the rate of compensation over 1997 to 3-1/2 percent from the 31 percent posted over 1996 The  staff forecast is for slightly above-trend growth over 1997, a further decline in the unemployment  rate to 5 percent, and a gradual upward creep in inflation that does not take on worrisome  proportions until 1998 It is still a pretty benign outcome for 1997, with inflation measured by  both the overall CPI and the chained GDP price index projected at just a shade above 2-1/2  percent Still, the main message is that the unemployment rate is about to move still further  below NAIRU and as a result inflation pressures are likely to build over the forecast horizon  However, because of the inertia in the inflation process and the reversal of energy prices in 1997  the consequences will not be very evident until 1998 and beyond  Relative to the staff forecast I expect slightly slower growth over 1997 accompanied  by a nearly stable unemployment rate On the price side, I anticipate something close to the staff  inflation pattern through 1997, including a small rebound in core inflation and a decline in  overall consumer price inflation I do view the risks relative to this forecast to be somewhat  asymmetric, with a slightly greater risk of above-trend growth and a greater risk that we are  already below the NAIRU   Could I just raise a question, Mr Chairman? When you indicated that  a 2 to 6 percent M2 range would be viewed as sanctioning 6 percent nominal income growth, I  was a little surprised Would you say that, consistent with the way these ranges have been used  in the past, it would take an increase in money growth above the range to justify a tightening of  policy?   You could say, after all, that the higher range is centered on 4 percent,  which would be centered on 4 percent nominal income growth and on 2 percent real growth    2/4-5/97  Could one justify a tightening of policy if growth moved toward the top of that range? That is  my question   That is the key   Thank you, Mr Chairman I think I have a somewhat different  perspective on the monetary aggregate ranges, and I want to share that with you Someone  suggested that the main reason we do not want to raise the target ranges is that raising them  would suggest less vigilance on our part with respect to inflation That is not the way that I  would make that decision I think the real key here is whether we have more confidence in the  reliability of M2 and its relationship to economic activity  The important issue here is not just the target range; the central issue is the  interpretation of that range The way we are interpreting it today seems very contrary in my  view to the Humphrey-Hawkins language That language asks us, I believe, to establish a target  range that is relevant to the current year and that is set in relationship to current and prospective  economic developments The way we interpret the current range is that it is relevant to a period  --one that will perhaps occur sometime in the future--of price stability with normal velocity  behavior The justification for such an interpretation is very clear, namely, that it does not make  sense to go back to our former practice until we believe that the relationship of M2 to economic  activity is more stable That is the key In my view, were we to reach a judgment that the  evidence was now consistent with the emergence of a more stable M2 relationship, we would  have to change the interpretation of the range that we give in the Humphrey-Hawkins reports  The range that we should set would no longer be one that will be relevant to price stability at  some time in the future It should be the range for the year ahead that we expect to be consistent  with prospective economic developments    2/4-5/97  If that were the interpretation that we were willing to live by for this year, then I  would say that the 2 to 6 percent range would make sense because it is centered on 4 percent 2  percent trend growth in real GDP and a 2 percent rise in the GDP deflator, about where we have  been For those of us who take an opportunistic perspective, that is about where we are  comfortable in being, and that is the sort of signal we would be giving Now, I am willing in the  near term to accept what I think is the judgment of the staff, namely, that the period of stability  in M2 has been too brief to permit a firm evaluation and in particular that stability has not yet  been what I would call "stress-tested" by more volatile economic times and by variations in  opportunity costs However, I think we need to continue to focus on M2 and to study its  relationship to economic activity because, when the evidence does suggest that that relationship  has stabilized, I do not believe that we will have an option I believe we will have a mandate to  return to the former interpretation And when we return to that interpretation, the range that we  set will become relevant Right now we never have to change the range; we never have to  discuss it As long as we retain the current interpretation of the range, we never have to discuss  it The 1 to 5 percent range is centered basically on 3 percent, including 2 percent real growth  and 1 percent measured inflation   Humphrey-Hawkins does not mandate us to do anything; we just have  to explain why we do not   One other thing if I might, Mr Chairman There has been some  discussion about how explicit we ought to be with respect to inflation targets and inflation  ranges As I have thought about this, it has seemed to me that when we were very far away from  where we wanted to get, a vaguer definition of price stability was perfectly adequate And in  fact such a definition was very desirable because it meant that we did not have to sit down and  worry whether the appropriate index was the PCE or the CPI, and we did not have to worry  about core or overall inflation or all those operational decisions But as we get closer to where  we want to be, then at least around the table, as Tom Melzer suggested, it might be worthwhile  for us to share a little more what price stability means to us because I think that will help us to  focus our deliberations on where we are going   I think in a way there is because in most of our meetings we are really  focused on a decision about what to do with the federal funds rate for the period between that  meeting and the next meeting and on a forecast that goes out one year ahead and at most two    2/4-5/97  years ahead The decision relating to inflation really does not come up as being relevant until we  go out over a longer period It is only at these two-day meetings where I think the vehicle is  there, with our focus on the longer-term forecast, to have more detailed discussions about  long-run strategy and how we bridge from our short-run meeting-to-meeting policy   Mr Chairman, could I ask a question?   Will the report include the sentence that has appeared in the last  several reports that these ranges are interpreted as a benchmark associated with price stability  and normal velocity?   In the testimony How do we interpret these ranges because that is  not in the paragraph that was read?   Right, it is not in that paragraph   The staff projects a decline in the unemployment rate to 5 percent,  more than 1/2 percentage point below their estimate of NAIRU, and as a result they see  progressive deterioration in the inflation outlook Now, if we were all sure of this forecast, I  think we would all agree to tighten immediately even though the sharpest increases in inflation  do not surface until 1998  I do want to respond to Bob Parry's question, does that "we" include opportunists or  only those who prefer a more deliberate approach to reducing inflation? I use the "we" as an  encompassing one in that case Why not move now? Uncertainty about the forecast, about the  structure of the economy or specifically about the value of NAIRU, justifies, I think, a more  cautious approach Fortunately, the usual inertia in the inflation process and the prospect of a  decline in energy prices combine to yield a still favorable inflation outlook through 1997,    2/4-5/97  reducing the need for immediate action But the risk of above-trend growth and the risk that the  current unemployment rate is already below NAIRU together strongly support an asymmetric  policy directive to complement an unchanged policy  There has been some very interesting discussion by Don Kohn and the Chairman of  the question, if not now, when I think that is what we really are talking about here One  perspective has been that, indeed, the time has come and the only issue is to prepare the markets  There is a widespread expectation that there will be no policy change at this meeting, and a  tightening move would be a great surprise So that is the only issue I think we have to think  about whether we are at that point or whether there is something we need to trigger an action  Let me give you a perspective that relates back to the staff forecast How would we  respond if the staff forecast turned out to be correct? I would argue that if we do see a decline in  the unemployment rate, specifically to the 5 percent rate in the staff forecast, that would be a  reason to tighten independently of whatever was happening to inflation pressures directly That  is, a further decline in the unemployment rate would be an appropriate trigger for an increase in  the funds rate This is just a general view that as utilization rates increase short-term rates should  increase We should build in that procyclicality of interest rates that would occur normally, for  example, under a money growth rule with a stable money demand function or under a Taylor  rule If in the meantime inflation pressures were to build, then still more aggressive action would  be required But that would be an example of a very clear trigger Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman I want to focus on two key questions  about the outlook that I believe should shape our decision about monetary policy today  First, how does the economic environment, meaning both the recent data and the current  forecast, differ today from that prevailing at the July and September FOMC meetings--which  in my judgment were the closest calls for a tightening of policy--and more generally from  that prevailing for the entire recent period of the asymmetric policy directive? Second, how  do today's forecasts for 1997 by members of the FOMC compare to the central tendencies of  the forecasts for the year that the members submitted at the February meeting and that were  incorporated in the Humphrey-Hawkins report?    3/25/97  This focus presumes that any change in policy we contemplate today would reflect  a change in the FOMC members' readings of the fundamentals and risks in the economic  outlook That would be the natural assumption However, the comments of at least some  members at the last meeting could be interpreted as indicating that they already had changed  their view about monetary policy but thought that a tightening should be postponed until this  meeting to allow an opportunity to prepare the market And the market certainly has been  prepared! [Laughter] For myself, however, some trigger, some change in the fundamentals,  is necessary to push me to accept a change in policy I will focus here on whether or not  there has been such a change in fundamentals  Let me remind you of the basic framework that has underpinned my judgment  about monetary policy during this period I worry about two risks to the inflation outlook  the utilization and the growth risks The utilization risk refers to the possibility that the  prevailing utilization rates may already be so high that inflation will rise over time The  growth risk relates to the possibility that future above-trend growth will raise utilization rates  still further, thereby aggravating the risk of higher inflation Given the uncertainty about  how to judge utilization rates, we have tempered our inclination to be forward-looking in our  policy actions and have given added weight to recent data on inflation and labor costs There  is, nevertheless, a causal chain that I believe we have been relying on--from growth relative  to trend, to utilization rates, to wage changes, and finally to inflation There are, to be sure,  complications associated with changing profit margins, possible change in the productivity  trend, favorable or unfavorable supply shocks, and change in threshold levels of utilization  rates But this causal chain is and must be at the heart of preemptive policy    3/25/97  Policy could be said to be more forward-looking or preemptive the more willing  we are to act earlier in this causal chain The importance I attach to this causal chain  necessitates a response to the flurry of disclaimers around this table at the last meeting about  the usefulness of NAIRU I intended to respond then but, frankly, I somehow got distracted  [Laughter] As the most enthusiastic champion of the NAIRU concept around this table, let  me briefly respond now because I think that concept is relevant to our decision today  The concept fundamentally involves three principles First, a major proximate  source of higher inflation is excess demand in the labor and/or product markets Second, the  causal chain is most likely to proceed from excess demand in the labor market, to wage  changes and hence labor costs, and finally to price inflation Third, as long as the excess  demand prevails, inflation continues to rise progressively and indefinitely over time I  frankly would be shocked if most of us around this table did not believe in these principles  To be sure, applying them has become more difficult of late because the implied  relationships have not been nearly as tight as had been the case earlier There are data that  suggest some decline in the NAIRU Nevertheless, these principles must in my view be the  framework for conducting a disciplined monetary policy, and I believe that is central to any  decision to tighten today  Now back to the outlook What is different today in the data and/or the forecast  compared to what we had at FOMC meetings during the period of asymmetric directives?  To set up my later discussion of my position on monetary policy, I will organize the  discussion from the perspective of the Taylor Rule A rough summary is that current  utilization rates are about the same and core inflation is lower Unlike at earlier meetings,  the forecast now shows continued above-trend growth immediately ahead and, as a result,    3/25/97  higher utilization rates over the next year or two The current Greenbook projection of a  decline in the unemployment rate is not much different from what was projected at the last  meeting, though I would argue that this forecast is more believable now for many of us At  the February meeting, both the Greenbook and FOMC members were projecting near-trend  growth over 1997, but the FOMC members were forecasting stable unemployment rates in  contrast to the decline projected in the Greenbook The current data on utilization rates and  core inflation are no more alarming now than earlier, and perhaps less so So, if we want to  justify action today, we have to look at an earlier stage of the causal chain  In his recent testimony, the Chairman has focused on labor market indicators as  being of special importance in reaching a decision for a preemptive move, and I agree Let  us take stock here The data on compensation are somewhat mixed, but they suggest some  acceleration on balance The latest 12-month increase in average hourly earnings is 1/4 to  1/2 percentage point higher than had prevailed at the time of the July and September  meetings On the other hand, the increases in average hourly earnings were rather tame in  the last couple of months There is certainly a hint here but hardly a smoking gun On the  other hand, virtually all other indicators of labor market tightness are at more elevated levels  today help wanted ads are up, initial claims for unemployment insurance are down, the index  of hard-to-get jobs is down, and consumer sentiment about jobs being plentiful is up But the  key to our decision today is the change in the forecast  Ill focus now on the Greenbook forecast, which may be more aggressive in certain  respects than some of our own forecasts This will effectively serve to make more dramatic  the point I want to make There is a significant change in the current Greenbook forecast for  1997 from the forecasts prepared for the July and September meetings and even that for the    3/25/97  February meeting Compared to the earlier meetings, the Greenbook now projects a 2-3/4  percent rate of growth over 1997 in contrast to just above 2 percent at the July and September  meetings and 2-1/4 percent at the February meeting This follows an unexpectedly strong  second half of 1996 To be sure, as is almost always the case in such projections, growth  slows to trend over the forecast period But the combination of a stronger second half of  1996 and an upward revised forecast for 1997 translates into an increase in the level of output  and hence utilization rates in 1997 and 1998 At the July and September meetings, the  unemployment rate was expected to stabilize near 5-1/2 percent for 1997 Now it is expected  to decline to 5 percent this year and below 5 percent in 1998 Just to underline the difficulty  in making and selling any policy change, the other important difference in the Greenbook  forecast is that inflation for 1997 has been revised downward relative to the July and  September meetings  To repeat the second question, how did we FOMC members change our forecasts  for growth over 1997 and the unemployment rate at the end of this year compared to the  central tendencies of the forecasts that we submitted for incorporation in the  Humphrey-Hawkins report? For my part, I see the economy as having more near-term  momentum than I did at the last meeting, and therefore I now expect the unemployment rate  to be lower in the second half of the year and into 1998 As a result, I have revised upward  my expectations for inflation over 1998   Thank you, Mr Chairman I strongly support your  recommendation for a 25 basis point increase in the funds rate, and I can accept your  recommendation for a symmetric directive though I could have been persuaded to go for an  asymmetric one I will come back to that later I want to focus my remarks, though, on an  analytical framework for supporting this kind of a move First, I want to consider the  implications of the Taylor Rule and talk about the importance of a flexible approach to  interest rates in response to economic developments I also want to explain why we should  not leave the task of countercyclical policy to the bond market and present an interpretation of  tightening in terms of what I will call the maxi/min solution  The Taylor Rule, as Don Kohn noted in his presentation, would suggest no move  at this meeting because utilization rates are about the same as they have been and core  inflation is actually lower While the Taylor Rule does not provide support for an action  today, it would suggest that, if the Greenbook forecast proves to be correct, we will want to  tighten later There is, however, an alternative specification of the Taylor Rule that would, in  my view, support a tightening of policy today I will call it the forward-looking Taylor Rule  To be sure, the standard rule is forward-looking to a degree in relation to inflation because it  includes current utilization rates But in the forward-looking Taylor Rule, actual values of  inflation and utilization rates are replaced by forecasts There is a growing literature on  forward-looking policy reaction functions An early paper was done by Steve McNees at the  Federal Reserve Bank of Boston in the mid-1980s and updated in the early 1990s Over the  last year, in fact, there has been a flurry of additional work along this avenue, including work  in progress at the Board, which finds that policymaking has tended to evolve over the last 15  years from reliance on incoming data to gradual responses to forecasts However, these    3/25/97  papers are an exercise in description and what we really need is a normative analysis to  confirm that moving in response to forecasts, given the accuracy of forecasts, would produce  better results than responding to actual data  Would such a forward-looking reaction function provide support for moving today  when we did not choose to move at earlier meetings? In terms of thinking about raising  interest rates today, we might interpret the recent strengthening as a shift in the IS curve and  ask whether monetary policy should impose a horizontal LM curve that would resist the  natural tendency for stronger growth to push up interest rates Alternatively, should  monetary policy enforce an upward sloping LM curve that allows a stabilizing response to  cyclical strength? In fact, there has been a lot of discussion or implicit commentary around  the table about the old pegging strategy, the mistakes of the 1960s, and also more discussion  of M2 than at any of the previous FOMC meetings that I have attended One of the  implications of imposing that horizontal LM curve is allowing an acceleration of M2 growth  in response to a shift in the IS curve  Some might argue that because long-term interest rates already have risen along  with the dollar, the economy is moving along an upward-sloping LM curve I do not believe,  however, that we should leave monetary policy to the bond market The question is whether  we should be validating or resisting the recent move in long-term rates That move after all  reflected to a significant degree the bond markets' expectation of a shift in monetary policy,  particularly as a result of the Chairman's recent testimony combined with the recent strength  in the data Let's pat the bond markets on the back and tell them that we appreciate their  effort but also let them know that they should not have to do all the work    3/25/97  Finally, let me discuss the maxi/min solution Here I compare the consequences of  two types of mistakes we could make today not tightening when that would have been  appropriate versus tightening when it was not needed In this approach, a decision today can  be interpreted as selecting the best of the worst possible outcomes First, consider what  would happen if we tighten when that turns out to be unnecessary, NAIRU could turn out to  be lower than anticipated, productivity growth higher than projected, or demand  unexpectedly weaker The unemployment rate could then be higher than would have been  desirable and inflation lower than otherwise In this case, the unemployment rate would still  be at a historically low level and inflation would be moving toward our long-run objective,  not a really bad outcome Indeed, that would be a preferred outcome for some on this  Committee  On the other hand, if we failed to tighten when it would have been appropriate to  do so, the excess demand gap would open or widen and inflation could increase We would  then face the Taylor Rule's triple whammy on the funds rate We would have to raise the  funds rate to prevent the real rate from declining, to counter the rise in output relative to  potential, and to combat the increase in inflation relative to our target This is usually an  ugly affair It does not end well for the economy  Mr Chairman, because I am guided by a forward-looking specification of the  Taylor Rule, because I believe we should be flexible in adjusting interest rates to changing  economic developments, because I think we should enforce an upward-sloping LM curve in  response to shifts in the IS curve, and because it is a maxi/min solution, I support your  recommendation for tightening monetary policy Because containing a threat to higher  inflation is likely to require some further increase in short-term rates beyond the small    3/25/97  change contemplated today, I could have accepted a call for an asymmetric directive I think  that is particularly true given that your comments raised the possibility, if not the likelihood,  of a move between now and the next meeting That sounds like an asymmetric directive to  me But I do not see that as a very important point, and I can certainly accept your scenario    My reading of first-quarter performance and incoming monthly  data suggests the economy will slow sharply in the second quarter in line with the Greenbook    5/20/97  forecast Special factors boosted growth in the first quarter while payback and special factors  are at work in the current quarter Inventory investment clearly is playing an important role  in the near-term dynamics On the other hand, the fundamentals supporting the expansion  remain very positive and suggest a rebound in the second half to at least slightly above-trend  growth As a result, the economy is likely over the forecast horizon and in the absence of  further policy action to remain at the high level of labor resource utilization rates reached in  April  Monetary policy decisions are appropriately conditioned by the inflow of data  between meetings I want to focus on an interpretation of that data, and there certainly was  something for everyone in that data First, we had the first-quarter GDP report with its  surprisingly robust growth immediately followed by a decline in the unemployment rate in  April to a 23-year low and to a level outside the narrow range that had prevailed over the last  year and half Second, we had reasonably strong evidence of a sharp slowdown in growth in  the second quarter Third, we had better-than-expected performance in labor costs, focusing  on the first-quarter ECI report and the April reading on average hourly earnings, combined  with mixed evidence on inflation On balance, the evidence did not suggest a trend toward  higher inflation, but it seemed to indicate a reduced prospect that core CPI inflation is still  declining  The data on the unemployment rate signal higher inflation risk The information  on current quarter growth, particularly when combined with the Greenbook forecast of  near-trend growth beyond the second quarter, suggests less risk of further increases in  utilization rates But these two developments do not offset The threat of continued  above-trend growth we faced at the last meeting has already delivered its consequence in the    5/20/97  form of higher utilization rates In the framework of utilization and growth risks that I have  been using to assess the risk of higher inflation, the data since the last meeting simply have  transformed growth risk into utilization risk This was a bad trade from the perspective of  inflation risk We traded a speculative increase in utilization rates, because that is what  growth risk is, for a realized increase in labor utilization rates  There are at least two sources of increased uncertainty suggested by the flow of  data between meetings Such uncertainty sometimes encourages caution in policy action, and  I expect it to weigh on our decision today First, there may be greater uncertainty about the  second-half outlook, given the sharpness of the slowdown that now appears under way in the  second quarter and given questions about the degree and persistence of the expected slowing  in inventory investment That is, even though the combination of stronger-than-expected  first-quarter growth and the sharp slowing projected in the Greenbook for the second quarter  leaves the first half stronger than was projected at the last meeting, the distribution of that  strength over the two quarters might add some downside risk to the second-half forecast  Second, the better-than-expected performance of labor costs in the first-quarter ECI report  and the April reading for average hourly earnings might increase further the uncertainty  about the estimate of NAIRU and hence increase the uncertainty about the degree of  deterioration to be expected in the inflation outlook if the economy returns to trend growth  and the unemployment rate stabilizes at its current level  I believe that the fundamentals supporting the expansion remain very positive I  am going to focus on two examples of the positive underlying fundamentals financial  conditions broadly defined and consumer confidence We might ask what factors have  contributed to the strong above-trend growth over the last year and a half A supportive set    5/20/97  of financial conditions certainly seems to have been a factor Financial conditions either  have been sufficiently stimulative to promote this strength or not sufficiently restrictive to  prevent the resurgence Borrowing terms generally are viewed as attractive for home buying,  for consumer durable purchases, and for business fixed investment If there is a problem, it  is the excessive amount of borrowing that some households would like to undertake under  prevailing financial conditions  How have financial conditions changed since the March 25 policy action? That  action was widely anticipated, so it largely was reflected in financial market conditions at the  time of the move Since the March move, however, long-term interest rates have edged  slightly lower, the stock market has rallied, the dollar first rose and then declined to below its  initial level A monetary conditions index for the United States, which took account of  short-term and long-term interest rates, the stock market, and exchange rates would, I  believe, show more favorable financial market conditions today than was the case  immediately following the March move  I do not ordinarily place great weight on measures of consumer confidence in my  own forecast, so I don't want to oversell the significance of the latest reading when it  supports the case I want to make But the preliminary report of the Michigan Consumer  Sentiment Index for early May was extremely interesting It shows a decline in the index as  it relates to current economic conditions that are consistent with the projected near-term  slowing But it also indicates a sharp improvement in expectations about future conditions  supportive of the prospect of a solid second-half rebound Let me read you a few sentences  from Richard Curtin's interpretation of the early May data on consumer sentiment  "Extraordinary strength was recorded in consumer sentiment during the first half of May,    5/20/97  with the Sentiment Index reaching a new record level The early May gain reflected  consumer reactions to the very favorable economic news that has dominated the headlines  record low unemployment, strong GDP growth, and a resurgent stock market Moreover, in  sharp contrast with the initial reaction to the interest rate hike, consumers have now  concluded that the recent increase will have little, if any, impact on future economic  conditions To be sure, consumers have not changed their views that further interest rate  hikes would be forthcoming in the year ahead Consumers, however, no longer expect those  rate increases to damp income gains nor to represent a barrier to planned purchases"  My conclusion is that the projected slowing in the current quarter is part payback,  part special factors, part breather, but not likely to be the beginning of an extended period of  below-trend growth The underlying fundamentals remain very positive As a result, from  the perspective of monetary policy, we should give appropriate attention to the level of  utilization rates For better or worse, this is what will determine the course of inflation over  the coming quarters   Let me begin with some further thoughts on the Taylor Rule  perspective on monetary policy options and the changes in initial conditions and forecasts    5/20/97  between this meeting and the March meeting This will lead me into my own version of the  policy options for today's decision, with special attention to the interpretations attached to  the options I will conclude with some considerations relating to initial conditions and to  other policy priorities that might justify a willingness to assume greater inflation risks  The Taylor Rule perspective underlies my strongly held view that prudent  monetary policy should lean against the cyclical winds by enforcing a procyclical pattern in  real short-term interest rates Specifically, I believe that real short-term interest rates should  rise in proportion to increases in utilization rates over the course of a cycle and that such a  disciplined response is especially critical as the economy approaches capacity I interpreted  our action at the last FOMC meeting as being justified by a forward-looking version of the  Taylor rule; that is, by a forecast at the last meeting of rising utilization and inflation rates in  the absence of policy action The wisdom of that move was quickly apparent, to me at least,  in the quicker-than-expected realization of higher labor utilization rates We might in  retrospect call it a "just-in-time" monetary policy action!  In my view, we tightened in March because we believed that continued  above-trend growth would lower the unemployment rate to or below 5 percent by midyear, in  line with the staff forecast The unemployment rate is already where we feared it might go  Why should a forecast of more moderate growth ahead make us more relaxed? All the  forecast of a return-to-trend growth guarantees is that the economy will linger indefinitely in  this precarious position until inflation does turn up  In short, we have more reason in my view to be concerned about inflation on May  20th than we did on March 25th, not less If one accepts the view that there is indeed  justification for some tightening, the next question is how much of a cumulative move is    5/20/97  justified by today's initial conditions and how gradually should such a tightening be  implemented over time We can get some guidance on this subject from alternative  specifications of the Taylor Rule as well as from model simulations of alternative funds rate  paths around the base forecast I conclude on the basis of guidance from those sources that  the real federal funds rate should move at least percentage point for percentage point with the  unemployment rate, with some of the evidence suggesting that the best stabilizing results  come from a gradual policy response that cumulates to twice this magnitude  The bottom line of the analysis is that some further tightening appears justified by  current initial conditions and forecasts On the other hand, it would be hard to argue that  recent data on labor costs and inflation suggest a high degree of urgency about taking the  next step today I also can accept the wisdom of a view that present uncertainties might  suggest a more gradual implementation of any cumulative tightening than otherwise  In my outlook statement, I noted two uncertainties that could influence our  judgment today, particularly about the timing of any action The first is that the data on labor  cost inflation in the period between meetings raised further questions about the estimate of  NAIRU and suggested that the staff forecast of rising inflation at prevailing utilization rates  may be too pessimistic The second is the sharpness of the projected decline in second-  quarter growth, which encourages the Committee to wait until we confirm the expected  rebound The Chairman has focused on a third uncertainty--heightened by first-quarter  profits data--the trend in productivity growth  With the above considerations as background, let me offer my own version of the  Bluebook policy options for your consideration First, we have alternative B, no change  This alternative could be supported on the basis of two quite different arguments I want to    5/20/97  place at least as much emphasis on the principles that underlie the action as on the action  itself Let me call the first rationale for no action the "B/reactive policy" alternative It  carries the following interpretation growth is slowing sharply in the current quarter, and it is  projected to be near trend over the remainder of the forecast horizon Therefore, we can  comfortably return to a reactive posture of watchful waiting A move to a tighter policy in  the absence of evidence of a sharper rise in labor costs or direct evidence of higher core  inflation would require at least a forecast of above-trend growth if not evidence of persistent  above-trend growth This justification for no action seems to make growth the issue rather  than utilization rates It seems to be a surrender to a reactive posture This approach could  be taken a step further to hold that, given the uncertainty about productivity growth, we  should not even worry about the strength of growth Do not worry about utilization rates  Do not worry about growth Do not worry about wages because their increase could simply  be a response to higher productivity growth Worry only about inflation, the ultimate  reactive posture This might be the best we can do if we believe that we know so little about  the structure of the economy that past regularities provide no guidance for current policy  For my own part, the puzzles of the current episode have not yet pushed me into this camp  Some might worry that this view suggests that irrational exuberance has affected more than  the stock market  I will take the liberty of redefining alternative C in my menu of options as 1/4  percentage point of additional tightening today This would be the second step in a cautious  but still preemptive policy posture It is justified by the increase in utilization rates since the  last meeting combined with the expectation, consistent with the Greenbook forecast, that  utilization rates are likely to remain at or below this level going forward In light of the    5/20/97  uncertainties I have previously discussed, we could accompany this move with an  announcement that indicates an intent to pause after the March and May moves The pause  would allow us to await confirmation of a rebound in demand in the third quarter, to assess  the degree and persistence of the projected slowing in inventory investment, and to evaluate  the implications of additional information on labor costs and inflation and whether utilization  rates were already so high as to yield a rising trend of inflation The pause also would  provide an opportunity to assess the July NIPA revisions for insights about trend productivity  growth Given the prevailing large statistical discrepancy and the recent unexpected surge in  tax receipts, there is reason to be particularly interested in this revision  Let me offer a third alternative as a compromise, which I call "B/go slow," that I  hope is in keeping with the spirit of the Chairman's proposal Like the "B/reactive" policy, it  calls for no change in policy today, presumably combined with an asymmetric directive that  clearly is justified by the inflation risks in today's initial conditions But it also carries the  expectation that current utilization rates may justify additional tightening We postpone any  tightening today in light of present uncertainties in order to confirm expectations that demand  and growth do firm, that unemployment remains at 5 percent or below, and to have time to  assess the implications of additional data on trends in labor costs, inflation, and productivity  "B/go slow"could be thought of as a slower moving version of "C" It still allows us to cling  to a preemptive posture, but it suggests additional caution in light of the present uncertainties  It might well be argued that there is only a hair of difference when all is said and done  between any of these alternatives But a "B/reactive" policy is of great concern to me It  suggests a willingness to abandon any sense of preemptive policy in favor of resuming a    5/20/97  reactive posture that history suggests will ultimately produce overheating and higher inflation  and that will end up threatening the expansion  I prefer "C" I think it is the more disciplined policy, the more balanced approach,  but I could live with "B/go slow" if it contributes to a stronger FOMC consensus about  current and prospective policy  Let me turn now to two quite different sets of considerations that would be  consistent with the choice of a reactive strategy I am not promoting either of these  justifications--I have already committed to preemptive "C"--but I believe they deserve to be  put on the table The first is the economic and political difficulty, what I will call a "reverse"  soft landing I view the monetary policy implementation through 1996 as an attempt to  achieve a conventional soft landing It involved slowing the expansion to trend before it  overshot capacity, thereby stabilizing inflation and extending the expansion We already  have seen that it can be difficult to muster public support even for such a sensible policy  effort Given the recent decline in the unemployment rate, we might now need a monetary  policy that is attempting a reverse soft landing in which we approach capacity from above  and thus require a period of below-trend growth to allow actual output to drift back down to  capacity Perhaps more to the point, it would be a period of below-trend growth to raise the  unemployment rate back to NAIRU Such a policy is very difficult to sell and very difficult  to achieve It might be argued in this case that the best we can do is to attempt to slow the  economy to trend, hope for the best, and react if necessary to clear and persistent signs of  higher inflation I wonder if this is a factor encouraging some to accept a reactive posture  A second consideration, and one increasingly talked about, is that a policy priority  for sustaining a high-pressure economy, one close to capacity, may have increased    5/20/97  Achieving maximum sustainable employment would ensure an environment that would  reduce the tensions and challenges associated with welfare reform and the associated  movement from welfare to work Given the continued uncertainty about NAIRU, it has been  argued that this is an opportune time to experiment by allowing the unemployment rate to  decline further, even below the best guess of the current NAIRU, to ensure that we avoid  sacrificing any employment that could possibly be sustained without accelerating inflation  I think these are provocative arguments for a reactive posture They do not,  however, sway me from my preference for a cautiously preemptive stance I am still aiming  to avoid overheating and sustain the expansion I like my version of "C," but I can accept the  Chairman's version of "B," which I take to be a "go slow" strategy and not a retreat to a  reactive policy    That is a tough act to follow I read the recent data as consistent with a  slowing in second-quarter growth to near 2 percent I view this in large measure as a payback    7/1-2/97  for the surprisingly robust first-quarter growth More importantly, the fundamentals supporting  aggregate demand, in my judgment, remain very positive there is solid momentum in income  and employment; financial conditions are generally favorable, and measures of consumer  confidence have soared to new highs In the absence of a change in policy, the fundamentals  appear to support the Greenbook projection of a rebound to well-above-trend growth in the  second half and continued growth near trend over 1998 As a result, the unemployment rate is  likely to trend lower in coming quarters from an already low level While this would normally  suggest an increased risk of higher inflation, the staff trimmed its inflation forecast in this  Greenbook This highlights what we have come to appreciate as a very unusual period from the  perspective of the relationship between inflation and unemployment The staff forecast  represents a careful attempt to balance the inflation risk stemming from prevailing and projected  labor utilization rates with a continuing exceptional performance of inflation My first reading of  the Greenbook, however, was that the staff had somehow mistakenly combined an output path  from a buoyant economy run and the low inflation path from an alternative soft economy run  True, there remains some upward drift in inflation in the staff forecast, but most of the  acceleration over 1998 reflects the small rise in oil prices following the sharp decline this year  and a rebound in non-oil import prices after a further fall in the first half of this year  Compensation per hour, on the other hand, edges up only 1 next year despite an unemployment  rate that is nearly one percentage point below the staff's assumption of the NAIRU  Let me focus on two positive elements in the inflation forecast that support the  Greenbook story and two concerns that nevertheless make me very worried that prices may rise  more than the Greenbook projects The first positive factor is the influence of an excellent    7/1-2/97  inflation performance this year on wage determination and on inflation next year Overall,  inflation this year is benefiting from falling energy prices, smaller increases in food prices, and  to date still declining import prices Next year, wage change and core inflation will feel the  benefits  That still leaves unanswered the question of what is holding down wages and core  inflation this year despite the low unemployment rate In my never-ending effort to reconcile  low inflation and low unemployment, I have been placing increased weight on the contrast  between the apparent tightness in the labor market and the seeming absence of comparable  tightness in the product market This is illustrated by the fact that while the prevailing 48  percent unemployment rate is below most estimates of NAIRU, the prevailing capacity  utilization rate is only a shade above its estimated natural rate Looking at the historical record  of unemployment and capacity utilization rates in previous cycles, one reaches the conclusion  that this disparity is a unique feature of the current episode  One way of appreciating the significance of this disparity is to view the unemployment  rate in a price/price specification of the Phillips curve as a proxy for overall excess demand  across both labor and product markets Given that the excess demand in the labor market is  traditionally mirrored by a similar degree of excess demand in the product market, the  unemployment rate is generally a reasonably good proxy for economy-wide excess demand In  the current case, however, the unemployment rate at best is capturing tightness in the labor  market and hence overstating the economy-wide excess demand Another way of seeing this is  to compare inflation forecasts from the Phillips curve using the unemployment rate to  specifications using capacity utilization rates This disparity most likely reflects one of the key    7/1-2/97  and perhaps under-appreciated features of the current expansion--the robust pace of business  fixed investment, notably equipment purchases and particularly purchases of high-technology  equipment The result is that industrial capacity is increasing at the fastest rate in 28 years The  net effect is that while labor markets are tight, the increasing productive capacity associated with  the investment boom has prevented excess demand from arising in the product markets The  much reported absence of pricing leverage that firms emphasize may be another implication of  the absence of excess demand in the product markets Nothing gives a firm market power like  excess demand I also suspect that firms have responded to the absence of pricing leverage by  being less willing to bid aggressively for workers, thereby helping to explain why wage change  has increased so modestly despite the prevailing tightness in labor markets The above  considerations do encourage me to expect continued modest inflation over the forecast horizon  Let me conclude, however, with two reasons why I remain concerned that inflation  may nevertheless increase more than projected in the staff forecast First, the unemployment rate  averaged 54 percent in 1996, close to most current estimates of NAIRU It has fallen  significantly below this threshold for only a couple of months The rise in wage change we  would normally anticipate from the prevailing unemployment gap may therefore be just ahead  As I emphasized above, the role of the capacity utilization rate is in my view only to damp rather  than to block entirely the effect of the lower unemployment rate Hence, both time and still  lower unemployment rates pose a real threat of higher inflation Second, a coincidence of  temporary factors, including declining import prices associated with the appreciation of the  dollar, a slowdown in the rise in benefit costs, and most recently a decline in energy prices have    7/1-2/97  been contributing to restraint in the increases in compensation and consumer prices These  factors are likely to be of diminishing importance going forward  On balance, in the absence of further policy changes I expect above-trend growth over  coming quarters, a further decline in the unemployment rate, and still modest inflation Perhaps  the main message here should be that this would be a remarkably benign outcome But we get  paid to worry and we get paid to hold the line on inflation I am concerned that the increase in  inflation may be somewhat sharper than projected in the Greenbook, and I believe that the single  most important risk factor in the forecast is the potential for a significantly sharper rise in  inflation   In the theoretical framework, I think we should understand that it is  one thing to measure and define price stability; it may be something else again to define an  inflation target I want to put on the table the view that, before we decide that we want the target  to be price stability or what I might call price stability plus a small cushion, we still need to do a  lot of research dealing with nominal rigidities, the potential flexibility of real interest rates, and  whether a little deflation is more dangerous than a little inflation I just want to throw that out   Just to follow that up with some examples Marty Feldstein has a  paper in which he tries to demonstrate the importance of squeezing out the last bit of inflation to    7/1-2/97  achieve low inflation, which he defines as 2 percent All the countries that have zone inflation  targeting have ranges of 1 to 3 percent   It is, but it is what I call bias plus a cushion I think that is the issue  that we really have to confront We need to do a little more work on whether there are some  costs that outweigh the benefits in eliminating that last, say, percentage point of inflation In that  regard, we should keep in mind that when we look at the literature on the costs of inflation, we  find an enormous nonlinearity in those costs They are very high at very high inflation rates  They are discernible for more modest inflation rates, but the fact is that below 8 or 10 percent  inflation it is really hard to find that definitive evidence So, I think we have a long way to go in  our research to make that case very definitively, particularly for that last percentage point I  think we want to be a little cautious   Thank you, Mr Chairman Tom Simpson's presentation of the  Bluebook alternatives for the Humphrey-Hawkins ranges identified two distinct decisions that  we have to make today, and also a third decision that we might want to talk about and  contemplate The first is the interpretation of the ranges; the second is the boundary of the  ranges; and the third is whether we want to upgrade the role of monetary aggregates in our  monetary policy process  I must admit that when I came here, I was initially uneasy about the current  interpretation of the M2 range that related it to some hypothetical period of price stability and  normal velocity behavior That interpretation seemed to me to be inconsistent with the spirit and  the letter of the Federal Reserve Act But I have come to appreciate that such an interpretation  might have evolved as a quite reasonable compromise, given the instability of the monetary  aggregates On the one hand, we are told to set a range On the other, the instability of the  monetary aggregates prevents us from doing so in a meaningful way--or from using the monetary  aggregates in a meaningful way--in the policy process Now that there is evidence of improved  stability of M2, I think we have to ask whether this continues to be a reasonable compromise  I agree with the Chairman that despite early signs of improved M2 stability, it is  premature to reach that conclusion I would say that we really have not stress-tested this  relationship yet It has proved stable through a very tranquil period, and I don't think we want  to make the move back to the earlier interpretation and then have to reverse ourselves when we  find that we are in a more turbulent period  Having said that, I think the Bluebook also challenges us a bit because it points out  that some interesting issues are involved in setting the target ranges under the current    7/1-2/97  interpretation Although we have been talking and easing our way through discussions about  whether we should have explicit inflation targets, in a sense what we have been doing under this  interpretation is to set target ranges for the monetary aggregates that in effect become inflation  targets Given that that is their role, we might want to consider over time whether they really  are in line with where we want them to be The discussion in the Bluebook is very interesting It  points out that the ranges are aligned very closely with what we might discern to be true price  stability Then the question is, as I pointed out yesterday, whether we really want our inflation  target to be true price stability or maybe true price stability with a cushion It forces us into  making that choice   Right It is premature to get into that at this point, but I thought the  discussion in the Bluebook was quite interesting and challenging Even if we do not want to go  back to the earlier practice, there might be a case for upgrading a little the role of the monetary  aggregates in our deliberations We could ask the staff to bring to the Committee information  that they glean from the monetary aggregates that they think might be useful to the monetary  policy process Having said that, I do not think there is necessarily any going back to the earlier  practice I would only suggest that there is an element of hysteresis in the monetary policy  process The way we view monetary aggregates has evolved over time in part because we have  had to adjust to the instability of those aggregates In the process, we began to give more weight  to our ultimate objectives, an implicit inflation target and a stabilization objective--a Taylor rule    7/1-2/97  kind of procedure We are focusing more on the ultimate objectives and less on intermediate  targets Despite the instability of M2 over the years, our track record is quite good We might  wonder whether we really want to go back to the earlier importance of the target ranges even if  M2 becomes more stable  At any rate, I would concur that we should retain the current interpretation and not  elevate the role of the monetary aggregates I would not modify the current ranges; I would just  stay with them   I have some question about how the wording on symmetry and  asymmetry is handled However, our practice when we set a target for the funds rate of  describing that in terms of reserve conditions seems to me to be somewhere between  embarrassing and amusing I think the time has come to make at least that change in the  directive    7/1-2/97   I view this as an improvement, an increase in explicitness and  transparency I don't see any reason why only professional Fed watchers should understand the  directive I think we have to bring it into conformity with what we say in our announcements I  also object a little to the idea that the new wording is a problem because it would tend to  reinforce the notion that we control and move the federal funds rate That is what we do! As  long as that is what we do, that is what we should say we do   Mr Chairman, I agree with your policy recommendation for today I  want to spend a few minutes talking about policy in a somewhat longer-range perspective I  think our semiannual two-day pre-Humphrey-Hawkins meetings give us the opportunity to take  that broader perspective on monetary policy To take advantage of that, I want to talk about the  policy that I think would be appropriate over the remainder of the year This in no way binds me  with respect to future policy decisions, as my prescription will always respond to unexpected  developments in the data and associated changes in my forecast  Based on my current assessment of the outlook, which is very similar to that of the  Greenbook in terms of the path for the unemployment rate--growth is well above trend in the  second half of the year and the unemployment rate declines further--I believe that we should plan  to raise the funds rate by 50 basis points over the remainder of the year in two 25 basis point  increments, one in August or September and the other in November or December I would, in  effect, be pushing forward to the second half of 1997 the increases in the second half of 1998  that are incorporated in the Greenbook forecast I think such a path would put us in a better  position to limit the increase in inflation projected over 1998 and especially into 1999 as well as  reduce the risk of a still sharper increase in inflation than is projected in the Greenbook I might  also note that the environment in the second half, at least as projected, provides an unusually    7/1-2/97  good opportunity for tightening above-trend growth, a falling unemployment rate, rising  long-term interest rates, and building expectations of Fed action That same window of  opportunity will not be so evident when the economy slows to trend in 1998  I view this recommendation as consistent with the long-run simulations presented in  the Bluebook The most important conclusion that I reach from those simulations is that, even  given the very optimistic assessment of the inflation outlook in the base forecast, monetary  policy needs to tilt toward greater restraint to prevent an increase in consumer price inflation  over time to above 3 percent The second conclusion, perhaps more implicit than explicit, is that  putting some restraint in place in the near term enhances the prospect that any required restraint  will be modest, will be imposed gradually, and can be done without threatening a recession I  think the simulations with alternative policy rules reinforce this recommendation They establish  that any of those rules would have yielded an improved tradeoff between inflation and output  variability compared to actual policy over the historical period One reason for this is that they  require aggressive moves in the federal funds rate in response to changes in inflation to insure  that inflation does not lower the real federal funds rate The Greenbook follows this pattern by  assuming a rise in the nominal funds rate in 1998 to prevent the higher inflation from lowering  the real funds rate Another reason these rules are successful is that they all insure systematic  responses of the real funds rate to evolving economic conditions This is consistent with my  view that increased flexibility in the response of interest rates to changing economic conditions  might contribute to a better macroeconomic performance    7/1-2/97  I interpreted our decision to hold policy steady at the last meeting as reflecting a desire  to move gradually and to postpone further tightening until there was clearer evidence of a  rebound in demand following the slowdown in the second quarter The data since the last  meeting do not yet clearly signal that that expected rebound is under way I am, therefore,  comfortable with the recommendation of no change I also think in light of the balance of risks  in the outlook that an asymmetric directive is appropriate    I definitely identify with the old paradigm, albeit with an updated  estimate of NAIRU [Laughter]   But I am at least an old paradigm with a new NAIRU I recently have  become more optimistic about the near-term outlook in response to data indicating much larger  than expected inventory building in the second quarter, continued favorable inflation news, and the  further appreciation of the dollar These developments suggest that it is now less likely that the  economy will rebound to well-above-trend growth in the second half, and more likely that inflation  will remain well contained in the near term I guess that makes me, along with Bob Parry, an old  paradigm newly found optimist  This more benign outlook reflects crosscurrents on both output growth and inflation in  the near term, crosscurrents that are very well captured in the Greenbook forecast and discussion  The first crosscurrent is between slowing inventory investment and rebounding demand While this  was a minor story in the forecast at the last meeting, the higher pace of second-quarter inventory  investment, especially in light of expected revisions to the data, has made this a dominant theme of    8/19/97  the near-term outlook As a result, the economy is more likely to grow closer to trend in the second  half, and therefore there is less concern that utilization rates will rise further  A second set of crosscurrents affects the inflation outlook I continue to be concerned  about the risks of higher inflation as a result of an economy that is operating beyond its sustainable  capacity The resulting upward trend in inflation should be reinforced for a while to the extent that  the restraining effect of favorable transitory factors recently in play diminish over time  Developments so far this year, however, suggest crosscurrents that might slow this process  First, the better than expected inflation outcome this year, both in terms of lower core  and especially lower overall inflation, and the modest acceleration in compensation per hour will  act in the near term to restrain wage and price increases going forward In this case, it is inertia that  is our friend, and the result is a virtuous wage/price spiral  Second, some of the transitory factors that have been restraining inflation, particularly  the effect of the dollar on import prices, appear to be less transitory than previously expected  following the further appreciation of the dollar since the last meeting  Third, the upward adjustment of profits in the NIPA revisions suggests more of a cushion  that might delay passthroughs of any future increases in compensation While the net effect is still  likely to be higher inflation over the forecast horizon, any increase will begin from a slightly lower  base, and at least over the forecast horizon may be even more modest than previously expected  The net effect is the prospect of a more benign environment going forward, though one certainly  not without its challenges Looking at the Greenbook forecast, it's hard not to be delighted with the  projected outcome in 1998 unless we have become jaded by two years of stronger-than-expected  growth and lower-than-expected inflation    8/19/97  While the near-term outlook looks more benign, I still view the risks as asymmetric  Consensus forecasts for the second half, for example, still appear to be in the 2-1/2 to 3 percent  range, compared to the 2-1/4 percent rate projected in the Greenbook While the slowdown in  inventories should be a drag in the period immediately ahead, I would interpret the inventory  building in the second quarter as largely voluntary, and therefore a measure of the confidence that  businesses have in the economy going forward That confidence undoubtedly reflects the sound  fundamentals supporting demand and is consistent with the initial indicators of the strength of  demand in the third quarter Growth over the second half is therefore more likely to be above than  below trend in my view As a result, it remains more likely that utilization rates will rise further  rather than decline, at least for the second half of the year In addition, even without a further rise,  prevailing utilization rates continue to point toward higher inflation over time  One of the more intriguing aspects of the Greenbook forecast is the projection of  utilization rates The Greenbook projects a nearly unchanged unemployment rate, but a declining  capacity utilization rate even after taking account of a slowing in the growth of investment  spending in the manufacturing sector and a resulting moderation in the rate of increase in industrial  capacity A decline in the capacity utilization rate with an unchanged unemployment rate would  further widen the disparity between these two measures of resource utilization, already one of the  interesting anomalies of the current episode If this divergence is part of the explanation for the  apparent decline in NAIRU and the surprisingly favorable inflation outcome, the further widening  of this gap may further damp the responsiveness of inflation to the already low unemployment rate  Maybe But I expect one of the more important stories still to be written about this expansion is  how the economy will find its way back to NAIRU, assuming we are already below NAIRU In the  Blue Chip consensus forecast, the economy slows on its own over 1998 to a below-trend rate and,    8/19/97  as a result, the unemployment rate retreats slowly toward NAIRU, fortunately before inflation rises  to any considerable degree In this case perhaps we can sit back and watch  In the Greenbook on the other hand, the economy grows at trend, preserving the  prevailing utilization rates, and as a result, inflation rises gradually over time This version of the  story is waiting for us to write the conclusion The change in the outlook since our last meeting  suggests, however, that we may have more time to refine our forecast before we have to pen our  conclusion   Don, before each FOMC meeting we are provided a memo on what  various rules are indicating, the Taylor rule particularly My recollection is that the equilibrium  real interest rate constructed in that case is for a 2 percent real funds rate, using the chained GDP  deflator   Do you want to talk briefly about the table at the bottom of chart 10 in  your handout and its implications? While I am a strong believer in some of the wisdom embedded  in the Taylor rule, I have been concerned for a long time that we need to be more careful about how  we set its level by coming up with a more reasonable estimate of the equilibrium real funds rate  The 2 percent comes from Taylor's heuristic rounding Do you think this table provides a  somewhat more thoughtful estimate?    8/19/97   Agree    My view of the economic outlook has changed rather significantly since  the last meeting At that time, it appeared that growth had slowed more sharply in the second  quarter than now appears to have been the case and that growth might remain near its sustainable  trend in the second half and into 1998 To be sure, the risk of higher inflation remained, but the  slowdown in growth and the recent favorable inflation performance removed any sense of urgency  to the policy decision  The crosscurrents that underpinned the earlier forecast, specifically between the  projected slowing in inventory investment and the expected rebound in demand, seem well enough  in evidence now and continue to underpin the forecast of slower growth in the second half of this  year But crosscurrents do not necessarily balance, and the crosscurrents in question apparently  have not yielded a return to trend growth Indeed, growth in the third quarter appears likely to be    9/30/97  about as strong as it was in the second quarter Perhaps more importantly, the ample evidence of  positive fundamentals including, I believe, supportive financial conditions and the absence of signs  of imbalances suggest that growth is likely to remain above trend for some time in the absence of a  change in policy As a result, it now appears likely that the unemployment rate will decline to a  new cyclical low in coming quarters  Three important changes in the Greenbook forecast for this meeting effectively highlight  the key issues in the forecast First, the staff forecast for growth in the first half of 1998 was  revised upward to about a 3 percent rate, with the unemployment rate falling to 4-1/2 percent by  mid-1998 Second, a series of adjustments and forecast assumptions were introduced that  moderated the decline in the unemployment rate and the rise in inflation associated with a higher  growth forecast And third, the normal practice of a constant funds rate, either nominal or more  recently real, was replaced by a preemptive policy response The key is the interaction among  these changes Even with the more favorable assumptions about the link from growth to inflation  pressures, the higher growth path of the Greenbook forecast yields an unfavorable inflation  outcome, justifying a preemptive policy response  I believe that the risks relative to the staff growth forecast are now more evenly  balanced, and I would endorse a preemptive policy response to the projected decline in the  unemployment rate and increased risk of inflation I do have some reservations, however, about  three changes in assumptions in this forecast, each of which worked to diminish the response of  inflation to the upward revised path of growth The staff revised upward its projections of both  labor force and productivity growth, in effect raising the trend rate of GDP growth over the forecast  period and as a result moderating the decline in the unemployment rate In addition, the staff  revised downward the response of wages and prices to the lower unemployment rate Mike Prell    9/30/97  referred to these changes as a flirtation with new era thinking They are clearly an effort to balance  what I have called regularities and possibilities Whatever the merits of these adjustments, they  leave in my judgment considerably greater upside risk to the Greenbook forecast of inflation than  has been the case in earlier forecasts  I can appreciate the conditions that motivated such adjustments I too would like to get  the inflation forecast right for a change, and I too want to be careful to balance regularities and  possibilities in my forecast I can hardly argue that the adjustments that were made are implausible  or that the productivity path in the forecast is unbelievable But this does change the balance of  risks, in my view, in relation to the Greenbook forecast  While the policy change is introduced in an understated way in the Greenbook, it is also  an important change in the forecast assumptions It is notable not only because it is preemptive, but  also because the increase in rates is sharper than previously assumed and begins earlier The policy  message is clearer than it otherwise might have been, precisely because the staff leaned so far with  its forecast assumptions in order to limit the chance that the forecast overstated the risk of higher  inflation  I believe there are some interesting similarities today to the situation we faced at the  March meeting when we raised the federal funds rate Leading up to that meeting, the  unemployment rate had moved within a narrow range; it was near the bottom end of that range,  near a cyclical low and below estimates of NAIRU The forecast for near-term growth at that  meeting was revised upward from the earlier forecast of trend growth The resulting projection of  above-trend growth was accompanied by a forecast of a decline in the unemployment rate to below  its recent rate As a result, the forecast presented a combination of utilization and growth risks that  compounded the threat of higher inflation compared to the earlier forecasts and galvanized support    9/30/97  for a tightening move Given the changes in the forecast since the last meeting, we again face a  similar combination of utilization and growth risks going forward, and those risks are compounded  by the fact that we begin with an unemployment rate nearly 1/2 percentage point lower than was the  case in March Fortunately, we also begin at a lower inflation rate But as a proponent of  opportunistic disinflation, I want to hold on to this lower inflation going forward   Mr Chairman, I agree with you and I endorse all elements of your policy  recommendation no change in the funds rate today; maintaining an asymmetric directive; and,  importantly, recognition that there is an increased possibility, if not a presumption, that a tightening  move will be justified in November, assuming the data between now and then confirm the thrust of  the Greenbook forecast  My view is that monetary policy should continue to lean against the cyclical winds and  be cautiously preemptive In my view, such a preemptive move might well be in order at the next  meeting By that time, we will have two additional employment reports, the third-quarter ECI  report, and a better feel for the momentum of the economy early in the fourth quarter This timing  is also consistent with my view that there are windows of opportunity for policy tightening We are  not, in my judgment, at such a window at this moment, but I expect we may be approaching one It  is easier to change policy, for example, when the financial markets anticipate a move and when the  public will understand it It is easier for this reason to tighten when growth is above trend and the  unemployment rate is moving lower than when the economy has slowed to trend and the  unemployment rate has stabilized, whatever its level  In my view, to maintain a preemptive course, to sustain the decline in inflation we have  recently achieved, and to take advantage of a possible window of opportunity, we should be  prepared to tighten in November if the data confirm continued above-trend growth and rising  utilization rates    Thank you, Mr Chairman The outlook for monetary policy has  become more complex since our last meeting On the one hand, the slightly stronger-than-  expected third-quarter GDP report, indications that the momentum in economic activity has  carried into the fourth quarter, and a decline in the unemployment rate in October all underscore  and reinforce concerns voiced at the last meeting about the threat of higher inflation and the  convergence of growth and utilization risks On the other hand, the developments in Southeast  Asia suggest a new downdraft on growth next year and further restraint on inflation, reducing the  degree of tightening that would otherwise have been appropriate and adding an important  element of downside risk that perhaps was absent previously  How do these things balance out? Given the staff's judgment about the implications  of developments in Southeast Asia, the dominant concern in my judgment is the momentum in  demand and the recent and prospective declines in the unemployment rate that continue to point  to a growing risk of higher inflation While I am comfortable with the staff forecast of growth, I  am concerned, as I was at the last meeting, that the unemployment rate might drift lower than  projected by the staff and that inflation might rise more than they anticipate, reflecting my  somewhat less optimistic assessment of trend productivity growth    11/12/97  One doubt sometimes expressed about the need for further tightening in this  environment is the possibility that increases in real interest rates this year have already imposed  the requisite degree of restraint Although the nominal federal funds rate has increased only  slightly, the sharp slowing in overall CPI inflation this year has raised real short-term interest  rates--computed by subtracting 12-month CPI inflation from nominal rates--by more than a  percentage point This method of computing real short-term rates is used by the staff, for  example, in international comparisons of real short-term interest rates The effect is qualitatively  similar though somewhat smaller if real interest rates are computed, as in the Taylor Rule, by  subtracting core CPI inflation from nominal interest rates Should we therefore conclude that, in  effect, a sufficiently aggressive tightening in monetary policy already has occurred to inoculate  the economy against the risk of higher inflation? The most important considerations may be that  the current level of real short-term interest rates, however high and however much they may have  increased this year, does not appear to be restraining demand growth and that credit availability  in general appears to be supportive of continued strong growth  But the key to why overall financial conditions still seem to be highly supportive may  be that real long-term interest rates, generally viewed as the more important force in aggregate  demand, appear to have declined over the year, even predating the decline in long-term  government rates during the current turmoil The contrast between the increase in real  short-term rates and the decline in real long-term rates reflects both differences in the movements  in short-term versus long-term inflation expectations and differences in the movements in short-  and long-term nominal rates Long-term inflation expectations as measured, for example, by the  median expected long-term inflation measure in the Michigan survey and inflation expectations    11/12/97 76  in the Philadelphia Fed survey have not changed much over this year, in contrast with the sharp  decline in actual CPI inflation and the smaller but still significant decline in other measures of  short-term inflation expectations Also, nominal long-term rates have declined compared to the  small increase in short-term nominal rates This is reinforced by the comments of President  Broaddus about the recent de facto easing produced by the further decline in long-term rates  Two other developments have reinforced the effect of the small decline in real  long-term interest rates on the real cost of capital First, there has been a further increase in  equity prices this year, contributing to a further decline in the cost of financing capital spending  Second, the sharpest slowdown in inflation has been that for durable goods Indeed, outright  declines have occurred in the prices of some durable goods, and in comparison with the prices of  overall output, the reduction in the relative prices of durable goods has further lowered the real  cost of capital for such goods  My message is that we should not take too much comfort in the rise in real short-term  interest rates that has been produced by a decline in actual inflation and an accompanying  decline in measures of short-term inflation expectations The financial conditions that are most  important in underpinning real economic activity continue to be highly supportive, indeed more  supportive than at the beginning of the year I conclude that if we want financial conditions to  become less supportive, we will have to do the dirty work ourselves   Let me offer at least a slightly different perspective In the absence of  developments in Southeast Asia and the related turmoil in world financial markets, I believe a  1/4 percentage point increase in the funds rate would have been justified today In my judgment,  this move would have been consistent with the concerns voiced at the last meeting, concerns that  were reinforced by the stronger-than-expected growth of GDP in the third quarter, the decline in  the unemployment rate in October, and the upward revision to the GDP forecast for the fourth  quarter Such a move would have insured the procyclical movement in short-term interest rates  that I believe is so important to achieving our macroeconomic objective  Let me comment a little on my views on productivity I frankly do not see anything  amiss in the staff forecast of a sharp slowing in productivity growth next year GDP growth  slows in that forecast from 38 percent to 22 percent If we get the slowing in GDP growth  anticipated by the staff, then actual productivity growth should be quite sharply below trend  productivity growth The staff estimate of that trend may be a little high, but I think it is  defensible I would not want to go higher than it is  The second point I would make is that I do not believe the anticipated reduction in  productivity growth would be an important factor contributing to higher inflation The reason is    11/12/97 96  that I think pricing is done more off trend productivity than off actual productivity I believe the  slowdown in productivity growth is the key story behind the projected downturn in profits So,  the behavior of productivity is really more of a profits story than an inflation story But I  certainly agree that there is a lot of uncertainty about what that productivity trend is going to be,  and that is why I focus on utilization rates From the standpoint of monetary policy, I think that  is really what needs to be kept in mind Utilization rates continue to increase, but I think it  would be prudent to accompany that increase in utilization rates with a somewhat firmer  monetary policy   I think we have to look two-fold I am focusing more on the labor  markets for all the reasons that you suggested, but I also agree that the gap between capacity  utilization and the unemployment rate is important If that gap widens further, then my view  would be altered a little There is also no question in my mind that developments in Southeast  Asia and to a lesser extent the stock market correction and the uneasiness in world financial  markets fully support delaying any move to a tighter policy The reason is not only because of  the turmoil in financial markets but because of some uncertainty about just how sharp the  economic impact is going to be in Southeast Asia and what the spillover effects to other  developed economies and therefore to the United States are going to be So, I think there is a  premium on additional information that comes only from waiting In my view, that does caution  some patience, but again I would be concerned if we did not respond over the longer term to  increases in utilization rates    Thank you, Mr Chairman The forecast to which policy must respond  is now being shaped by three powerful forces The first is the strong cyclical upturn over the last  two years The second is the diverse set of factors--some combination of temporary influences  and longer-lasting structural changes--that have restrained inflation and resulted in a virtual  disconnect between the real sector and the wage/price sector The new ingredient, also  threatening to be a powerful player in its own right, is the Asian turmoil In terms of monetary  policy, we mainly have watched as the first two forces have battled to a near draw We have  remained alert and asymmetric to be sure, but mostly unmoved Our inaction has been rewarded  with exceptional macroeconomic performance However, the further decline in the  unemployment rate over the past two months and the evidence of growth at a pace still well  above trend in this quarter have begun, in my judgment, to tilt the balance toward policy action  to lean against the cyclical winds, notwithstanding the continued excellent inflation performance  Simply put, an economy growing at a pace near 4 percent and operating at a 46  percent unemployment rate deserves to have a little sand thrown into its wheels The Asian  crisis will throw a heap of sand into the wheels of the economy This should, in my judgment    12/16/97 52  substitute for at least part of any monetary policy tightening that otherwise might have been  appropriate This suggests the use of a comparison How much monetary tightening would be  required to yield the same slowing in growth over the next two years as the staff now expects  from the Asian turmoil? Between the September and the December Greenbooks, the forecast for  growth over 1998 was revised downward by almost a full percentage point and over 1999 by 1/2  percentage point The September forecast in this comparison is adjusted to reflect the same  monetary policy assumptions as in December The effect of the Asian turmoil with allowance  for a multiplier effect accounts for most of this revision We can compare this effect with that of  a 100 basis point tightening over 1998 as shown in the December Greenbook This tightening is  estimated to slow growth 03 percentage point over 1998 and 07 percentage point over 1999  The dynamics of the two shocks are quite different Nevertheless, this comparison suggests that  the effects of the Asian turmoil might easily match or exceed the outer end of any monetary  policy tightening we might have contemplated over the next year That is a lot of sand to throw  into the wheels of the economy The dynamics of the response to the Asian crisis are more front  loaded, and that may be even better suited to policy objectives at the moment than a policy  tightening  The next questions are whether the staff may have overestimated the spillover from  the Asian crisis or underestimated the momentum in the economy in the absence of an Asian  shock The reality is that there is a great deal of uncertainty about the dimension of the Asian  turmoil First, the situation has not stabilized in the region Second, it is very difficult to predict  the effect of the crisis on growth in that region And third, the degree of spillover to other  developing economies remains in question    12/16/97  The good news is that we may not have to wait long to grade this forecast The staff  expects the effect of the Asian turmoil on the United States to occur very quickly It may be  hinted at in a downward revision to the forecast for net exports and the less favorable mix  between inventory investment and final sales now projected for the fourth quarter It will be  clear for all to see, according to the staff, in the halving of growth in the first quarter relative to  the fourth quarter Nevertheless, most of the data we are likely to see between now and the next  meeting will be dominated by the monthly data for November and December and the NIPA data  for the fourth quarter These data will more likely, in my judgment, signal momentum rather  than slowdown So, we are likely to have to be patient and wait for the data that will come out  after our next meeting to see more clearly the effects of the Asian turmoil  The degree of the slowdown will, of course, dictate the nature of the challenge  monetary policy will face going forward The staff forecast, now close to where private sector  consensus forecasts have been for some time, presents one vision, a remarkably graceful  version of what I would call a reverse soft landing We begin from an economy already  operating beyond its point of sustainable capacity, with the prospect of a slow progressive updrift  in inflation Growth slows immediately to below trend where it remains over the next two years,  ending 1999 close to NAIRU Inflation is restrained over the interval by a variety of factors; it  rises only modestly, and the cumulative increase is limited by the return toward NAIRU by the  end of the period This scenario allows monetary policy to remain on hold and permits the  economy to move into the year 2000 near full employment and with inflation still low Maybe!  But given the more balanced risks going forward, I certainly cannot rule out that the next move  might be toward ease if the Asian shock turns out to be even greater than is now projected    12/16/97  Let me offer an alternative that I believe is at least as likely as the staff forecast This  is a forecast that already has been presented today by Presidents Moskow, Broaddus, and  Minehan The economy slows only to trend The unemployment rate stabilizes near its current  level, having declined by 1/2 percentage point recently without any response from us, and  inflation begins to edge upward over time This would be a challenge for monetary policy--to  tighten into an economy that already has slowed to trend when the updrift of inflation is still only  a forecast It is a challenge I believe we may still face Certainly, as Presidents McDonough and  Boehne have noted, flexibility should be our key word, both in respect to the outlook and to  demands on monetary policy going forward   Thank you, Mr Chairman Given the expected effects and uncertainty  related to the Asian turmoil, I agree that we should hold policy unchanged today Because the  risks are better balanced, I also support a move to a symmetric directive It is, as President  Boehne suggested, likely to be a much better description of our intermeeting posture I believe a  symmetric directive has the advantage of signaling our flexibility to respond quickly to a worse  case scenario, should it materialize, without changing our view that the next move is still likely  to be in a policy tightening direction Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman Not a lot has changed since the last  meeting to affect my assessment of the near-term outlook The key forces at work remain  clear These are the tug of war between the momentum in domestic demand and the  expected external drag from Asia and the tug of war between very tight labor markets and  the forces that have restrained and appear likely to continue to restrain inflation But  there is, as nearly everyone has said today, a great deal of uncertainty about how these  powerful forces will play out, particularly with regard to the uncertain dimension of the  still evolving crisis in Asia It seems to me, therefore, that there is not much for us to do  for a while but to wait and see precisely how these crosscurrents balance out    2/3-4/98  Relative to the Greenbook forecast, I would expect slightly stronger growth this  year, with the expansion slowing down a little less to a pace close to 2 percent, and  slightly higher inflation I think my forecast is qualitatively in the same spirit as the  Greenbook  Given the crosscurrents and related uncertainties, a variety of outcomes could  challenge monetary policy in coming quarters I want to comment on two One of them  could easily come into play almost immediately and a second might arise later this year  and into next year Perhaps the most important question that we may have to confront in  the near term is how long we can afford to wait for the effect of the spillover from Asia to  slow growth to or below trend This question is highlighted by the stronger-than-  expected performance of the economy in the fourth quarter, including the somewhat more  favorable than anticipated mix between final demand and inventory investment, and is  also highlighted by the upward revision to the Greenbook forecast for the first quarter  The prospect for further strong employment gains and a further tightening in labor  markets immediately ahead raises the question of how long we can afford to wait and  how much further tightening in labor markets we are prepared to tolerate without some  response The good news is that the initial conditions afford us the luxury of waiting,  assuming at least that we do not have to wait much beyond the first quarter to observe a  slowdown in growth toward trend Because it appears that inflation is likely to remain in  check in the near term despite tight labor markets, there may be room to wait out some  residual above trend growth, provided the forecast continues to point toward slower  growth ahead    2/3-4/98  My greater concern, however, is the forecast for inflation in 1999 and beyond  While this does not bear directly on our decision today, it highlights a transition that we  will have to make and one that might reasonably affect the way we respond to  developments over this year The relevant issues are effectively highlighted in the  longer-term simulations reported in the Bluebook In those simulations, a combination of  tight labor markets and dissipation and reversal of some of the forces that recently have  been restraining inflation finally begin to put upward pressure on inflation into 1999 and  beyond One of the alternative longer-term scenarios in the Bluebook involves a  tightening to prevent the persistent updrift in inflation We may want to keep this  scenario in mind if growth slows to below trend or the unemployment rate edges upward  as in the staff forecast The transition ahead may require either such a period of below  trend growth or a tightening of monetary policy, and maybe both   Whenever we talk about the monetary aggregate ranges, it seems  to me we are always caught between two kinds of decisions whether we want to confirm  or change the interpretation we give to the ranges and what boundaries we want to set  The staff presentation today reminds us that the ranges are set inconsistently in terms of  their interpretation, and we have an opportunity to make them more consistent M2 and  M3 are set according to what I call a "price stability" rationale, one that is consistent with  price stability and normal velocity behavior, and debt is set according to what I call a  "projections" interpretation  It seems to me that the principle of consistency has some value here I think the  ranges should be set consistently with one another We could argue as to whether the  "price stability" or the "projections" interpretation is the one we want to use In my view,  the choice between those two involves two principles One I call convenience As long  as there is a lot of uncertainty or projected potential instability in the aggregates, the    2/3-4/98  "price stability" interpretation is rather convenient The other principle is consistency  with Humphrey-Hawkins, or the spirit of Humphrey-Hawkins, and that would make me  lean toward the "projections" interpretation  In the midst of concern about the instability of the monetary aggregates, I am  comfortable with the "price stability" rationale until stability emerges long enough for us  to move back to a "projections" interpretation Given that, I prefer the spirit of alternative  III In particular, I cannot think of a good rationale for alternative II because all it does is  change which aggregate is inconsistent with the other two Now, while I like alternative  III in principle, I do not think the timing for moving to that alternative is particularly  good On the one hand, we would be lowering our target range for debt and raising our  forecast of its growth On the other, we would be drawing attention to the monetary  aggregates at a time when we do not necessarily want to signal that we are going to place  more emphasis on them So, I would prefer to retain alternative I, and as the growth rate  projections for the debt aggregate decline over time and become more consistent with the  "price stability" rationale--if that should occur--we could then lower the debt range and  change its interpretation, too  One other observation that I would bring up relates to the ranges for the M2  aggregate The staff has made a very good point that the M2 range seems to be almost  perfectly centered on virtual price stability It implies a 1/2 percent increase in inflation  So, it might be said that, by voting for alternative I, we are saying that price stability is  indeed our long-run inflation target and is what we intend to achieve I want to come  back to that issue in my policy position statement, but I do not want my preference for  alternative I necessarily to carry that implication    2/3-4/98   Could I add a point? It is not just our ability to communicate to  the public, it is our own internal deliberations that are at stake here We might ask where  we are heading Do we think we are where we want to be or do we think we want  inflation to move down 1/2 percentage point, 1 percentage point, 1-1/2 percentage points?  This vague definition was perfectly adequate when inflation was 10 percent, and it    2/3-4/98  worked when inflation was 5 percent, but now I think there is a real question--maybe  among us and certainly among the public at large There is an issue here   Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation I want to say a  word about what I think a symmetric directive means Sometimes, one thinks of it as  meaning that there is an equal probability that the next policy move might be up or down  I do believe, given the tight labor markets and the continuing strength of demand, that  the next move still is more likely to be up--that there is that upside risk On the other  hand, I think a symmetric directive signals our readiness to respond rapidly to a sharper  downdrift from Asia than we foresee in the baseline forecast  I also want to come back and mention something about the longer-run  simulations It seems to me that the two-day meetings we have twice a year are an  opportunity to think about some of the longer-range strategic issues facing monetary  policy rather than always focusing meeting by meeting on just one decision In my view,  that is the value of the simulations of alternative policy strategies that the staff has  presented to us In those simulations they considered, for example, a couple of options    2/3-4/98  for longer-term monetary policy--either to stabilize inflation at 2 percent or to reduce it  further to, say, 1 percent for the PCE As I read that, the question occurred to me, why do  we make the staff guess at our longer-range inflation target? One of the reasons might be  that we are uncertain ourselves about our long-range inflation target because of issues  relating to the perils of deflation Do we want to center our inflation target in the long run  on true zero inflation so that a typical recession would always be accompanied by  deflation? I'm not sure Is a little deflation worse than a little inflation? Maybe, but I'm  not sure about that either I would like to encourage the staff to think more about these  issues, give us some guidance about them, and perhaps devote some of their simulations  to them We might then set aside some time at the next two-day meeting in July to focus  on those issues    Thank you, Mr Chairman I want to focus on three aspects of  continuity in the developments since the last meeting First, there has been continued  exceptional momentum in private domestic demand and payroll employment, only partially  offset by a decline in net exports Second, the strength in domestic demand has continued to be  supported by very favorable financial conditions, including soaring equity prices Third,  favorable supply shocks, reinforced in this case by a sharper-than-expected decline in oil prices,  have continued to restrain inflation  I continue to accord an important role, indeed a central role, to favorable supply  shocks in explaining recent economic performance and assessing an appropriate course for  monetary policy When there is an adverse supply shock, it is well appreciated that the bad news    3/31/98  cannot be escaped, only shared in the near term between higher unemployment and higher  inflation And so it is with a favorable supply shock, only substituting good news for bad news  Policymakers cannot escape the benefits no matter how they might try [Laughter] They can  only influence how the benefits are shared between lower unemployment and lower inflation  There is, of course, much to like in the outcome of low unemployment and low  inflation and in the policy that has supported that outcome, so far at least In particular, it is not  imprudent to operate for a while beyond the point of long-run sustainable capacity as part of the  sharing of the benefits of the supply shock Still, the optimal course of policy in this case  depends on the expected persistence of the shock, although the length of time it persists is  sometimes as much of a surprise as the shock itself At any rate, the longer-than-expected  persistence or renewal of the favorable supply shocks has certainly contributed to the very  favorable outcome and to how brilliant monetary policy appears after the fact The danger in this  policy is the possibility of misperceiving the sustainability of the recent performance and  therefore of failing to appreciate the necessity of a transition at some point to a more sustainable  state Given the transition that must ultimately be made, it might be unwise to move still further  beyond the point of sustainable capacity  The key to the Greenbook forecast is the projected slowdown immediately ahead in  the rate of economic expansion to below trend growth The Greenbook forecast shares this  feature with almost all private sector forecasts This is worrisome because my experience as a  forecaster suggests that forecasters can get it all wrong, but they almost never get it all right At  any rate, I have described this widely shared forecast as tracing out a graceful reverse soft  landing Because the economy slows almost immediately to below trend growth, it moves  gradually from its initial point beyond sustainable capacity toward sustainable capacity just as    3/31/98  the favorable supply shocks that are restraining inflation dissipate The result is an economy that  glides toward full employment with still low inflation as we reach the end of the Greenbook  forecast horizon This is a remarkably favorable outcome, especially since it occurs while we  play spectator  The risks, however, seem weighted from my perspective to stronger growth and hence  higher average utilization rates and, given the projected slowdown, to even sharper increases in  compensation and inflation than in the Greenbook forecast There is still a potential for further  declines in the unemployment rate based on the momentum in demand before the slowdown  takes hold There is also the potential that the crosscurrents so clearly identified in the  Greenbook may work out a little less favorably for price inflation, exert somewhat more pressure  on nominal wage changes, and produce a somewhat sharper reversal in benefit costs The latter  developments, interacting with a slowdown in productivity growth, suggest the potential for a  less benign than projected path of labor costs in coming quarters Looking to 1999, I also am  concerned that there might be a somewhat sharper reversal in the supply shocks than projected  by the staff  Financial conditions in general and monetary policy in particular have played  important roles in supporting recent economic performance Favorable financial conditions have  been supporting aggregate demand, notwithstanding the sharp rise in the real federal funds rate  stemming from the decline in inflation Real long-term rates are steady to declining, equity  prices are soaring, credit availability is ample, underwriting standards may have eased  somewhat, loan pricing is aggressive, and money growth is rapid True, there is good reason to  project a decline in velocity in the first quarter, and there are some special factors that likely have  boosted M2 growth Still, there is a fairly clear signal in the acceleration of money growth that    3/31/98  should not be ignored Financial conditions in general and monetary policy in particular clearly  are not restraining aggregate demand The projected slowdown in M2 growth in the forecast is  only the mirror image of the projected slowdown in nominal income growth, reinforced by a  return to a more stable velocity path This simply indicates that if the Asian slump slows the  economic expansion to the degree projected, the current setting of the funds rate is consistent  with the slowing of nominal income growth and hence money growth Policy does not slow  money growth in the forecast; Asia does  The bottom line is that a slowing in growth is essential to avoid a sharper than  desirable reversal of inflation fortunes in 1999 and beyond The Asian slump may accomplish  this Some patience has been advisable early in 1998 as we wait for evidence on the degree of  momentum in domestic demand and the offset from Asia Patience is a virtue but only to a point  We may be able to remain spectators if economic growth slows and helps to preserve the low  inflation environment But the continued momentum in demand so far this year suggests that a  tighter monetary policy may still be required to slow the expansion and preserve the low  inflation climate   Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation for no change in the  federal funds rate and for an asymmetric posture    3/31/98  I have some considerable sympathy with the notion that, rather than just expanding the  policy announcement, we have an immediate release of the directive that would indicate--   The whole directive On the other hand, I think that proposal deserves  a full discussion of the pros and cons before we move forward If we decide to go in that  direction, we might want to do so at a time when the directive would not create a surprise when it  is released There are some relevant issues A change from symmetry to asymmetry sends some  indication of partial tightening or easing to the market, and our willingness to move from  symmetry to asymmetry may be affected by whether or not we are going to announce that move,  depending on what impact it is going to have on the market Another consideration, Mr  Chairman, would be that your signaling to the markets in a speech would allow you to provide  more explanation, and I think that would be desirable at this point also    Thank you, Mr Chairman I will be referring to a couple of charts  that I am having passed around2 At the last meeting, many members of this Committee expressed  concern that inflation risks might be increasing in light of the prevailing tightness in labor markets  and the momentum in domestic demand The question we confront today is whether developments  since the last meeting should encourage us to relax that concern or to act on it Of course, a serious  alternative is to remain concerned but on the sidelines, perhaps increasing vigilance instead of rates  I want to focus my remarks on the labor market, inflation data, and on the question of  whether the evidence points to a still higher trend rate of growth in productivity and the prospects  for an imminent slowing to below-trend growth I will have some comments on the monetary  policy implications of the stock market and of Asia during the policy go-around  At the last meeting, many emphasized that it was important that economic growth  slow quickly and significantly given the already tight labor markets I refer to this concern as  growth risk Specifically, it is the concern that above-trend growth would raise utilization rates  further and thereby exacerbate the risks of higher inflation The bottom line is that the tighter labor  2/ Copies of the charts used by Governor Meyer are appended to the transcript (Appendix 2)    5/19/98  market we worried about last time has already arrived Utilization rates rather than growth per se  drive inflation pressures A slowing of growth to trend at this point would only stabilize utilization  rates at their elevated levels  It is true that a decline of 04 percentage point in the unemployment rate in one month  makes no sense in terms of underlying fundamentals But neither did a constant unemployment  rate over the previous five months during which growth was so robust I, like the staff, would  assume an upturn immediately ahead to an unemployment rate of about 4-1/2 percent Growth  turned out to be 2 percentage points faster in the first quarter than expected at the last meeting, the  unemployment rate is well below where we expected it to be, and the staff forecast for the second  quarter was revised upward The bottom line is that if we were worried about the tight labor  markets at the last meeting, we should be more worried today I am  What about the prospect of an imminent slowing in growth going forward, perhaps to  below trend in the second half as in the staff forecast? It seems to me that the economy has  somewhat of a knife edge quality with respect to the pace of the expansion On the one hand, the  fundamentals continue to look very positive There is impressive momentum in domestic demand;  financial conditions appear to be very supportive; and interest-sensitive sectors of the economy  continue to prosper It is not hard to imagine that we could have continued above-trend growth  ahead  Still, three factors are likely to weigh on the expansion going forward First,  assuming that the latest staff estimate of a $103 billion increase in inventory accumulation in the  first quarter is on the mark and is not revised down going forward, the rate of inventory investment  in the first quarter is almost certainly unsustainable Indeed, the two most impressive numbers  related to this forecast are 43 and 103 The 43 percent unemployment rate in April highlights how    5/19/98  tight labor markets are, and the $103 billion rate estimated for first-quarter inventory investment is  a triple-digit weight hanging over the expansion going forward At any rate, while there do not  appear to be stock imbalances, there likely will be if the flow rate of accumulation does not slow  immediately A lower rate of inventory investment, a flow correction, should lead as opposed to  follow a slowdown in economic growth  Second, the external drag from a combination of the emerging Asian economies,  Japan, and the long cumulative appreciation of the dollar should continue, although at a diminished  rate after the first quarter  Third, the positive impulse from the stock market should at least diminish, partly in  response to a slowing in the expansion and hence in the growth of earnings This is in line with the  staff forecast and would contribute to a slower growth of the economy in 1999 after the effects  from reduced inventory investment and external drag had mostly run their course Particularly  because of the interaction of inventory correction and external drag and perhaps with some help  from the stock market, there is the potential for a significant slowing immediately ahead Still,  there is some question about how much longer one should wait for this slowdown especially in  light of the fact that growth has consistently outperformed expectations over the last two years and  in light of the very tight and indeed now tighter labor markets  At the last meeting, members of this Committee expressed the following concern  about wage pressures in the context of tight labor markets Here is a quote from the minutes "but  additional improvements in productivity growth could not be counted on to offset further increases  in the rate of growth of labor compensation, which were more likely to occur if labor markets were  to tighten further" The staff, however, does plan on higher productivity growth to offset the  effects of tighter labor markets, at least for a while This is very much central to their forecast    5/19/98  The staff's decision to raise productivity growth reflected their assessment of two new  pieces of data the adjusted productivity series, reflecting a correction of the data on hours--the  length of the pay period--and the report on multifactor productivity that indicated faster growth in  capital services in 1996 I followed with a lag and some discount factor the staff's earlier upward  revision in their estimate of trend productivity growth Perhaps I will ultimately follow this  revision as well but not now; I have some reservations My lower estimate and the staff's higher  estimate work about equally well in explaining the recent decline in unemployment via Okun's  Law The adjusted productivity series provides a hint of a sharper break in the trend rate of  productivity growth in mid-1995 but it is only a hint in my judgment and not definitive enough for  my taste to justify an upward revision in my estimate of the trend Indeed, assuming a constant  trend from 1990 onward, the staff's productivity equation yields an estimate of just 11 percent for  the trend rate of productivity There is in this case no difference in the estimated trend whether  published or adjusted productivity data are used This trend is also identical to the trend estimated  over the earlier 1974 to 1990 period While the staff's analysis is suggestive and it definitely got  my attention, it appears to me that the recent robust productivity growth can be explained by a  combination of a more modest increase in productivity and a normal cyclical rebound  What about the inflation and the wage data? Should developments since the last  meeting make us less concerned about the potential for an acceleration in wages? Let me focus  first on the recent data on core CPI The staff projected a 22 percent rate of increase for this  measure over 1998 and over 1999, the same as over 1997 On a consistent methodological basis,  however, this translates into an increase from 22 percent over 1997 to 24 percent over 1998 and  27 percent over 1999 The first question about inflation is whether the trend in core CPI is stable  or declining or already rebounding The 12-month increase is now 21 percent, a tenth below 1997    5/19/98  This perhaps suggests an underlying rate of inflation that is still stable to declining But as  indicated in the charts I have passed around, the annualized inflation rates over three-month and  six-month intervals exhibit quite a pronounced upward trend The three-month rate is now 28  percent and the six-month rate is 25 percent This leads me to suspect that the underlying inflation  rate may already be higher going forward than the staff suggests and it may also be rising faster  than they project  Let me admit that I have taken a very different approach in interpreting the CPI data  than I did with the productivity data I weighed more heavily the lower frequency data on  productivity, down-playing some signs in the higher frequency data that there might have been a  recent break in trend On the core CPI on the other hand, I emphasized the higher frequency data in  an effort to identify a change in the trend quickly I admit that I was looking for faster inflation and  I found it I was not looking for higher productivity growth, and I did not find it But this is where  my intuition has taken me  The wage and compensation data, including ECI, compensation per hour, and average  hourly earnings, point to some upward drift in wage and compensation rates But as shown on the  second page, the acceleration is much more evident in the 12-month rates than in some of the  higher frequency data Especially in the case of ECI, the latest quarterly reading is more benign  than what is suggested by the 12-month changes Putting it all together, on balance it seems to me  that the risk of higher inflation has escalated a bit further since the last meeting   Thank you, Mr Chairman Labor markets are very tight, and a  significant part of the recent inflation performance owes to the temporary effects of favorable  supply shocks Inflation will almost certainly be on a rising trend going forward, but the published  rise will be partially offset by the effect of technical revisions Let me say a few words about the  stock market and then Asia and how they fit into the monetary policy calculus  For the stock market, I suggest two rules Rule number one is that, in general,  monetary policy should focus on our broad macro policy objectives, namely price stability and full  employment The stock market in this case has only an indirect influence on monetary policy  through its effect on aggregate demand, with no more influence than a host of other factors If the  FOMC is disciplined about its monetary policy and thereby contributes effectively toward its broad  macro objectives, the stock market in my view is likely to converge back to fundamental values and  to do so in a reasonably graceful and not very disruptive way should it drift away for awhile  Rule number two addresses the case when there is evidence of a bubble economy in  which asset values are more seriously stretched in both financial and real asset markets, as was  apparently the case in Japan in the late 1980s Failure to control such widespread over-valuations  can risk serious disruptions to the real economy down the road Rule number two suggests the use  of monetary policy to resist such wider and more dramatic asset market overvaluations The art of    5/19/98  good policy is knowing when to switch from rule one to rule two [Laughter] I do not think that  time has come yet Nevertheless, when there is an increased risk that equities are significantly  overvalued, it would be prudent for monetary policymakers to reassess how disciplined their policy  really is and perhaps to err on the side of restraint when there is a close call  What about Asia? Specifically, should the FOMC weigh the global effects of US  monetary policy? Applying my belief in rule number one for stocks, a globally friendly US  monetary policy is one that insures the United States is an anchor for strong global performance  This is generally achieved by promoting price stability and maximum sustainable growth and full  employment at home Like rule number two, there may be exceptions and the acute stage of the  Asian crisis toward the end of last year might have been one The recent sense of increased  fragility in the region and perhaps a greater sense of vulnerability of the Japanese economy at least  raises some question about whether today we are still or again in such a situation Another close  call  The bottom line is that this is a close call for policy I believe that monetary policy  needs to edge toward a tighter stance and soon unless either inflation moves still lower or growth  slows to below trend The staff forecast suggests that growth may slow to trend this quarter and to  below trend in the second half That would reduce the risk of rising inflation going forward But  such a slowdown is far from assured, and even in the staff forecast, inflation drifts upward Asia  encourages some patience  On balance I think I would support a tightening today if the consensus were there I  will use my energy today and in the days to come to try to move the consensus in this direction  unless, of course, the data going forward or further analysis of the data change my view of the  appropriate policy But today I will accept your recommendation, Mr Chairman    5/19/98    Peter, I just wanted a few more details on the pessimistic Asia  scenario When you start out with the yen depreciation in that scenario, do you "add factor"  down any other parts of Japanese aggregate demand or is that the hit on it?   Okay   So, the falling Asian GDP is imposed exogenously Let us come  back, then, and follow through on President Broaddus's suggestion that we let the yen  depreciate, whether it is to 160 or 175 If you had not imposed the exogenous shocks to  aggregate demand in Japan and the rest of Asia and had just assumed that the prevailing  weakness in Japan, if we stepped back and allowed it to happen, would lead to this depreciation,  how would that have changed your overall view of this picture?   So, the Chinese currency would hold and the Hong Kong spillovers  would be contained   Thank you   Does he know anything about that subject?   The most important developments since the last meeting relate to  near-term growth They include early signs of the projected slowing in inventory investment, the  GM strike, and the further deterioration in foreign real economic activity centered in Asia and  Japan that is threatening to spread elsewhere The combined effects of these developments,  reflected in the significant declines in both inventory investment and net exports in the  Greenbook forecast, point convincingly to a sharper than previously expected slowdown in the  second quarter--from well above to likely below trend growth This, of course, follows robust    6/30-7/1/98  growth in the first quarter and indeed for the last year and a half While this is history, it has left  a legacy in terms of the prevailing very tight labor market that is the major source of inflation  risk going forward This risk will remain even if growth slows immediately to trend  The significant deterioration in the foreign economic outlook is the most important  change in the forecast since the May meeting In thinking about the effect of the Asian crisis on  the outlook, I like to keep in mind both the central tendency in forecasts of the spillover on the  US economy and the probability distribution associated with this effect In my view, the central  tendency was relatively stable earlier in the year while the probability of a significantly worse  outcome appeared to diminish when some rebound occurred in the currency and equity markets  of the countries in question More recently, however, there has been both a worsening in the  central tendency and a renewal of a higher probability of a significantly worse outcome The  aggravation of the central tendency reinforces the case for a significant slowing in the pace of the  economic expansion going forward, while the widening of the tail associated with worse case  scenarios adds an important downside risk to the forecast The list of countries facing serious  difficulties seems to grow by the day  Nevertheless, the growth of domestic final demand remains robust The strength  reflects positive fundamentals, including continued supportive financial market conditions This  leaves some serious doubt about whether the slowdown that clearly appears to be under way will  leave growth persistently below trend, a consideration that is central to the optimistic inflation  scenario in the Greenbook While I expect slower growth and higher inflation going forward,  still in question is the degree to which this turns out to be a relatively benign outcome--  specifically, a reverse soft landing with inflation remaining modest--or a less pleasant ending of    6/30-7/1/98  one form or another There is once again a more balanced set of risks in terms of output growth,  given the sorry state of foreign economic developments and the still robust domestic demand  On balance, I expect somewhat faster growth and higher inflation than projected in the  Greenbook Like President Broaddus, I believe that an outcome in line with the Greenbook  forecast would require some tightening of monetary policy over the forecast horizon On the  growth side, I wonder whether we are facing only a transitory decline in growth to below trend in  the second quarter, after which growth will rebound to at least trend or higher I wonder, in  particular, if growth will remain as subdued as projected in the Greenbook for the second half  when auto production rebounds from the GM strike and as the drag from nonauto inventory  investment and net exports diminishes  If growth slows to trend or remains above trend, the unemployment rate will remain  near where it is today or drift still lower and the inflation outlook will deteriorate more rapidly  than in the staff forecast Even if growth slows as projected in the Greenbook, I wonder whether  the staff was too optimistic in its jump-off from third-quarter core CPI inflation I interpreted the  May CPI report as incrementally reinforcing my view that there may already have been a  rebound in the underlying rate of core inflation from near 2 percent to about 2-1/2 percent But  after a 27 percent annual rate of core inflation over the first five months of this year, the  Greenbook projects only a 21 percent rate for the second half I would be less concerned about  the outlook for inflation if the staff turns out to be on the mark about where the underlying rate  of inflation is today That jump-off point, the higher productivity trend produced in the last  Greenbook about which I am also skeptical, and the 03 percentage point downward revision in  the CPI inflation in 1999 due to technical revisions combine to yield the Greenbook's still low  2-1/4 percent core CPI inflation for 1999    6/30-7/1/98  Finally, I am concerned that when the trend in the dollar reverses, it will be more  dramatic than the staff projects When the fundamentals in terms of relative cyclical growth  rates and real interest rate differentials tilt against the dollar, I expect the surging current account  deficit to reinforce the decline in the dollar, potentially yielding a much sharper reversal of the  exchange rate than is projected in the Greenbook That would add to the inflation rebound in  1999 and beyond   I thought this was a very interesting and very useful study and entirely  relevant, not only to what is going on in Japan but to the low inflation environment that is now in  place throughout the developed economies of the world I would feel more confident about the  results if they were replicated in a variety of other models I would be particularly concerned  about the rational expectations focus of the FRB-US model relative to some other econometric  models, but I would like to see it played out in a variety of models    6/30-7/1/98  What I found exciting in the paper were the implications for both policy strategy and  for policy objectives I think it is a very relevant point that when we have a situation where  inflation is low and we don't have much room to move nominal rates, we can compensate for  quantity with speed and more aggressive moves This notion of asymmetric responses to  downward versus upward shocks is a very interesting one Having said that, I am a little  skeptical that the Committee would be willing to move as aggressively as is contemplated in  those models, given uncertainty and the need to build broad consensus for policy changes  On policy objectives, I see this as a part of a long discussion that we seem to be having  a couple times a year with regard to how we would set an explicit inflation target if we ever  decided we wanted to set an explicit inflation target One of the reasons I liked this study was  that it reinforced my view that an appropriate inflation target would be price stability plus a  cushion where this cushion was related to the potential adverse consequences of setting too low  an inflation target I would like to see further work along these lines and I would be delighted to  see outside reviews of this study   Let me offer an alternative perspective I think that the current price  stability interpretation allows target ranges for money growth to be set independently of both the  current forecast and projected policy and therefore to be ignored in the policy process  Switching to a projections interpretation is therefore closely connected in my view with a return  of money growth to a more important role in setting monetary policy An expanded role, as  noted in the Bluebook, need not be in the form of a rigid target with policy responding  aggressively to deviations of M2 growth from its target But an expanded role would at least  signal that money growth would be more important as an indicator variable, and that deviations  of money growth from a target range would be one of a number of considerations that would  affect the course of monetary policy    6/30-7/1/98  I look forward to the return to a projections interpretation of the money growth ranges  for two reasons First, I believe it is more consistent with the spirit of the Humphrey-Hawkins  Act Second, I believe it would increase public awareness of money growth, and this could be  useful at times in explaining the need for a change in policy In particular, this might make it  easier to explain the need for a tightening of monetary policy during a period when robust  economic growth pushes money growth above its target range  The staff reports that V2 continues to perform as well relative to its determinants as  was the case before the deterioration of such performance in the early 1990s This progress  report is similar to that made at virtually every meeting at which we have discussed this topic  during my two years on the Committee So, the question is if not now when? What additional  hurdles do we expect M2 to jump through and over how long a period before we accord it a new  role? In fact, the bar seems to have been raised  A second question has been put in the discussion of the Bluebook for this meeting  Was velocity ever stable or predictable enough to justify a more important role? This, of course,  is a relevant question My assessment is that money growth did play a useful role earlier and that  it may, therefore, be ready to resume a somewhat more important role going forward A greater  role for money growth in the policy process might be facilitated both by returning to a  projections interpretation of the range and by the identification of a long-run target for money  growth consistent with the Committee's inflation target We implicitly identify such a target  today as the midpoint of the current money growth ranges, which we have interpreted as being  consistent with price stability Many countries have either adopted an explicit inflation target or  have given a more central role to money growth in policy deliberations, insuring a nominal  anchor for monetary policy and its communication    6/30-7/1/98  If we decide not to adopt an explicit inflation target, according money growth a more  important role in the policy process and establishing a long-run target for money growth would  be a natural alternative In considering the long-run target for the money growth rate and indeed  in specifying the numerical range under the price stability interpretation, I think we also need to  take into account the analysis of the implications of the zero nominal interest rate bound we  discussed yesterday The current price stability interpretation of the money growth ranges is set  with the midpoint for M2 growth at 3 percent, corresponding to about a 1/2 percent inflation rate  for the GDP price index If we decide that the appropriate long-run inflation target is true  inflation plus a cushion, then the long-run money growth target for M2 should be raised  So what about alternatives I, II, and III? Alternative III remains unattractive despite  its consistency It doesn't make sense to move to alternative III if the ultimate objective, as in  my case, is to move from the price stability to a projections interpretation of the ranges I  personally am ready to move to a projections interpretation of the ranges, though in this case the  numerical ranges in alternative II should be adjusted to make them consistent with a FOMC  consensus forecast The staff, however, does not have the necessary information to make the  adjustment because they need the FOMC's projections of short-term interest rates as well as  nominal income  Let me suggest a few possibilities First, it might be appropriate for the Chairman to  note in his upcoming Humphrey-Hawkins testimony that the Committee is moving toward  paying somewhat closer attention to money growth, if there is some agreement here that that is  the case Second, perhaps we could ask the staff to adjust the alternative II ranges to make them  more consistent with the Committee's forecast and for them to think more about how to  accomplish this Third, perhaps we should retain the alternative I ranges at this meeting but keep    6/30-7/1/98  track of the adjusted alternative II ranges and see how useful they are relative to forthcoming  developments in M2 as we think about our policy choices over the months ahead   Could I just point out that the Committee is accepting that view in its  policy decisions Are you saying you don't want to communicate that to Congress because we  will not look disciplined enough?   The price stability range is not the range we are aiming for next year   Thank you, Mr Chairman In light of the sharp slowdown in US  economic growth that appears to have taken place in the second quarter, the increased potential  for a more persistent slowdown due to the further deterioration in foreign economic activity and  perhaps especially due to the substantial increase in global risk, I support your recommendation  for no change in policy today Nevertheless, I remain quite concerned about the risk of inflation  going forward due to the very tight labor markets prevailing today, due to the continued robust  state of domestic demand, and due to uncertainty about the degree and the persistence of a  slowdown Therefore, I strongly favor the asymmetric directive as well   Thank you, Mr Chairman I think we already have had some very  thoughtful discussion of this topic I will try to add incrementally to that if I can I believe we  have an opportunity to take another small step toward greater transparency I believe such a  move would be constructive because the additional information would help participants in the  financial markets to better understand the FOMC's assessment of risks This would allow the  FOMC to better prepare the public for changes in policy that might lie ahead  Let me comment on three issues First, should we change the announcement policy?  Second, should we add the tilt of policy to the announcement? Third, should we immediately  release the full directive?  I believe that announcements should be used on occasion even when there is no  change in policy First, if there were significant uncertainty about whether or not policy would  change, we might explain why we chose not to change policy Second, if we were expected to  change policy and did not, again we might explain why Third, if we did not change policy but  changed the tilt in the directive, then we should explain why On the other hand, we should not  be in a position where we feel compelled to make an announcement in the case where we were  not expected to change policy and did not  Whether policy is symmetric or asymmetric is a very simple way of conveying  important information to the market and to the public more generally about how the FOMC  weighs the risks going forward I believe we should announce our assessment of those risks after  each meeting Would we make less use of an asymmetric bias? I think that if we agree to be  honest and use this procedural change to enhance public transparency, we will not use it any less    6/30-7/1/98  I think the memos we received on this issue contained two very interesting arguments  against immediately releasing the entire directive First, it was said that the opening paragraph is  written before the meeting and is basically vacuous Second, it was noted that the language of  the directive neither says what it means nor means what it says Thinking about this even for a  few seconds suggests an obvious solution First, we might eliminate the first paragraph and  perhaps replace it with our announcement Second, we could improve the language so it says  what we mean and we can honestly say we mean what we say My first preference is to publish  a new and improved directive My second best is to announce our tilt decision following each  meeting In addition, depending on the Committee's decision, I would like to provide an  explanation when there is a change in the funds rate, a change in the tilt, or a no-change directive  under the circumstances that I detailed above    Thank you, Mr Chairman I expect both slower growth and higher  inflation over the next year and a half However, I expect faster growth than in the Greenbook  forecast, with the rate of expansion in GDP closer to trend and a slower rate of increase in  potential output These two factors combine to yield a lower path for the unemployment rate than  is indicated in the Greenbook In part because of this, I am skeptical that the recent pattern of a  rising rate of increase in nominal compensation will reverse next year, an outcome central to the  Greenbook inflation forecast  The story underpinning the forecast of a persistent slowdown in growth to below trend  begins with a sharper external drag associated with the turmoil in Asia The resulting decline in  net exports is projected to slow GDP growth The multiplier-accelerator effects of the slower  GDP growth then moderate domestic demand, reinforcing the slowdown in GDP growth If for  good measure we add a stock market correction that is sharper than might otherwise occur in a  period of slowing expansion to reflect some initial overvaluations, we get a slowdown in GDP  growth that carries into 1999 even though the external drag is fading It is a good story I have  told it more than a few times myself I think it is the story in the Greenbook, with the important  substitution of a realized for a projected stock market correction  What is wrong with this picture? Well, it does not seem to fit the facts of the first half  of this year very well The story in the first half was not that of a significant slowdown in GDP  growth The economy grew at a 3-1/2 percent rate in the first half despite a subtraction of 2-1/2  percentage points stemming from the decline in net exports This GDP growth rate is only 1/4  percentage point slower than over 1997, and it is fully accounted for by the GM strike True,  growth was unbalanced in the first half in terms of the pattern of growth in the first and second    8/18/98  quarters, but this difference was almost entirely associated with the pattern of inventory  investment  The real story in the first half was that a stronger-than-expected advance in private  demand was offset by a sharper-than-expected decline in net exports, leaving GDP growth about  unchanged That outcome suggests at least a couple of questions First, why did private domestic  demand accelerate? Second, why should private domestic demand now weaken so sharply as in  the staff forecast when there are no multiplier-accelerator effects to speak of stemming from  slower growth in the first half? One piece, but only a piece, of the puzzle of the further  strengthening in private demand may be the same Asian turmoil that was reflected in the  sharper-than-anticipated decline in net exports That turmoil resulted in at least $3 of the per  barrel decline in oil prices and was accompanied by a shift in portfolio preferences in favor of  dollar-denominated assets that contributed to lower intermediate- and long-term interest rates in  the United States  But the key question in the forecast is, what will now induce a slower rate of economic  growth in the second half and into 1999? It is not the external drag The decline in net exports in  the second half is about half as sharp as in the first half, and the decline then halves again next  year Therefore, in order for GDP growth to moderate going forward, the slowing in domestic  demand must be aggressive enough to more than offset the diminishing external drag The  bottom line is that we need a story other than just external drag to explain the slowdown in GDP  growth going forward  Part of the story is clearly the stock market decline, but this is not enough The  FRB/US model forecast identifies a second key underpinning of the slowdown scenario, and one  that, I expect, is also a factor in the judgmental forecast I call it the "X" factor in that it slows    8/18/98  growth through gravity It reminds me of my defense of a forecast of a sharp decline in long-term  rates in 1993 When I was asked why long-term rates were headed lower, I responded that it was  because they were too high The FRB/US forecast talks of error correction rather than force of  gravity, but it's the same story Many private-spending components have expanded at a rate  above what that model and most other models predicted This was true by the way during 1997  but perhaps even more so during the first half of 1998 Now, these spending components are  projected to return to fundamentals, hence the economy slows There is nothing wrong with this  story, but it is not an overwhelmingly compelling one, especially in terms of the timing of the  slowdown As a result, I have some doubts about the degree of the slowdown in the staff forecast  The second major call in the staff forecast is for a reversal in the recent trend toward  faster increases in nominal compensation This is partly due to a rising unemployment rate and  partly to the pass-through of lower inflation expectations The case was quite carefully argued in  the Greenbook in terms of a range of forecasts from different wage-price models Again, such an  outcome is possible, but I remain skeptical  Given the uncertainty about the structure of the economy and the forecast going  forward, it is likely that collectively we will become more reactive in terms of policy response  This makes reading the inflation data for signs of a change in the underlying trend more  important But this also has become more difficult I have noted before, for example, that the  core CPI data hinted at a rebound in the underlying inflation rate based on three-month and  six-month inflation rates However, taking account of the last two months of CPI data, the  three-month inflation rate of core CPI has receded from above 2-1/2 percent to about 2 percent, very  much in line with the staff forecast for the second half of the year    8/18/98  The data for the chain measure of GDP prices show, in contrast, a remarkable slowing  in the rate of inflation The four-quarter rate of inflation for this measure has declined steadily  from 2 percent in the second quarter of last year to 1 percent in the second quarter of this year  The slowing in the quarterly inflation rates occurred quite abruptly in the third quarter last year  Inflation by this measure has now been near 1 percent for four consecutive quarters The  widening gap and different trends in the alternative measures of inflation are making our job of  reading inflation signals more challenging, but on balance they are showing few signs of building  inflation pressure  The last topic I want to comment on is the risk to the forecast Given the tightness in  the labor markets, the lack of compelling evidence of a persistent slowdown even to trend growth,  and the likelihood of some diminution in the favorable supply shocks, there remains a risk of  higher inflation going forward The other major risk is that of a still worse outcome from the  Asian turmoil The forecast embodies a sensible central tendency for this external effect It still  appears to me, however, that the possibilities relative to the central tendency are asymmetrical I  see more chance of a much worse outcome than a much more favorable one For this reason, I  believe the risks to the forecast have become more balanced than I viewed them earlier Thank  you   Thank you, Mr Chairman First, I strongly support your  recommendation for no change in policy at this meeting, but I want to focus my attention on the    8/18/98  issue of symmetry versus asymmetry In my view, the very tight labor markets impose a natural  asymmetry to policy in relation to growth prospects Specifically, a forecast of persistent  above-trend growth would, I believe, justify a tighter policy, but a forecast of modestly  below-trend growth would not immediately dictate an easier policy Instead, such a development  would help to unwind the very tight labor markets and contribute to a soft landing with maximum  sustainable growth and full employment This, I believe, is the foundation for the asymmetric  bias toward tighter policy that we have maintained since the March meeting I still believe that  very tight labor markets and likely growth near or above trend will ultimately dictate that the next  move for the funds rate will be up rather than down This balance of risks is best conveyed by the  current tilt in policy  But there is a second asymmetry in the outlook today This asymmetry relates to  probable outcomes versus central tendency forecasts for Japan and emerging economies in Asia  and elsewhere Relative to such a baseline forecast, there is in my view a considerably greater  risk of a much worse outcome in those economies than there is of a much more benign result I  see this downside risk of a worse case outcome in Asia, should it materialize, as likely to spread to  other emerging market economies and constituting the most serious threat to the US and the  global economies Such a worse case outcome does not have the highest probability, but it is the  most worrisome possibility that we face today On balance, therefore, I think a symmetric posture  is the best choice for now    I continue to favor immediate announcement of the tilt I thought Tom  Hoenig and Jack Guynn presented the arguments extremely well, and I believe Tom improved  the draft language a little I recognize that there is some danger that an immediate announcement  could reduce the use of the tilt However, if we are disciplined, we can avoid that and honestly  communicate to the public exactly how we assess the risks going forward That is what the tilt  does Releasing the minutes more quickly would be a further constructive step toward  incremental transparency, and I think doing that would be a good idea   Thank you, Mr Chairman What has changed between the last  meeting and today that could justify an easing? That clearly is the question of the day The  answer is not the initial conditions, in terms of very tight labor markets, nor the near-term pace  of the expansion Second-half GDP growth still looks to be close to trend, at least to my estimate  of trend That is, of course, a significant slowdown relative to the rate of growth in the first half,  but it is in line with earlier expectations and it will leave labor markets still very tight at the end  of this year Nor do I see anything in the most recent data relating to the strength of the  expansion to justify a change in policy The forecast? Well, that's a different story and that is  my point Any policy action today must be based squarely on and be defended in terms of the  forecast for 1999, specifically on the change in that forecast justified by recent developments  The staff did an excellent job of identifying and quantifying the effects of three recent  developments  The first is the downward revision to foreign growth due importantly to a downward  revision in growth prospects for Latin America The second is the sharper-than-anticipated  decline in equity prices that suggests a downward revision to consumer spending and quite likely  to business fixed investment and residential construction as well The third is a widening of risk  spreads and a generally reduced appetite for risk that might well have an incrementally adverse  effect on spending Taking the direct impacts of the first two, adding a smidgen for the difficult  to quantify latter factor, and then applying an appropriate multiplier gets me to something in the  range of a 3/4 percentage point downward revision to my growth forecast for 1999, albeit from a  somewhat higher initial forecast than that in the last Greenbook  The change in the forecast can perhaps best be understood by differentiating what I  call phase two of the global turmoil from phase one I date phase two from the Russian    9/29/98  moratorium and devaluation and the increased pressure on Latin American economies that  immediately followed Interestingly, phase two does not appear to have an especially adverse  effect in terms of its incremental effect on net exports, certainly when compared to the effect of  the crises among developing Asian economies and the deterioration of the Japanese economy  during phase one However, whereas phase one was accompanied by offsetting positive shocks  in the form of lower US interest rates stemming from safe-haven capital flows and lower oil  prices, phase two in contrast is accompanied by the reinforcing adverse effects of a decline in  equity prices and an increase in risk spreads as well as by a coincidental increase in oil prices due  to supply cutbacks A second likely difference is that whereas phase one was accompanied by an  unexpected and largely unexplained surge in private domestic demand, phase two will likely be  accompanied by a spontaneous unwinding of that exceptional strength  I have emphasized previously the distinction between central tendencies and  asymmetric risks in the current forecast, and I believe this aspect of the outlook is also relevant  to the policy decision I have to admit that when I hear someone say that the risks in their  forecast are asymmetric, my first inclination is to encourage them to rethink that forecast and  return when they have managed to produce one where the risks are symmetric I believe our  staff has followed this philosophy more than most forecasters They assume, for example, a  break in Brazil's exchange rate regime and a fairly sharp adjustment in growth in Latin America,  and they have a further decline in the stock market on top of the recent correction Nevertheless,  when there are potentially important one-sided discontinuities in the outlook, as I believe there  are today, risks can legitimately be asymmetric As a result, there could be an important  difference between the modal forecast--the best guess and the most likely outcome--and the  mean of the probability distribution of outcomes Both are relevant to the policy decision    9/29/98  On balance because my previous forecast for 1999 was not as pessimistic as that in the  August Greenbook, I end up with a somewhat higher growth forecast for 1999, even allowing for  a similar downward revision to growth But I do expect growth to be decidedly below trend next  year Given my expectation of somewhat faster growth than in the Greenbook and therefore a  slightly lower path for the unemployment rate, I anticipate a bit higher inflation than is projected  in the Greenbook However, I agree the weaker growth now in prospect and the projected rising  path of the unemployment rate should restrain inflation going forward The policy question, of  course, is whether the projected slowdown crosses the line from benign to undesirable I will  save that assessment for my policy statement   Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation of a 25 basis point cut  in the target federal funds rate As I noted earlier, an easing has to be justified as a preemptive  response to a significant change in the forecast In regard to that forecast, we have changes that  involve some combination of a lower central tendency for growth next year and wider downside  risks The question we face in reaching this decision is the location of the threshold where such  a projected slowdown crosses the line from being benign to becoming unacceptable There is no  question in my mind that a slowdown of the dimension projected by the staff meets that test It is    9/29/98  a closer call from the standpoint of my less pessimistic forecast, but taking into account my sense  of asymmetric downside risks, I believe an easing is clearly justified today An easing can be  viewed as either a step toward filling an expected hole in growth in 1999 and/or providing  insurance against a bad draw from the unpleasantly fat tail of the probability distribution of  outcomes An easing also can be justified in terms of the minimax framework I previously  suggested in relation to our March 1997 tightening We should look at each of our options, in  this case no change or an easing, and ask what would be the worst possible outcome under each  option Then, we should select the option that yields the least-worst outcome As I balance these  risks today, I am convinced that the greater danger comes from an unacceptably sharp decline in  growth and that an easing is therefore justified  The next question is the size of the move It is useful to make a provisional judgment  about the path of the funds rate in relation to the forecast The path of the funds rate should be  set so as to partially offset the projected slowing in growth in 1999 The objective is to leave  growth below trend next year so as to reverse in part the prevailing tightness of the labor market  and also to avoid overshooting in the year 2000 as foreign growth begins to recover The  magnitude and timing of the rate cuts in the Greenbook look about right based on the above  considerations relative to the Greenbook forecast Since my forecast is less pessimistic, I would  not want to move more aggressively than the funds rate path assumed in the Greenbook I also  agree with your recommendation of an asymmetric posture toward further easing In my view,  such a posture better reflects where we are, assuming that we implement a 25 basis point move  today I would favor that posture whether or not we were to announce it today   As we get under way with our F-6 study of systemic risk, I think this is  an important episode for us to study We are trying to decide what is systemic risk and what is  not--where we can draw the line I think we need some further analysis of this episode to help us  decide whether this was an appropriate involvement of the Federal Reserve There will always  be a matter of judgment involved, but this certainly was a close call We need to think about  that Secondly, we have the supervisory issue I think we are going to be called on to explain  whether or not our examinations and other sources of information provided us with what we  needed to know  There also is an issue that I would be remiss not to at least mention, namely that of  overseeing how these lending and investment decisions get made Rather well along in this  process, I was getting telephone calls from reporters who knew more about LTCM than I did I  don't think that was the way it should have been   Our committee will certainly be engaging in a broader dialogue with  all of you as we think about this    This is Larry Meyer Let me reinforce two themes that I think we have  heard mentioned several times While there may be some erosion on the margin in terms of the  very near-term outlook, there is not very much change in terms of the traditional ingredients that  go into our forecast, say for 1999, and no basis there for a material change in policy On the  other hand, we have to contrast developments in the real economy and those in the financial  markets There is a tension between them It may be that recent developments have increased  our perception of a wider deterioration in the functioning in the financial markets that goes  beyond simply the widening of risk spreads but now includes indications of illiquidity--market  participants not standing behind the bid-ask spreads as wide as they are It is very difficult to  translate all that into a revised forecast, but it adds a higher degree of uncertainty and reinforces  the sense of downside risks  With reference to other forecasts, I must say that for the first time I see a meaningful shift  in forecasts for 1999 after a long period of little change I think we are going to see those  forecasts converge down to something closer to the Greenbook, not to the Greenbook level but  toward it  My sense is that one of the problems is that we may not have conveyed as well as we  might have liked the message that we wanted to send at the last meeting That message I thought  was that we had a flexible policy, we recognized a significant change in the economic outlook,  and we responded accordingly I think our action was taken as something done grudgingly, and I  believe we might reduce some of that uncertainty in the markets by taking a further action at this  point Were we to do so, and since it would involve an intermeeting move, I would think that 25    10/15/98  basis points would be the right way to do it To me, if the story is that we feel we need to have a  lower federal funds rate in the first half of next year, it probably would be good to get there a  little faster than on the pace we might otherwise be on In addition, given the downside risks, I  would say that if I picked a number that I would like for the GDP growth rate next year, I would  snug it up a little closer to trend than I otherwise would because of the prevailing sense of  downside risks and discontinuities   I agree with the 25 basis point move in the funds rate In general I think  the discount rate should be moved in line with the funds rate I do not think of the discount rate  as anything other than complementing policy And since we recently narrowed the spread  between the two rates to 25 basis points from 50 basis points, it is very easy to justify a 50 basis  point move on the discount rate I guess that's where I would be    I want to join what seems to be the emerging consensus I, too, prefer  Option 2, and I would eliminate the sentence in question I don't think it adds anything, and  whatever is briefer and more to the point is better I also would echo the view that it would be  desirable for us to move at some point to the immediate release of this language after our  meetings Thank you   I think that President Poole is bringing up an extraordinarily good  point It is almost an embarrassment to use over and over a standard sentence that incorporates  an expectation that can only sometimes be right If we want to include this reference in the  directive, we should adjust it to reflect changes in the money growth forecast   As I listened to the discussion on TIPS and SOMA, I was struggling  with it for a while When I heard the Chairman's remarks, they seemed to summarize my views  just perfectly [laughter] because I wasn't quite sure where I would be Then when I heard  Governor Gramlich, I thought he really put it together very, very well [Laughter] On balance, I  think that it makes sense to treat them like other securities and to allow operations in TIPS as  well as other securities   Thank you, Mr Chairman Let me start off by focusing on what I  think has changed and what has remained the same in the outlook since the last meeting and  particularly since the intermeeting move First, the second half looks stronger, with growth at or  above trend This reflects both the surprise in third-quarter GDP and the general resilience in the  spending data Second, I think the forecast going forward has been bolstered by depreciation of  the dollar and particularly since our intermeeting move by the resurgence in equity prices and  some relaxation in financial stress Third, the announcement of the Brazil package and some  other developments in the international realm have added at least a bit of optimism that the worse  case scenario for global turmoil might be avoided    11/17/98  What has remained the same? I think the general answer is the qualitative forecast  going forward It still appears that growth will be clearly below trend next year, though some  modest upward revision along the lines of the Greenbook forecast appears justified It still  appears that inflation will remain well contained And it still appears that downside risks  predominate though perhaps less so than before I think the main difference is that there is  renewed appreciation of some upside risk going forward  Why so little change in the forecast? First, I think the upward revision to the third  quarter was concentrated so heavily in inventory investment that it is more likely to be reversed  than extrapolated going forward Second, the rebound in equity prices appears to be  incompatible with a forecast of slowing growth and declining profits, and therefore it also is  likely to be reversed going forward Third, while the depreciation of the dollar is certainly a  positive, its effect is offset by some further slowdown in foreign growth, as in the Greenbook  forecast Finally, while the financial stress has been partially unwound, financial conditions, at  least outside of equity markets, have nevertheless significantly deteriorated since July  Here is how I would characterize the broad qualitative features of the outlook First,  private domestic demand appears to have decelerated to about a 4 percent growth rate in the  second half from the 8 percent rate in the first half, returning to its average rate over the previous  two years This is very consistent with the gravity story that I told earlier A further slowing in  private domestic demand, as in the Greenbook forecast, toward roughly a trend rate over 1999  looks plausible This partly reflects a diminished stimulus from the wealth effect, assuming  equity prices do not rise further, and it reflects, in addition, the effect of the recent deterioration  in financial conditions along with the projected further correction in equity prices This spreads  the effects of global turmoil from the external to the domestic sector Given the slowdown in    11/17/98  private domestic demand, even the slower rate of decline in net exports over 1999 is enough to  push overall growth below trend The slowdown is reinforced over the next couple of quarters  by a reduction in inventory investment from its unsustainable third-quarter pace I think it is also  reasonable to anticipate that growth will rebound to about trend in the year 2000  I would put my best guess of growth next year just a shade higher than in the  Greenbook forecast, but I would also take into account the still asymmetric downside risk that I  see to that baseline in setting monetary policy I'm a little less optimistic about the course of  nominal wage change and a bit more concerned about the size and inflationary effect of the  depreciation of the dollar than is the Greenbook, but I still believe inflation will be well  contained  I think what we do at this meeting is a close call But were we to move one more  time, which I would support, it would seem to me that that would bring to a conclusion the  cumulative adjustment in monetary policy that seems appropriate in light of the discrete change  in the outlook that has occurred We should find some way to perhaps signal that as well Thank  you   Thank you, Mr Chairman It seems to me that we have been playing  catch-up to a discrete change in the outlook The question today is whether we have caught up,  and if not, whether we should complete the likely further move sooner rather than later It is  clear from the discussion around the table today that it is a close call On balance, my judgment  is that another quarter point move would complete what I think would be an appropriate  adjustment to the discrete change in the outlook Because the slowdown is projected to be  around the corner, a case can be made that the additional easing should be sooner rather than  later These considerations lead me to support your recommendation, Mr Chairman, to cut the  funds rate a quarter point today and return to a symmetric directive The move to a symmetric  directive signals the pause that I believe is in order after the move and highlights the possibility  that the move may have completed an appropriate response to the change in the outlook    Thank you, Mr Chairman Like most forecasters, I responded to the  downward revision in foreign growth prospects and the abrupt deterioration in domestic financial  conditions after midyear by revising down my expectations for US growth over 1999 Unlike  most forecasters, I was in the position to ratify my earlier forecast by participating in monetary  policy decisions to lower the funds rate by 75 basis points I appreciate being in this unique  position [Laughter]  But monetary policy actions have not been the only developments that have supported  an upward revision to expectations for growth next year Three other developments are of note  First, the stronger-than-anticipated growth in the second half, maintaining the continuous pattern  of positive demand surprises over the past three years, is evidence of continued resilience in  demand and suggests greater momentum going forward and upside risks to the forecast for next  year Second, the external drag from declining net exports appears to be diminishing faster than  expected After subtracting more than 2 percentage points from growth in the first half, net  exports appear to be subtracting only 1/2 percentage point in the second half Third, the  deterioration of financial conditions that seemed so worrisome a short time ago now appears less  so The equity market correction has simply disappeared While private risk spreads have  widened in the capital markets, the absolute level of private borrowing costs, weighted across    12/22/98 51  risk classes, is about what it was at the end of last year and only modestly above lows for the  year reached at about midyear  On balance, financial conditions, thanks in part to recent monetary policy actions,  continue to be supportive of growth going forward There are nevertheless plausible grounds for  projecting a slowing of growth The rationale for the slowdown is well presented in the  Greenbook, though it should be admitted that virtually all the arguments, including the  dissipation of the positive stimulus from the wealth effect, the dissipation of accelerator effects,  etc, were considerations that underpinned the projected slowdown for 1998  On balance, I expect growth to slow to about 2-1/4 percent in 1999 and I see a somewhat  better balance now in upside and downside risks I think the upside risks principally reflect the  experience of continued positive demand shocks that after some point make me wonder what we  might be missing about the fundamentals driving this expansion The downside risks have been  well discussed around this table They relate principally to Brazil, to questions about the  sustainability of current equity prices, and to other pressure spots in the world economy  Let me note two upside risks relative to the staff's inflation forecast As I have noted  at recent meetings, I find the Greenbook forecast of a slowing in nominal wage growth  somewhat aggressive The risk here can perhaps be seen by comparing the forecasts for nominal  wage change based on wage-price and wage-wage versions of the Phillips curve, two  specifications that are routinely tracked by the staff The forecasts for the wage-price  specification point to a slowing of nominal wage changes going forward--and perhaps a  significant slowing--as the response to the recent decline in inflation and the projected modest  rise in the unemployment rate dominate the effect of the prevailing low level of the  unemployment rate Some of the wage-price specifications indicate a slowing of as much as a    12/22/98 52  percentage point in the rate of nominal wage gains in 1999 On the other hand, the forecasts  from the wage-wage specifications suggest a sizable increase in the pace of nominal wage gains  going forward Both of these specifications have yielded similar errors over the past four years,  and they are now generating forecasts that differ by as much as 1-1/2 percentage points over 1999  I think this highlights the considerable uncertainty about inflation going forward  Second, the Greenbook allows for some diminution in the favorable factors that have  been suppressing inflation a reversal of declines in oil prices; some further depreciation of the  dollar; a reversal of the recent decline in non-oil commodity prices; and a faster pace of increase  in health care and health benefit costs The dissipation of the contribution from these special  factors is the basis for the convergence of actual to core inflation in the Greenbook forecast But  I am concerned that the projected rebounds in these components could result in somewhat higher  inflation than in the staff forecast and that in addition there is a particular upside risk from a  sharper-than-projected depreciation of the dollar Thank you   Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation for no change in the  funds rate target and to retain the symmetric posture for the policy directive I believe it is  sometimes useful to think about monetary policy in terms of the desired path for the growth of  output instead of the desired path for the funds rate The path of output for 1999 projected in the  Greenbook seems about ideal to me It shows a slowdown to below-trend growth, which I think  is very important, and some unwinding of the exceptional tightness now in labor markets but  leaving plenty of room, given the potential downside discontinuities in the forecast This means  that no policy action is warranted today and none would be warranted when and if the economy  slows to the projected path Looking beyond that, if we do not get a realization of those    12/22/98 68  downward discontinuities, I am struck by how brief the period of below-trend growth is in the  forecast and how modest the shortfall is relative to potential growth To me that means, after we  get a better sense that we have avoided these downward discontinuities, that we are going to  have to be very vigilant against potential upside risks to inflation going forward   I would delete the sentence in question in option 2, thereby going with  option 3 I would actually prefer to leave in the phrase "in coming months" in option 3 It goes  to the question of what we mean by symmetry and asymmetry Does it refer to the intermeeting  period or is it a statement about the balance of risks that we see that might influence when the  next move might occur over some reasonable forecast horizon? I like the broader context I  think that is what symmetry or asymmetry means Most importantly, it is not positioning  ourselves for either the intermeeting period or the next move but to provide some broader  concept of how we see the balance of risks  With respect to the last sentence, I would prefer to delete it because I don't think it has  to do specifically with the directive itself It could go elsewhere in any discussion of the  underlying forecast, but I don't think it belongs here   The decision is so clear from that discussion!   Mr Chairman, your proposal is a compromise that I can heartily  endorse Indeed, I think I would argue that it is better than either the status quo or at this point  going to the immediate release of the operating paragraph As you know, I have been an  advocate of the immediate release of the operating paragraph in general and the decision on the  tilt in particular But I also agree with you that a change like this should not be made unless  there is a stronger consensus than now exists  It seems to me that what your proposal does is that it respects the views of the majority  by affording an opportunity to make announcements about symmetry on those occasions when it  would be most constructive In that regard, this approach goes a long way toward fulfilling the    12/22/98 82  objectives that I have But it also respects the views of the minority by not making a formal  change in the operational procedures that cannot be easily reversed  And, as you also indicated, there is a chance to experiment Let's see what happens  Let's see how useful in practice these announcements are, and let's also get a feel for the degree  to which they affect the dynamics of our decisionmaking and consensus-building The  discussions we have had around this table over the last couple of meetings have given me a  better appreciation of the potential costs as well as the likely benefits of an immediate release  Given the uncertainty about this balance, I think your compromise is a perfect solution    I have a couple of questions First, on Chart 1, the inflation rate as   measured by the CPI goes up almost a percentage point over the forecast horizon In   your opening comments, Mike, you said that you were leaning toward giving somewhat   greater weight to labor market tightness in the inflation picture Yet, as I look at the   projected performance of the CPI, it seems to me that it is mostly driven by the   dissipation of the declines in energy prices The effect of labor market tightness is there   only marginally in the next year This year the labor market tightness is still being fully   offset by other forces Is that a fair statement?    I had a question, too, about Chart 10, entitled “US Current   Account Sustainability” You talked about the factors that have affected the   sustainability of the current account deficit since 1997, including the appreciation of the     2/2-3/99 37   dollar and the deterioration of external accounts It seems that many of these   developments reflected cyclical phasing and the crisis in Asia, for example  So, I am   wondering why at some point in the future--when the cycles in the United States, Japan   and Europe become more in phase and we get to the other side of the Asian crisis--we   won’t recoup some of the losses in the current account Are these transitory and related   to the cyclical crisis or are they long-term structural changes?    That’s a very good point Just one last comment I was a little   surprised in Chart 15 by the limited impact on inflation of whether there was a positive   demand surprise or a negative demand surprise The Taylor rule, with the exchange rate   consequences, just offsets that Was that not surprising to you?    Okay Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman The forecast revisions in the   Greenbook are very similar to my own and in my view constitute somewhat of a sea   change in the economic outlook It doesn’t seem to me that most of you share that view,   so let me explain why I think that is so Previously the Greenbook, the consensus   forecast, and my own forecast projected what I refer to as a reverse soft landing Growth   slowed to below trend and the unemployment rate gradually increased, unwinding some   of the exceptional tightness currently prevailing in labor markets and reducing the   inflation risk posed by the above-trend growth and the very tight labor markets The   revised forecast has the economy slowing, but now just toward trend And the result is   that the unemployment rate stabilizes at a lower level than for any quarter in the previous   Greenbook forecast   My first question is Should such a sea change in the outlook have a counterpart   in monetary policy?  When I talk about policy here, I really am not referring to the   targeted funds rate for the intermeeting period that we will talk about tomorrow I am   talking about policy in terms of the path of the funds rate that we think would be   consistent with our outlook over the next year or two and whether or not that should   change in light of the changed forecast     2/2-3/99 65   Let me just say a word about the inflation forecast It does not seem to have   changed dramatically, but it has changed a bit First of all, we have mainly what I call a   convergence story in 1999 That is, although core CPI does not really change, we have   an increase in both the overall inflation rate and in GDP chain inflation as these measures   converge toward more normal relationships to the core rate, with overall inflation rising   because of the dissipation of the favorable supply shocks, particularly in the energy area   But thereafter, with labor markets very tight, the Greenbook and my own forecast would   expect continued increases in inflation going forward I think that is what we have to   worry about   I pay a lot of attention to the policy prescriptions from the Taylor rule Sometimes   the different rules that are in the standard packet yield quite different implications for   policy Today, while they offer a variety of prescriptions for the current rate setting,   there is one commonality Whether one looks at the CPI or the chain GDP price version,   at the versions with imposed or estimated coefficients or with the backward- or forward-  looking specification, the prescription for the federal funds rate in the current quarter is   higher than the prevailing target For example, it ranges from 51 to 63 percent for the   rules with imposed coefficients   So, I ask myself How have we ended up departing so aggressively from the   Taylor rule prescriptions? First, we hesitated to tighten in the face of global instability   following the crisis in Korea and then again following the turbulence after the   devaluation and default by Russia But neither of those events to date has slowed the   expansion Second, our forecast generally called for a slowing to trend growth just   around the corner, so we waited for the spontaneous slowdown rather than imposing a   policy-induced slowdown Of course, while we waited for the slowdown, continued   above-trend growth kept pushing the unemployment rate lower until we ended up at a   4¼ percent unemployment rate And now we find ourselves at that rate with one of the   highest Greenbook growth forecasts in some time and many other forecasts also are   pointing to relatively robust growth Another reason we have ended up there certainly is   the possibility of a structural change suggested by the combination of declining inflation   along with a declining unemployment rate That provided a good reason for not slavishly   following any historical regularity     2/2-3/99 66   Let me end with a suggestion on how we might want to think about the strategy of   monetary policy going forward We ought to follow and think about what I refer to as an   incremental asymmetric Taylor rule To start off, I would consider setting the initial   specification of that Taylor rule by calculating what NAIRU would have to be to make   the current setting of the funds rate the Taylor rule prescription The answer is that in the   Taylor Rule with imposed coefficients, the NAIRU would have to be about 4½ percent I   think that is very much on the low side, but some might find it a plausible number That   is fine It seems to me that going forward we should at the very least follow the Taylor   rule incrementally, raising the funds rate if continued above-trend growth was pushing   the unemployment rate even lower That is, going forward we should be careful to begin   again to lean against a cyclical wind; otherwise we will continue to accommodate and   indeed reinforce any and all positive demand shocks   On the other hand, if the unemployment rate were to rise modestly, given its   already very low level, I would resist easing immediately Hence the asymmetry in my   approach If inflation increases--and here I mean  increases in the core CPI rather than a   convergence of the overall rate to the core CPI--then I think we should respond as in the   Taylor rule with more than proportionate increases in the nominal funds rate On the   other hand, if inflation declines modestly further, I would passively accept an increase in   the real federal funds rate in light of the very low level of the prevailing unemployment   rate That again is an asymmetric response  So, I offer that as food for thought as we   turn to discuss policy strategy in more detail tomorrow    When I think about the inflation process and the inflation   dynamic, I always point to two things excess demand and special factors I don’t know   any other way to think about the proximate sources of inflation When I think about   excess demand, I think about NAIRU If we eliminate NAIRU and that concept of   excess demand, it moves us into very dangerous territory with monetary policy   I would remind you that in the 20 years prior to this recent episode, the Phillips   curve based on NAIRU was probably the single most reliable component of any large-  scale forecasting model It was very useful in understanding the inflation episode over   that entire period Certainly, there is greater uncertainty today about where NAIRU is,   but I would be very cautious about prematurely burying the concept     2/2-3/99 119   I was also surprised to hear how many people believe that special factors--the   appreciation of the dollar, health care cost developments, and so forth, which I feel have   been so important over this recent episode--have been so immaterial in their views of   inflation Declines in oil prices from $26 to $12 per barrel seem to me quite relevant in   understanding the recent inflation experience So, I think we have to keep some balance   in this   Even if productivity growth has moved upward, we know it has been above trend   because we know the unemployment rate has been declining So I come back to my story   about the incremental Taylor rule If you think NAIRU is as low as 4½ percent, fine   But that still means to me that if the economy is growing above trend, there is a   considerable prospect that it will continue to do so and that we should put some discipline   in monetary policy by leaning against the cyclical winds Otherwise, every time there is   an upside demand shock, we will allow monetary growth to accelerate to accommodate it   and wait for the day of reckoning   In terms of symmetry and asymmetry, the risks seem reasonably balanced around   trend growth Does that mean we should have a symmetric or an asymmetric directive?   The problem I have is that I believe the initial conditions are such that we are already   operating beyond the point of sustainability in labor markets If we have balanced risks   around trend growth, that tells me that we should have an asymmetric directive Growth   a little lower than trend would not call for any easing of monetary policy, but any growth   above trend would call for a tightening of monetary policy   Mr Chairman, I can certainly accept your recommendation and wait a little longer   on the asymmetry story But I hope some of these concerns will be reflected in your   testimony Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman The staff’s revised forecast   features once again an upward revision to growth and a downward revision to inflation   and hence a more favorable outcome for 1999 than was projected in the last Greenbook   Nevertheless, the staff forecast raises an important question for monetary policy going   forward How will the economy make a successful transition to sustainable growth and   labor market equilibrium without an unacceptable increase in inflation?  The forces that   threaten to raise inflation over the forecast horizon are the prospect of a dissipation of   favorable supply shocks and the expected persistence of very tight labor markets Of   course, the staff forecast may be wrong and inflation may continue to decline For my   part, I admit that to date I have not been able to retire from my discussions of economic   performance the phrase “stronger-than-expected growth and lower-than-expected   inflation” Nevertheless, if one accepts the staff forecast, and I do, then it seems to me   they have asked the right policy question and left it to us to answer it   The key to the outlook in the context of monetary policy, therefore, is not the   blissful state projected for 1999 but the pattern of rising inflation, especially in 2000, and   the prospect of further increases thereafter based on the continued labor market tightness     3/30/99 37   at the end of the forecast horizon The key policy question, therefore, is whether and   when to adjust policy to improve the prospects of a better outcome in 2000 and beyond   It is hard to make such a policy adjustment appear urgent today and, indeed, it is not But   I hope we can focus attention today less on the decision about what the target funds rate   should be during the period from March 30 to May 18, 1999, and more on whether and   when an adjustment in policy might be appropriate in light of the forecast through 2000   I would also note that if a tighter policy appears justified, it might be better to move in   that direction sooner, while the economy is still growing above trend, than later when   growth may already have slowed spontaneously to below trend I accept in broad outline   and in most details the staff forecast for growth over the forecast horizon, assuming   unchanged policy The key developments recently have been stronger-than-expected   momentum in domestic demand in the first quarter, partially offset by sharper-than-  expected declines in net exports and more-moderate-than-expected inventory building   But the upward revision to GDP growth and the more favorable mix of GDP projected   for the first quarter provide two reasons to expect stronger second-quarter growth relative   to the last forecast stronger momentum in demand and a positive contribution from   inventory building   My main quibble with the staff forecast relates to the further upward revision   to their estimate of trend productivity growth That revision, though small, lowers the   staff inflation forecast by perhaps as much as ¼ percentage point by the end of 2000 As   a result, I am a little more pessimistic than the staff about the inflation outlook in 2000   and beyond But the key to the inflation forecast is that the initial conditions--the very   tight labor markets--would make it very difficult to avoid a significant increase in   inflation without an adjustment to policy, even if the economy were to slow to trend   immediately   To put into perspective the implications of the initial conditions in the staff   forecast, let me pose the following question How well will we take advantage of the   extraordinary disinflationary forces during this expansion, given the staff forecast or my   slightly more pessimistic scenario, in order to lower the underlying inflation trend going     3/30/99 38   forward? Another way of asking this question is To what degree will the current   episode be an example of opportunistic disinflation?  Inflation measured by the core CPI   was 31 percent over 1995 before the coincidence of favorable inflation developments   impacted the economy How much will we lower inflation over the expansion from this   point with the help of the extraordinary disinflationary forces that are so clearly   important?   Let’s take the staff forecast first To put inflation on a methodologically   consistent basis, I add 06 percentage point to their estimate of 25 percent for the core   inflation rate over the year 2000 So the staff’s forecast says that we have not lowered   the underlying inflation rate at all We get the same conclusion if we use the GDP chain   measure of inflation Of course, inflation is rising at the end of the forecast period, so we   can infer that before this expansion is over inflation actually will have increased despite   the extraordinary disinflationary forces at work   In my forecast, the latter outcome is more evident and emerges earlier What   is driving this outcome?  Blessed with a combination of positive supply shocks and   supply-enhancing structural changes, monetary policy is the critical factor shaping how   the benefits of these developments are shared between higher output and lower inflation   during the expansion and, therefore, how they will affect the underlying trend of inflation   beyond this expansion To date their benefits have been split between higher output and   lower inflation However, in the process--in the staff’s judgment and mine as well--we   have allowed the economy to move beyond its sustainable capacity The low overall CPI   inflation during the period of supply shocks will be partly reversed as the supply shocks   dissipate That is an important part of the inflation story this year And the benefits of a   possible upward shift in the productivity trend itself are transitory, unless taken   advantage of by monetary policy   To be sure, recent economic developments have been exceptional It has been   a wonderful ride, and we have all enjoyed it But we will ultimately be graded--and   indeed we will grade ourselves--on the effect of current policy on the inflation trend in   coming years Might we not achieve a higher grade on the final exam by accepting a less     3/30/99 39   exceptional growth performance in the near term?  That is the question we have to   answer in coming months    Thank you, Mr Chairman I can support your recommendation   for no change in the federal funds rate target today In my view, however, monetary   policy should be biased toward tightening going forward Let me explain why and then   confront the issue of whether or not a move to an asymmetric bias should be made and   announced at this meeting   I think there are three important considerations that relate to possible   adjustments in monetary policy in the period ahead First, there is the reassessment issue,   which the Chairman articulated very clearly in his Humphrey-Hawkins testimony That   is, given what I see as an improvement in financial market conditions and given a   significant upward revision in our forecast compared to what it was at the time we     3/30/99 65   implemented the recent easing, we need to reassess whether the full amount of that easing   is still justified   Second, and here is where I place most of my emphasis, there is the question   of how policy should respond to developments going forward, specifically to changes in   the unemployment rate and inflation I suggested at the last meeting that we follow a   strategy that I call an incremental asymmetric Taylor rule This is a policy that is not   forward-looking but reactive; it responds not only to changes in inflation, but also to   changes in the unemployment rate Following the strategy would entail raising the real   federal funds rate in response to declines in the unemployment rate and to increases in   inflation Based on the staff forecast, following such a strategy would indeed result in an   increase in the federal funds rate over the next year   Third, there is the question of how monetary policy should respond if there is   in fact an acceleration in productivity growth under way This is an issue that the staff   has addressed recently and that President Broaddus talked about today I think the   conclusion that we reached in that analysis is that such acceleration in productivity   growth raises the equilibrium real interest rate of the economy and requires, in order to   maintain an unchanged stance of monetary policy, an increase in the real federal funds   rate   Governor Kelley along with the Chairman made a persuasive case,   nevertheless, for not changing the policy bias at this meeting given prevailing   international tensions and the prospect that the first announcement of such a change in   the tilt could produce a particularly large financial market response So I can accept the   Chairman’s recommendation for continuing the symmetric posture under these   circumstances with the understanding, as I’m sure we all agree, that this is no obstacle to   changing policy going forward     Thank you, Mr Chairman I continue to be impressed by the   recent exceptional growth in productivity The case for an increase in trend productivity   growth is now more compelling after the strength in productivity over the last five   quarters--and especially after the last two quarters--than it was based on the data for 1996   and 1997 And I believe the staff’s pattern of incremental upward steps in trend   productivity growth makes sense, with some acceleration in productivity beginning in   late 1995 and a further acceleration in 1998 My problem with the staff forecast is that its   projection of a 2¼ percent productivity trend over the forecast period is just too   aggressive for my taste This revision to the productivity forecast basically drives their   entire forecast It allows a significant upward revision in growth over the two-year   horizon with little effect on the unemployment rate and, hence, on inflation   It is important to note, however, as the Greenbook makes very clear, that the   revision of the productivity trend delays but does not remove the day of reckoning that is   still implicit in the staff forecast It is interesting that this “day of reckoning” seems to   have become the theme of this meeting The tight labor market gets still tighter The   favorable price shocks are still dissipating further  Ultimately, the very tight labor   markets and the dissipation of supply shocks put inflation on an upward trend This is an   important message Growth does not cause inflation; excessive utilization rates do But   another unexpected shift in the productivity trend, as assumed in the Greenbook, imparts     5/18/99 49   another disinflationary bonus and allows rapid growth to be accommodated for a while   longer with relatively stable inflation   My less optimistic assessment of the underlying productivity trend essentially   moves forward in time the rise in inflation that current initial conditions make so likely I   do believe that we are at an important turning point in this episode Inflation, after falling   throughout the last few years, is stabilizing in the near term, I believe, and is poised to   move higher going forward That’s how I read the recent CPI data   The continued favorable financial conditions and high level of consumer   confidence are helping to sustain robust demand While I still expect growth to slow   somewhat going forward, I believe it is more likely that growth will be above trend than   below trend in the near term, and that growth will not spontaneously slow enough over   the forecast horizon to prevent a rising trend in inflation   It might be useful to recall the forecast that motivated the easings in monetary   policy last fall At our September meeting, the staff projected a 12 percent growth rate   in 1999, assuming an easing in monetary policy  The current staff forecast has growth   almost three times as fast The unemployment rate by this point was projected to be   4¾ percent, ½ percentage point above where it is today It was projected to rise toward   5½ percent by the end of 2000, 1¼ percentage points above the current forecast And   equity prices have rebounded by about 40 percent from their trough in early October To   be fair, the other major developments since the September forecast were the much-  sharper-than-expected increase in productivity growth in 1998 and the upward revision to   trend productivity going forward Productivity growth over 1998 turned out to be almost   double what the staff projected at the September meeting--27 percent versus 15 percent   And the trend productivity assumption is ½ percentage point higher now in the staff   forecast than the 1¾ percent assumed at the time of the September meeting   One question we have to ask is whether we have become sufficiently   optimistic about the productivity trend going forward to justify keeping in place the full   amount of the decline in the federal funds rate that was motivated by a forecast that has   since been so significantly revised and by a set of financial conditions that have so   dramatically improved The second question we have to ask is whether we should   maintain the current policy setting for the funds rate if growth continues strong and labor     5/18/99 50   markets tighten further while inflation remains steady in the near term and is projected to   increase thereafter I will pick up from here in my policy position statement    Thank you, Mr Chairman I support your recommendation for   no change in the federal funds rate target and enthusiastically support your recommenda­  tion for a move to an asymmetric directive that would be announced after the conclusion   of this meeting The balance of risks in my view is toward continued strong growth,   possibly even tighter labor markets, and ultimately higher inflation As other members of     5/18/99 62   the Committee have noted, a case could be made for an increase in the funds rate to   reverse some of our easing during the fall in light of the upward revision to the forecast   and the improvement in financial conditions since that time It is especially important in   my view for us to respond to any further tightening in labor markets or to any increase in   inflation because I believe the unemployment rate is more likely to decline than to rise in   the near term And because I think it is more likely that inflation will be rising rather   than falling over the next several months and quarters, I believe an asymmetric directive   is appropriate at this time   Long-term interest rates have risen in response to the Chairman’s recent speech   and in response to the recent CPI and industrial production data Some might argue that   this rise in long-term interest rates alone provides a desired restraint and removes the   necessity of Fed action However, the rise in long-term interest rates reflects the   expectation of bond market participants that monetary policy will tighten in the not too   distant future, presumably in response to the considerations that I have just outlined The   bond market is in effect pricing in relation to the market forecast and our perceived   policy reaction function Such preemptive pricing in the bond market is in my view   desirable and stabilizing, but it will occur only if we consistently ratify the expectations   on which it is based when those expectations match our own   There has been some concern that the first time we move to a bias and   announce the change will have an unusually large effect on the market But today’s   meeting provides an opportunity to implement such a move with a relatively modest   effect precisely because the bond market has already priced in some expectation of a   near-term policy move While there is very little or no expectation of a change in the   federal funds rate target at today’s meeting, financial market participants are to an   important degree expecting the FOMC to move to an asymmetric directive In fact, I   would expect that the response to no announcement, which might be viewed by the   market as implying that there was no change in the bias, might be greater than the   response to an announcement of a change in the bias Thank you     That will be difficult!   I read the incoming data on demand and production as generally consistent with a   slowdown to about trend growth in the second quarter but not at all definitive on whether   we are in the process of a more sustained slowdown from the 4 percent rate of growth   experienced over the last three years   On the inflation front, the last CPI report reduced concern that we are already   seeing a move toward higher inflation But the recent pattern in CPI reports is consistent,   in my view, with the interpretation that core inflation has now stabilized and that,   therefore, the best inflation news is behind us Concern that we may, in addition, be   poised for an uptrend in inflation going forward comes mainly from the labor market,   where there are some hints that demand pressures are now beginning to be felt in wage   changes This is the tone of the Beigebook We also have the upward revision to the   average hourly earning series and the rebound in the 3- and 6-month rates of increase in   average hourly earnings in the last several months relative to the 12-month increase,   following a period of deceleration On top of this are reports of higher health insurance   costs that are expected to boost the employer benefits component of the ECI going   forward   The change in the Greenbook forecast, while not dramatic, certainly is in the   direction of supporting the case for a higher federal funds rate target While I thought the     6/29-30/99 58   rhetoric of the Greenbook was modified somewhat more than the forecast, I appreciated   both changes The 04 percentage point increase in core CPI in 2000 relative to 1999, the   27 percent core CPI inflation rate in the fourth quarter of 2000, and the momentum   toward still higher inflation thereafter are the central stories in the Greenbook This is   consistent with my own concerns   Now, at Humphrey-Hawkins meetings, the staff also offers an extended forecast   This puts us in a better position to consider the longer-run path of monetary policy that is   consistent with our policy objectives, rather than focusing exclusively on the decision   about the target for the funds rate between today and the next FOMC meeting This also   provides an opportunity to consider the inflation risks associated with initial conditions in   terms of current utilization rates and the prevailing momentum in economic growth   Let me note some of the important features of this extended forecast Despite the   50 basis point tightening over the Greenbook horizon and the cumulative 150 basis point   tightening over the extended forecast horizon, inflation moves up measurably And the   rise in inflation may be steeper than it appears on the surface The reference price index   is the PCE, which has been running and is expected to continue to run about ¾   percentage point below the CPI The rise in the PCE inflation rate from just below 1½   percent this year to just above 2 percent by 2001 and to a peak later of about 2½ percent   translates into an increase in core CPI from 2 percent over the last 12 months to about 2¾   percent in 2001 and a peak of around 3¼ percent Add another 06 to 07 to put this   number on a methodologically consistent basis with a 31 percent increase in core CPI   over 1995 I think this helps to underscore the point I made at the last meeting That   there is a danger that we could squander a most extraordinary set of disinflationary forces   over the last several years and allow this episode to be a transition to higher rather than   lower inflation   The Greenbook forecast and my own, of course, reflect key assumptions about   trend growth and NAIRU Our forecasts have admittedly been very poor over the last   few years There is no question that there is an unusual degree of uncertainty on all   counts But the reasonable possibility of a significant rise in inflation is a concern that I   will weigh in my monetary policy position tomorrow morning    Mr Chairman, I strongly support your views on this Another   consideration, given the importance of the monetary aggregates in our decisionmaking, is   the less said about them the better [Laughter]    Could I ask about the change in the saving rate and the   equilibrium interest rate that you talked about in the earlier portion of your remarks?   Your comments seemed to imply that you do not perceive the current saving rate as the   ultimate equilibrium rate and that you believe saving is going to move back toward the   equilibrium rate I’m wondering if that’s really true As I look at the extended   simulations--and I can’t be sure of the data that I have--that’s not the story I see To me   the story in the extended simulations is that we have a decline in the wealth-to-income   ratio and that the decline in that ratio leads to the readjustment of the saving rate So it’s   really a question of whether the equity market is in equilibrium today If the equity   market isn’t in equilibrium today, as it moves back into equilibrium it brings about that   change in the saving rate Is that what’s going on?    What about the equilibrium interest rate?  We had some   discussions previously about the role of the increase in the productivity trend in raising   the equilibrium real interest rate It levels out but at a higher level    How do we sort that out in terms of what happens to the   equilibrium rate when all is said and done?    Okay    Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman The Greenbook forecast, which is not   far from either the consensus forecast or my own, suggests that we will not be able to   stabilize inflation at an acceptable rate without multiple tightening moves Given the risk   of higher inflation, the 50 basis point tightening this year that is incorporated into the   Greenbook forecast would in my view be prudent and appropriate That would mean   doing the 25 basis points today and another 25 basis points later in the year, subject to the   condition that data in the interim do not disconfirm the need for a second move I believe   there are few risks of moving in this direction, given the strength of the economy today,   initial conditions in terms of labor market tightness, and our ability to reverse course if   necessary There is, on the other hand, considerable risk in doing nothing This is   another example of the maximin strategy Consider the worst outcomes under various   policy alternatives and select the policy with the least bad outcome Mr Chairman, you   talked about the possibility that productivity is still accelerating, and that might be the   case If it is, I expect it also means that the equilibrium real interest rate is rising as well;   and in that case it seems to me that there is little damage to be done by such a modest   increase in interest rates   I want to spend some time talking about policy rules and the issue of how to   operate with uncertainty about the measurement of the output gap The papers that were   prepared for this meeting were, I think, very provocative and interesting and deserve   some comments   The policy prescription from the simple Taylor rule would yield a more   aggressive near-term tightening than the one I suggested But a similar trajectory over   time is in the Greenbook in the extended forecast The policy called for under the Taylor   rule would fall into two phases The first phase would be what I’d call the reassessment   or the releveling phase That is, the rule would call for immediately reversing at least the   easings of last fall for a return to the prescribed path for the target funds rate The second   phase would be in response to changes in the unemployment rate and the inflation rate   going forward     6/29-30/99 94   Now, the Orphanides et al work on uncertainty about the output gap suggests   attenuating, though not eliminating, the response of the funds rate to changes in the   output gap It suggests, therefore, only a partial return to the level-based Taylor rule   prescription, but would yield the same “phase two” increase in the funds rate in response   to higher inflation The conclusion in these papers that policymakers should downweight   their response to changes in the output gap in the face of uncertainty about its   measurement is both very intuitive and very sensible But there is a difference, as   emphasized in these papers, between downweighting the response to the output gap and   ignoring the output gap altogether This is the difference between uncertainty and total   ignorance   I would note also that the Orphanides, et al prescription is symmetric For those   inclined to applaud the downweighting of the output gap at the current policy decision   point, keep in mind that the same logic implies that we should also respond by less to   increases in the unemployment rate as the economy weakens We can’t have it both   ways--to be aggressive to a weakening in the economy and passive to a strengthening   unless, of course, we want to guarantee higher inflation over time   These papers highlight very effectively the importance of flexibility in using   policy rules Policy rules are best used to inform judgment, not to displace judgment At   times we might be willing to respond to the data; at times we will want to respond to the   forecast Sometimes we may have the confidence to implement level-based rules;   sometimes we may want to be more cautious along the lines of change rules Whether   we’re prepared to be more aggressive or more cautious in responding to changes in the   output gap may also depend upon initial conditions, in particular where we are relative to   the range of estimates of the output gap   The question remains how to apply the insights from this work I don’t find   appealing the change or growth rule offered by Orphanides It suggests that we raise the   funds rate when growth is above trend, then lower the funds rate when growth falls back   to trend Given that the underlying model implies that inflation depends on utilization   rates and not growth, the change rule does not seem like a sensible strategy to me It   implies raising the funds rate when the utilization rate is rising, then lowering the funds     6/29-30/99 95   rate when the utilization rate stabilizes at the higher level The problem is that it’s   difficult to design a sensible rule in the face of uncertainty if constrained to linear rules   The rule I suggested at previous meetings is a nonlinear one It allows for a   downweighting of the response to the output gap when the gap is in a range around the   best estimate, but for a sharper response once the gap has increased to the point where   one is more confident that the economy has moved beyond the level of sustainable   capacity This is consistent with the sensible view that we should be cautious about fine-  tuning, interpreted to mean aggressive responses to small changes relative to our targets   But we should recognize the gains of “crude-tuning,” interpreted as more aggressive   responses to changes in output once output has moved farther away from the target   Applying this nonlinear rule to today’s decisions would imply returning toward, but not   all the way to, the simple Taylor rule prescription A 50 basis point increase in the funds   rate implemented over the next few meetings would, for example, be consistent with a   halving of the response parameter of the output gap in a simple Taylor rule But my   nonlinear rule would also call for returning to a more aggressive response to further   increases in the output gap going forward, given that the unemployment rate is already so   low relative to estimates of NAIRU A 25 basis point move today could be viewed as a   partial reversal of the ease that was implemented last fall, in effect a partial return to a   level-based Taylor rule This is also consistent with a preemptive effort to limit the   upward trend in inflation that appears likely to emerge going forward   Let me emphasize a consideration favoring the second move, if it’s to be made, at   the next meeting or two as opposed to later in the year My presumption is that we will   be disinclined to tighten after October through the end of the year because of possible   volatility in financial markets related to Y2K and to shifts in the demand for liquidity   While a move in November is certainly not out of the question, I suspect we will be   reluctant to take such action   Now, I think the decision about whether or not to retain an asymmetric directive   today is somewhat less important in light of the fact that there will be an announcement,   presumably, if we raise the funds rate We can use this announcement to convey our   sense of the balance of risks Nevertheless, I have a preference for an asymmetric   directive     6/29-30/99 96   Let me note, however, that I think we are likely to encounter problems whether   we opt for a symmetric or an asymmetric directive  If we return to a symmetric directive,   the markets are likely to interpret today’s move as the one and only one that we expect to   make this year, unless they doubt we really mean a symmetric directive As a result,   market participants will revise downward their expectations about the funds rate in   coming months, resulting in a rally in the bond and equity markets I would prefer a   more market neutral result We could try to achieve this by combining a symmetric   directive with asymmetric language in the announcement, but that seems destined to look   confused as well as to confuse   If we choose an asymmetric directive, on the other hand, we could feed the   anxiety in the markets about an even larger set of increases than the 50 basis points I   expect to be appropriate In addition, we want to keep our options open for a further rate   increase as we assess the data over the next couple of months, rather than definitively   signal that it’s a sure thing   My preference is for an asymmetric directive with a somewhat calming   announcement, followed by a return to a symmetric directive after the second move--if   we opt for a second move This has the advantage of conveying the most useful   information to the markets about our intentions and of being truthful An added benefit is   that moving to a symmetric directive after the second move would be a very effective   way of signaling that we do not expect further near-term moves It would be less   informative if we moved to a symmetric directive today and then raised rates in August   or October     Thank you, Mr Chairman I read the recent data as consistent with a   continued momentum in aggregate demand that is likely to support growth at or above trend   in the period immediately ahead and maintain very tight labor markets I see core inflation   stabilizing amid signs of a dissipation or reversal of many of the favorable supply shocks   that have contributed to low and declining inflation over the last couple of years and   stirrings, perhaps, of higher wage gains This sets the stage for a test of the role of tight   labor markets on inflation going forward I expect we all look forward to learning a little   more about just how new the new economy really is The story in the Greenbook--and one   that I can definitely relate to--is that the dissipation or reversal of favorable supply shocks,   including the stabilization in trend productivity growth, will allow the effects of prevailing   tightness in the labor market to show through We will maintain growth at near trend over   the forecast horizon with gradual upward pressure on inflation The result is a core inflation   rate that in the Greenbook forecast moves from about 2 percent recently to 2¾ percent by   the end of next year, with the momentum pointing to a further increase in 2001, even   allowing for two ¼ point tightening moves An interesting feature of the forecast is that the   initial step-up to a 2½ percent rate is already in train and is reflected in the quarterly data in   the forecast for the fourth quarter In addition, the 2¾ percent rate at the end of 2000 would   be higher on a methodologically consistent basis than the core CPI inflation rate over the   year 1995, before the coincidence of powerful disinflationary forces took hold   One of the issues that we face and will continue to face in our policy deliberations is   how much to take into account a forecast of rising inflation as opposed to the realization of   utilization and inflation rates going forward That is, how proactive and forward-looking   are we prepared to be in light of uncertainties about the structure of inflation dynamics and   the poor forecasting record of recent years?   Let me point out, relative to the Greenbook baseline forecast, a couple of   contingencies that I think are particularly important and deserve mention--that is, a   correction in equity prices and a sharper-than-projected decline in the dollar The   combination in the Greenbook forecast of a tightening monetary policy, slowing growth,   rising inflation, and a declining dollar appears to raise the potential for an equity market   correction However, I certainly would not want to temper a tightening of monetary policy   by relying on an expected equity market correction to slow growth Rather, we have to be     8/24/99 67   prepared to adjust monetary policy in light of how overall financial conditions evolve in   response to our policy actions   I read the Greenbook as suggesting that the staff has an asymmetric probability   distribution with respect to the exchange rate, with a much greater chance of a lower than a   higher exchange rate evolving over the forecast horizon Given the difficulty in forecasting   exchange rates and particularly timing the effect on exchange rates of a large and widening   current account deficit, the best way to handle the situation may be, as the staff has done, by   providing an alternative simulation with a sharper decline of the dollar But the recent   upside surprises to foreign growth and the high and rising US current account deficit   should weigh heavily on the dollar going forward This may temper any slowdown in 2000   and reinforce upward pressure on inflation Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman I support your recommendation for a ¼   point increase in the funds rate and the continuation of the symmetric directive I want to   focus a bit, though, on the issue of whether we need not just a symmetric directive, but a   “truly symmetric” directive And I’m going to give a contrary perspective The bond     8/24/99 83   markets today still have the expectation built in that if we move today, it won’t be our final   move--that there are still further, though modest, increases coming down the road I don’t   think it would be particularly useful to use the directive and our announcement to remove   that expectation from the bond market Indeed, I think it is a very reasonable expectation It   involves the same kinds of considerations that we have talked about around this table   There is a lot of momentum in the economy Labor markets are very tight The supply   shocks are beginning to dissipate So, I think the task we have before us is a rather difficult   one We need to combine the rate move, the tilt, and the announcement so as not to put into   place expectations of an immediate move--keep our options open to be sure--but not to   squeeze out of the markets what I think is a very sensible and rational expectation right now   I think we should try to be market neutral   Now, one reason that I support the symmetric directive is the reason that Presidents   Poole and Moskow and others have noted Right now we have the problem that symmetry   and asymmetry seem to mean different things to different members of this Committee   Until we solve our internal problem, it is very difficult to communicate our intentions to the   public effectively So, first things first During the interim while we clean this up, I think   we have to be more reluctant to use changes in the tilt and, if possible, stick with a   symmetric directive But again, the challenge is how to balance that approach with the   announcement so as not to convey an incorrect set of expectations about our policy   intentions going forward     Thank you, Mr Chairman I agree with Governor Kelley that today’s   decision is especially challenging The recent data for compensation and core CPI have been   remarkably benign On that basis it would appear to be a reach to argue that there is an urgency to   tighten But the Greenbook tells a different story, one in which the interactions of tight labor   markets, above-trend growth in the near term, and the dissipation or reversal of favorable supply   shocks result in a steady rise in inflation over the forecast period The challenge in our policy   decision today is to reflect our assessment of the balance of risks appropriately In my view, those   risks are tilted toward rising inflation   The inflation news has been so remarkably good in terms of both compensation and core   prices that it’s easy to lose sight of a key reality Overall CPI inflation is projected to increase by   almost 1¼ percentage points this year relative to last year This contrasts with a decline of about ½   percentage point in overall CPI inflation last year compared to the previous year This year   nominal compensation gains have been restrained by last year’s decline in overall inflation Next   year, in contrast, compensation will be boosted by the rebound in overall inflation this year This   development highlights what may be a fundamental change in the inflation environment Instead   of lower inflation blunting the force of low unemployment rates on nominal wage changes, rising   inflation going forward is likely to reinforce the effects of tight labor markets on nominal   compensation gains The Greenbook inflation story has many chapters I’m in broad agreement   with both the qualitative themes and the quantitative implications     10/5/99 41   By my count there are nine factors that contribute to higher inflation in this forecast (1)   tight labor markets today; (2) tighter labor markets around the corner; (3) rising capacity utilization   rates; (4) a rebound in nonoil import prices; (5) the secondary effects of the sharp rise in energy   prices this year; (6) a rebound in benefit costs; (7) an increase in the minimum wage; (8) an upward   trend in nonoil commodity prices; and (9) the stabilization in trend productivity growth There is   an important partial offset from an assumed declined in energy prices over next year and the   following year But the cards seem stacked To be sure, this is just a forecast You might say,   “Been there, done that!” [Laughter] Maybe productivity will accelerate further; I cannot rule that   out Maybe NAIRU is even lower than the staff estimate; it could be   But I find the Greenbook story line compelling If it is wrong, it is likely to be a matter of   degree rather than direction Perhaps it will not take four or more ¼ percentage point increases in   the funds rate to limit the rise in core CPI to 2½ percent over the forecast period But how likely is   it that we would come to regret another move this year? The case for tighter policy always seems   more compelling when near-term above-trend growth is projected to aggravate already tight labor   markets That is a one-two punch that should be resisted And once again the data point to faster   growth than previously expected The outlook for growth was revised upward from the last   Greenbook Growth appears to have moved again into the above-trend zone and remains quite   strong, though slightly below trend, in 2000 and 2001 This is the case despite the assumed tighter   monetary policy and flat equity prices in the Greenbook forecast Persistence of strong growth   reflects a combination of still favorable financial conditions even with a tightening, flat equity   prices, stronger global growth, a declining exchange rate, and increased fiscal stimulus   The generally favorite forecast paradigm since at least mid-1996, when I arrived at the   Board, has been slower growth and rising inflation One can say the same paradigm is reflected in   the current forecast But the slowdown in growth is now much more modest and the rise in   inflation more aggressive Instead of looking like a transition from exceptional performance to a   modestly uncomfortable period of stagflation, the forecast is beginning to look a little more like a   boom/bust scenario, with the boom part admittedly more evident than the bust in this part of the   forecast Thank you    Mr Chairman, once again your presentation was a most interesting one I   felt as if I was riding a roller coaster for a while [Laughter] Sometimes when you start out and   begin to talk about accelerating productivity, I feel a bit of discomfort But I’ve heard it often   enough to know that if I’m patient and just sit back, we’re going to end up pretty much in   agreement Nevertheless, I was holding on to my chair! [Laughter] But soon enough you came   back and we agreed that there are tight labor markets and potential inflation risks   The story is that we have two scenarios out there We have the Greenbook scenario with   constant trend productivity growth That’s the one I’m comfortable with and that’s why I am   concerned about inflation risks We have your alternative--one that’s certainly shared by others   around the table--that we could continue to see accelerating productivity growth Clearly, the task   here is to make monetary policy fully respecting that uncertainty That might be a little too simple,   though, because we might really want to ask the question of just how much of an acceleration of   productivity would be required to overturn the increase of inflation that’s in the forecast At any   rate, at times like this I like a maximin type of strategy that looks at each of these scenarios and   pairs it with the wrong policy action to see how bad the outcome is It seems to me that if we have   the wrong policy with the constant productivity growth scenario, we have a rather unpleasant   outcome ahead of us   However, if we begin to tighten and you’re right that productivity growth is accelerating,   it’s just hard to see, given the fact that rates of return are rising so aggressively in the economy, that   very much damage is going to be done The bottom line here is that I’d be very uncomfortable if   you had said that in light of your optimism about productivity the place to be was at no change with   a symmetric directive I do appreciate the leadership you provided in bringing us toward a   consensus We have a variety of options and I think I could live with a number of them     10/5/99 56   I have more than a slight preference for going “B” asymmetric and publishing it because the   artifice of saying that we’re not going to say we’re asymmetric but use language that reflects our   bias in that direction will seem strange to everybody People will note that we used asymmetric   language in our policy release but didn’t want to use the word in the directive and will then worry   about that In this circumstance we have the benefit that the markets expect, more than any other   outcome, the decision today to be no change asymmetric There was a survey in Stone and   McCarthy in which 46 percent of the respondents expected that outcome That was the largest   single expectation I think that gives us some opportunity to get the job done with an appropriate   announcement But if the preference were for doing it and saying that we weren’t going to vote on   symmetry or asymmetry but reflect it in the announcement, I think that would be fine too I would   prefer not to adopt “B” asymmetric and say we will let people find out in six or eight weeks That I   don’t like But I think an announcement to the markets that doesn’t mislead them about what our   assessment of the balance of risks is today would be appropriate    We ought to be careful There is a sense of causality here; this is what   we’re worried about I don’t see any reason to hide that    The point here, it seems to me, is that the more serious problem is in the   realization of above-trend growth in the form of high utilization rates Do you want to mention   what brought about the high utilization rates? This captures it pretty well    I disagree with that Take a situation where we have cost increases and a   02 or 03 percentage point decline in the unemployment rate next time I know where I’m going to   be If everybody else isn’t there, that’s fine Are preemptive responses by us to changes in the   balance of supply and demand appropriate even before those cost pressures show up?  That’s the   question If you’re not prepared to respond to that-­   That’s fine    I’m happy!    That says what we did but not why we did it It goes against the notion that   an announcement is supposed to give the rationale for what we’re doing     Thank you, Mr Chairman We have a wealth of new and especially   revised data to incorporate into our assessment of the outlook On balance, the data suggest that   both productive capacity and demand are advancing more rapidly than previously expected The   further upward revision of the estimate of trend productivity does translate, as reflected in the   Greenbook, into a slightly more favorable inflation forecast over the next couple of years That   is, the temporary disinflationary force of higher productivity growth has been enhanced and   renewed in this forecast While this has taken some of the quantitative edge off the Greenbook   inflation forecast, it has not changed the qualitative picture or the balance of risks, which in my   judgment definitively continues to point toward an increase in core inflation over the forecast   horizon And I might note that if the Greenbook has lost some of its quantitative edge it hasn’t   lost any of its rhetorical edge, arguing very forcefully that inflationary pressures are building   The key to inflation prospects is not how fast supply or demand is advancing but   rather the degree of imbalance today between supply and demand, particularly in the labor   market, and whether or not this imbalance might be further aggravated going forward In the   Greenbook forecast growth slows to trend There is some discussion at several points in the   Greenbook that growth is slowing to below trend and that pressures in the labor markets are   easing, but I do note that the unemployment rate is 42 percent at the end of 2001 So that 01   percentage point increase in the unemployment rate is not much of an easing in labor markets     11/16/99 39   At any rate, my point is that the slowdown projected in the Greenbook only prevents the degree   of labor market tightness from becoming more acute   I agree with the staff that this degree of labor market tightness has prevailed for some   time and has been offset in recent years by a combination of favorable price shocks and the   disinflationary effect of the significant acceleration of productivity But I think the situation has   changed in a very important way with respect to the future We already can see that overall   inflation has increased significantly this year So we can look forward now to reinforcing   developments instead of offsets Rising inflation this year will reinforce the already tight labor   markets, putting upward pressure on nominal compensation next year That will be reinforced   by the effect of higher health care expenses, and the pass-through of those costs to inflation will   be reinforced by further increases in import prices   One of the most critical aspects of this projection of trend growth is that at the end of   the period--after which inflation has increased by perhaps as much as ¾ percentage point--the   degree of labor market tightness is the same as it was at the beginning of the period Inflation is   rising just as fast at the end as it was at the beginning, and it’s hard to see how this process gets   contained without inflation moving above 3 percent in the period going beyond the forecast   horizon   If I take one thing importantly away from the Greenbook, it is that it’s possible to be   an optimist about productivity and a pessimist about inflation at the same time I think that’s   important to keep in mind    Mr Chairman, I can support your recommendation for a ¼ point   increase in the funds rate and I can accept your recommendation for a symmetric directive The   problem I have is this While I want to convey to the markets the view that there is little chance   that we would make an additional move between now and our February meeting, I don’t   particularly want to convey to the markets that we now feel that we’ve done as much as is   necessary, that we’ve rebalanced the risks, and that it’s just as likely thereafter that rates will go   down as go up What I really want to avoid is turning a tightening into what appears to be an   easing We’ve had that problem before Now, I could make a case that it’s not that hard to   convey what we actually mean in our announcement  I could argue that we could go asymmetric   and tell the market that asymmetry doesn’t mean that during the period leading up to the century   date change we will tighten but that it reflects a policy tilt that would be in place thereafter I can   accept the symmetry, but I just want to raise the issue that we need to be careful about how we   convey our message in the announcement Now we’ve put added burden on the announcement,   which is okay as long as we use it effectively    I’m concerned about the third paragraph It talks about slowing   growth down toward trend and I think there is a reasonable prospect that we might do that But I   heard concerns expressed around the table--and others can speak for themselves--that that might   not be sufficient to contain inflation going forward, or that at least the risks would still be   unbalanced and consistent with a likelihood that rates would have to rise more So if we’re   going to be symmetric, I don’t want to be so radically symmetric The idea of being symmetric   was to convey to the markets that we were unlikely to move in the very near term, but this     11/16/99 57   wording conveys a different message This says we think we’re done tightening now Okay,   bond and stock markets, have a nice day!    It would be better if you take out the “markedly”    I am not particularly wedded to the language in either of the options   But I strongly prefer the spirit of the second option, which focuses on the policy implications,   and here is the reason What is the tilt about?  What is the market trying to learn about?  Does   the market say “You are our favorite forecasters and we want to know how you view the balance   of risks in the outlook so we can think about the forecast”?  Or does the market want to glean   some information about our policy intentions?   Now, we can leave it and just say we’re going to talk about the balance of risks, but   then they will say that a balance of risks toward higher inflation means the Fed is more likely to   tighten There’s no great damage in that; I’m just saying they are going to infer that We can’t   hide it Why would we want to hide that?  If we want to hide that, we shouldn’t get into the   business of having a tilt at all If we don’t want to hide it, then we can just be more transparent     11/16/99 66   about it and say here is what we think the balance of risks is and as a result of that we think it’s   more likely that rates will be rising rather than falling   The next question is Can we really tie the hands of the FOMC with respect to the   future?  Of course not I wouldn’t want to do that We are not tying anybody’s hands At every   meeting we sit down and we start from scratch making an assessment about the economy and the   outlook We do the best job we can at that meeting So the question is whether we also should   provide some honest assessment of how we are leaning in the future That’s all we are doing,   and we can do that every time   Is the market going to be more focused on the policy decision at the next meeting if   we talk about it in terms of a policy leaning as opposed to talking about the balance of risks?  I   can’t understand why But if we’re concerned about that, why don’t we just communicate?  We   can tell the market that we don’t view this tilt as having any particular focus on the next meeting   We are not saying that we prejudged that we are going to move and that’s why we have the tilt-­  that we decided just not to do it this time but will do it next time We can tell the market that our   decision on symmetry encompasses a near-term horizon, typically perhaps a period of two or   three meetings   Another factor that goes into my thinking is that I believe it’s much more difficult to   convey why we might want to tighten than whether we might want to tighten There are a lot of   nuances, a lot of different models, and a lot of different perspectives around the table So we   might have more difficulty--though this is probably a minor thing--talking about what exactly it   is in the balance of risks that we’re weighing In the draft language in the memo we only have   two things that drive our policy each time--the risks are weighted either toward weakness in   economic activity or toward higher inflation    Or balanced I think that’s a relatively minor point But what I didn’t   like about the language was that it focused on the likelihood of a particular policy move That is   perhaps a little stronger than the language we have been using Instead of saying that in the   future we’re more likely to tighten, now we simply say that we’re more likely to raise rates than   to lower rates That’s a much softer way of conveying an asymmetry as opposed to saying we’re   more likely to raise rates than to hold them constant     11/16/99 67   So I would have preferred to marry the balance of risks and the likely direction of   interest rates I’d give a simple statement about the balance of risks and say that as a result it is   more likely that rates will rise rather than fall or that those risks are balanced, with an equal   likelihood that rates will rise or fall I’d go back to the same language that we have now in the   directive, but precede that with a sentence on the balance of risks    I just had a comment on the Chairman’s latitude When Ed Boehne   talked about it, the first thing he said was something like Of course, the Chairman must have the   authority to move in exceptional cases I didn’t see anything here about “exceptional cases,” and   that’s part of my problem If this were handed out as a public statement, I think it would seem to   convey the notion that the Chairman has more latitude than the market might have expected   There’s almost a sense of encouraging the Chairman to review the data during the intermeeting   period and to make adjustments as he sees fit I don’t think that interpretation is something we   want to encourage Most decisions should be made in FOMC meetings; that’s the best place to   make them In exceptional cases, though, it’s important for the Chairman to have that authority   October 15th of last year was a perfect example of it being used to its best effect That may be   understood inside this organization, and I wouldn’t want to convey an impression outside that   this latitude was for other than those exceptional cases   The other question is linked or de-linked, coupled or de-coupled It seems to me that   this statement says any decision and adjustment should reflect the Committee’s discussion and   decision at the previous meeting That might be a sufficient linkage There should be some   linkage If the Committee’s vote was for symmetry--if the Committee put out a statement that   said there was little chance that a move was going to be necessary--that doesn't mean that a move   couldn’t be made in exceptional cases It just raises the hurdle a bit higher than would otherwise   be the case Whereas if we thought it was more likely that the risks were tilted toward higher   inflation, there would be less of a hurdle for the data to push the Chairman toward an interim   adjustment    I read this change as almost an encouragement of more frequent   intermeeting adjustments I would prefer it to say that the Committee appreciates that in rare   cases the Chairman has the authority to act on the Committee’s behalf     Thank you, Mr Chairman There is clearly strong momentum in   private domestic demand and at the same time few signs of rising core inflation So far so   good The issue is sustainability The Greenbook weighs in with an assessment that the   current state is not sustainable--not at the current monetary policy setting or even with the   75 basis point increase in the funds rate assumed in the Greenbook forecast This, we all   understand, is only a forecast and just one forecast at that And as several speakers this   morning have noted, there are many elements of uncertainty surrounding the outlook,   especially about inflation dynamics, NAIRU, and productivity   But I buy into the qualitative story of the Greenbook I buy into the balance of risks   that it identifies and into the message that I think it conveys about the challenges we may be   facing next year From my perspective the challenges are especially great because I think   we face two reinforcing elements of unsustainability We have an unsustainably rapid pace   of growth on top of an already unsustainably high labor utilization rate So, in short, I think   we have our work cut out for us   I believe next year will be an especially key one for monetary policy Even if we do   move to tighten policy next year, the overall picture of growth and inflation might still look   quite favorable, particularly if the staff is correct that we will face declining oil prices after   the peak in the first quarter But in the coming year we will have the opportunity to take the   steps that will improve the prospects of containing inflation going forward and, by doing so,   hopefully extend even further this remarkable expansion Thank you    Don, I thought that was a particularly outstanding presentation   except for the last sentence In the very last sentence you expressed some concern that even   if we were transparent and honest--if we told the market very clearly that our priority was to   assure liquidity over the century date change and that we wouldn’t be taking up the balance-    12/21/99 44   of-risks issue until the February meeting--an asymmetric directive could, nevertheless,   mislead the market Do you really think so?    There’s nothing new there! [Laughter]    As I was thinking about this decision coming into this meeting, my   inclination was for an asymmetric directive with language that during the intermeeting   period we would be focused on insuring liquidity in financial markets Basically I thought   that would be the most transparent and honest approach we could take But I must say that   the symmetric directive draft is extremely well done and I would be very comfortable with   that I feel that’s honest and transparent as well I’m 51/49 asymmetric, but I’m quite   comfortable with the symmetric one, too, because I think it is extremely well crafted    Thank you It was clear at the last meeting, as it has been during the   deliberations of the Working Group, that I am part of a very small minority on this issue-­  maybe it’s just Bill Poole and I Nevertheless, I thank you for the opportunity to talk a little   about my views because I am strongly in favor of language in the tilt that refers directly to   prospective policy actions   I believe the best way to think about this is to reflect on why we are engaged in this   process and what we are trying to accomplish In my view, two concerns led to this   reconsideration of our directive and disclosure practices First, we became uncomfortable   with the market’s reaction to our announcements, particularly with its assessment of the   immediacy and the certainty of a policy move whenever we announced a shift to an   asymmetric directive Second, there was an additional uncertainty engendered by the   absence of a consistent interpretation of the tilt by members of the Committee Now, the   second problem is easy to deal with We have a process under way to develop a consensus,   and I think we have an agreement around the table that whatever that consensus is we are all   going to be bound by it going forward, whether we agreed with it or not   But the first problem, which I’m going to call the immediacy/certainty problem,   resulted in large part from the decisions we made when we adopted this disclosure policy   last December First, we decided only to announce a change in the tilt when the change was     12/21/99 64   significant and important for the public to know In retrospect, I think that was a mistake It   was as if we had said “If we are going to have a significant change in the directive, we   want to have it flashing on that big neon sign in Times Square” And then we were   surprised about how intense the market response was! Second, by explicitly tying the tilt to   the intermeeting language of the directive, we reinforced the presumption that the bias   referred to a very short-term policy horizon So, I think we unintentionally created the   problems that we are trying to respond to today   Now what do we do? We have already reached consensus on three constructive   steps to alleviate these problems First, we are always going to announce changes in the tilt,   thus removing the special sense of immediacy and certainty of announced tilts Second, we   are going to remove the tilt from the directive and not tie it to the intermeeting period   language And third, as I noted above, we are going to agree to be bound by the consensus   interpretation What more do we need to do?  Here is where we differ   The majority also wants to change the language to focus on the balance of risks in   the forecast in order to detach it from an explicit reference to policy Two quite different   reasons have been put forth for why we should not explicitly refer to the policy direction in   expressing the tilt The first is that by not linking the tilt directly to future policy prospects   we are taking a further effective step toward resolving the immediacy and certainty problem   The logic is that if we don’t mention policy, the markets will be less likely to infer from the   announcement of a tilt a sense of immediacy and certainty of a subsequent policy action   That may be the case But I’m not sure it will be   The second argument is that we can legitimately have an assessment of the balance   of risks to the forecast, but that it makes no sense to have a policy bias because we can’t   commit a future FOMC to a policy decision The view is that somehow the balance of risks   is accurate, but we can’t have an accurate policy bias I don’t understand it I’ll give you an   example We sat around this table today and discussed the outlook, and I think we all were   talking as if it was very likely that we would have to tighten policy even at our next meeting   in February Does that mean when February comes along that we won’t start afresh with a   zero-based review of the data and the forecast?  Of course not  Of course we will start   afresh, as we are required to do So I would reject that notion I don’t think that’s a good   argument     12/21/99 65   But there is a legitimate question as to whether or not the balance-of-risks language   will deal with this certainty/immediacy problem The markets really want to know about   our policy bias and they will infer that policy bias however we express the tilt We would   be deluding ourselves to think otherwise We can couch this bias in the language of the   forecast, but the market will read right through it to our policy intention Therefore, I prefer   the direct, transparent approach Specifically, I’d use the language we’ve been using rather   than this alternative language that Bill Poole has suggested And I would use the press   release to set out our interpretation of the tilt--specifically, that we don’t intend it to indicate   a precommitment to action at the next meeting, but to indicate a greater likelihood of   moving in one direction rather than the other over a longer time frame   If the majority view is nevertheless in favor of the balance-of-risks language, I   would strongly urge that we not assume that this language alone will convey the message   we want to send in terms of immediacy and certainty of subsequent policy action We   should make these points explicitly in the press release in exactly the same way we would   do if we used the policy bias language Thank you    We have gone through a process here and we have reached a   consensus It’s a quite overwhelming consensus, though it’s not 100 percent So I’m   perfectly satisfied that the process has worked I got the chance to try to persuade others to   my viewpoint and I was unsuccessful And I would certainly consider myself bound by this   consensus, so I think we ought to vote   SEVERAL Agreed      Could I just give an interpretation of why the staff has a somewhat   different perspective from most of the private forecasts?  I think the main difference is that the   staff here has a very strong view of the interaction of supply and demand  This common force of   productivity is affecting both demand and supply  I think they have been proven very accurate in   that  One doesn’t see that perspective in most of the private forecasts  So, when those   forecasters revise up their productivity growth estimates, they do not get the same demand   impact, and that changes the whole dynamic     Could I just follow up on that?  In judging that probability you might   want to indicate what the path of investment would have to be in the model to produce the capital          45  deepening required to achieve that scenario, given that the capital deepening is what has been   generating most of the uptick in trend productivity     Yes, but that’s almost pulling something out of the hat in a way  It   seems to me that the big story here is the increase in capital deepening  If you want to play the   story out, I think you need to trace through what would be needed to get so much more capital   deepening to produce that acceleration in productivity     I want to share with you some observations about the outlook that   shape my views about the appropriate policy action tomorrow and the strategy that could guide   us going forward  Given the uncertainty that we face about trend growth, NAIRU, and inflation   dynamics, we’ve had to balance the risk that we might fail to take full advantage of the higher          75  trend growth and the lower NAIRU against the risk of overheating, higher inflation, and   increased economic instability  As we have probed the limits of the new possibilities, the risk of   overheating has increased     My first observation is that the risks have now become significantly tilted toward   higher inflation  That judgment is based on the still more robust growth at the already very high   labor utilization rate, by the dissipation or reversal of the favorable relative price shocks that   have been restraining inflation, and by some signs of incipient pressure on nominal   compensation and inflation  While there have been consistent upward revisions to trend growth   and a growing appreciation of the importance of higher productivity growth in explaining recent   macroeconomic experience, the key challenge for monetary policy today derives from the   persistent imbalance between the growth in supply and demand  From the perspective of   monetary policy, the absolute value of trend growth in GDP--whether it's now 3-1/2, or 3-3/4, or   4 percent, or whatever--is less important than the relative growth rates of demand and supply    The higher trend productivity growth appears to have had simultaneous effects on demand as   well as supply via the investment boom to take advantage of profitable opportunities and via the   consumption boom driven by the surge in equity values and perhaps expectations of higher   permanent income  I want to read a sentence from the staff memo on the FRB/US model   forecast prepared for this meeting because I think it is very telling  “With trend productivity   growth assumed to be 30 percent rather than 28 percent, real GDP growth is boosted by nearly   05 percentage point in 2000 and by 04 percentage point in 2001, holding the nominal funds rate   and the nominal exchange rate at their assumed values”  So, 02 percent higher productivity   growth results in 1/2 percentage point faster growth in basic demand  That's the problem I think   we are facing          76  My second observation is that we should focus more on relative growth rates than on   absolute ones, notwithstanding uncertainties in the comparison  This points to the need to   tighten despite optimism about trend productivity growth  Inflation prospects ultimately relate to   the balance between the levels of actual output and potential output, not to their relative growth   rates  I continue to believe that output has moved beyond potential and that the inflationary   consequences of this imbalance have been restrained by temporary effects associated with supply   developments, including earlier relative price shocks and, more importantly, the higher   productivity growth itself  This has allowed the economy to enjoy faster growth and a higher   level of output than is sustainable in the longer term  The policy implication is that we have to   recognize the serious possibility--in my view the likelihood--that we will need to encourage a   transition back to more sustainable macro conditions, not only in terms of relative growth rates   but ultimately in terms of relative levels    My next observation is that the rise in interest rates necessary to balance supply and   demand and contain inflation risks may initially be smaller than usual but ultimately may be   larger in a boom featuring an increase in trend productivity growth  The temporary   disinflationary effect of the supply shock may at first limit the increase in interest rates, but given   that the productivity upturn carries with it an increase in the equilibrium real rate, the cyclical   rise in rates required to contain inflation may ultimately be larger than otherwise  Wicksell’s   framework of natural versus market rates provides a useful perspective on this development    The recent productivity upturn implies an increase in the economy's natural rate  At unchanged   market rates the gap between natural and market rates has widened, and monetary policy has in   effect become more stimulative  Only when monetary policy moves market rates enough to   close this gap will the expansion begin to slow          77  My final observation is that I believe we still have an opportunity for a relatively   benign transition to a soft landing--if we begin the journey immediately, are prepared to   implement a series of tightening moves and, most importantly, are willing to tolerate a period of   inflation above our preferred rate   If we are already operating beyond potential and with growth above trend, some rise in   inflation is probably inevitable as the economy makes a transition to a more sustainable set of   macro conditions  What is called for is a policy path that endeavors to achieve what I have   called a “reverse soft landing,” a transition to potential from growth above potential achieved by   a period of below-trend growth  This feat, I am compelled to admit, has never before been   successfully accomplished  It is, nevertheless, achieved with precision in the Bluebook!    [Laughter]  While there are some limited signs that inflationary pressures may be building, the   inflation process still has a lot of inertia, and we may get some help from a decline in energy   prices over the next couple of years  In addition, a reverse soft landing, requiring as it does a   slowdown to below-trend growth for an extended period, is easier to achieve without recession in   a fast growth economy like today's than in the slower growth economy of the 1970s and 1980s     I think the issue is this  Is our goal stable money growth or stable   inflation?  If your goal is stable money growth, you’ll take whatever inflation comes out of it   depending upon the productivity shocks     That may be okay   But that is not the goal, as I understand it  We   operate under a mandate of achieving price stability, which I think indicates not necessarily zero   inflation but at least a stable inflation rate  So we have to make a choice       I think it is easy to attribute an adjustment in the range to productivity   because nobody actually believes that our goal in setting the range is pure price stability    Nobody believes that our goal is just price stability  So, in my view, people will not think that   we are accommodating higher inflation if we raise the range       Well, now for a different perspective, I suppose  I must say that this   has been a very interesting discussion so far and I think we have identified two issues relevant to   the target ranges  The first is whether to revise them to reflect the faster rate of growth of trend   GDP  The second is what implicit inflation target we should use to set the midpoint of the   revised range     Alternative II deals with the first issue and I believe perpetuates the possible   misunderstanding that our inflation target is pure price stability, adjusted only for an estimate of   inflation bias  Now, I say a possible misunderstanding because the Committee has not fully   discussed its preferred inflation rate and certainly hasn’t worked to achieve a consensus on that   point  As for the strict price stability target that is implicit in the target range today, we might   ask this question  Does that really make us look like the central bank most focused on price   stability around the world or like the central bank least transparent about its inflation objective?    I think it is the latter     I will offer an alternative III set of ranges that incorporates my view that the implicit   inflation target, set as the midpoint of the M2 growth rate, should reflect what I’ve called price   stability plus a cushion  Although there remains a lot of uncertainty about the precise value of   trend GDP growth and how it might evolve over the next several years, I think the current   monetary growth ranges are outdated and badly in need of revision  Now, I am comfortable with   the judgment reflected in alternative II that the ranges should be updated to reflect an assumption   that trend GDP growth is currently 3-1/2 percent  The Humphrey-Hawkins report and testimony          97  should emphasize that the FOMC will reconsider the setting for the monetary aggregate ranges   as incoming information leads us to revise our estimate of trend real GDP growth  That is,   instead of thinking of the monetary growth ranges as being carved in stone, we should use them   as digital--subject to costless adjustments in response to the flow of new information     Let me turn to the second issue, which is undoubtedly the more controversial one  I   think we are sending an implicit message about how we define price stability when we set the   ranges  We can try to escape from this reality, but I doubt we will be successful  Any change in   the ranges, as many people have already indicated, may result in a probing for our implicit   inflation target  Clearly, we go through this exercise very explicitly when we set the ranges  The   question is how we present it to the public  Should we blur this logic, ignore the issue entirely,   or be more transparent about it?  I think the main--and maybe the only--purpose of the monetary   aggregate ranges today is as a means to offer an implicit inflation target  So perhaps we should   view today’s discussion of the ranges as an opportunity for an internal discussion about how we   should set an inflation target that is consistent with our interpretation of price stability  And we   might also look at our discussion and decision today as an opportunity for another step in the   direction of transparency     I want to point out that, in my view, there is a subtle but very real difference between   an “explicit inflation target” and “inflation targeting”  I do not understand how a central bank   can conduct monetary policy to achieve price stability without establishing an inflation target   consistent with our interpretation of price stability  Given that we want markets to help us   achieve this target, there is also a value in being explicit about it  And I believe I can accept an   explicit inflation target without having to sign on to a specific strategy for achieving that, which   is what I interpret “inflation targeting” to be            98  Other countries that have price stability mandates and explicit numerical targets have   uniformly set ranges centered on what I’ve referred to as price stability plus a cushion  This, in   my view, is an appropriate option, in light of concern about a deterioration in cyclical   performance near zero inflation with a zero nominal interest rate valve  Therefore, I offer as   alternative III a range centered on my preferred midpoint of 5 percent  That reflects the sum of a   3-1/2 percent rate of trend growth in GDP, a ½ percentage point estimate of bias in the chain   measure of the price index for GDP, and a 1 percentage point cushion  And this suggests a 3   percent to 7 percent range  This would be a small step to take toward an explicit inflation target   and enhanced transparency, but it would be a big step for this Committee to take     I will give you an alternative strategy here, which would be to set a central range   rather than a point, with the bottom point being consistent with pure price stability and the upper   point consistent with price stability plus a cushion  In this case, the central tendency might be 4   to 5 percent  Attaching a symmetric range about the central tendency would yield a range of 2 to   7 percent for M2  This is analogous to the Australian approach of setting a “thick” point target   of 2 to 3 percent  It has its own problems, particularly the indecision once M2 growth is inside   the central range  But it would allow us to defer a more precise setting of the midpoint until a   consensus could be reached in the Committee and perhaps until there was consultation with   Congress     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support your recommendation for a 25   basis point increase in the funds rate and what I will continue to call an asymmetric posture  I   also agree with you that we are likely to have to implement a series of tightenings this year; it is   likely to be appropriate to make a move at each meeting for a period of time  Given the   uncertainties about trend growth, NAIRU, and inflation dynamics, and also given the uncertainty   about the impact of our policies on financial conditions more broadly, I think there is a strong   case for a gradualist approach  I hope we will be able to use the bias in the announcement that   accompanies today’s action skillfully  By that I mean that I hope we don't undermine what I   view as very sensible expectations about the rise in the funds rate that are built into the term   structure and futures markets   We had a lot of discussion today about uncertainty, about the structure of the economy   and inflation dynamics, and about the value of humility  I don’t want to lead a discussion   opposed to humility  [Laughter]  However, I think sometimes we draw an implication here that   humility suggests inaction, though that is certainly not what you have been arguing, Mr   Chairman  But I want to bring us back to the discussion of our monetary growth targets because   it seems to me that in a monetary growth target regime the danger of inaction is much less than   in a funds rate regime  And that, I think, is consistent with some of the points that President   Jordan was making  If productivity growth is a little higher, we will end up with a little lower   inflation; it will be somewhat limited and won't be as much of a problem  But in an interest rate   regime inaction can be very, very dangerous--and particularly dangerous in an expansion that is   driven by higher productivity, which raises real equilibrium interest rates   I also want to comment a bit on your discussion of the role of the wealth effect  It   clearly has been very important  We go from the productivity upturn, to the wealth effect on          132  consumption, to the excess of demand growth relative to supply growth  And we’ve had a lot of   discussion, not only here but in a number of other arenas, about how a declining equity premium   or higher equilibrium growth rate can raise the value of equity prices  A lot of that is a partial   equilibrium analysis  You just plug into the formula a low equity premium and voilà--higher   equity prices That makes very little sense in a general equilibrium model, because in such a   model that wealth effect will ultimately generate increases in real interest rates that will   significantly cap and diminish the increase in equity premiums     I think the danger that we have been facing recently is that a monetary policy that has   been somewhat slow to tighten and has allowed the economy to operate in this partial   equilibrium world  I think we are now going to see how equity prices evolve in a general   equilibrium world, and I think that is one reason why we have to be a bit cautious and gradualist   I want to make just a few comments on what I perceive to be the consensus strategy   that is unfolding  It seems to me that what we have been talking about is being very preemptive   now in slowing the economy to trend growth, but being very reactive once we get to trend   growth and we have stabilized the unemployment rate  Then at that point we are prepared to be   very reactive and respond only to evidence of higher inflation  I have been struggling with the   issue of whether this is an appropriate strategy, or perhaps even an optimal strategy, given our   uncertainty about the output gap  If it is a sensible strategy, I think there are some gaps or details   we have to fill in  Obviously, we have to decide what the appropriate path of the funds rate is to   slow the economy to trend  But we also have to keep in mind that if we are unsuccessful in   slowing the economy to trend and, therefore, the output gap rises even further, that should affect   our policy and we should tighten by more than we otherwise would  That is, we should tighten   enough to slow the economy to below trend so that we can push the output gap back down  I          133  think that is consistent with the nonlinear rule that I have discussed in the past  As uncertain as   we are about the output gap, that uncertainty about whether or not we are beyond the economy’s   potential diminishes very greatly as the output gap increases based on our best estimate of   potential   And the third issue I think we are going to have to focus on in this strategy is just how   aggressively we should move against higher inflation  To the extent that we have down   weighted our response to increases in the output gap, when inflation rises we have to be more   aggressive than we would otherwise be  The way to think about that is that once we get to trend   growth and the unemployment rate stabilizes, we have assumed that our policy setting and   strategy are consistent with stable inflation and the output gap is basically zero  If inflation then   begins to rise, not only do we have to respond to the increase in inflation the way we ordinarily   would, we also have to revise our estimate of the output gap  That requires a more aggressive   response to inflation than would otherwise be the case   So, those are a few thoughts that at least shape my views of the strategy going   forward      Thank you, Mr Chairman  In my judgment little has changed in the   outlook and hence the appropriate course for monetary policy since we last met  Let me   emphasize the three features of the outlook that, in my judgment, support an increase in the   federal funds rate target today and suggest that further increases will be warranted over the   course of the next several months   First, the growth in aggregate demand continues to outpace the growth of aggregate   supply even allowing for the recent upward revisions to the productivity trend  Many apparently   have had difficulty with the story that the productivity shock itself could generate an increase in   demand that outpaces the increase in supply  But this link only provides a possible explanation   for why demand growth is exceeding supply growth  I believe this link is plausible  But all that   really matters for monetary policy is that the growth in demand is exceeding the growth in   supply at a time when labor markets are already very tight  Perhaps the more important point is              - 72 -     that whether or not demand grows faster than supply following a productivity shock depends   critically on the monetary policy response to the productivity shock, a point that President Jordan   made very effectively earlier  I find it very plausible that holding nominal rates constant in the   face of a productivity shock that raises the real equilibrium interest rate will result in an excess of   demand relative to supply  The test of whether or not demand growth is in fact exceeding supply   growth is what happens to resource utilization rates  The unemployment rate has been declining   by an average of almost 04 percentage point a year since the end of 1995 and has declined at   least 03 percentage point each year, confirming that demand growth has been exceeding supply   growth  The Greenbook projects a decline of about 1/2 percentage point by the end of next year   to 36 percent in the absence of further increases in the federal funds rate   Second, while core inflation remains well contained, I agree with the Greenbook   forecast that it will soon begin to rise, reflecting the secondary effects of the recent rise in oil   prices, the dissipation or possible reversal of various favorable price shocks that restrained   inflation earlier, and the effects of very tight labor markets  Monetary policy tightening today   would clearly be preemptive and appropriately so   Third, slowing the economy to trend is unlikely to contain the risk of higher inflation    I very much doubt that stable inflation is compatible with a 4 percent unemployment rate    Slowing the economy to trend may, therefore, be just the first step  It is an important step, but it   may not be--indeed, it is unlikely to be--enough  We should therefore be especially determined   to slow the economy at least to trend quickly and to be aggressively reactive to increases in core   inflation     Mr Chairman, I agree with your recommendation  I think a good case   can be made for the kind of gradualist policy that we've been following  However, since we are   obviously into confessions today, I should say that I, too, didn't come to this conclusion without   some internal debate of my own                - 91 -     I mentioned at the last meeting that I thought it was important, in terms of the   decisions we made on the funds rate and our announcements on the tilt, that we make sure that   the bond markets continue to build in appropriate assumptions about future interest rate   increases  But in fact, I think there has been some decrease in the extent of the expected rise in   short-term interest rates in the bond markets  I didn't read the incoming data as supporting that   conclusion  The Greenbook didn't read the data as supporting that conclusion  And that suggests   that a time may come when we are going to have to surprise the bond markets  Now, the   question is  When would we like to do that?  Would we like to do it today when the performance   of the economy is in some sense unblemished and before inflation starts to rise?  Or would we   like to do it in the midst of rising inflation and when economic growth may have already slowed   somewhat?  It's possible that we could improve the performance of the economy and do a lot to   reinforce the credibility of monetary policy if we decided to move more aggressively   Well, that was the 40 percent case; I'm still with the 60 percent that argues for a   gradualist policy today  But in coming meetings if the Greenbook forecast is correct and we do   see a rise in the core inflation rate, I think we will have a very good reason to move in a larger   increment      Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Bluebook gets to the heart of what   has changed and what has not changed since our last meeting  I quote  “… incoming data   suggested both that aggregate demand had continued to grow more rapidly than potential   supply and that wage and price developments were becoming more worrisome"  So what has   not changed is the momentum in demand and production and the imbalance between the   growth in production and in potential supply  But the quote does not make entirely clear   whether the staff was referring to an imbalance in the growth rates between demand and   potential supply or in the levels of actual and potential output  It occurs to me that the   ambiguity might have been intentional to allow each of us to interpret the observation in a   way that we could accept  But I believe another critical and persisting element is a large   imbalance between the levels of actual and potential output  This view is very consistent with      73  the Greenbook and many other forecasts and it does suggest that we have a significant   challenge ahead of us  I don't know if we have “sweaty palms" or even if I have “sweaty   palms," but I think the challenge is quite considerable  And it is along the lines that I think   Mike Prell laid out very well in his presentation  By the way, I thought that was a particularly   insightful presentation, although I should note that I always tend to find presentations   insightful when they tend to confirm my own bias  [Laughter]       But this is a good point for me to say how much I have valued your   presentations to the Committee during my tenure here  And you really ended on a high note   today!   So, what has changed?  Well, first of all utilization rates have increased slightly   further  There should not be any surprise about that  As long as demand is growing faster   than potential supply, of course utilization rates will increase  Now, I recognize that monetary   policy acts with a lag, but my view is that the restraint we have put in place since last summer   is not sufficient  The virtual absence of signs of slowing suggests that if we don't take further   steps to slow demand growth, utilization rates will most likely increase still further   A second change is that inflation has become both more of a reality and more of a   threat  It is more of a threat because of still high utilization rates and continued above-trend   growth  But it is more than a threat  We are seeing, I believe, the beginning of a pickup in   inflation rates for both compensation and core consumer prices   Certainly one can find some mixed signals, but I view the data on balance as quite   compelling  There is a conflict among some of the data on wages and compensation, but on   the basis of both the ECI and the higher frequency data for average hourly earnings I think it      74  is clear that we are at an inflection point here  To me this assessment is very consistent with   the reports summarized in the Beigebook and with the anecdotal reports that I am hearing as   the various state banking groups visit the Board   As for inflation, President Parry mentioned that the core PCE was moving up  Its   12-month rate is now 18 percent, which is the highest rate of increase since October 1997    And it has moved up 04 percentage point since just the end of last year  In terms of the core   CPI, of course, its 12-month rate is the same as it was a year ago  But if I look at the pattern, I   see that beginning in September the monthly increases were rather consistently higher  I note   that of the next four months to be dropped out of the 12-month core CPI, three of them were   01 percent and one was 02 percent  So, I think the 12-month rate is moving up from being   around 2 percent to being around 2-1/2 percent, consistent with what we are seeing in the core   PCE  Again, why should we be surprised?  Given the prevailing utilization rates and the   dissipation or reversal of favorable supply shocks, some deterioration in inflation is what most   forecasters have been expecting   I think the third change is in the nature of the forecast errors  For a very long time   we have been saying faster-than-expected growth and lower-than-expected inflation  No   more  So far this year there is relatively little surprise about the strength of growth, which   remains robust  And some key inflation data are now coming in either worse than expected or   at least confirming expectations of an increase in inflation pressures--particularly, as I said,   the core PCE and CPI measures, the ECI, and average hourly earnings  This reflects, in my   view, the fact that the dominance of favorable supply shocks is receding  And as a   consequence, the implications of the supply/demand imbalance are coming into clearer focus      75  At the end of last year there was a bold headline in the Wall Street Journal  “So   long supply and demand”  I have been waiting for a new headline “Welcome back supply   and demand”  And then today in the Wall Street Journal on the front page there is an article   about firms starting to raise prices  It begins, “Even in the new economy at least one old rule   still applies  If demand exceeds supply for long enough, sellers will raise prices"  Our job is   clear  We must restore the balance between supply and demand  Until we do so, the threat   and reality of higher inflation are likely to remain with us     Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation  I do have to admit   that I got to this decision by a rather different route than you did, but it is nevertheless good to   end up with the same conclusion  I am concerned that our challenge is much more demanding   than slowing the expansion to trend  The further increase in utilization rates and signs of   building inflation pressures suggest that we are ultimately going to have to slow economic   growth to below trend for a while  And until this process is much further along, there's a   threat of continued upward pressure on inflation  I think the gradual approach we've been   taking so far has been motivated by the possibility that our task might be a more limited one--  just slowing the economy to trend--and also by the fact that until recently there hasn't been   any sign of rising inflation  Moreover, we’ve had concerns or uncertainties about sustainable   utilization rates  But I think it has always been clear that there were risks in the gradual   approach  And the risks were that during the time we were trying to slow the expansion, the   imbalance between actual and potential output would become still worse and the threat of   inflation would become more of a reality   It seems to me that with a more aggressive policy action of 50 basis points today   the risk of a policy mistake is much smaller than with a more gradual policy response  What   we're doing in some sense today is moving forward a rate increase that in any event we likely   would have implemented in the near term  So, we don't have to have any larger cumulative   increase in interest rates than we otherwise would have had, but we put ourselves in a position   to implement a larger cumulative rise if it turns out to be justified  Thank you      95     The dynamics are important here, and that is what I was thinking   about  You don't need just the reduced forms in some sense, the static ones; you need the   dynamic process  And the disequilibrium process through the gap is the mechanism that gets   you from one inflation rate to another  I’m not sure, but I think if you increased the rate of   monetary growth in that model and you didn't have the dynamics working through the gap,   you’d have no mechanism to get you from one inflation rate to the other  So, what I would   urge--     Well, if there is no mechanism to generate higher inflation, why   would inflation expectations go up?     That's right  If you have an increase in the price level that's fine, but   not if you have an increase in the rate of growth in the money supply or some stimulus like that    You won't have a determinant process     The point here is that I think it would be dangerous to throw away a   disequilibrium mechanism that underlies the inflation/wage dynamics without having anything   to replace it  That's my concern  The issue is not the nature of the wage/price dynamics but   what the critical value of that is that gives rise to the process  And, of course, there’s a lot of   uncertainty about that  But that’s why I thought the simulation was very interesting  Actually,   it was a bit surprising that if you put in a NAIRU that is a percentage point below the staff   estimate, the qualitative story was not that different     I think we are making this discussion more complicated than   necessary  We are not saying, “Let’s throw away this whole wage dynamics model,” but rather   the question is what is the value of the NAIRU  That becomes very important  Nobody could   dispute that     As you know, I love talking about macro modeling and I love talking   about NAIRU, and I like talking about the outlook too  But first things first  Let me start by   responding to President Poole's comments about whether there might be two different models of   the causal process of what determines inflation  I think there is only one model; I may not   convince you of that, but let me try to explain my reasoning  The Phillips curve is not a model   of what determines inflation  The vertical Phillips curve tells us that inflation is indeterminate   in that model  All the Phillips curve tells us is when inflation is constant, when it is rising, or   when it is falling  It's a model of the dynamics of the inflation process, but it's incomplete as a   full model     What about the causality from money to prices?  Well, that's very important  That's   an equilibrium relationship, which helps to pin down where along that vertical Phillips curve   inflation will really be  But what gets you from one inflation rate to another when money   growth changes?  We have to have that dynamic model  That is what the Phillips curve does    We need both parts  So the problem we have is that even with all of the skepticism about   NAIRU, we should understand that if we throw that concept away, we don't have another model   at this point, as I think President Stern suggested  That's the problem  Now we can still   question what the value of NAIRU is, but let's think for a minute what would be the situation if   we really believed that NAIRU was 4 percent  Then I would have to be asking myself  How   come inflation is so high?  A core CPI inflation rate of 24 percent on a methodologically   consistent basis would be the same as it was in 1995  Now, during that period since 1995, the   unemployment rate was above NAIRU  We had all kinds of relative price shocks that were   lowering inflation  We got a productivity shock that was lowering inflation  So, how come           72  inflation is so high?  One thing to keep in mind if we don't believe this framework is that it’s not   clear why we would bother to tighten if we wanted to slow down inflation     Let’s move on to the outlook   I think the slowdown that's clear in the second quarter   raises two important questions for the Committee  The first is whether it is a pause or a more   sustainable slowdown  And if it is more sustainable, the question is whether it is sufficient to   achieve our objective of containing the risks of higher inflation  Now, I describe the May   employment report as incredible--meaning literally that it is not believable  It is not believable   that private payrolls in effect fell off the cliff in May, a cliff that was elevated by the sharp   increases over the previous two months  That's not to say that there isn't information content in   that report, but it makes sense at least to smooth the data to get a better sense of the underlying   reality  Granted, we don't know whether we should smooth it backward or forward  Usually   smoothing it in both directions will be the norm  I think there is plenty of reason to smooth it   going backward because the economy soared in the previous three quarters to a degree that was   unanticipated by forecasters and their models  So part of this slowdown could simply be a   smoothing out of growth to an average more in line with fundamentals, in the process taking it   below the underlying rate for a while     Now, as a private sector forecaster, I have to admit that I was frequently confronted   by unexpected data, data that contradicted my forecast  And in each case I had to decide how   much to respond by altering my forecast and changing my story  I developed two rules that I   believe served me well  Now, certainly, one could change the current-quarter forecast  The   question was what to do about the forecast over the next year or two  Rule number one was that   when the data disconfirm your forecast, initially you ignore the new data and defend the old   forecast  This is not simply stubbornness  Well, it's stubbornness to a degree, [Laughter] but           73  it's not only stubbornness  It also involves the recognition of the volatility in high frequency   data, the difficulties associated with seasonal adjustment, and the potential for revisions or   reversals in the data  Rule number two was to know when to say when  That is, when the data   continue to contradict the forecast, it is time to change the forecast  Otherwise, clients tend to   change their forecasters!  And of course, really good forecasters know when to shift from rule   one to rule two     As a forecaster, I'm still operating under rule number one, and I think the staff   appears to be following the same strategy  As was just noted, some slowdown was expected,   whether beginning in the second or the third quarter, after the unexpected and indeed   inexplicable surge over the previous three quarters  Now, part of this slowdown could also be   the cumulative effect of monetary policy tightening  But I think Chart 2 in the staff's outlook   packet suggests that tighter financial conditions cannot explain much of the second-quarter   slowdown   Presumably, there are good rules of thumb for how policymaking should respond to   unexpected economic developments  In this case, I don't believe rule number one would be to   ignore the new data and continue to set policy based on the old forecast  The new data at the   very least raise the degree of uncertainty about the forecast  And this high order uncertainty   may reasonably justify a more cautious policy response to the old forecast  This difference   reflects the fact that the forecast is the mode of the probability distribution associated with the   outlook, while policymakers should take into account the full probability distribution associated   with the forecast     Let me turn to a few comments on the inflation outlook  I was also quite surprised by   the very small increase in average hourly earnings in May  It altered my story, and I hate that!            74  And it interrupted what appeared to be a definitive change in the trend in the series, based on   the fact that average hourly earnings had increased at a 4-1/2 percent annual rate over the first   four months of the year, following a 3-1/2 percent rate over 1999  With the May data we have a   38 percent rate over the first five months, so the case for a change in the underlying trend is   less definitive  It seemed to me that this stable pattern in average hourly earnings contradicted   the anecdotal reports, which have been suggesting that pressures for wage change are building   This contradiction was driven home in this room not too long ago when I had a   meeting with state bankers as part of one of the state banking association meetings  It was a day   after I had given my last outlook talk  The head of the bankers group took out a newspaper   article about my talk, which began by identifying me as an inflation hawk  It then went on to   report that I had said the data did not yet indicate a clear pattern of rising wage gains  He   wanted to have a little fun with me, obviously, so he said  What kind of a hawk is it who can't   see the clear change in wage pressures in the real world?  I'm going to help you out, he   continued  We’re going to go around this table and we're going to let everybody straighten you   out  So, everybody at the table gave his or her story about how much wages were going up,   how many workers they were losing, what percentage wage gain those workers were getting   when they moved to their next job, and what it meant for recruitment and training costs to   business firms  To be sure, their view was that what had happened to date was raising wage   pressures and compressing profit margins, not increasing prices  So, I think it's interesting that   on the wage side the anecdotal stories seem to have become clearer but the data remain mixed    On the price side it's just the reverse; the anecdotal stories about pricing leverage still suggest   that price performance remains fairly good  But it seems to me that the data on prices are clear   and that inflation is rising  It is rising whether one looks at overall inflation or at the core           75  inflation measures  I think President Parry made a very good point that the increase in inflation   to date, in core measures as well as the overall rate, can be pretty well attributed to the primary   and now the secondary effects of higher energy prices  So the impact of these rising wage   pressures has not been definitively felt yet on inflation  But in the staff forecast it will be, and   that is my judgment as well  Therefore, in the context of tomorrow's policy decision, the   tentative signs suggest some slowing in the economy of yet uncertain persistence and   dimension, but still with very tight labor markets and already rising trends in inflation       I always look forward to these opportunities to have broader   discussions on long-term goals and strategies, and I agree with the Vice Chair that it would be   good to do this on a regular basis at each of these two-day meetings  Let me give you a few   thoughts on both the monetary aggregates and inflation targeting    I agree with Presidents Broaddus and Poole that one of the desirable features of our   discussions of the monetary aggregate ranges was that there really was in that process an   implicit inflation targeting  So, while we are not prepared to have an explicit discussion and pin   that target down, we did it implicitly when we set the ranges  Secondly, I am one who still   believes that there is information content in monetary aggregates and that they are very much   worthwhile monitoring  I quite agree with the Chairman's proposal  If we no longer have to set           90  ranges for the monetary aggregates for Congress as part of the Humphrey-Hawkins process, it   would be reasonable not to set ranges because we don't pay enough attention to them as a   Committee to justify that  As for myself, I do pay attention to the monetary aggregates  I get a   briefing on them before each FOMC meeting  And I'm going to ask the staff now to prepare a   packet as part of that briefing with ranges that I feel are more reasonable and from which the   information content can be extracted visually  So I think that is still useful to do   In terms of inflation targeting, I make a big distinction between inflation targeting as   strategy, particularly when it means going to a single objective for monetary policy, and setting   an explicit target for inflation as part of our present dual mandate  I think it is a very big   distinction  There are also distinctions about inflation targeting today as a methodology; it is an   approach to hitting inflation as well as a procedure that has a numerical target for inflation  I   am very much committed to a dual mandate  I think that is the right way to go  But, as you   know, if we think about that dual mandate and how to achieve it from the perspective, say, of   the Taylor Rule, we are forced to put some number in there for our inflation target  I am always   amused to get the “rules packet” because when I open it up I see 2 percent in there  Where did   that come from?  Well, that was John Taylor's target  So we sit around the table and we look at   simulations from the rules packet based on John Taylor's thoughts on what is the appropriate   inflation target  I think it might be reasonable for us to tell the staff what our inflation target is   and have the packet done that way    Would it really matter?  In other words, are we fighting over something that is not   that important?  Well, I agree that there is a good deal of consensus among us, but there is a   range of views  I have a view--I call it price stability plus a cushion--that may be a little higher   than some others would have, but I think it is useful for us to have coherent internal discussions           91  and appropriate transparency regarding what we're trying to do  I believe we should try to agree   among ourselves and communicate to the public where we are trying to go because the public   could say they are not really sure where we are going  Is 2 percent for the CPI just about right?    Do we understand what that means and if we achieve that rate for the CPI is everything fine?    Or are we really heading for zero?  Well, that is a big difference  Do we know?     So, I think at least some further discussion of this issue is worthwhile  And while I   don't see us moving any time soon, I think having an opportunity to voice such issues around   the table when we have these two-day meetings and to make some incremental progress toward   a consensus is really valuable  I have enjoyed this discussion this morning  Thank you     Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation, too  I should note   that this was the position I felt comfortable with as I went home for the weekend  And when the   Bluebook came and I opened it, I found that it was sort of arguing with me and questioning   whether I should feel comfortable with that decision, given my views  It noted, for example,   that this position would be appropriate if I wasn't sure that inflation would intensify going   forward  I guess that depends on what we mean by “sure”  That is a word that forecasters are   loathe to use under any circumstances  But I do think that inflation is more likely to rise  The   next thing the Bluebook said was that this position would be appropriate if I was less convinced   than the staff that output is beyond potential  Well, I am at least as convinced as the staff that   output is beyond potential  So I am certainly struggling with this           112  Then, as if that wasn’t enough, the Bluebook went on to say that if you want to take   the view that interest rates should go up you should hold the following views  First, that   indications of slower expansion are still tentative  Okay, I believe that  Second, that resource   utilization is still quite high  Well, I believe that, too  Third, that some of the earlier financial   restraint has been unwound by the recent rally in bond and equity markets  That is factually   true  And fourth, I should be in favor of tightening especially if I believe that growth may have   to slow to below trend to unwind the prevailing excess in the labor market  Well, I believe all   those things, so I did have to struggle more than most with this decision     I don't put extraordinary weight on what goes on at one meeting  I think getting the   direction and the overall response right is what is really important  So, I can feel comfortable   with holding pat today because we have moved so decisively since last June and also because I   believe that the data are likely to show the wisdom of moving further perhaps as early as by the   next meeting  And given what we have done in the past, I am confident that we will do what   needs to be done at that time and get it done in a timely fashion to insure a favorable outcome   So, I support your recommendation with the confidence that we have taken steps to   mitigate the risks of higher inflation, but also with the belief that our work is not yet done        Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’m going to focus my remarks this morning   entirely on productivity, specifically on the implications for the outlook of the apparent further   acceleration in structural productivity growth  If I had a title, I think it would be “In Celebration of   Accelerating Productivity”  I’m going to use a handout a little later in my remarks--or at least the   first two pages of my handout--but please, no peeking yet!  3   As it turns out, I’m going to respond directly to Governor Ferguson who said that those of   us who characterize our views of the economic outlook and challenges for monetary policy in terms   of NAIRU have a very heavy burden in terms of communication  I think he’s absolutely correct    And I rise to the challenge!  [Laughter]  To me the most important developments since our last   meeting were the revisions to the path of productivity over the last several quarters and the higher-                                                    3 A copy of the material used by Mr Meyer is appended to this transcript  (Appendix 3)       61  than-expected value of productivity in the second quarter  Likewise, the most important parts of the   revisions to the Greenbook forecast for me related to productivity  They were the upward revision to   the assumption about structural productivity growth and the interesting decision to build into the   forecast a further acceleration in structural productivity, as implied by the capital deepening path   associated with the staff forecast   Now, I think President Poole made a very worthwhile point about the need for caution in   extrapolating productivity acceleration going forward  But I rather like what the staff did in this case   because it made their forecast more internally consistent  They have a path of capital spending; they   have an assumption about capital deepening  And what they really did was to endogenize their   projection of productivity to keep it consistent with the capital deepening going on in the model    Still, as others have pointed out, it probably would be useful to have alternative scenarios with   different productivity paths since this is so very important to the outlook   Let me now turn to an interpretation of the Greenbook forecast  What is happening in this   forecast is that the staff has revised upward the path of both actual and potential GDP growth by   about the same amount, preserving almost the same unemployment path as it had last time  But   inflation is lower as a result of the impact of a further acceleration in productivity on inflation, an   effect I want us to focus on in a minute  The picture is clearly bright  We have higher growth and   lower inflation than in the previous forecast  But what is also important is that the Greenbook has   preserved the qualitative story of the last Greenbook and previous Greenbooks, and that is that the   unemployment rate is still below the staff’s estimate of what I’m going to refer to as the short-run or   effective NAIRU  And as a result, there is upward pressure on inflation due to tight labor markets,   though less so than would otherwise be the case because of the acceleration of productivity  Indeed,   over the next year and a half, the dissipation of the secondary effects of energy costs on core       62  inflation just offsets the upward pressure that demand is exerting on it, leaving the core rate about   unchanged  But thereafter core inflation would begin to rise in a longer-run forecast  We would see   that, for example, in the five-year and longer kinds of projections like those we had in the Bluebook   at the meeting last time  And over the still longer run, as the short-run NAIRU converges to the   long-run NAIRU, there could still be more rapid increases in inflation unless and until supply and   demand were rebalanced     I think the keys to understanding the role of productivity in the forecast have to do with   two fundamental issues  One is the effect of productivity on aggregate demand as well as aggregate   supply  We know that the staff has argued, I think persuasively, that over the last four years the   increase in productivity has actually increased demand by more than supply, resulting in the decline   in the unemployment rate that we’ve seen  They make a break from that approach in this forecast by   moving to balanced increases in demand and potential supply  That, I think, is supported by the   more modest tone of the economic indicators and by the relatively subdued path of equity prices   recently  But we have an important element here of upside risk because we certainly could get a   repetition of the pattern we have had over the last four years, in that each acceleration of productivity   actually brought with it even sharper increases in demand     The second effect is the one I particularly want to focus on, and that is the temporary   disinflationary impetus that comes whenever we have an acceleration in productivity  Now, we are   only beginning to learn about the complex dynamics associated with an increase in productivity   growth  First of all, there is not even widespread consensus about the framework that I’m going to   be using here, though it is implicit in the staff forecast as well  But we really don’t have a lot of   historical data from which to learn about the impact of adjusting to big increases in productivity  We   had the big decline in productivity in the 1970s and we have this recent experience with acceleration       63  in productivity, and that’s it  We have very few data points  So, there’s a lot of uncertainty about   how it all works out   What I want to focus on, then, is the power and persistence of the temporary   disinflationary effect associated with the acceleration in structural productivity  Let’s look at that   first term on the first page of the handout  What I identify there is the effect on inflation of an   acceleration of productivity as being related to this term the difference between q, which is the   actual trend productivity now--for example, 3-1/2 percent in the staff forecast--and q*, which is a   moving average of trend productivity  The key in this analysis is that wages respond more slowly to   increases in trend productivity than prices, and this gap reflects that difference  The q* is a moving   average of that trend in productivity, which reflects the slower impact on wages  As a result of this   asymmetric response of wages and prices, an acceleration of productivity temporarily lowers   inflation  And that exact term shows up in the price specification of the Phillips curve if there is an   asymmetric response of wages and prices to inflation  Just to give you an idea of how powerful this   might be, take a look at the second page where I plotted out that term--the difference between trend   productivity and a moving average of trend productivity  I based the estimate of the moving average   on a 40-quarter moving average  I picked that particular length because that’s the specification the   staff uses in solving their wage equations and they found that that works relatively well  What we   see here is that because we have such a long lag length, the increases in productivity that we’ve seen   cumulate; they don’t dissipate  They are still cumulating and getting to the highest impact we’ve   seen  This term is now 1-1/2 percentage points; that says that the acceleration of productivity is now   responsible for about a 1-1/2 percentage lower inflation rate than we otherwise would have had     You don’t have to turn to the mathematical derivations on the third page unless you are a   glutton for punishment, but the estimation is all worked out there in gory detail  But I think it       64  probably overstates the disinflationary impact for a couple of reasons  One, there is a good reason to   believe, or I think it is plausible, that part of this acceleration of productivity would be absorbed by   firms through a higher profit share during this period  So, not all of this acceleration is passed on in   the form of lower prices  Secondly, it’s very hard to estimate the lag here  Some equations, in   particular those in the FRBUS model, have a shorter lag  To approximate this effect in that model   would involve a lag of about 3 years as opposed to 10 years  And if that were the case, it would cut   this disinflationary effect by about two-thirds  It would only be about ½ percentage point     So, it seems to me that this framework helps to explain why an acceleration in   productivity temporarily lowers inflation for a given unemployment rate while preserving the role of   balance between supply and demand in labor markets as an important force in inflation dynamics--  indeed, the importance of the long-run NAIRU once q* converges back to q  What it suggests to me   is that this further acceleration in productivity is definitely a powerful force holding down inflation   relative to what it otherwise would be  I think the staff forecast of about-stable core inflation   through next year and an upward creep after that makes a lot of sense  And it suggests that we might   have somewhat more time in terms of dealing with the day of reckoning  But we have to be mindful   that the unemployment rate might still be below the short-run NAIRU here and that ultimately these   demand pressures will become more meaningful should we get a convergence of the short-run   NAIRU back to the long-run NAIRU once productivity growth stabilizes        Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation for no change in the funds   rate and to maintain the assessment that the risks are still unbalanced toward higher inflation  I just   want to give a perspective on the unbalanced risks issue   Whenever we have an acceleration of productivity growth, we have the following choices    We can take it for a while in temporarily higher output or we can take it in potentially permanently   lower inflation  I think so far what we have done is to take it all in the form of higher output  Core   CPI inflation today is exactly the same as it was at the end of 1995 on a methodologically consistent   basis  That is fine  But I would argue that we have to be particularly vigilant about an upward creep   in inflation going forward because once this productivity acceleration effect dissipates, inflation will   rise  And it is better if that rise takes place from a level closer to our long-run inflation objective than   from a level that has already drifted above it          80   The second reason is that an acceleration of productivity is the classic opportunity for   opportunistic disinflation  So, it does seem a little strange to allow an extraordinary experience of an   acceleration of productivity to be accompanied by an upward creep in inflation  For both those   reasons, I think we need to stay with the statement on unbalanced risks  I think they are unbalanced   and even though inflation performance remains very favorable, I believe we have to be very vigilant   about rising inflation going forward        Thank you, Mr Chairman  I will focus my remarks this morning on what   I view as the three key themes in the Greenbook forecast  While David Stockton has already      68  emphasized the considerable uncertainty that attaches to each of them, these themes are consistent   with the qualitative aspects of my own view of the outlook  First, the economy appears to be making   a transition from above-trend to below-trend growth  Second, the balance of risks is nevertheless   toward rising core inflation  And this risk not only persists throughout the forecast period; it will   likely remain for a considerable period of time thereafter  Third, if oil prices decline over the next   two years, consistent with expectations in futures prices, overall consumer price inflation will likely   decline next year and the upward drift in core inflation will be significantly restrained over the   forecast period     The balance of risks toward higher inflation, even if growth remains modestly below   trend, reflects an assessment that the prevailing unemployment rate is below the short-run NAIRU   and the prospect that the short-run NAIRU will rise as productivity growth stabilizes, or at least rise   at a slower rate than over the last several years  The upward pressure on core inflation in the   Greenbook comes from the gap between the prevailing unemployment rate and the staff’s 4-3/4   percent estimate of the short-run NAIRU  The staff projects no increase in the short-run NAIRU   over the forecast period  And a subsequent convergence toward the long-run NAIRU would   presumably be a source of continuing inflation pressure beyond the forecast period     There have been already many well deserved compliments to the authors of the   Greenbook, but I can’t resist noting that no member of this Committee has a greater appreciation for   their careful analysis of the unemployment rate relative to the short-run NAIRU and the long-run   NAIRU than I do  Of course, the staff took no chances in this Greenbook  With all the alternative   simulations, including the one with a 4 percent long-run NAIRU, there was something for   everybody  And that’s a good thing, I’m sure       69  The first two themes in the Greenbook story, below-trend growth and rising core inflation,   are features of what I have called a “reverse soft landing”  There is a transition to growth at   potential from an initial point above potential via a period of below-trend growth  During the   transition demand pressure results in an upward trend for core inflation unless other supply shocks   intervene  So while many outside and some inside the FOMC will regret a slowdown to below-trend   growth, I continue to believe that such a reverse soft landing is the most benign outcome possible,   given my assessment of the relationship between actual and potential output today     The earlier period of above-trend growth and declining core inflation and the projection of   below-trend growth and rising inflation over the forecast period are, in my view, two sides of the   economy's adjustment to the acceleration in productivity growth  Initially, an acceleration in   productivity yields a powerful disinflationary impetus  It may allow a decline in both   unemployment and inflation  That is the bright side of the adjustment to the acceleration of   productivity that we have enjoyed for the last four or five years  It has offered policymakers a   choice among only favorable outcomes temporarily lower unemployment, lower inflation, or some   combination  Now the time may have arrived when we have to face the other side of that   adjustment  When the temporary disinflationary impetus of the productivity gains dissipates, the   demand pressure at the prevailing unemployment rate will begin to show through to higher unit labor   costs and inflation unless, of course, productivity growth continues to rise aggressively enough to   postpone that adjustment     On the other side of the adjustment process we face a less favorable set of choices--some   combination of below-trend growth and rising core inflation, as in the Greenbook, until output is   realigned with potential  The closer growth is to potential during this part of the adjustment, the   sharper will be the cumulative rebound in inflation  The staff forecast does, nevertheless, offer a      70  very benign outcome over the next 2-1/2 years  The key assumptions that contribute to that benign   outcome are that oil prices decline over most of the forecast period and that a tighter monetary   policy prevents a premature rebound in growth to or beyond trend as long as there is upward   pressure on core inflation The result is steady growth at a rate more than 50 percent higher than the   average of the 20 plus years prior to the mid-1990s, with an average unemployment rate still close to   the lowest over the last 30 years and still modest rates of overall inflation  This is not as good as the   experience during the bright side of the adjustment process, but it would still be a pretty impressive   next chapter in this expansion     While I appreciate the uncertainty about the estimate of both the short-run and the long-  run NAIRU, the Greenbook forecast and analysis highlights the risks of higher inflation that may   still remain, even if the economy slips into an extended period of below-trend growth     I support the recommendation      Yes, it’s like mixing apples and oranges here  You’re taking one   forecast and another rate assumption that’s based on a different model and a different forecast  I   think the comparison that is always worthwhile to make is to ask how your baseline federal funds               25      rate forecast relates to what’s in the futures market  But I don’t find particularly instructive a   forecast that uses the futures market interest rates and otherwise the staff assumptions     There is in my view relatively little change in the outlook compared to   the assessment at our last meeting  The data and developments we’ve seen since that meeting,   however, do reinforce the expectation that we have transitioned into a period of below-trend   growth  In addition they justify a small downward revision to the forecast of real GDP growth,   at least over the next few quarters, in line with the adjustment in the Greenbook forecast  The   two most important developments were highlighted in the staff presentation on the outlook this   morning  First, there has been a deterioration in financial conditions, including the wider quality   spreads, especially for below investment-grade bonds and tighter lending standards by banks   and, second, a heightened anxiety about the financial conditions of some emerging market   economies, especially Argentina   The deterioration in financial conditions in the United States reflects a response to the   slowdown that is under way and reinforces the prospect of continued below-trend growth  Both   developments add an element of downside risk to the forecast  The qualitative story nevertheless   remains unchanged  We appear to be headed, in my view, to a period of below-trend growth and   at the same time rising core inflation  If oil prices decline as projected in the Greenbook, overall   inflation is likely to diminish and the rise in core inflation is likely to be significantly damped   over the forecast period   The focus in our discussion this morning is clearly on assessing or reassessing the   balance of risks in the forecast  In assessing the balance of risks, we have to look at both the               71      risks in the baseline forecast and the risks relative to the baseline forecast  The risks, for   example, are balanced in the baseline Greenbook forecast between below-trend growth and a   rising unemployment rate on the one hand and rising core inflation on the other hand  This is an   uncomfortable mix but one that may be inevitable following the long period of above-trend   growth and the decline in the unemployment rate to its current exceptionally low level  It is this   balance that I presume encouraged the staff to maintain a constant nominal funds rate through   the next year in the Greenbook forecast     Relative to the Greenbook baseline forecast, I'm slightly more concerned about weaker   growth, especially next year  And if growth turns out to be in line with the Greenbook   projection, I'm slightly more concerned that inflation might turn out to be higher than projected   in the Greenbook  My assessment of the risks reflects my view that both the temporary demand   and disinflationary effects of the productivity acceleration may now be dissipating     While the risks in and relative to the baseline forecast may now be more balanced--  and I think that is the case--there are nevertheless a number of reasons for this Committee to   delay a move from a statement that the risks are unbalanced toward higher inflation to one of   balanced risks  First, we’ve had only a single quarter of below-trend growth after 4-1/2 years of   persistent above-trend growth  We might want to be more confident that growth will remain   below trend before we take such a step  Second, the unemployment rate today is at its cyclical   low and significantly below the staff's estimate of the short-run NAIRU  We might not want to   remove the disproportionate focus on inflation risks until we see labor market tightness unwind   at least a little  And third, the benign inflation forecast depends importantly on the assumed               72      decline in the price of oil  We might want to wait until we see at least some confirmation of that   trend   My greatest concern today is that a move to a balanced risk assessment would   reinforce expectations of a near-term easing  I would have less of a problem if financial markets   expected a balanced risk assessment and incorporated expectations of a stable funds rate going   forward  Perhaps the issue is how to communicate our assessment that the risks have become   more balanced without appearing to downgrade our concern about the risk of higher core   inflation and without reinforcing expectations of a near-term policy easing   Finally, with core inflation at or above my long-run target and with a further increase   in core inflation over the forecast horizon and beyond in the Greenbook and my own forecast, I   would prefer that we be very cautious about removing an assessment that the risks are weighted   mainly toward higher inflation  True, growth is also expected to be below trend, and we have to   be alert to the downside risks  But below-trend growth when output is above potential, as I   believe is the case, is desirable That’s exactly what we need to mitigate the risks of rising core   inflation  There is nothing, on the other hand, desirable about the projected rise in core inflation    Maintaining the statement of unbalanced risks would effectively reinforce the point that, given   the prevailing tightness in the labor market and inflation already above our long-run objective,   there is a higher than normal threshold before the Fed would consider easing  I believe that   would be the right message to send     Don, I have a question about the analytical framework you   used in the earlier part of your discussion  I may have misunderstood you but it seemed   to me that you were saying that maximum sustainable growth is the translation of the   objective of maximum employment--sort of identical to that in some sense  My reaction   is that that's not the way I ever thought about it  It seems to me that maximum   employment is a utilization rate concept  And we have the problem here that this   slowdown in growth may in fact be pushing the output level to our target--not away from   our target, but to our target And that's good     But inflation, given that we are perhaps already above where   we’d like to be, is clearly pushing it away     That’s absolutely fair  The question is how far along we are   and whether that's a situation that would really be useful in 2002 or 2003 or whether it’s   relevant in the next several months     I take it that’s from a framework similar to the Greenbook and   maybe that's my problem  But beginning with an unemployment rate of 39 percent,   where the long-run NAIRU might be closer to 5-1/2 percent, it just seems a bit premature   to be worrying about that  If we were at a different starting point, then I would agree that   that could be relevant     Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation in all respects    Specifically, I think we should retain the statement of unbalanced risks  And I thought   the statement that you read was excellent       Just one point to follow up on that One possible way to operate is to note   that while we’re no longer required to report targets for the monetary aggregate it doesn’t mean that   we shouldn’t be monitoring and looking at them  They still play the role of anchoring a sense of   inflation targeting     Thank you, Mr Chairman  There are two key questions that highlight, at   least for me, the challenges in making the forecast and setting the course of policy today  First, is   the growth rate in the Greenbook forecast over the next few quarters or the rate of revision in that   forecast over the two most recent intermeeting periods a better guide to what the forecast will be the   next time we meet?  If the current Greenbook forecast turns out to be on the mark, we have in my   view a relatively benign outcome  We would see some of the excesses arising from a long period of   above-trend growth unwind and would return to near-trend growth by 2002  That outcome would   contain the risk of higher inflation and likely extend the life of this expansion   I think there are two ways of describing this outcome  The first is as a reverse soft landing   emphasizing the therapeutic value of a slowdown  The second is a growth recession  We have had   around the table a bit of discussion of that concept  This emphasizes the pain associated with rising   unemployment, production cutbacks in areas where demand has weakened the most, profit   disappointments, declines in equity values, and the associated swing in consumer and business   confidence  But I'll remind you that these are just two different ways of describing the same   outcome   However, once the economy has slowed to below trend, the downside risks to the forecast   that earlier might actually have been welcomed, quickly become a source of serious concern  And as   President Moskow noted, when there is a rapid swing from above-trend growth to below-trend   growth it becomes, as it does at turning points, especially difficult to forecast  The internal      56  dynamics of the economy become very hard to anticipate  There are dangers of inventory cycles just   as there are at turning points and, therefore, of overshooting   While available monthly data seem consistent with the Greenbook forecast for the current   quarter, measures of confidence in some real-time anecdotal reports point to downside risks  In this   regard I really expect that the December data may be very helpful in getting a better handle on   whether the slowdown is stabilizing or deepening  I think an important key will be whether or not   production cutbacks in the fourth quarter make a significant contribution to slowing inventory   investment, as in the Greenbook forecast  Another important contingency is whether we face a   further significant decline in equity prices in response to additional profit disappointments   The second key issue we face today relates to the possibility--and in my mind strong   probability--that the economy was operating beyond sustainable capacity before this loss of   momentum  If so, the question is whether that requires a more cautious and measured policy   response to the slowdown to below-trend growth than would be the case if the economy were   operating close to capacity when growth moved to below trend  The answer here seems obvious, but   perhaps the real issue is the level of output relative to potential and our confidence in such a reading    Those who, like myself, believe we are operating beyond sustainable capacity welcome a slowdown   to below-trend growth while appreciating the importance of not allowing a slowdown to escalate to   one that is either excessive or to an outright recession  But certainly if I, like Governor Gramlich,   believed that 4 percent was a sustainable unemployment rate, I'd be right where he is in terms of the   need to ease quickly     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support your recommendation  I continue to   believe that a period of below-trend growth is constructive, but I'm mindful of the downside risks we   face today  I think one reason for being cautious about moving immediately is that the markets   already anticipate a move early next year and a cumulative easing of 100 basis points over the course   of next year  I don't think we should do or say anything at this meeting that would disconfirm or   unwind those expectations, but neither do I believe that it would be particularly constructive to   escalate them further  So, I think this is the right move for now  But this period of uncertainty is a   time when the incoming data may be very revealing, and an intermeeting move could certainly be a   possibility      Larry Meyer here  Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation  It   seems to me that we’re in a situation now that is very similar to the one we faced in September   and October of 1998  In late September of 1998 we made a small move but it led to great   disappointment in the market  We had a chance to come back in October with a further move   that changed the market’s expectations and gave it a psychological boost  Similarly, after our   last meeting, though we moved the balance of risks statement directly from one direction to   another the markets were still disappointed  This gives us a chance to reset the psychological   tone and expectations      I think this move is also justified by where the baseline forecast is today, and not just in   terms of the downside risks to that forecast  We’re seeing significant downward revisions in the   forecast and we now have expectations of growth that are quite a bit lower than we anticipated     1/3/01 19  when we undertook our tightening moves  So I think some modest easing is justified on that   basis    I do have some caution, though, about the future course of policy  I fully support this   move  The problem we have to worry about is how aggressively to respond in the future  I   would note two concerns  One is the literature on instrument instability  When the monetary   authority tries to make up for the lags in monetary policy, it sometimes responds very   aggressively to try to get quickly back to its target and, therefore, there's always a tendency to   overshoot  I think we want to be careful not to end up with swings in monetary policy that lead   to swings in economic growth from above trend to below trend and back to above trend  We   want to control that and try to achieve a more stable pattern  In addition, we shouldn’t lose sight   of the fact that we did want to encourage a slowdown, though it's now greater than I think we   wanted when we tightened policy  There are downside risks associated with that, so this move is   certainly justified  But going forward I think we want to be objective as well    In terms of the message, I would very much prefer not to go with a message that we’re   lowering the nominal funds rate to avoid a rise in the real funds rate  One, it's a complicated   message, and two, I don’t believe it  Third, if that is the right story, it’s probably not the right   thing to do; we should be lowering the real funds rate today  The way we measure the real funds   rate is typically with short-term inflation expectations, and I don’t find that argument very   persuasive  The economy has slowed dramatically  The degree of slowing may be still   deepening  We are lowering the real funds rate as an appropriate move to counter that       They can basically rebate it as a tax refund immediately or   spend it     The government would not accumulate private assets; the funds   would just flow right through     The government never acquires debt  It just rebates it right   back to the public instantaneously     That’s right; there is no surplus     Think of it as a “money rain” every day!      Thank you  Let me also begin by complimenting the staff on a   very excellent set of papers  Let me note, too, that I begin with a quite open mind  My   views are likely to change several times today as well as over time as we talk about this    What I want to do is to offer perhaps a still different perspective, so as to get a lot of   different ideas on the table   I have been thinking a little along the lines of what President Poole discussed,   in terms of a multiple part strategy with two or three components to it  The first   component involves options for providing for the secular growth of reserves and   currency, what we might call the permanent part of the portfolio  The way I think about   this is that I want to emphasize the diversification principle here rather than liquidity   because this isn’t the part of the portfolio that we would be buying and selling  These   assets are going to be accumulated gradually and held    When I begin to think about the diversification notion, it encourages me to take   the broadest possible approach so that we have the smallest impact on individual markets   and the least possibility of affecting credit allocation and relative interest rates  So, as   opposed to starting with state and local government debt, I actually excluded that market   because it is so small that we’d have to buy up the whole market to make even a dent  I   took a much more radical approach  I asked myself what market we could operate in that   would give us the opportunity to be the least intrusive and the most diversified, with the   least credit allocation effects  The answer, of course--I’m sorry to say--is the equity     1/30-31/01 28  markets, which are valued at about $22 trillion  So we’d have a very tiny percent stake in   that market  How would we do it?  I would say that we could add to that the corporate   bond market and the mortgage-backed securities market and focus on a strategy that is   rule-based and index-focused  It would be very difficult and very challenging  But it   would give us the opportunity to have a $200 billion component, or something in that   range, that is just a piece of America  [Laughter]  So, I throw that out on the table   Actually, I purposely did not include in that portfolio some of the more liquid   assets because those are going to be part of my second component, which is the short-run   portfolio or the liquidity portfolio  These assets would be used for carrying out the   normal monetary policy stabilization efforts and for those occasions that require   temporary injections or withdrawals of liquidity  We also have to be prepared for an   occasional episode involving very large liquidity increases or decreases, and that’s a   particular challenge   For the second portfolio, to me the natural place to expand is in repurchase   agreements and I’d do that by broadening the range of acceptable collateral  The staff   has suggested extending the authorization for mortgage-backed securities and considering   municipal and foreign sovereign debt  That seems sensible, but that’s not the direction I   would have suggested  I would have thought immediately of commercial paper and high-  grade corporate debt because what I want to do is to rationalize the operations in agency   debt and mortgage-backed securities, and I’d do so by making sure that we also accept   RPs with collateral against a broader range of private assets  And we can view those   agencies as just another example of high-grade private assets       1/30-31/01 29  There are some other possibilities as well besides RPs  One would be buying   and selling money market mutual fund shares  We could also have a portfolio of GSE   bills and commercial paper, for example, that is shorter term like our Treasury bill   portfolio  It would allow us to operate--to buy and sell--in that area depending upon the   liquidity and size of those markets   A third component of my thinking was an intermediate portfolio that would be   useful for meeting seasonal needs when there are swings that are somewhat predictable   but can be sizable  That would provide a complement to both our permanent portfolio   and our liquidity portfolio  There I found the ACF facility quite attractive, but I’m not   thinking about it as $100 to $200 billion in size  That’s a size where it becomes   problematic or could become problematic for reasons that some have already suggested    I’m envisioning something on the order of $20 to $50 billion  It has to have an average   size of about that amount so it could be run down if necessary--or built up--but never   become too sizable a part of the portfolio   I also agree that we need an incremental strategy here  We want to put off as   long as possible moving into this very broadly diversified portfolio because it raises so   many challenges  An infrastructure is required, which is expensive to put in place, and it   subjects us to political risks as well  So the transitional steps do suggest that we should   begin to think more about broadening the range of collateral for RPs  We should also   begin to consider, and even experiment with, auctions of discount window credit    Moreover, we should continue to study and evaluate options and procedures, should we   want to move ahead with broader diversification of the portfolio     Just one point  Our strategy needs to take into account the   strategy of the Federal government because the government itself is going to be   developing an asset allocation strategy as part of this process     Peter, a question  Part of the rationale for bringing in the   municipal and the foreign sovereign securities was that the authority to operate in those   instruments was available under existing law  That would give us the added flexibility to   make it through a reasonable period as we entertain more challenging options  But you   also noted that in part this strategy was a way of diluting the special status of Fannie Mae   and Freddie Mac securities  It seems to me that it does just the opposite  What it says is   that we operate only in collateral that is government sponsored     I will simply reiterate that it seems to me to reinforce the status   of those entities as a government related--     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The trend of downward revisions   in the staff and private sector consensus forecasts, as well as in my own, has continued   over the intermeeting period  While they now point to near zero or even slightly negative   growth in the first quarter, there is yet no evidence that the forecasts for the near term   have themselves stabilized  There has been a lot of talk around the table of pessimism   regarding the near-term outlook, so I thought I’d focus my remarks on the basis for some   optimism about the recovery from this very sharp slowdown    That optimism is founded on several considerations  First, I do believe that a   period of below-trend growth, which now seems inevitable at least through the first half   of this year and likely a little longer, will have beneficial aspects in terms of unwinding   some of the excesses of the long period of robust growth  And I refer not only to the   probable excesses of output relative to potential  I'm talking about excesses in equity   valuations in some sectors, excesses in terms of a frenzied pace of investment that has   produced over-capacity in some sectors, and excesses in terms of leverage in both   household and business balance sheets  Now I admit that what I had in mind, or had   hoped for, was a much more gentle version of what I called a reverse soft landing in   response to our policy tightening  But the sharper version has the benefit of getting the   job done quickly, allowing the Fed to ease as the process is under way   The second reason for optimism is that I see, as the staff portrayed very well in   its presentation, a series of reinforcing developments in support of a projected recovery in   the second half of this year and into 2002  Monetary policy will clearly be supporting   such a recovery, with the combined dissipation of the restraining effects of the earlier     1/30-31/01 166  tightening and the effects of the recent and prospective easing  The prospect of further   declines in energy prices remains good and the projected depreciation of the dollar is in   my view plausible  And perhaps especially important is the assumption that the   underlying pace of productivity growth will remain high, if not as high as was earlier   projected  This suggests an accumulation of profitable investment opportunities at the   low rates of investment projected through the first half of this year, setting the foundation   for sizable increases in equipment spending in the second half and into 2002  Last, but   probably not least among the forces that may support recovery is that we will have fiscal   stimulus  I suspect that the coming fiscal stimulus may be understated in the Greenbook    I would not be surprised to see the tax cut become effective earlier and to be larger   cumulatively or more front-loaded--or both--than implied in the Greenbook projection   A third consideration that supports some optimism is that the sharpness of the   decline in production that appears under way this quarter may reflect a very front-loaded   inventory correction  Perhaps this will be an IT version of the traditional inventory cycle,   one that is sharper but also shorter than classic inventory corrections      To achieve a balance between the anxiety about the immediate weakness and   near-term downside risks versus the optimism about a relatively quick revival and a move   toward trend growth next year creates a real challenge for monetary policy  That's   because of both the lags in the effects of monetary policy and the practical difficulties of   rapidly reversing the direction of policy, especially from easing to restraint  The policy   challenge is that there may be nothing or little we can do about the weakness in the   economy during the period when it’s likely to be most intense, namely in the first half of     1/30-31/01 167  2001 and especially in the first quarter  But we can powerfully reinforce the rebound that   the staff projects with only slight additional easing     So the questions we face today are how much insurance we should buy against   a sharper and more persistent downturn and what degree of rebound we want to   encourage on top of the forces I have mentioned above  It’s relatively easy to see the   appropriateness of front-loading, so I don’t think the decision that we face at our meeting   tomorrow is that difficult  But I do believe we will face a challenge thereafter about how   to continue       Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation  I believe that’s   the right move for today but I completely concur with the remarks of President Jordan  I   think we have to exercise care in the expectations that we encourage in the markets about   the certainty and the cumulative size of the likely amount of future easing, particularly in   light of what I view as a still plausible and sensible baseline scenario in the Greenbook   One point I would like to make is that I’ve always looked forward to these   two-day meetings as an opportunity to talk about some broader issues on the strategy of   monetary policy  This morning doesn’t seem to be the time to do that, given the nature of   the discussion around the table  But I would hope, as we plan the agenda for future two-  day meetings, that we would allow time for some comments that I would like to make   about the appropriateness and direction of policy, how we monitor the monetary   aggregates, and how we set inflation targets and our rules packet  I’m always amused   that we start off from the inflation target that John Taylor set but do so without any   communication from the Committee to the staff about the inflation objectives Committee     1/30-31/01 188  members might have  But I’ll save that topic for future discussions and express my hope   that future agendas will allow more time for such discussions     Is it necessary?  It seems there is more detail than is necessary   in this release   SEVERAL  Yes, in this release   SPEAKER(?)  Have we ever said this before?      Three highly interrelated developments over the intermeeting   period have, in my view, strengthened the case for further easing  The first relates to the   more powerful negative wealth effect due to the slide in equity prices, the further decline   in consumer confidence, the possibility of a more serious shakeout or retrenchment in   high-tech investment, and the prospects for weaker foreign growth  All those factors   point to weaker consumer and investment spending and weaker exports over the forecast   period for a given funds rate path  Despite these concerns, the incoming data are mixed   and there is considerable uncertainty about the strength of spending going forward   A second consideration reinforcing the case for further easing is that broader   financial conditions have not eased--at least not appreciably--despite the decline in the   funds rate to date and despite expectations in the market for considerable further declines   in the funds rate  Instead, the decline in equity prices and the strengthening of the dollar   have significantly offset the stimulus from lower short-term interest rates   Third, and perhaps more speculatively, although David Stockton mentioned   this in his presentation, recent developments may be consistent with a decline in the   economy’s equilibrium real interest rate  The staff, as you know, has been working on   estimating a time-varying measure of the equilibrium real funds rate  One of the key   drivers of the equilibrium real rate is the equity premium  To the extent that the recent   decline in equity prices is a reassessment of fundamental values rather than a cyclical     3/20/01 77  correction, it implies a rise in the equity premium and a decline in the equilibrium real   rate  In this case, the federal funds rate might need to be lowered more aggressively than   would be suggested by movements in the output gap or inflation  Of course, this line of   analysis has some implications for the appropriate response to a decrease in the equity   premium, but that’s another story   Let me turn to the question of why the economy has slowed so sharply and   what the implications are for the forecast and the policy response  One hypothesis is that   we’re in the middle of an IT inventory correction, one that is sharper and faster than   traditional inventory corrections but with less persistence  This would be consistent with   the so-called V-shaped recovery  I don't disagree that the current inventory correction   may be sharper and swifter than traditional corrections, but I do not think that is the most   important theme in the story nor even the most important way in which new economy   developments are shaping the slowdown  The deeper story in my view is the interaction   of a cyclical slowdown and a correction of pre-existing imbalances     Such a correction of imbalances is quite typical of recessions and, indeed,   often contributes to the severity of downturns  I will focus on two interrelated   imbalances at the start of the slowdown  One is the valuation of equities, particularly of   high-tech firms; the second is the rate of high-tech investment and/or stocks of high-tech   capital goods   First, consider the consequences of the apparent equity correction  The staff   estimates that the wealth effect, after adding as much as 1-1/2 percentage points to   consumer spending growth in the second half of 1999, will be subtracting about 1   percentage point throughout the forecast period  That will result in growth of consumer     3/20/01 78  spending at a rate below the growth in GDP  The tax cut assumptions in the forecast   make only a slight dent in the short run  As a result, returning to trend growth over the   forecast period requires a strong rebound in investment     Unfortunately, the second imbalance may be in the level of high-tech capital or   at least in the rate of high-tech investment  The V-shaped recovery depends on a strong   rebound in investment, reflecting continued high structural productivity growth and an   associated high expected rate of return on high-tech investment  But we also have to put   into the investment mix the legacy of excesses associated with the frenzied pace of   investment over the last few years  The result may be a period of shakeout or   retrenchment in high-tech investment that weighs against a quick and sharp rebound   Let me turn now to a critical set of assumptions underpinning the Greenbook   forecast  They happen to be very important in assessing the degree of cumulative easing   that might be required  Despite very similar paths for output, the Greenbook and Blue   Chip forecasts show very different paths for the unemployment rate  This is exactly the   issue that President Minehan remarked on earlier and that a number of others also have   mentioned today  The Blue Chip forecast, assuming what appears to be a similar policy   path to that in the Greenbook, depicts a quite benign soft landing, with the unemployment   rate moving just above 4-1/2 percent--close to the short-run NAIRU--and growth near   trend in 2002  In contrast, with about the same output path, the Greenbook has the   unemployment rate a full percentage point higher and growth still slightly below trend in   2002  As a result, that would call for a more aggressive easing over the forecast period    The first key assumption behind this difference, as President Minehan noted, is   the underlying rate of productivity growth  The staff assumes that structural productivity     3/20/01 79  growth is almost 1/2 percentage point higher than the assumption implicit in the Blue   Chip forecast  This explains a bit less than one-half of the difference     The second key may be how Okun’s Law is being applied  The Blue Chip   forecast seems consistent with applying a simple static form of Okun’s Law  The staff   appears to be applying a dynamic version, taking into account the delayed effect of the   slowdown to date, most of which has not yet passed through to employment  It’s hard to   argue with the Greenbook approach in this case  But there are some considerations that   might support a different dynamic in the labor market response to a slowing in growth    One example is the reluctance of firms to lay off workers, given the recent difficulty in   hiring them  At any rate, these considerations increase the difficulty of assessing at this   point just how much easing will be appropriate and provide a rationale for a gradual,   incremental strategy of easing     Thank you, Mr Chairman  My position is very similar to that   of Presidents Minehan, Broaddus, and Guynn, a little stronger than President Moskow’s    I support your recommendation for a 50 basis point decline in the target funds rate today,   along with a statement that the risks remain unbalanced toward economic weakness  But   I would very strongly prefer to avoid any direct or explicit hint in our statement of an   intermeeting move   I haven’t heard much support for a 75 basis point move, so I won't argue the   case for 50 as opposed to 75  A 50 basis point move today along with a statement of   unbalanced risks as always, as has been pointed out, holds open the possibility of an   intermeeting move  But hinting more directly at such a possibility in the statement,   especially if we repeat something like the words in our December 19th statement--in   effect using a code that will be interpreted as an inclination toward an intermeeting move   --would, in my view, be a mistake  It would leave market participants speculating day in   and day out about whether we were in or about to hold an emergency meeting to cut the   target funds rate  It could aggravate the market's response to every newly reported   indicator and it would leave equity prices continually buffeted by such speculation  This   type of uncertainty in my view has no up side   My preference to avoid a direct hint of an intermeeting move also reflects my   preference for policy decisions to be taken at our regular meetings  To be sure, there are   circumstances when an intermeeting move is a valuable part of our toolkit and, Mr   Chairman, you have used this tool sparingly and wisely in the time I've served on this   Committee  I am confident you will continue to do so  Still, I do not believe it would be     3/20/01 102  wise to set policy so as to leave the impression that an intermeeting move has a very high   probability or to tell the markets that we are so inclined     This is just a little stronger it seems to me because we didn't   say “especially” monitor, we said monitor “closely”     The discussion will all be on what “especially” means     I can’t vote “no”?     3/20/01 109    Okay      I’d like to make three points  First, I agree that the incoming   data suggest perhaps a slight downward revision to the near-term forecast but not much     4/11/01 20   change to the overall outlook  The change is not one that normally would be large   enough to justify an intermeeting move  On the other hand, I am somewhat pessimistic   about the challenge that lies ahead in terms of how long it will take us to get back to   trend  And, therefore, I do believe that we have further easing ahead of us  I wouldn’t be   surprised if we need to move a full percentage point between now and the end of June   The question is how to get there, which brings me to the issue of timing  My view has   been that 50 basis points at each of the next two meetings would be just fine and that   sooner isn’t always better than later  There’s a lot of uncertainty in the outlook and a   number of crosscurrents  Sometimes going a little slower allows one to get data that   either confirm or disconfirm one’s views  I also think it is better to move at meetings  I   like to have a full forecast in front of me and to have detailed presentations by the staff on   recent developments and the outlook  If we’re going to move between meetings, then I   think we need to have an appropriate justification  I think moving today at a time when   the markets have been pricing out the probability of an intermeeting move would only   lead to a great deal of confusion about what we are doing and how we are viewing the   economy  But given the fact that I do expect we will ease further, I couldn’t argue too   strenuously against a move if the data over the next few days are worse than expected  But my preference now would be to ease over the course of the next couple of meetings   MRGRAMLICH  This is Ned Gramlich  I prefer not to do intermeeting   moves too, but let me make three points  First, the economy is changing rather sharply   from last year to this year  Secondly, at the last meeting we didn’t make the full change   in rates that I frankly thought would have been appropriate at that time  We didn’t   because we don’t like to make too large a change in any one move, which is fine  Still, I     4/11/01 21   left that meeting feeling that rates were a little on the high side  And thirdly, it’s a long   time between meetings  So while I prefer not to make intermeeting moves, I don’t think   it’s wise to hold to that as an absolute no-no  Since our March meeting the data, as Dave   Wilcox said, have weakened slightly  And I’d just like to remind everybody that the   weakening is from a Greenbook forecast that already had the year-end unemployment   rate at 52 percent  So the economy is weakening from a forecast that already is showing   a weak economy  I would point out further that some people are taking solace in the fact   that housing, autos, and overall consumption have been fairly strong  But that could be a   danger sign as well because if those equations ever start working, we could have more of   a problem on our hands than we think   So my personal preference would be to do 50 basis points of easing as soon as   we possibly can  I’d like to find a tranquil time in the markets, but I would like to get out   there ahead of the data  Many of you have counseled waiting for another 10 days or so   and see more data  I would go the other way in that I would like to move ahead of the   data      Thank you  Mr Chairman, I see the outlook much the same as   you do and as a result I can support your recommendation  Nevertheless, I’ll voice one   last time my reservations about an intermeeting move at this time--and not just because   I'd prefer that moves be made at our regular meetings  Whatever the arbitrariness of the   schedule of meetings may be, I find it a bit difficult to believe that a one-month head start     4/18/01 10   is going to change the growth rate of the economy over the next year or 18 months    When I look back at the two previous intermeeting moves, I think they were extremely   well timed because the markets seemed not to have confidence in the Fed’s willingness to   move as aggressively as needed to lower rates to support the economy  Right now it   seems to me that the expectations in the market are pretty reasonable in terms of another   50 to 100 basis point decline in the funds rate between now and the middle of the year    So, I think that reason for a cut isn’t there     I am a little concerned that the stories following this cut are going to be   dominated by a sense of confusion  The question will be why so many FOMC members   talked up the economy, helped to squeeze out any expectations of an intermeeting move,   and then just as that was happening decided to come along with an intermeeting move    So I think it’s a mistake, though not a big mistake  It’s not a mistake for the economy, by   the way  I don’t think it will be damaging to the economy though it may be a little   damaging to the public’s confidence in the competency of policymaking     Mr Chairman, could I just raise one point about the statement?    I think it missed the most important development  By starting out with the notion that the   good news is that consumption is being well maintained, the statement is referring to an   historical fact of momentum in consumption because of the large increase in January    The fact of the matter is that consumption has not been well maintained; it has lost all its     4/18/01 16   momentum  It is going to be close to zero in the second quarter; that’s almost baked in   the cake by what has already happened in February and March  So I think we should   point to the clear loss of momentum in consumer spending that underlies the trend in   final sales going forward  That’s the key story      Thank you, Mr Chairman  My views of the outlook are very   consistent with both the qualitative story and the general details of the Greenbook forecast    Relative to that forecast, the risks in my view have become more balanced  I also share the view   that several others have expressed today--that given that forecast, we’re approaching the point   where it would be appropriate to become much more cautious about further easing       5/15/01     71   In the near term, the negative wealth effect and the retrenchment in high-tech   investment appear almost certain to be significant drags on the economy  As a result, growth   looks likely to remain very weak in the second and third quarters and then to gradually, and only   gradually, move back toward trend  The prospects for a gradual improvement reflect in part the   stimulus expected, but not yet evident, from the aggressive easing moves over the first part of   this year  Clearly, there are still downside risks     We have approached the point where we also have to pay more attention to the upside   risks  That may seem odd given that so much of the rise in the unemployment rate in this   episode may still lie ahead of us  But the decision to move aggressively toward stimulus in 50   basis point increments, and including two intermeeting moves, means that we may also need to   end the easing sooner  Indeed, we may get to the point where we have put in place an   appropriate degree of stimulus even before much of the effect of that stimulus becomes evident   The modest rise in core inflation and the upward adjustment to the staff’s inflation   forecast support this assessment  These developments confirm, in my view, that inflation risks   were indeed building before the economy slowed so sharply  In addition, these developments   point to what might lie on the other side of recovery  After recessions, the buildup in slack often   allows a period of disinflation during the early cyclical rebound and, at the very least, a   considerable period before concerns about rising inflation surface  The slowdown in this case   began in my view with output above potential and growth in demand above the rate of growth of   potential supply  In the Greenbook forecast the slowdown under way results in output falling   below potential, but not very far below, by the time growth returns to its potential rate sometime   in 2002  Indeed, in the Greenbook forecast, the unemployment rate rises to about the level of the   staff’s estimate of the long-run NAIRU in 2002, with the staff’s estimate of the short-run NAIRU     5/15/01     72   lagging behind, but not very far behind, and still converging with the long-run NAIRU  At any   rate, more so than in most cyclical downturns, there is potential for overshooting   Let me conclude with a few comments on the role of the productivity assumptions in   the Greenbook forecast  We have new data  The staff revised the estimates for 2000 going   forward, and the projections now suggest that structural productivity growth stabilized in 2000   after ratcheting higher over each of the preceding eight or so years  The continuing rise in   structural productivity growth in earlier years renewed each year the temporary bonuses   associated with rising structural productivity growth--specifically, the stimulus to aggregate   demand and the restraint on inflation  The apparent stabilization in structural productivity   growth in 2000 may, therefore, have contributed at the margin to both a weakening in aggregate   demand and to the upward pressure on inflation   The second feature of the productivity story is the decline in structural productivity   growth that the staff now projects for this year and next year  Just as the staff was quick to   revise upward its estimate of structural productivity growth in response to revised data and   prospects for capital deepening, they’ve been quick to revise it lower  Assuming the staff has   that right, the decline in structural productivity growth could also reinforce both the downdraft   on aggregate demand and contribute to upward pressure on inflation     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I can support your recommendation for a   50 basis point easing today and a statement that the risks remain unbalanced toward economic   weakness  On the other hand, I could also have joined Presidents Minehan and Broaddus in   supporting a case for slowing the pace of easing today and moving only 25 basis points  That   might have been a very effective way of signaling the sentiment that we now need to move   toward a more cautious monetary policy and that we may not be far from ending the easing cycle     But more importantly, Mr Chairman, I agree with you on what I believe is the really   important issue, and that is the prospect that we may be near the point--and perhaps after this   move at the point--where we have to be very cautious about any further easing      Actually, I think that would be a good idea  I also would like to see   two parts of the statement adjusted  I’d suggest that the very last part of the second paragraph,   which reads “threatens to keep the pace of economic activity unacceptably weak,” be toned   down a bit  It could say these factors “continue to weigh on the economy” or something like   that  The proposed wording seems a little too sharp  And perhaps we could add a reference--  maybe after the sentence that says the reduction in excess inventories seems well advanced--to   the fact that consumption and housing expenditures have held up reasonably well  We might   also note that the considerable easing over the last half year should begin to support economic   growth      Well, I think it would be good to have a different statement  That’s a   good reason to change it     Is that including the change I suggested in that paragraph?     I would like to try to draw out from these very interesting discussions   some implications for the near-term forecast  I want to focus on areas where the two approaches­    6/26-27/01 38   -we'll call them the staff approach and the Boston approach--agree and disagree  I take it that the   agreement is that currently structural productivity growth is around 2-1/2 percent and that that   represents an elevated level from the early 1970s to mid-1990s  The question is Do you agree   on the implication for the outlook--does that reflect an ongoing pace of innovation that is likely to   rekindle the appetite for investment and support some optimism going forward about your   assumption regarding high-tech investment?  Is that fair to say?    Now where you disagree, I take it, is whether or not we believe this   structural productivity growth overshot in some sense and is now reversing  The question is   How does that matter in your two visions?  Let me describe how I think the staff is looking at it,   particularly if equity values and investment respond sharply to the driving force behind the   productivity movements--that is, the changes in the pace of innovation and so forth that motivate   investment and give rise to optimism about earnings  It seems to me that the staff views it this   way That if the economy adjusts relatively rapidly to that, then that gives us support for   explaining why the economy was as strong as it was earlier  And the reversal has important   implications for the near-term outlook Do you want to reject that or--   I have a question for Sandy Struckmeyer on the treatment of capital   deepening You make no attempt to separate out cyclical from structural changes in the case you   presented You indicated that you don't do so because it's not useful in some sense, not that you   don't do it because it's too difficult or you don't know how to do it  But take the case of   permanent income growth  Couldn’t you argue that households, if they really had perfect   foresight, should look through blips and overshooting in structural productivity due to this kind   of overshooting in capital deepening because it isn't going to be sustained?  And, therefore, if you   were really trying to get it right, you would smooth these variations and end up with something   that was more stable    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I want to start by identifying three themes   that summarize my interpretation of the outlook context for today's policy decision  First, growth   appears to be at or below 1 percent for the third consecutive quarter and there are few signs in the   incoming data of an imminent rebound  This weakness reflects a combination of a negative   wealth effect on consumption, a sharp retrenchment in high-tech investment, the continued drag     6/26-27/01 125   from an incomplete process of inventory correction, and the sharper-than-expected weakening in   foreign economic activity    Second, several forces are in train that should collectively contribute to a gradual   improvement in the second half and a return to near-trend growth by early or mid next year    These include the considerable degree of monetary easing already in place, the fiscal stimulus on   the way--the checks are literally almost in the mail--and the prospects for a period of declining   energy prices In addition, a continued elevated rate of structural productivity growth, mirroring   the continued rapid pace of innovation and rapid decline in the relative price of high-tech   equipment, should rekindle the appetite for high-tech investment   Third, this cyclical episode is unique in an important respect  In my judgment the   slowdown in growth began with output above potential  As a result, if the consensus and   Greenbook forecasts are in the ballpark, when growth returns to near trend in 2002, the economy   will be operating close to full employment  This point is very closely related to Governor   Kelley's discussion that the economy, though it has lost momentum, remains at a high level of   output To be sure, there remains a high degree of uncertainty about both the sustainable   unemployment rate and the rate of trend growth, as well as about the timing and vigor of the   prospective strengthening in demand  But it seems to me that an important implication of the   Greenbook forecast is that the upturn in economic growth may begin in 2002 without the usual   slack present at the start of expansions  Indeed, we may begin 2002 where we usually find   ourselves late in an expansion--close to capacity, and at a place where we have to be particularly   alert to inflation pressures Chart 10 used in the staff's presentation on the outlook yesterday   illustrates this third theme  It shows that the unemployment gap was about 2 percentage points   early in this expansion The staff projects the gap to be near zero as we enter 2002     6/26-27/01 126   Now, the first theme evokes a concern about the downside risk relative to the baseline   and keeps on the table consideration of further easing, at least as an insurance move  On the   other hand, the second and third themes are more forward-looking and suggest upside risks,   specifically the potential for overshooting  These themes point to a more cautious approach to   further easing   Some have dismissed concerns about overshooting by noting that any risk could be   countered by our quickly moving to tighter policy once the economy shows more tangible signs   of revival That logic does not entirely relax me for two reasons First, I suspect that a quick   reversal of monetary policy is a lot easier when an easing is called for to partially undo an earlier   tightening rather than the reverse  In addition, while our job is to stabilize inflation and output,   not interest rates, there is some value in avoiding a pattern of excessively sharp movements up   and down in interest rates   Let me comment now on how the excellent staff analysis of the capital overhang, in   my view, fits into the story It seems to me that the capital overhang story contributes to both the   first and second themes--the prevailing weakness and the promise of a rebound  The main source   of the overhang, according to the staff, is a reassessment of the profitability of producing high-  tech capital  This lowered the target relative to the actual capital stock, potentially resulting in a   capital overhang The paper suggests, however, that a rapid response of investment and hence of   the actual capital stock to the decline in its target value has helped to prevent a serious overhang    The story does not diminish the importance of the retrenchment in high-tech investment in the   current period of economic weakness  A sharp decline in investment that has prevented a more   serious overhang and the effects of the modest overhang that nevertheless have resulted appear to   be important sources of the prevailing weakness in demand  But the analysis does suggest that     6/26-27/01 127   any capital overhang is likely to be modest and short-lived and, therefore, unlikely to be an   obstacle to the projected strengthening of the economy in the Greenbook forecast   From the productivity papers, I took two conclusions that help shape the forecast    First, both the Board staff and the Boston Fed believe that structural productivity growth will   remain elevated relative to the experience from the early ’70s to the mid-’90s  This contributes   to confidence in a rebound of high-tech investment next year  Second, and perhaps more   controversial, the Board staff believes that structural productivity growth may now have   decelerated At first I thought the projected partial reversal of the earlier acceleration in   structural productivity might be just a small wrinkle in the outlook  However, it appears that this   may be a more important part of the story, at least if the staff is correct about the dimension of   the deceleration The effects of accelerations and decelerations in productivity are, I would   expect, symmetrical  All the good news that comes with an acceleration turns into bad news   during a deceleration So whether or not there has been overshooting, and if so by how much,   would have an important influence on demand, equity prices, and inflation  In addition, the   effect of a possible deceleration of structural productivity growth on the equilibrium real rate   highlights one of the challenges perhaps faced by monetary policy in the recent slowdown  If   there has been a deceleration in structural productivity growth, monetary policy has had to ease   enough to lower the real funds rate relative to the declining equilibrium rate  The aggressive   easing has achieved this But if the economy moves to full employment and trend growth in   2002 as projected in the consensus and Greenbook forecasts, the challenge to monetary policy   soon will be to return to neutrality  The extended Bluebook simulations confirm this view     Two considerations significantly enhance the prospects of maintaining inflation under   control as we move toward neutrality the projected decline in energy prices and the still-low     6/26-27/01 128   capacity utilization rate projected to 2002  Still, how we set policy over coming months will also   be important in determining just how big a challenge the return to neutrality will be and what the   inflation rate will be when we get there    I believe that we may be at an important inflection point for monetary   policy It's important today, in my view, that we at least decelerate the pace of easing and signal   that the considerable degree of monetary easing in train is likely to contribute to improvement in   the pace of economic activity  Mr Chairman, I believe your recommendation for a 25 basis point   easing and a statement of unbalanced risks moves in this direction  A case could be made based   on the Greenbook forecast for holding the funds rate constant today and recognizing the   downside risks with a statement that the risks were unbalanced toward economic weakness  You   wouldn't have to twist my arm too much to get me to support that But your proposed policy   recognizes the clear downside risks that remain, while at least signaling a more cautious approach   to further easing It alerts markets that we may be at or near the end of an easing cycle  It makes   it easier for us to hold the funds rate constant at the next meeting, while also retaining the   flexibility to ease further should the incoming data point in that direction     The previous Greenbook projected some strengthening in growth in   the fourth quarter and a recovery to growth near trend and to a level of output near potential in   2002 And I believe there was a sense of agreement that if the forecast stabilized, that forecast   provided a strong case for holding policy unchanged after last meeting’s move  On the other   hand, the pattern this year has been a continuing series of downward revisions to the forecast,   followed by additional easing moves in an effort to restore the earlier forecast for 2002  So the   first questions I asked myself as I prepared for today’s meeting were “Has the forecast   stabilized?” and “Is the forecast for 2002 still lined up to a reasonable approximation on trend   growth and full employment?”  The answers will help me to assess both the need for further   easing and the room to maneuver--or the threat of overshooting in easing further     This assessment, however, is complicated, as David Wilcox noted in his presentation,   by the NIPA and productivity revisions The outlook context for monetary policy decisions in   my view is best viewed in terms of growth in actual output relative to potential and in terms of   utilization rates From this perspective, the growth rates for 2001 and 2002 in the Greenbook   forecast were marked down just about in line with the staff’s downward revision to trend growth,     8/21/01 55   thereby virtually replicating the previous Greenbook’s projections for the unemployment rate   and inflation  So if the story is still that forces are in train that will move the economy to   recovery and that the recovery will put the economy near full employment and trend growth next   year, it’s hard to see the need for further easing or the room to maneuver   But to tell the truth, the story doesn’t feel entirely right  There remains a tension   between the evidence of persistent weakness in the incoming data and the story of recovery  The   question we face in each forecast round is how many quarters lie between the data and the story    And what we end up doing again and again is inserting one more quarter that looks more like the   previous weak quarters--in this case it’s the fourth quarter of this year--before we get a   transitional quarter or two on the way to trend growth  At the very least this pattern suggests that   there are significantly asymmetric risks on the downside     In assessing how much easing is appropriate and whether we have done enough,   another consideration is important  Declines in the federal funds rate have little or no direct   effect on aggregate demand but are an instrument for encouraging a more accommodative   overall set of financial conditions, as the lower short-term rates pass through to lower longer-  term rates, to equity prices, and the dollar  In fact--and this is an issue that President Poole and   Governor Gramlich have just commented on--long-term rates did not fall from their levels at the   time we began to ease, at least until very recently  Furthermore, equity prices are significantly   lower and the dollar is higher   I asked the staff to run some simulations with the FRB/US model to assess the effect   of the cumulative easing on overall financial conditions  First, they began the simulations in the   first quarter of 2001 and they held the real federal funds rate constant in the baseline forecast  In   the alternative scenario, they imposed the path of the funds rate in the Greenbook through 2002      8/21/01 56   They ran the alternative scenario under two assumptions  In the first case, they assumed the   historical regularities for pass-throughs to longer-term interest rates, equity prices, and the dollar    In the second, they constrained the latter variables to follow their actual paths through the last   easing The results indicated that, assuming historical regularities, there would have been   virtually no effect on real GDP through the second quarter  But real GDP would have been a   percentage point higher by the end of this year and more than 3 percentage points higher by the   end of 2002 However, given the actual paths of financial variables, the level of real GDP would   be only 1/4 percentage point higher at the end of this year and 1/2 percentage point higher by the   end of 2002 That is, instead of providing a powerful stimulus, the easing only about offset the   restraint coming from declining equity prices and the appreciation of the dollar, leaving little net   stimulus from overall financial conditions   The problem with this simulation experiment is that it fails to give the Fed any credit   for the decline in interest rates in the second half of 2000 in anticipation of Fed easing in 2001    So the staff then redid the simulations beginning in the third quarter of last year  By August of   last year, the federal funds futures indicated the absence of expectations of any change in the   funds rate over the next year The decline in long-term rates that followed reflected expectations   of subsequent Fed easing This approach counts the decline in long-term rates in the second half   as part of the stimulus from the cumulative easing  But the benefits of the lower long-term rates   were more than offset by the effects of the decline in equity prices in the second half of last year    So in somewhat of a surprise, to me at least, on net financial conditions have actually become   more restrictive rather than more stimulative if we begin the accounting from mid-2000   From the standpoint of monetary policy strategy, this raises the question of whether   and how monetary policy should be adjusted for variations in the pass-through from the funds     8/21/01 57   rate to broader financial conditions, episode by episode  If we make our policy judgments on the   basis of the forecasts, this adjustment would naturally occur  But it does raise a cautioning note   about guidance from outcome-based policy rules that in effect are calibrated off average pass-  throughs   At any rate, this analysis suggests some tension in the forecast  We all point to   monetary policy as one of the forces promoting recovery and yet the analysis shows that at best   we may be running in place  To be sure, it also suggests that our aggressive easing has prevented   what otherwise might have been a slide into recession  However, the recovery in the Greenbook   must be based not on improved financial conditions but on other forces in play--for example, the   effects of lower energy prices, more stimulative fiscal policy, or perhaps more importantly the   natural forces for recovery that follow the end of the inventory correction and the end of the   retrenchment in high-tech investment     While I worry, therefore, whether we are on the path to recovery, I also worry about   overshooting as well It seems to me that the dynamics of expansion suggest an upward   instability to growth In the dynamics of cyclical swings in growth, it’s not that the economy   returns to trend growth after a slowdown or recession and stays there, but it naturally moves to   above trend growth Therefore, once a recovery is under way we may face the twin challenges   of moving monetary policy back to neutrality in a timely fashion and contending with above-  trend growth at a time when inflation is a bit above at least my long-run target and the economy   is already operating at close to capacity  Further easing today will undoubtedly complicate that   adjustment  But the failure to see traction from our moves to date and the resulting downside   risks encourage taking some risk of overshooting today and leaving to tomorrow the task of   returning to neutrality and avoiding the inflationary consequences of any overshooting     8/21/01 58    Mr Chairman, like some others, I do worry a bit about the adjustments   that will become necessary as the economy begins to recover on the other side of our current   problem  But I support your recommendation  I think it’s right for today     Mr Chairman, Governor Meyer  I strongly support your   recommendation     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I found the alternative simulations   provided by the staff in the latest Greenbook to be especially useful  Given the   exceptional degree of uncertainty that we now face, the alternative scenarios help us to   better appreciate the range of outcomes  But in addition, they allowed me to easily craft   my own forecast by adding the alternative scenarios directly to the baseline subject to my   personal assessment of the probabilities associated with each  When I began this exercise   I thought that it would allow me to present to you an interesting, even compelling,   alternative to the Greenbook forecast  To my surprise--and I must say disappointment--I   found that when I completed this exercise, the alternative scenarios turned out to be   remarkably offsetting  That left me, no doubt, with the same uncertainty as the staff had,   and equally likely to be wrong, but with a forecast that turned out to be remarkably   similar to the baseline  While we face enormous uncertainty as I indicated, I think this     10/2/01 70   sort of experience adds a little to the credibility of the baseline  I did wonder a bit if the   staff might have been playing some games by offering us a series of alternatives that they   knew were entirely offsetting just to reinforce the baseline  But David Stockton assured   me that this was an accident of good fortune rather than a strategy!     I find that it’s useful in my own thinking to separate the forecast horizon into   two sub-periods The near term covers the next two or three quarters and the remainder   is the period through 2003 It seems to me that there are two key drivers of the near-term   forecast The first is the momentum in the economy prior to September 11th The second   is the effect of the events of September 11th through disruptions to key industries and via   consumer and business sentiment  With respect to the momentum, some saw the data   immediately preceding September 11th as very encouraging and signaling that the   economy was poised for a rebound  Others interpreted the very same data as indicating   that the economy had at most stabilized at a growth rate not much different from zero,   and they were still revising down their forecasts     I think there was ample scope in the data to support both of these differing   interpretations, but I was in the latter camp  And the more pessimistic interpretation   suggested that additional easing would have been justified in the absence of the events of   September 11th In part for that reason, my point of departure for the forecast was the   alternative simulation with easier money policy     But the events of September 11th clearly called for a downward revision to the   near-term forecast--at least to the estimate of the third quarter and the forecast for the   fourth quarter and likely into early 2002  Because a downward impetus to a considerable   degree reflects an assessment of the psychological effects of the events of September     10/2/01 71   11th, the uncertainty about the forecast is an order of magnitude above normal  But my   judgment is that over this time frame the risks are more likely asymmetric toward still   weaker growth So I give some considerable weight, 50 to 75 percent, to the alternative   simulation of a collapse in consumer and business confidence  Having said that, the   downside risk seems to be most acute in the fourth quarter because I’m also going to give   very high weight to the alternative simulation of major fiscal stimulus  And by the first   quarter, that also begins to weigh in importantly    There is little that monetary policy can do through traditional channels to spur   demand over this time frame  However, there might be and probably would be some   salutary effect by bolstering confidence in the future  What we do and what we say   should be designed to contribute to this end, and I think Governor Kelley made that point   extremely well     A second consideration concerns the implications for monetary policy of the   evolution of overall financial conditions  Once again, we’re confronted by a shock that   has had direct effects both on financial conditions, specifically on equity prices, and on   aggregate demand above and beyond the effect on equity prices  Monetary policy has to   move aggressively enough to counter at least the adverse effects on overall financial   conditions before it can hope to make a net contribution to offsetting the direct effect on   aggregate demand   Over the remainder of the forecast horizon it seems to me that the fiscal   assumptions begin to dominate the forecast, complemented by the details of the internal   dynamics of recovery as consumer sentiment and hopefully equity prices rebound  In   addition, the latter development should be reinforced by the delayed contributions of the     10/2/01 72   forces we expected to support recovery before the events of September 11th, including a   rebound in high-tech investment after a sharp and prolonged retrenchment and a return to   inventory accumulation after liquidation runs its course     Now, beyond the nearer-term period it seems to me that the risks turn to the   upside, at least after mid-2002 and especially into 2003  My reading is that the fiscal   stimulus will be an order of magnitude above that in the Greenbook baseline, something   closer to the major fiscal stimulus simulation  Over this time frame, therefore, perhaps   the key question is what monetary policy is a good fit with the assumed fiscal stimulus    There is a potential that an earlier and more aggressive reversal of recent and prospective   monetary easing will ultimately be called for than may be contemplated at this point    Still, there’s ample scope for additional monetary policy easing over the near term  In   part this reflects the fact that, given the prospects of a rise in the unemployment rate to   the 6 percent range, we should now be targeting a period of above trend growth  So,   whereas before we might have thought that we needed stimulus to get economic growth   back to trend as quickly as possible, now if we ended up with something that was less   than a percentage point above trend I think we’d be disappointed  We could probably   tolerate something even stronger than that for awhile  Nevertheless, as a number have   already suggested, monetary policy will face the challenge at some point during the   second period and beyond of a timely return toward neutrality   I think the other issue relating to the strategy of monetary policy relates to the   timing of any cumulative decline in the funds rate  Most of the bad macroeconomic news   in particular relates to higher unemployment that lies ahead and likely will extend at least   through the middle of next year  In evaluating what we do today, we should pay some     10/2/01 73   attention to how much more of a cumulative decline might be justified given the forecast   we now hold And then we need to consider how we should spread the change out over   time so that we don’t end up doing more than we would prefer to do  In addition, we   might worry a bit about how we should signal markets about our future intentions so that   we don’t face market pressure again to move further than would be prudent  I must say,   however, that I don’t think that is really a story of today, but a story of what we do at   subsequent meetings  Thank you    I wanted to follow up on that discussion of the equilibrium real   rate because I think many of us have come to believe that information on this--if we had   confidence in it--is very valuable to our setting of policy  I applaud the research that the   staff has been doing on this subject; I think it already has provided a lot of insights and   has been very useful I have to say, however, that I have a high degree of skepticism   about the amount of short-term variation in the staff measure of the equilibrium real rate    I think that at this point our methodology hasn’t really allowed us to separate out very   effectively cyclical from longer-term influences  So I think the issue needs some more   thought For one, the path of the equilibrium real rate has so much sensitivity to near-  term data that I think any estimate that is not based upon a forecast that goes out at least   five years for example--and returns to some sense of normality--has to be discounted   considerably  But I think that’s work for the future    I support your recommendation     Dave, one of your comments in your presentation surprised me a little, and   that was the link that you described between capital deepening, productivity, and inflation  You   emphasized the implications of a temporary investment incentive that raises investment, spurs   additional capital deepening, and leads in a sense to a positive supply shock  In the Greenbook,   though, it seems to me your emphasis was that on balance we face a negative supply shock because     11/6/01 20   of a significant slowing in structural productivity growth that is expected to occur for a couple of   reasons, including a slowdown from an unsustainable pace of technology spending and also the   reallocation of resources to security enhancements    Just to follow up on that, the slowdown in structural productivity growth is   really quite significant into 2002 in particular  We became somewhat familiar with the complicated   dynamics of how that plays out on demand as well as inflation when we had an acceleration in   structural productivity, so this is perhaps a factor that we should weigh in our real forecast as well    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Relative to the current Greenbook forecast, I   believe that there are still asymmetric downside risks to the first half of next year but that the risks   are more balanced after that time  Because of the near-term downside risks, I view the alternative   scenario of still weaker consumer spending as identifying a material risk  Given that risk and   considerations that, in my view, suggest that policy today should be set to err on the side of stimulus,   the path of the federal funds rate in my forecast is more consistent with the easier monetary policy   alternative simulation  Indeed, that would be the case even if I were beginning with the Greenbook   baseline Still, as David Stockton noted in his presentation, there is an unusual blend of pessimism   and grim data on the one hand and signs of resilience on the other hand, further complicating the   assessment of the outlook     But my major concern relates to the question of the appropriate monetary policy relative   to the forecast My first concern here is that monetary policy may be less effective in this easing   cycle than it normally has been because of the failure of the declines in short-term interest rates to   pass through to other dimensions of financial conditions that matter more for spending  In that   regard I recognize that my views run counter to the remarks we just heard and to many of the   comments around the table this morning that have emphasized the amount of monetary stimulus   already in the pipeline and its likely contribution to the vigor of the projected rebound     Financial conditions indices, including the one recently constructed by the Board’s staff,   are sometimes subject to difficulties in interpretation  But they do in my view highlight the risk that   financial conditions have improved much less than would have been expected based on the   magnitude of the cumulative decline in the federal funds rate over this easing cycle  The Greenbook   forecast presumably takes this into account  Indeed, I suspect it may be the reason why monetary   policy is assumed to remain so stimulative, measured in terms of the real funds rate relative to its     11/6/01 66   long-term equilibrium value and relative to the economy’s rebound  The implication of concerns   about the improvement in financial conditions is not that we should rely less on monetary policy but   that we may have to do more than would otherwise have been necessary   Second, I wonder whether we need to take into account another aspect of asymmetric risk   --what might be described as the two-states-of-the-world problem  The Greenbook, like most   forecasts, seems to assume a one-time terrorist attack with a near-term effect on confidence that   dissipates over time  That might be appropriate for a modal forecast  But relative to this   assumption, there seems to be significant asymmetric downside risks, specifically of further terrorist   attacks that affect confidence in the economy or perhaps for other reasons as well  The forecast for   the first state of the world is therefore likely to be biased in an optimistic direction though, as David   Stockton noted, we would be hard pressed to parameterize the downside risks associated with the   second state of the world Still this analysis suggests that the mean of the forecast might be   interpreted as being below the mode in this case  So the question is how policy should respond to   this type of uncertainty and whether policy should be set to err on the side of ease relative to the   modal forecast   This concern is reinforced by the implications of the zero nominal bound restraint  My   remarks here will elaborate on the points that have already been made by President Broaddus and   Governor Ferguson Some have suggested that the initially low nominal funds rate should   encourage us to keep our powder dry To the contrary, I read the lesson from our study of the zero   nominal bound constraint as pointing to an asymmetric policy response, one that is more rapid with   respect to downside shocks This allows policymakers to use a faster speed of response and   compensate for the smaller possible cumulative decline  The result of the more aggressive policy   would be to limit further declines in core PCE inflation, restraining it from falling below my long-    11/6/01 67   run target of 1-1/2 percent as it does in the Greenbook baseline  This maintains a cushion that would   allow a larger decline in the real federal funds rate if needed   This may be less of a pressing concern at the moment given the steepness in the yield   curve and the opportunity for long rates to fall relative to short rates if the downturn is deeper or the   recovery more gradual or longer delayed than now expected  A more rapid easing would, however,   provide an opportunity for long-term rates to fall by more over the forecast horizon if the sharpness   of the decline or the moderation of the recovery disappoints the financial markets  In any case, I   take the lessons from the zero nominal bound analysis to mean we probably should move more   aggressively in response to adverse shocks, not less when nominal short-term rates are already low   My last concern is about long-term rates  While they have declined somewhat further   recently, they have been sticky in relation to the cumulative decline in short-term rates  As a result, I   have become concerned that we may have lost the ability to lower them further with monetary policy   and, therefore, have quite limited leverage on aggregate demand  This stickiness may reflect in part,   as David Stockton noted, the offsetting effect of a revision in longer-term budget prospects  But in   my view, it may also reflect a divergence between the FOMC’s forecast for the economy and the   forecast implicit in the bond market, equity markets, and the federal funds futures market  Given the   more robust forecast apparently priced into these markets--most evident in the expectation of an   early and aggressive reversal in the federal funds rate--any further decline in the federal funds rate   may be viewed as unnecessary, even damaging, and in any case short-lived     As a result, I have mused, the best way to stimulate the economy might be not to lower the   funds rate further but to encourage a decline in long rates relative to short-term rates  How can we   do that, I hear you ask?  [Laughter]    Perhaps, I muse again, we could do that by being unusually transparent--  that is, by informing markets that we view the economy as weaker than they appear to be assuming   and that as a result the federal funds rate is less likely to rise as soon or as aggressively as they   expect As I said though, I am just musing here--I think--and perhaps amusing, [laughter] as   opposed to making a serious policy recommendation         I just have a comment on Don’s presentation I thought you were   especially effective this time, Don, in making the case for both a 1/4 point move and a 1/2 point   move Indeed, it was a bit of a roller coaster ride for me  I felt myself being swayed first in one   direction and then whipsawed back in the other direction  So it was an enjoyable ride!  Thank you   [Laughter]    Mr Chairman, I view the risks relative to the Greenbook baseline as still   to the downside in the near term  I believe that’s a case for erring on the side of stimulus relative to   the baseline, given the asymmetric risks and the relationship between the mean and the mode in the   forecast And I believe that’s a case for moving more rapidly than otherwise, given the zero nominal   bound constraint For these reasons I support your recommendation of a 50 basis point decline in the   target federal finds rate today and also your recommendation for a balance of risks statement toward   weakness    It’s in a slightly different location in this statement, but we always use it      Thank you, Mr Chairman  Recently at FOMC meetings, one of the key   issues that has weighed on the policy decision is whether or not the forecast is stabilizing  In fact, as   Governor Ferguson just noted, in each of the previous FOMC meetings this year there has been some   meaningful downward revision in the Greenbook forecast  And these revisions have been followed by   further easing So it seems that a precondition for an end to the cycle of easing is a stabilization in the   Committee’s forecast  This Greenbook delivers such a stabilization  Indeed, it has a small upward   revision in projected growth for next year  My forecast has the same property and a number of you   around the table have reached the same conclusion  This at least puts on the table the possibility of   holding the line on the funds rate, if not today then perhaps after today     Of course, we face a tension between the forecast and the incoming data on production and   employment  The incoming data reflect the projected decline in output this quarter, and over the next   several months we’re likely to see further increases in the unemployment rate until economic growth   comes back to trend  In my view, prudent monetary policy would call for an end to the policy easing   cycle before an end to the rise in the unemployment rate  Nevertheless, the sharpness of the increase   in the unemployment rate in November and the uncertain effects of that on sentiment and spending at   least put back on the table the possibility of a little further easing at this meeting     One way of thinking about monetary policy is in terms of the path of the funds rate  A   second way that I sometimes find useful is in terms of the desired path of real GDP growth, as if that     12/11/01 64    were the instrument under control  Given the lags in the response of monetary policy and the   preference with regard to moving interest rates, when I play this game I don’t adjust GDP growth for a   couple of quarters The question I ask as I look at the Greenbook is whether the strength of the   rebound as we get to the middle of next year is about right or, for example, would be better scaled up    I view that as a way of gauging whether or not there is room for further easing  That room depends on   three considerations the rate of employment in mid-2002, when growth moves above trend in the   Greenbook forecast; the inflation rate at that time relative to the Committee’s long-run objective; and   how much projected growth is above trend in the following year or two  The Committee does not   have an explicit long-run inflation objective, so I do the exercise in terms of my own long-run   objective for inflation, which is 1-1/2 percent for the PCE core inflation rate     It seems to me that these considerations reinforce each other and suggest relative to the   Greenbook forecast some room for further easing  The unemployment rate peaks just above 6 percent   and is still 5-3/4 percent at the end of 2003, as compared to my estimate of the NAIRU at that point of   5-1/4 percent And the inflation rate is almost 1/2 percentage point below my long-run objective at the   end of the period A number of people, Governor Ferguson and Governor Gramlich both, mentioned   the perfect foresight simulation, and this is the message that comes through in that particular forecast    On the other hand, just to keep it close, I expect that growth might be stronger by mid-2002   than projected in the Greenbook and I’m slightly more pessimistic than the Greenbook about inflation   First, I expect a sharper cyclical rebound in equities and therefore I start with the staff’s alternative   simulation with a stronger stock market  The Greenbook equity path is predicated on further earnings   disappointments and a perception that there is some overvaluation today, given the excessively   optimistic earnings expectations  There’s good logic in this assessment, to be sure  But I suspect that   this logic will be overwhelmed by a more normal cyclical rebound if the economy performs as     12/11/01 65    projected in the Greenbook  Down the road, we’ll face the implications of any resulting   overvaluation   Second, I believe we may be at an inflection point  We are shifting from progressive   downward to upward revisions to the forecast  And this reflects a tendency toward a coincidence of   positive errors or smaller negative errors in spending equations during recovery periods     With respect to inflation, the Greenbook focuses on the effects of declining oil prices and   the emerging slack in labor markets  I would put more weight than the staff does on the implications   of what looks like a significant adverse supply shock  The staff estimate of structural productivity   growth has declined from a bit above 2-1/2 percent in 1998 and 1999 to about 2 percent this year and   about 1-1/2 percent next year  We, or at least I, placed a lot of emphasis on the effect of the   productivity acceleration on both demand and inflation to explain the exceptional performance of the   economy in the second half of the 1990s  Now, the deceleration is different in character from the   acceleration, and perhaps this will matter  It reflects a move from overshooting in 1999 and into 2000,   relative to some longer-run sustainable growth rate for productivity, to undershooting next year  In   addition, it reflects some effect from increased spending on security  But it seems to me that this   swing could damp the projected disinflation  To be sure, the staff has taken this into account in their   forecast but not with the weight I would have given it  As a result, I view the negative supply shock as   at least a risk factor relative to the Greenbook forecast   The bottom line is that there appears to be a little room for further easing, but we are rapidly   approaching the point where it may be prudent to hold the funds rate stable for a while  Even at this   point, the Committee will still be able to adjust the degree of stimulus going forward by its decision on   how long to remain at the low prevailing funds rate and how gradually to return to neutrality      Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support your recommendation While I   support a statement of unbalanced risks toward weakness, I also believe that the Committee should   avoid encouraging an expectation of further easing at the next meeting  Given my recent experience   in communicating with the markets, I’m not giving any advice on how to do so!  [Laughter] I will     12/11/01 89    view with great interest the statement this time, as it tantalizes us with a possible way of   accomplishing that goal   I’m very pleased to see that the Committee will continue its practice of using its two-day   meetings as an opportunity to have a wider discussion of key issues related to the strategy of monetary   policy Because this is my last FOMC meeting I will not have an opportunity to participate in these   discussions or even to make suggestions for the agenda  So I thought I’d take this opportunity to   unveil some recommendations--in this case for improving the transparency of monetary policy--in the   hope that the Committee might find it worthwhile to discuss this topic in the future  Let me also note   the excellent contribution to this topic from the recent conference at the Federal Reserve Bank of   Philadelphia   Transparency means, in my view, revealing to the public both the objectives that drive the   policy decisions and the rationale for specific policy decisions  I see greater transparency as serving   both to enhance the accountability of the Fed and to increase the effectiveness of monetary policy by   improving the market’s ability to anticipate future policy actions  In terms of transparency about   objectives, I would urge the Committee to discuss again and to consider further setting an explicit   numerical value on its long-run price stability objective  I stated my case on this recommendation in a   paper earlier this year, so I’ll focus today on recommendations related to the minutes and the role that   document plays in conveying the FOMC forecast     The Committee’s press statements have become briefer and more repetitious this year and in   my view less revealing Moreover, some Committee members have expressed a preference for   moving further in this direction To be sure, it is a challenge to have more than a very brief statement   and still represent the consensus of the Committee  In any case, as a consequence the minutes have   become a more important vehicle for revealing the Committee’s views on the outlook and policy     12/11/01 90   options The minutes serve to illuminate the rationale of the recent action and in addition they   recognize the diversity of views on the Committee     The first change I would recommend is either to eliminate the discussion of recent   indicators at the beginning of the minutes or to move it to an appendix at the end  This discussion is   presented on page one, I presume, to set the context for the meeting, not to describe what we   discussed As it is today, it is the first substantial section in the minutes  To my mind at least it numbs   the reader [laughter] and may even distract those who continue on and remain for the summary of the   Committee’s discussion that follows     I had thought about recommending that the next section, which is the paragraph that   summarizes the staff forecast, be expanded maybe to a full page  In the end, after some quite   interesting and constructive discussion with the staff, I decided not to recommend this course of action   out of concern that moving in this direction might interfere with the freedom the staff currently   perceives in putting together its forecast  At the margin though, it still might be useful to expand the   paragraph a little to better tell a coherent story about what underlies the staff forecast  Furthermore,   particularly to the extent that the Committee’s press announcement on the policy decision becomes   less revealing, it would in my judgment be constructive to speed the release of the minutes--perhaps to   the third Thursday following the meeting, or just over two weeks after the meeting   My next set of recommendations relates to the FOMC members’ own forecasts, now   revealed twice a year in the testimony and report on monetary policy  My first concern is that these   forecasts may not be developed as advertised  That is, the forecast is supposed to reflect appropriate   monetary policy from the perspective of each member  This is a very weighty assignment, especially   if the forecast extends out beyond a year--perhaps similar to the perfect foresight policy in the   Bluebook this time  It might be helpful, therefore, if the Bluebook included such a forecast based on     12/11/01 91    perfect foresight in the policy-related material  I think the Committee members might want to discuss   whether they’re preparing the forecast under this type of model and if not, whether and how to do so   Second, these forecasts in my view should always cover a period of at least one and a half to   two years In particular, the forecast prepared each January now extends only to the end of that year,   while the forecast prepared in June extends one and a half years  The January forecast in my view   should be extended to the end of the following year, a two-year period Now, I appreciate that this   recommendation was considered and rejected in 1994  Some members of the Committee were   concerned at that time that such an extension could allow the public to infer the Committee’s   objectives! Should I repeat that?  To my mind, this is an advantage  Publishing an extended forecast   might require more discussion by the Chairman at his monetary policy testimonies and perhaps by   other Committee members  That’s what transparency is all about   Third, the ability of the forecast to serve as a rationale for the Committee’s decisions is   limited today because the Committee does not reveal the assumptions underlying its consensus   forecast and in particular the funds rate path  I understand that this is especially radical, but I would   encourage the Committee to consider revealing the central tendency of the funds rate path that   underlies its consensus forecast I’d also suggest perhaps looking for other ways to reveal the key   assumptions underlying that forecast   Finally, I’d encourage the Committee to consider increasing the frequency of such forecasts   from twice a year to four times a year  This forecast provides a rationale for the Committee’s   decision And it is more important in this respect because of the absence of a full statement that   otherwise provides that rationale Just as a picture might be worth a thousand words, so might that be   said of a forecast     12/11/01 92    Let me conclude by repeating what I said during my very first meeting in June 1996  This   has been even more fun than I expected it to be!  It has been a privilege to serve on this Committee    I’m certainly fortunate to have served during a time that has been so interesting and challenging  I’m   fortunate to have served on this Committee under the leadership of Alan Greenspan and with all of   you I’m fortunate also to have had the exceptional support of the staff, as I wrestled with the outlook   and tried to make contributions to the policy discussion         As Brian noted, I will summarize our current approach  As   indicated on page 7, I will discuss depository institutions’ demand for central bank  balances, how the Desk manages the supply of balances, and outcomes in the federal  funds market  There are three components of demand  Some depository institutions  (DIs) hold balances to satisfy the reserve requirements shown on page 8  Many more  hold contractual clearing balances, and some routinely hold excess reserves      Page 9 notes that DIs can meet their reserve requirements by holding currency, by   holding balances at a Reserve Bank, and by holding deposits at a correspondent that  holds an equal amount at a Reserve Bank  These assets earn no interest, so DIs have  an incentive to reduce their required reserves to the level of vault cash and reserve  balances they would choose to hold if there were no requirements  In practice, DIs  cut required reserves by using sweep programs that shift deposits out of transaction  accounts into linked nonreservable accounts  This stratagem works because the Fed  applies reserve requirements to end-of-day, post-sweep, deposits  About half of the  DIs have no reserve requirement  A large majority of the remainder meet their  requirements entirely with vault cash  Only 1,500 DIs hold balances to meet reserve  requirements, so last year required reserve balances averaged less than $7 billion, an  amount equal to 01 percent of total deposits in the US banking system  Economists  claim that central banks impose reserve requirements to ensure a sizable demand for  central bank balances  Imposing a high required reserve ratio on a narrow deposit  base and then allowing DIs to run sweep programs and use vault cash to meet reserve  requirements does not achieve that goal     More than 7,000 DIs have accounts at Reserve Banks  On an average day, they   use their accounts to make and receive more than 05 million interbank payments with  a value of roughly $25 trillion  As noted on page 10, many of those DIs need a  larger balance to avoid frequent overnight overdrafts than to satisfy reserve  requirements  About 5,700 choose to hold a contractual clearing balance  The  incentive to maintain a contractual balance is that such balances earn implicit interest  that offsets the fees a DI incurs when it uses our priced services  But these “earnings  credits” cannot be paid in cash, so DIs that do not use our services have no incentive  to hold a contractual balance  Page 11 shows that DIs hold a bit less than $7 billion  of contractual clearing balances  The rough equality with required reserve balances is  coincidence     Required and contractual balances, though small, facilitate the implementation of   US monetary policy in two ways, as indicated on page 12  First, required and  contractual balances are set before the start of each reserve maintenance period, so  they establish a predictable lower bound on the period-average demand for balances   Second, DIs are allowed to meet reserve requirements and contractual balance  commitments on average over multi-day reserve maintenance periods  This  averaging feature helps make the demand for balances interest elastic  DIs reduce the  opportunity cost of meeting requirements by holding smaller balances on days when  the fed funds rate is above target and larger balances on days when the funds rate is   April 29–30, 2008 145 of 266    below target  Carryover provisions and clearing bands, which give DIs some  flexibility to hold too many or too few balances in one maintenance period and the  opposite in the next period, also help make the demand for balances interest elastic     Page 13 summarizes the third component of demand for balances  desired excess   reserves  Large DIs usually aim to hold zero excess reserves on average  Small DIs  as a group generally hold positive excess reserves  The left half of the graph on page  14 illustrates that the daily sum of required, contractual, and excess reserve balances  averaged about $15 billion from January through July of last year but varied between  $10 billion and $25 billion  The day-to-day variation largely reflects big banks’  behavior  Big banks want much larger balances on days when an unusually large  volume of payments flows through their Federal Reserve accounts than on other days   This strategy lowers their risk of incurring overnight overdrafts on high-payment- flow days while reducing their opportunity cost of holding non-interest-bearing  balances on other days  The right half of the graph shows that demand for balances  has oscillated even more widely since August  Even at $25 billion or more, DIs’  balances are not big enough to clear $25 trillion of Fedwire payments per day  without incurring overdrafts  Indeed, DIs make heavy use of daylight credit  At least  in theory, ready availability of inexpensive daylight credit reduces DIs’ demand for  central bank balances  A proposed reduction in the cost of collateralized daylight  credit—the proposal is now out for public comment—may further reduce demand for  balances     We turn next to the supply of balances, beginning on page 16  You’ve told the   Desk to keep the federal funds rate close to target on average  The Desk does so by  trying to make each day’s supply of balances equal to the quantity that DIs would  demand that day if the funds rate were at target  The Desk’s strategy is to use  outright purchases or sales of Treasury securities, plus 14-day and 28-day repurchase  agreements, to supply a level of balances somewhat lower than the minimum amount  the banking system is likely to demand going forward  The Desk then uses one- to  seven-day repo to supply the remainder  The Desk structures its operations so that  maturing repo almost always leave the supply of balances short of the quantity  demanded and then undertakes a new repo to fill in the gap  But as indicated on page  17, the Desk does not completely control the supply  Unanticipated changes in  autonomous factors can make the supply of balances larger or smaller than projected   The staffs at the Board and in New York do a very good job, but not a perfect job, of  predicting changes in these factors     Variations in borrowing from the primary dealer credit facility also affect the   supply of balances  For example, Citigroup Global Markets borrowed on 20 of the  first 25 business days that the PDCF was in operation, in amounts that varied from  $05 billion to $27 billion  Barclays Capital borrowed on 21 days, in amounts that  ranged from $1 billion to $7 billion  Four other primary dealers were frequent  borrowers; another six borrowed less often  Changes in PDCF credit are not always  captured in the staff’s daily projections, so they can, and do, cause the supply of  balances to deviate from the intended level  In any case, if the day’s projected supply   April 29–30, 2008 146 of 266    is not close to the forecast of quantity demanded, the Desk conducts an open market  operation to make the two roughly equal  As noted on page 18, the Desk was in the  market almost every business day—indeed, all but six business days—from January  2006 through July 2007, replacing maturing repo with larger or smaller repo as  projections showed a need to add or to drain balances       How well does this approach to implementing monetary policy work?  If the key   criterion is keeping the funds rate close to target, our current approach works well in  normal times and not so well when interbank markets are under stress  But our  current approach imposes substantial and unnecessary burdens  As the graph on  page 20 indicates, the effective fed funds rate is almost always within a few basis  points of target during normal times, as it was from January through July of last year   But there have been many larger-than-usual deviations from target since last August,  for two primary reasons  First, daily variations in demand for balances have become  larger and more difficult to forecast  Second, demand apparently has become less  responsive to temporary deviations of the funds rate from target—that is, demand has  become less elastic  Even so, the average of daily deviations from target has been  close to zero since mid-September  Pages 21 and 22 summarize equilibrium in the  federal funds market and the reasons for large deviations from target  Fed funds  typically trade near the target early in the morning because buyers and sellers usually  expect the Desk to supply enough balances to get the funds rate to target in the  afternoon  But the funds rate sometimes is firm or soft in early trading, signaling a  likely shortage or surplus of balances and leading the Desk to aim for a somewhat  larger or smaller supply than otherwise     After the Desk conducts the day’s operation, three things happen concurrently    The supply of balances responds to changes in autonomous factors and PDCF credit;  the demand for balances is realized as DIs make and receive payments; and DIs trade  federal funds, determining the day’s average or “effective” funds rate  If the supply  of balances is close to the actual quantity demanded and if the payment system and  the federal funds market work normally, the funds rate will be close to target  Any  excess demand or supply generally does not become apparent until late in the day,  when the Desk is unable to adjust the supply of balances because primary dealers no  longer have uncommitted collateral  DIs that end up with larger balances than they  want late in the afternoon seek to sell fed funds  When the banking system as a whole  has sizable excess balances, DIs that try to sell fed funds late in the day find few  buyers  Because balances earn no interest, the funds rate can fall to zero in that  situation  On the other hand, an excess demand for balances makes the funds rate rise  relative to target  If the funds rate climbs sufficiently above the primary credit rate,  some DIs overcome their reluctance to borrow, raising the supply of balances and  helping limit the increase in the funds rate       Last August provides an interesting case study  The demand for balances rose as   DIs sought greater liquidity  The Desk increased the supply  Even so, the funds rate  traded firm relative to target almost every morning as European banks bid  aggressively for fed funds to lock in dollar funding before the end of their business   April 29–30, 2008 147 of 266    day in Europe  The firm morning rate suggested a shortage of balances  But late in  the day in New York, the funds rate often fell well below target as domestic banks  that held larger-than-normal balances during the day tried to sell fed funds rather than  hold big non-interest-bearing balances overnight       While our current regime keeps the funds rate close to target on average, it   imposes sizable and unnecessary burdens  As noted on page 23, DIs use real  resources to run sweep programs and to carefully manage each day’s balance in their  Federal Reserve accounts  While those efforts generate private gains, they are a  waste from a social perspective  Even with sweep programs, the opportunity cost of  holding unremunerated reserve balances averaged about $360 million per year during  the past two years  In addition, the banking system and the Federal Reserve spend  many millions of dollars each year to ensure and monitor compliance with complex  reserve requirement rules     As indicated on page 24, our current approach to implementing monetary policy   has strengths  It usually keeps the funds rate close to target, and it supports an active  interbank market  But our current approach also has shortcomings  It allows  occasional large deviations of the funds rate from target even in normal times and  more-frequent large deviations when interbank markets are disrupted  Our approach  is less than transparent; even well-informed market participants sometimes are  surprised by the Desk’s daily operations, and there was widespread misunderstanding  of the Desk’s actions last August  Finally, our current approach imposes burdens that  simply are not necessary to enable the Desk to keep the funds rate close to target   Theory and foreign experience suggest that it is possible to reduce the shortcomings  of the current US approach to implementing monetary policy without sacrificing its  strengths  Jim Clouse and Spence Hilton will now discuss a range of options for  improving the US approach       With respect to the UK system during the period of turmoil, banks’ initial   reaction was to lower their reserve deposits, their contractual commitments  But they came to their   senses and realized that holding more rather than less was a more sensible approach, and the Bank   of England accommodated the banks’ desire both to increase their targets and to widen the bands     Quite dramatically, to avoid the end-of-period spike in rates  In terms of   rate volatility, the Bank of England, the ECB, and the Fed all achieved about the same rate volatility   during the period of market turmoil  For the Bank of England, the spikes just tended to be more on   the upside than the downside, but that had to do with their implementation procedures and not   getting to the end of the period and being willing to accommodate     Though they had a few trades above their lending rate, in fact that was not   much of a problem  Their system worked quite well  Interestingly, the country with the smallest   rate volatility during the whole period of market turmoil was Canada, and that’s because they knew   the demand for balances at the end of every day and could adjust the supply by adjusting the   government balance at the end of every day  So they hit it basically every day     Basically everything clears through their equivalent of Fedwire, so they   know in real time what the balances are      Thank you, Brian  By way of background, the Greenbook and   many private forecasters project a sizable drop in real GDP from mid-2008 to mid- 2009, followed by sluggish growth into 2010, even with short-term interest rates  barely above zero and with substantial fiscal stimulus  The Board staff and the  median forecaster in the December Blue Chip survey predict that unemployment will  peak around 825 percent in 2010  The Greenbook forecast shows core PCE inflation  dropping below 1 percent in 2010; many private forecasters envision similar  disinflation  Moreover, responses to a special question in the latest Blue Chip survey  indicate that private forecasters see a sizable risk of deflation, and stochastic  simulations of FRB/US that take the Greenbook forecast as the baseline suggest a  roughly 1-in-4 chance that the core PCE price index will decline over one or more of  the next five years  In short, forecasts generally suggest that additional stimulus  would be desirable     With the target federal funds rate at 1 percent and the effective rate significantly   lower, the Committee has little scope for using conventional monetary policy to  stimulate the economy  As a practical matter, the System’s large liquidity-providing  operations and the Treasury’s decision to scale back the supplementary financing  program make it likely that the effective federal funds rate will remain quite low into  the new year  Even so, the Committee could choose to apply some additional  stimulus by reducing its target federal funds rate and pushing the effective funds rate  closer to zero      The research literature strongly suggests that a central bank should quickly cut its   target rate to zero when it faces a substantial probability that conventional monetary  policy will, in a few quarters, be constrained by the zero lower bound on nominal  interest rates  But as discussed in several of the notes you received on December 5,   December 15–16, 2008 16 of 284    driving short-term interest rates to zero would have costs as well as benefits  Zero or  near-zero rates cause a high volume of fails in the Treasury securities market, leading  to decreased liquidity in that market and potentially in other fixed-income markets   And if short-term rates remain very close to zero, some money market funds probably  will close  Such costs may argue against cutting the target funds rate to zero and  driving the effective rate closer to zero       Whether or not the Committee chooses to cut its target rate to zero, policymakers   may find it helpful to expand the use of nonstandard monetary tools  In the current  environment, using such tools has two potential benefits  First, they may help the  Federal Reserve achieve better expected outcomes on both parts of the dual mandate   Second, nonstandard tools could help mitigate the risk of an even more negative  outcome  It may prove useful to group nonstandard tools into four broad categories  and treat each category in turn       The first category is simple quantitative easing  This approach uses conventional   open market operations such as buying short-term government debt and conducting  repurchase agreements to raise excess reserves in the banking system to a level well  beyond that required to drive short-term interbank rates to zero  The objective is to  spur bank lending by ensuring that banks have ample funding at very low cost  The  Japanese experience suggests that greatly expanding excess reserves, per se, has  limited success in spurring bank lending, and thus has modest macroeconomic  effects, when banks and borrowers have weak balance sheets       The second category of nonstandard policy tools is targeted open-market   purchases of longer-term securities  The objective here would be to reduce term  spreads or credit spreads and thus reduce the longer-term interest rates that are  relevant for many investment decisions  The Committee could, for example, direct  the Desk to buy a large amount of longer-term Treasuries  The Bank of Japan bought  sizable quantities of Japanese government bonds; its purchases are thought to have  lowered yields  The available evidence for the United States suggests that adding  $50 billion of longer-term Treasury securities to the SOMA portfolio (a bit less than  1 percent of publicly held Treasury debt) probably would lower yields on such  securities somewhere between 2 and 10 basis points; a substantially bigger purchase  could have a disproportionately larger effect as longer-term Treasuries became  scarce  Of course, what matters for the macroeconomy is the effect on private agents’  borrowing costs and wealth  Those effects are difficult to predict  Corporate bond  yields should decline with Treasury bond yields, though perhaps less if supply effects  are the main reason Treasury yields fall  But corporate bond yields could decline  more than yields on Treasuries if the Committee’s action reduces investors’ concerns  about downside risks and thus reduces credit risk premiums  Such a boost to  confidence could also lift stock prices and household wealth  Another possibility is to  instruct the Desk to buy a large quantity of GSE debt and mortgage-backed securities  to reduce their yields and thus drive down mortgage rates  As Bill noted, markets  reacted positively to the November 25 announcement that the Federal Reserve will  buy $100 billion of GSE debt and up to $500 billion of agency-backed MBS; yields   December 15–16, 2008 17 of 284    on 10-year GSE debt and option-adjusted MBS yields fell about 60 basis points that  day, and the spread over 10-year Treasury yields narrowed about 40 basis points   Quoted rates on conventional conforming mortgages declined a similar amount in  subsequent days  The magnitude of the announcement effect, which is consistent  with estimates from the research literature, suggests that additional targeted purchases  of agency debt and MBS could provide further macroeconomic stimulus     The third major category of nonstandard tools encompasses special liquidity and   lending facilities  The Board could choose to expand current facilities or create new  ones  Special liquidity facilities for banks and other financial firms are intended to  help them meet their customers’ needs for credit by providing a reliable source of  funding even if the markets in which those lenders usually raise funds are disrupted or  if their depositors withdraw funds  Indeed, these facilities seem to be meeting these  needs effectively  The Term Auction Facility, or TAF, is one example; the Asset- Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Lending Facility, or AMLF,  is another  Liquidity facilities may also support specific funding markets  The idea is  that such markets are more likely to function if borrowers are confident that they will  be able to issue and roll over debt and if lenders are assured that they will be able to  fund purchases of debt instruments or reduce their holdings of such instruments when  necessary  The Commercial Paper Funding Facility, or CPFF, is an example of this  sort of program  Although the commercial paper market has not returned to normal,  the CPFF has been helpful in supporting overall credit flows and reducing some  credit spreads  Direct discount window lending to creditworthy nonfinancial firms is  another potential tool for supporting economic activity  The Federal Reserve Act  allows such lending, on a secured basis, if the borrower is unable to obtain adequate  credit from banking institutions during unusual and exigent circumstances       Significant further expansion of the System’s lending programs would raise a host   of issues  New facilities that lend directly to individuals, partnerships, or  corporations would have to meet the requirements in section 13(3) of the Federal  Reserve Act  The Reserve Banks would take on more credit risk unless the Treasury  or other parties took substantial first-loss positions  Moral hazard would become a  larger issue  The resulting increase in reserve balances would further complicate the  implementation of monetary policy unless the FOMC were willing to accept a federal  funds rate of essentially zero  Developing satisfactory exit strategies would be  challenging  And the practical burdens of designing and operating a sizable number  of new liquidity facilities would be substantial  Even so, some expansion might  prove useful if credit conditions do not improve       Communication and commitment strategies are the fourth and final category of   nonstandard policy tools  In current circumstances, the Committee might use such  strategies in an effort to lower market expectations of future short-term interest rates  and thus reduce long-term rates, or it might wish to prevent expectations of deflation  from taking hold  I will mention three strategies that the Committee might pursue      December 15–16, 2008 18 of 284    First, research suggests that it would be helpful for the Committee to be explicit  about its longer-term goals, particularly about its goal for inflation  Foreign  experience supports the theoretical prediction that an explicit and credible inflation  objective helps anchor longer-run inflation expectations and thus can help prevent a  downward drift in expected inflation and an upward drift in real interest rates during a  protracted period of high unemployment and slowing inflation  That is, an explicit  longer-run inflation target can prevent the public from thinking that the Federal  Reserve will allow inflation to remain persistently below rates that the Committee has  previously said are desirable  The Committee has discussed the pros and cons of a  numerical objective for inflation several times  You may wish to consider whether  the significant risk of deflation and the near certainty that the zero lower bound will  constrain conventional monetary policy have changed the cost–benefit calculus       Second, the Committee could announce that it will seek to run a somewhat higher   rate of inflation for a number of years than it will seek in the long run  Such a  promise, if deemed credible, would stimulate real activity by raising inflation  expectations and reducing medium- and long-term real interest rates  Researchers  have proposed several approaches for dealing with the zero lower bound that would  operate in this fashion, including targeting a slowly rising price level  These  approaches would be a significant departure from historical practice, and so their pros  and cons would need to be evaluated carefully     Third, research suggests that it would be helpful for the Committee to provide   more-explicit information about its views on the likely future path of the federal  funds rate  Suppose, for example, that the Committee concludes that it most likely  will need to keep the federal funds rate close to zero for some time to spur an  economic recovery and to prevent a persistent decline in inflation  In the current  environment, an announcement to that effect might lead market participants to expect  the funds rate to remain near zero for a longer time than they now think likely; the  announcement might also lead to an increase in expected inflation  Those changes in  expectations would lower nominal and real bond yields, providing some stimulus to  economic activity  Theory suggests that it would be important to make clear that the  Committee’s current view about the likely future path of policy is conditional on  current information and the current outlook and to spell out how the actual policy  path would depend on a range of possible future outcomes  Communicating this  conditionality could be difficult       The bottom line from the staff’s analysis is that unconventional monetary policy   tools can be useful complements to well-designed fiscal stimulus and to steps to  recapitalize and strengthen the financial system  Additional purchases of longer-term  securities, expansion of targeted lending facilities, and explicit statements of  policymakers’ goals and intentions all seem likely to be useful when conventional  monetary policy is constrained by the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates   Our limited experience with these tools makes it difficult to estimate the amount of  macroeconomic stimulus that would be generated by each and thus makes it difficult  to calibrate their application  If the Committee and the Board choose to make greater   December 15–16, 2008 19 of 284    use of nonstandard tools now or in the near future, it may be appropriate to deal with  the uncertainty by using the tools in combination  Finally, the Bank of Japan's  experience suggests that nonstandard tools are more likely to be effective if they are  used aggressively  I’ll now turn back to Brian
