2842,1996-08-20," Thank you We clearly are still struggling with the same two questions that occupied us at the last meeting First, is the economy slowing or likely to slow quickly enough to trend to at least stabilize the unemployment rate at the current level? Secondly, is the current level of the unemployment rate definitively below NAIRU so that it ensures a trend toward higher inflation? The Greenbook gives us an optimistic answer to the first question and a pessimistic answer to the second The data available since the last meeting gave me a little more confidence in my answer to the first question but still left me with uncertainty about the second  There has been a lot of mention around the table already of the risks of higher inflation as a result of that uncertainty But I hope that we won't ignore the fact that the slowdown has the potential to allow the economy to sustain trend growth at the current level of unemployment with modest, stable inflation at least for some period While the persistence of the slowdown is hardly assured, the data that have become available since the last meeting provide evidence of slowing that we could only anticipate then This certainly reinforces my confidence in the slowdown projected by the staff, and that is also very consistent with the consensus of private sector forecasters So, I think a provisional ""yes"" is in order for the slowdown scenario Of course, what we are talking about here is really a knife edge--slowing just to trend So we obviously are going to have to revisit this issue and adjust as necessary  The real key is the second question; that is the heart of our problem The staff forecast answer to the second question is as follows The unemployment rate is already below NAIRU and will remain so after the projected slowdown, resulting in a gradual, persistent deterioration in inflation The minimum wage increase is an ingredient in the staff forecast of higher inflation, but it is a spice not the substance The fundamental source is the conviction that the current unemployment rate is incompatible with stable inflation The problem we face in acting on this forecast is that the pattern of rising inflation that it projects going forward should have been under way for some time and in fact is not yet evident The data available since the last meeting, while somewhat mixed, did not alter this interpretation The staff views the benign inflation environment in recent quarters as a temporary aberration relative to longer- standing regularities Technically, the excellent inflation performance is a mirror image of poor model performance The forecast of higher inflation going forward simply reflects confidence that this model error will diminish or disappear But it is very hard to dismiss the fact that the extraordinary performance of inflation in recent quarters raises serious doubts about the estimate of NAIRU compared to what it was in earlier periods As a result, my answer to  -29-    8/20/96  the question of whether or not the current unemployment rate is below NAIRU has taken into account not only the estimate of NAIRU based on a longer period, but also the details of the inflation performance over the last couple of years Indeed, estimation techniques that weigh the more recent data more heavily suggest that NAIRU has declined recently and may be close to 5-1/2 percent today  The inflation picture is even more impressive than many acknowledge More broad measures of inflation have declined than have appreciated; they show no signs of broad-based acceleration and in many cases even hint of ongoing disinflation Consider particularly the recent patterns in the chain measures of the GDP price index, the gross domestic purchases price index, and the PCE price index The inflation rate in each case is about 2 percent over the past year and below 2 percent if it is measured net of food and energy components when that breakdown is available Each of these measures posted a lower inflation rate over the year ended in the second quarter than over the preceding year At least for the available core measures, each of these inflation measures was near its recent low in the second quarter The CPI in contrast is closer to 3 percent than 2 percent, and there is less evidence of ongoing deceleration But even for the CPI, both overall and core inflation rates were lower over the four quarters ended in the second quarter than over the previous year The ECI data do challenge us, and we are seeing some signs of higher wages I think we ought to take into account that, given the slowdown in the rise in benefit costs, some increase in wage pressures should be passing forward the benefits that firms have received from those lower benefit costs So, we want to focus on total compensation, not just on wages There has been some edging up in compensation; it is fairly small so far, and given the projection of some compression in profit margins, it is also quite compatible with stable inflation at least for some time  In case all this may seem too optimistic, let me end with a cautionary note There has been some discussion around the table of the potential, or even the reality, that we are already facing fast productivity growth or that we might see some in the future or that faster productivity growth might offset any increase in compensation My reading of the data leaves me somewhat concerned about that interpretation Productivity growth over the last three years has been very low, below 1 percent If we look at the productivity trend over that three-year period--when, after all, the economy has been growing at a rate averaging close to what we thought was trend over that period--one would think that productivity growth during that period also would be close to trend In that case, we might reach the judgment that the productivity growth trend is a half percent rather than a percentage point I think we need to monitor this path very closely But if the trend rate of productivity growth has in fact downshifted, then the growth of potential will turn out to be much slower than the Greenbook projects The slowing in growth that will be required to reach trend will need to be more aggressive and less certain, and the price inflation that we should expect from the current trend in nominal compensation will be greater But for now, steady as she goes "
2843,1996-08-20," Mr Chairman, I also support your recommendation that we make no change in policy at this meeting and retain an asymmetric directive This position reflects my willingness to support trend growth at full employment with stable modest inflation in the near term, patiently awaiting opportunity down the road for renewed progress toward price stability I simply am not persuaded at this point that the current policy setting is inconsistent with stable inflation Given the lags in response to monetary policy, particularly when it comes to inflation, it is often prudent to move to change policy on the basis of forecasts, and that is the challenge that the staff forecast presents to us today But my willingness to move preemptively in this case has to be conditioned by what seems to me the inconsistency in the story that the current unemployment rate is too low to sustain stable inflation, given that we have seen stable inflation for the last two years So at this point, I think it would be prudent to hold the line and wait for additional data Nevertheless, I think there are risks of higher growth and there are undoubtedly risks that inflation at the current unemployment rate might move up Therefore, I think the asymmetric directive is very reasonable Thank you "
2894,1996-09-24," Peter, let me ask you a question to help further my education I took two things out of the memo One, you want to switch to an average duration limit as a way of measuring the overall liquidity of the portfolio The second issue was more interesting and seemed to be the real question, ie, whether there was a case for increasing average duration You note that reserves are invested without price exposure and that liquidity is the primary objective That would seem to suggest a low average duration So, I need to understand what you buy by increasing the duration Let me bring it down to the story about the 10-month versus the 18-month average duration; that was a good example You started by saying you would like to have a 10-month average duration as the target, but you want to have 18 months as the limit and that is in case of the necessity for significant intervention But that brings to a head the point because you implied in your discussion that, of course, we are going to sell only at the short end You did not actually say that, but the implication was that you would sell from the short end of the portfolio So, why are you holding long-term securities?   I thought the compelling story was the German balance sheet, but some of the same issues come up when we talk about the liquidity of the SOMA portfolio   The difference is that the way you buy differs from the way you sell, and that is really my question You have the same situation domestically in that liquidations occur at the short end but buying occurs over a wide maturity range I want to understand what you achieve by buying over a wider maturity span than you intend to sell   I think this is where the issues come up that I started to get into with respect to the investment of our foreign currency reserves It seems to me that what you are talking about in terms of the portfolio is a compromise between two ideas that I call buy-side neutrality and sell-side liquidity I am struggling to learn how you deal with that Buy-side neutrality says that you mirror everything so that you do not have an impact on particular markets The sell-side liquidity says that when you sell, you sell short-term securities That is obviously how you deal with it But it seems to me that the current practice is an attempt to deal with that compromise by segregating out a bills portion that you sell and then the rest is for mirroring The question is whether or not we could be more systematic in how we decide on what those proportions should be It seems to be very similar to the story we tell in our own regulation with respect to internal models, market-based risk, self assessment, stress testing, and all the rest The Meulendyke memo on liquidity seems to be at least an attempt to get us to think in that way But the question it seems to me is whether that procedure should be the  -48-    9/24/96  one that determines the correct proportion of bills in the total portfolio, whether it is 50/50 or 70/30 Is that the right spirit? "
2895,1996-09-24," Thank you, Mr Chairman The data that have become available since the August meeting have provided a quite interesting set of crosscurrents On the one hand, the data indicate that growth has slowed much more sharply in the third quarter than I previously expected, moving down to a pace close to trend Moreover, the apparent mix between final sales and inventory investment suggests a diminished prospect for above-trend growth in the period immediately ahead On the other hand, the August employment reports suggest that labor markets have become even tighter, raising the danger of a still faster acceleration of wages and therefore increasing the risk of higher price inflation going forward even if growth has slowed to trend Thus, the case for tightening to slow growth to trend has diminished in my judgment, while the case for tightening to counter inflationary utilization rates may have increased Well, it never gets easy At the same time, the August CPI and PPI reports challenge us with further evidence that core inflation continues to edge lower despite utilization rates that historically would already have been associated with rising inflation Let me elaborate on these two issues, beginning with the prospects for growth  While I am comfortable with the broad outline of the path for real GDP in the Greenbook forecast, I would have been a bit more aggressive in lowering my forecast for third-quarter growth There were three significant reports since the last meeting that suggest slower growth the August retail sales report, the July construction put-in-place report, and the July foreign trade report Cathy, you mentioned earlier that you were concerned that consumer spending might be even stronger than in the Greenbook forecast My concern would be quite different I suspect that consumer spending is growing at least 1/2 percentage point more slowly in the current quarter than the Greenbook is projecting So, I think the central tendency right now appears to be growth around trend, and I would even say there are about equal chances that third-quarter GDP growth will be below trend as above trend While the details of one quarter are of little importance to our task here, the sharpness and widespread nature of the softening of demand in the third quarter might make us cautious about the timing of the tightening that still appears to be the most likely direction of policy going forward I expect an increase of only 1 percent in final sales in the third quarter compared to 4 percent in the previous quarter At the same time, production-side data--payroll employment, aggregate hours, and industrial production in particular--look stronger The contrast between the softness in demand and the strength in employment and production is likely to be reconciled with strong third-quarter inventory growth consistent with the rapid inventory buildup reported for July However, if the rebound in inventory investment leaves the third-quarter growth closer to 2-1/2 percent in the context of softening final sales, the prospect of slower fourth-quarter growth becomes still more persuasive  I think the most important implication of the developments in the third quarter may be that the unexpectedly sharp slowing in the growth of final sales has made room for a rebound in inventory investment to a trend level, perhaps removing the danger that inventory building will sustain above-trend growth in coming quarters My strong expectation is that we are in a temporary lull Fundamentals do not suggest to me a serious likelihood that the expansion is tiring to the point of slipping into protracted below- trend growth Indeed, I continue to expect that, with an unchanged  -19-    9/24/96  policy, growth will be near trend or slightly above in coming quarters Nevertheless, the sharpness of the weakening in final sales in the third quarter adds a cautionary note to this forecast and provides the rationale for waiting for data to confirm the expected stabilization in final demand  Second, utilization rates The decline in the unemployment rate to 51 percent in August was another significant piece of data It suggested that the labor market may have tightened in August from the 5-1/2 percent area over the last couple of years, to a 5 to 5-1/4 range in the period immediately ahead There are good reasons to believe that the decline in the unemployment rate in August was exaggerated, for example, because of the late survey date But there is also reason to believe that the above-trend growth over the first half has left a legacy of somewhat higher utilization rates going forward The staff completely discounts the August decline in the unemployment rate as a statistical quirk and assumes that it will be reversed in coming months As a result, they project the same 54 percent unemployment rate going forward as in their last forecast The difference between a shade below 5-1/2 percent and a shade above 5 percent is a very important one to me Personally, I might buy provisionally into a NAIRU as low as 5-1/2 percent I do not buy into a NAIRU as low as 5 percent As a result of the August employment report, there is more uncertainty about the degree of labor market tightness, and in my judgment the danger of higher inflation going forward is also somewhat greater now than earlier  Third, a word on inflation performance The 12-month inflation rate, as measured by the core CPI, declined to 26 percent in August, a tenth lower than in the previous four months, and it has declined nearly half a percentage point since the end of 1995 The 12-month core PPI inflation rate was 14 percent in August, close to half the pace at the end of last year Not only has inflation not begun to rise, but by some measures it has continued to decline While monetary policy should be forward-looking, the disparity between inflation performance and inflation forecasts looking backward might temper our aggressiveness in adjusting policy in response to forecasts of higher inflation, at least until inflation stabilizes "
2896,1996-09-24," My decision at this meeting is more difficult than at the past two meetings Indeed, leading up to this meeting, I was feeling the pain associated with fence sitting, hoping the data would push me decisively in one direction or the other No such luck I believe that increases in utilization rates should in general be followed by increases in short-term interest rates That is, pro- cyclicality in short-term interest rates is one of the most important rules of prudent monetary policy If the unemployment rate stabilizes near 5 percent and if the economy settles into trend growth, I expect I will be moved to support a tightening of monetary policy I could make that case even today given the increased tightness of labor markets indicated in the August employment report and with fundamentals supporting trend growth ahead I could make the case that, even here, a cautious step toward restraint would be prudent  Nevertheless, Mr Chairman, I am prepared to support your position for three reasons First, there is a small risk that a tightening at this moment would be badly timed into a sharp slowing in GDP growth to below trend in the current quarter and the period immediately ahead Second, the prospects of either higher productivity growth or some compression in above-normal markups going forward will give us some room to clarify both the prospects for growth and the degree to which labor markets have indeed tightened Third, given the recently stable or even declining trend in core measures of inflation, failing to tighten today does not in my judgment leave us seriously behind the curve That judgment is reinforced by the Taylor rule projections that, as Governor Yellen pointed out at the last meeting, suggest that monetary policy is appropriately positioned today in light of prevailing inflation and utilization rates  I certainly respect the judgment of any colleagues on this Committee who would prefer a modest move toward tightening today Nevertheless, I would second the wise counsel of the Vice Chair and encourage those on the Committee who believe as I do that the decision today is a close one and that either no change or a 25 basis point increase could be justified, to join me in supporting alternative B today "
2947,1996-11-13," The data available since the last meeting confirmed that the economy has slowed to trend growth They suggested that an unfavorable mix between final sales and inventory investment in the last quarter weighs heavily against a rebound to above-trend growth in the period immediately ahead The data also indicated that the acceleration of wage and compensation costs that is under way is somewhat more modest than previously anticipated And despite the stabilization of the unemployment rate at a level that may yet prove to be below NAIRU, inflation remains remarkedly well contained On balance the data, if not precisely consistent with every aspect of that forecast, at least matched our fondest hopes and rewarded our patience  The prevailing economic environment, however, is not without risk going forward The main challenge in my view lies in the suspicion of many of us, precisely as set out in the staff forecast, that trend growth at the prevailing unemployment rate will ultimately  -20-    11/13/96  prove to be inconsistent with stable inflation going forward Nevertheless, in the near term there may be more downside than upside risk with respect to GDP growth, particularly given the absence so far of any clear evidence that the collapse of final sales in the third quarter has been reversed and given the restraint to production in the period immediately ahead from the projected slowing in inventory investment  Over the more important intermediate-term horizon of the staff forecast, on the other hand, favorable underlying fundamentals do I think support expectations of growth near trend Such growth might be incompatible with stable inflation, given the current low unemployment rate Still, this outcome is far from preordained Given the current federal funds rate setting, growth could easily be below trend, especially in the near term but even over the forecast horizon The unemployment rate could gradually increase to NAIRU before the building wage pressures are passed through to higher inflation If this sounds too good to be true, one should note that this is essentially the Blue Chip consensus forecast The Blue Chip panel projects 2 percent GDP growth over 1997, measured on a fourth- quarter-to-fourth-quarter basis While this is just below the 22 percent rate of the Greenbook forecast, it is enough to produce a modest but sustained increase in the unemployment rate The latter reaches 5-1/2 percent by the end of 1997, a level almost identical to the downward revised estimate of NAIRU in the staff forecast As a result, inflation stabilizes at 2-1/2 percent for the GDP deflator and 3 percent for the CPI Even if the staff forecast proves to be correct, a more likely prospect in my own mind, the projected acceleration in labor costs over the forecast horizon is modest, thereby containing the threat to our long-term price stability objective over the time period required for a tightening of policy to reverse the rise in inflation  For the moment, a continuation of remarkably subdued price inflation gives us the luxury of waiting for the data to clarify whether growth will remain at or above trend and whether the unemployment rate will begin to rise while we continue to monitor wage pressures and benefit costs We should not, however, be lulled into believing on the basis of the most recent data on wages and compensation that the acceleration in wages that we have been monitoring and worrying about at recent meetings has abated In particular, I find the third-quarter employment cost report literally too good to be true Rather than taking at face value the deceleration in wage costs from a 43 percent annual rate in the first quarter to a 2-1/2 percent rate in the third quarter, I believe it is prudent to focus on the gradual but unmistakable uptrend in the four- quarter growth rate to 33 percent in the third quarter from 28 percent a year ago Part of the explanation for this surprising pattern of deceleration in the quarterly wage data may be the volatility of quarterly wage changes for sales workers associated with their commissions Leaving out sales workers, the uptrend in annual wage increases is both more consistent and steeper; it rises from 27 percent a year ago to 34 percent in the year ended in September For the moment, the slower acceleration in benefit costs has damped the effect on labor costs of the rebound in wage changes In addition, the effect of higher compensation costs on prices may be damped for a time by declines in markups, especially in light of the widespread expression by firms of the lack of pricing leverage Nevertheless, if  -21-    11/13/96  benefit costs accelerate toward the rate of increase in wages, we will move very quickly toward the staff forecast of an increase in compensation per hour near 3-1/2 percent At some point, firms will exhaust their willingness to accept compression in their markups We may therefore be living on borrowed time, but given the slowdown in growth and the recent pattern of price inflation, we still have time to make sure "
2948,1996-11-13," Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation for no change in policy Indeed, given that the recent data suggest that  -37-    11/13/96  the risks have become more balanced, I am more comfortable supporting a proposal of unchanged policy than I was at the last meeting I still think the major risk is that inflation will begin to rise over the next year An asymmetric directive reminds us of the importance of remaining vigilant in the face of this risk, and I therefore support your proposal to retain the current policy posture "
3001,1996-12-17," The limited amount of data that we now have available since the last meeting does not alter the picture of the economy, and that picture is a remarkably good one Economic growth has now slowed to trend I read core measures of inflation as stable to still declining The unemployment rate remains locked in a low but narrow band Still, I think we all appreciate that good monetary policy is forward-looking So, the relevant question is, what change can we look forward to with enough confidence to justify a change in policy today?  Given that we are beginning from full employment, one justification for a policy change would be a strong conviction that growth over the forecast horizon will be persistently above or below trend But the risks related to growth have really become more balanced over the last several months The Greenbook forecast indicates trend growth immediately ahead The discussion around the table suggests that few of us have a conviction that would justify a very different forecast I compared the Greenbook forecast to five of my favorite private-sector forecasts, and the range is remarkably tight On a fourth-quarter-to-fourth-quarter basis, the range for next year is from a low of 20 percent to a high of 24 percent This is a very narrow range Unemployment rates tend to be slightly higher than in the staff forecast; they jump off from about 54 percent, which is the current rate, rather than the lower 52 percent rate in the Greenbook, but again these forecasts are in a very narrow range that pretty much encompasses the estimates of trend growth  When we begin from trend growth, I think one thing that we might also recognize is that slight differences in the forecast for GDP growth, differences that are much smaller than the margin of forecast error, produce qualitatively different forecasts A forecast of slightly slower GDP growth at the lower limit of that range, like 2 percent, produces rising unemployment rates, as in the consensus Blue Chip forecast, whereas a slightly higher forecast of GDP growth produces a degree of further tightness in the economy and further risks of rising inflation that none of us views as acceptable  -27-    12/17/96  A second justification for policy change would be the conviction that we are already below NAIRU and not likely to move back to it quickly enough to prevent an uptick in inflation This is basically the staff forecast, and my view has been and continues to be that this is the most serious risk factor in the outlook Yet, we get stuck in place because we continue to be confronted by the reality of stable to declining core inflation in the face of this prevailing low unemployment rate So, we wait for additional data to resolve our doubts The risk of waiting, judging from the modest rise in inflation in the staff forecast, is not very great Still, it is probably worthwhile noting that in all of the five private-sector forecasts that I looked at, there are increases in core inflation over the next year or two That is a pervasive tendency that just about everybody is worried about I think we need to keep that in mind  Just a little historical perspective I think the major threat to an expansion comes from an ultimate overshooting of demand relative to productive capacity and from the resulting acceleration of inflation I do not believe that business cycles are dead Rather, I think there has been a coincidence of events that so far have permitted us to avoid pervasive excess demand and rising price pressures I want to suggest a few of them that we have not discussed very much Demand is always chasing supply during the expansion, but I think supply has been more elusive than normal in this particular cycle Effective labor supply has been increased by an apparent decline in NAIRU, so the unemployment rate has been chasing down a falling NAIRU In addition, we have had very strong capital spending in this expansion, and as a result we have seen very rapid growth in industrial capacity So, if we look at the price pressures in the product markets, they seem even better contained than the price pressures in the labor markets I think that is an important distinction One reason why this absence of pricing leverage makes sense is a lack of excess demand pressure in the product markets that makes firms more cautious about raising wages in response to labor market pressures and also more cautious about passing on wage increases that do occur Other factors that have inhibited the normal buoyancy in demand at this stage in the cycle have been the continuing fiscal restraint and the persistent drag from net exports So, supply has been increasing more rapidly perhaps than normal, demand has been less buoyant, and that is what has created the current environment  But as I said, the business cycle is not dead; history suggests that the risks are tilted in favor of demand ultimately overshooting productive capacity and causing higher inflation While this should not prevent us from enjoying the current balanced prosperity and good performance, it does suggest vigilance rather than complacency as we move into 1997 "
3002,1996-12-17," Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation As the risks have become more balanced over the last few months, it has clearly become a closer call as to whether the directive should be symmetric or asymmetric Nevertheless, the major risk seems to be a  -39-    12/17/96  rise in the inflation rate and I therefore concur with that asymmetric directive  Let me just preview our next discussion since we seem to be focusing in advance on the February meeting and the potential discussion of longer-term targets and strategies I would certainly respond well to some notion of a cap like 3 percent on inflation, but I am going to be very troubled from my opportunistic perspective about laying out a specific year-to-year path I would not want to feel committed to a specific path Thank you "
3050,1997-03-25," Thank you, Mr Chairman I want to focus on two key questions  about the outlook that I believe should shape our decision about monetary policy today  First, how does the economic environment, meaning both the recent data and the current  forecast, differ today from that prevailing at the July and September FOMC meetings--which  in my judgment were the closest calls for a tightening of policy--and more generally from  that prevailing for the entire recent period of the asymmetric policy directive? Second, how  do today's forecasts for 1997 by members of the FOMC compare to the central tendencies of  the forecasts for the year that the members submitted at the February meeting and that were  incorporated in the Humphrey-Hawkins report?    3/25/97  This focus presumes that any change in policy we contemplate today would reflect  a change in the FOMC members' readings of the fundamentals and risks in the economic  outlook That would be the natural assumption However, the comments of at least some  members at the last meeting could be interpreted as indicating that they already had changed  their view about monetary policy but thought that a tightening should be postponed until this  meeting to allow an opportunity to prepare the market And the market certainly has been  prepared! [Laughter] For myself, however, some trigger, some change in the fundamentals,  is necessary to push me to accept a change in policy I will focus here on whether or not  there has been such a change in fundamentals  Let me remind you of the basic framework that has underpinned my judgment  about monetary policy during this period I worry about two risks to the inflation outlook  the utilization and the growth risks The utilization risk refers to the possibility that the  prevailing utilization rates may already be so high that inflation will rise over time The  growth risk relates to the possibility that future above-trend growth will raise utilization rates  still further, thereby aggravating the risk of higher inflation Given the uncertainty about  how to judge utilization rates, we have tempered our inclination to be forward-looking in our  policy actions and have given added weight to recent data on inflation and labor costs There  is, nevertheless, a causal chain that I believe we have been relying on--from growth relative  to trend, to utilization rates, to wage changes, and finally to inflation There are, to be sure,  complications associated with changing profit margins, possible change in the productivity  trend, favorable or unfavorable supply shocks, and change in threshold levels of utilization  rates But this causal chain is and must be at the heart of preemptive policy    3/25/97  Policy could be said to be more forward-looking or preemptive the more willing  we are to act earlier in this causal chain The importance I attach to this causal chain  necessitates a response to the flurry of disclaimers around this table at the last meeting about  the usefulness of NAIRU I intended to respond then but, frankly, I somehow got distracted  [Laughter] As the most enthusiastic champion of the NAIRU concept around this table, let  me briefly respond now because I think that concept is relevant to our decision today  The concept fundamentally involves three principles First, a major proximate  source of higher inflation is excess demand in the labor and/or product markets Second, the  causal chain is most likely to proceed from excess demand in the labor market, to wage  changes and hence labor costs, and finally to price inflation Third, as long as the excess  demand prevails, inflation continues to rise progressively and indefinitely over time I  frankly would be shocked if most of us around this table did not believe in these principles  To be sure, applying them has become more difficult of late because the implied  relationships have not been nearly as tight as had been the case earlier There are data that  suggest some decline in the NAIRU Nevertheless, these principles must in my view be the  framework for conducting a disciplined monetary policy, and I believe that is central to any  decision to tighten today  Now back to the outlook What is different today in the data and/or the forecast  compared to what we had at FOMC meetings during the period of asymmetric directives?  To set up my later discussion of my position on monetary policy, I will organize the  discussion from the perspective of the Taylor Rule A rough summary is that current  utilization rates are about the same and core inflation is lower Unlike at earlier meetings,  the forecast now shows continued above-trend growth immediately ahead and, as a result,    3/25/97  higher utilization rates over the next year or two The current Greenbook projection of a  decline in the unemployment rate is not much different from what was projected at the last  meeting, though I would argue that this forecast is more believable now for many of us At  the February meeting, both the Greenbook and FOMC members were projecting near-trend  growth over 1997, but the FOMC members were forecasting stable unemployment rates in  contrast to the decline projected in the Greenbook The current data on utilization rates and  core inflation are no more alarming now than earlier, and perhaps less so So, if we want to  justify action today, we have to look at an earlier stage of the causal chain  In his recent testimony, the Chairman has focused on labor market indicators as  being of special importance in reaching a decision for a preemptive move, and I agree Let  us take stock here The data on compensation are somewhat mixed, but they suggest some  acceleration on balance The latest 12-month increase in average hourly earnings is 1/4 to  1/2 percentage point higher than had prevailed at the time of the July and September  meetings On the other hand, the increases in average hourly earnings were rather tame in  the last couple of months There is certainly a hint here but hardly a smoking gun On the  other hand, virtually all other indicators of labor market tightness are at more elevated levels  today help wanted ads are up, initial claims for unemployment insurance are down, the index  of hard-to-get jobs is down, and consumer sentiment about jobs being plentiful is up But the  key to our decision today is the change in the forecast  Ill focus now on the Greenbook forecast, which may be more aggressive in certain  respects than some of our own forecasts This will effectively serve to make more dramatic  the point I want to make There is a significant change in the current Greenbook forecast for  1997 from the forecasts prepared for the July and September meetings and even that for the    3/25/97  February meeting Compared to the earlier meetings, the Greenbook now projects a 2-3/4  percent rate of growth over 1997 in contrast to just above 2 percent at the July and September  meetings and 2-1/4 percent at the February meeting This follows an unexpectedly strong  second half of 1996 To be sure, as is almost always the case in such projections, growth  slows to trend over the forecast period But the combination of a stronger second half of  1996 and an upward revised forecast for 1997 translates into an increase in the level of output  and hence utilization rates in 1997 and 1998 At the July and September meetings, the  unemployment rate was expected to stabilize near 5-1/2 percent for 1997 Now it is expected  to decline to 5 percent this year and below 5 percent in 1998 Just to underline the difficulty  in making and selling any policy change, the other important difference in the Greenbook  forecast is that inflation for 1997 has been revised downward relative to the July and  September meetings  To repeat the second question, how did we FOMC members change our forecasts  for growth over 1997 and the unemployment rate at the end of this year compared to the  central tendencies of the forecasts that we submitted for incorporation in the  Humphrey-Hawkins report? For my part, I see the economy as having more near-term  momentum than I did at the last meeting, and therefore I now expect the unemployment rate  to be lower in the second half of the year and into 1998 As a result, I have revised upward  my expectations for inflation over 1998 "
3051,1997-03-25," Thank you, Mr Chairman I strongly support your  recommendation for a 25 basis point increase in the funds rate, and I can accept your  recommendation for a symmetric directive though I could have been persuaded to go for an  asymmetric one I will come back to that later I want to focus my remarks, though, on an  analytical framework for supporting this kind of a move First, I want to consider the  implications of the Taylor Rule and talk about the importance of a flexible approach to  interest rates in response to economic developments I also want to explain why we should  not leave the task of countercyclical policy to the bond market and present an interpretation of  tightening in terms of what I will call the maxi/min solution  The Taylor Rule, as Don Kohn noted in his presentation, would suggest no move  at this meeting because utilization rates are about the same as they have been and core  inflation is actually lower While the Taylor Rule does not provide support for an action  today, it would suggest that, if the Greenbook forecast proves to be correct, we will want to  tighten later There is, however, an alternative specification of the Taylor Rule that would, in  my view, support a tightening of policy today I will call it the forward-looking Taylor Rule  To be sure, the standard rule is forward-looking to a degree in relation to inflation because it  includes current utilization rates But in the forward-looking Taylor Rule, actual values of  inflation and utilization rates are replaced by forecasts There is a growing literature on  forward-looking policy reaction functions An early paper was done by Steve McNees at the  Federal Reserve Bank of Boston in the mid-1980s and updated in the early 1990s Over the  last year, in fact, there has been a flurry of additional work along this avenue, including work  in progress at the Board, which finds that policymaking has tended to evolve over the last 15  years from reliance on incoming data to gradual responses to forecasts However, these    3/25/97  papers are an exercise in description and what we really need is a normative analysis to  confirm that moving in response to forecasts, given the accuracy of forecasts, would produce  better results than responding to actual data  Would such a forward-looking reaction function provide support for moving today  when we did not choose to move at earlier meetings? In terms of thinking about raising  interest rates today, we might interpret the recent strengthening as a shift in the IS curve and  ask whether monetary policy should impose a horizontal LM curve that would resist the  natural tendency for stronger growth to push up interest rates Alternatively, should  monetary policy enforce an upward sloping LM curve that allows a stabilizing response to  cyclical strength? In fact, there has been a lot of discussion or implicit commentary around  the table about the old pegging strategy, the mistakes of the 1960s, and also more discussion  of M2 than at any of the previous FOMC meetings that I have attended One of the  implications of imposing that horizontal LM curve is allowing an acceleration of M2 growth  in response to a shift in the IS curve  Some might argue that because long-term interest rates already have risen along  with the dollar, the economy is moving along an upward-sloping LM curve I do not believe,  however, that we should leave monetary policy to the bond market The question is whether  we should be validating or resisting the recent move in long-term rates That move after all  reflected to a significant degree the bond markets' expectation of a shift in monetary policy,  particularly as a result of the Chairman's recent testimony combined with the recent strength  in the data Let's pat the bond markets on the back and tell them that we appreciate their  effort but also let them know that they should not have to do all the work    3/25/97  Finally, let me discuss the maxi/min solution Here I compare the consequences of  two types of mistakes we could make today not tightening when that would have been  appropriate versus tightening when it was not needed In this approach, a decision today can  be interpreted as selecting the best of the worst possible outcomes First, consider what  would happen if we tighten when that turns out to be unnecessary, NAIRU could turn out to  be lower than anticipated, productivity growth higher than projected, or demand  unexpectedly weaker The unemployment rate could then be higher than would have been  desirable and inflation lower than otherwise In this case, the unemployment rate would still  be at a historically low level and inflation would be moving toward our long-run objective,  not a really bad outcome Indeed, that would be a preferred outcome for some on this  Committee  On the other hand, if we failed to tighten when it would have been appropriate to  do so, the excess demand gap would open or widen and inflation could increase We would  then face the Taylor Rule's triple whammy on the funds rate We would have to raise the  funds rate to prevent the real rate from declining, to counter the rise in output relative to  potential, and to combat the increase in inflation relative to our target This is usually an  ugly affair It does not end well for the economy  Mr Chairman, because I am guided by a forward-looking specification of the  Taylor Rule, because I believe we should be flexible in adjusting interest rates to changing  economic developments, because I think we should enforce an upward-sloping LM curve in  response to shifts in the IS curve, and because it is a maxi/min solution, I support your  recommendation for tightening monetary policy Because containing a threat to higher  inflation is likely to require some further increase in short-term rates beyond the small    3/25/97  change contemplated today, I could have accepted a call for an asymmetric directive I think  that is particularly true given that your comments raised the possibility, if not the likelihood,  of a move between now and the next meeting That sounds like an asymmetric directive to  me But I do not see that as a very important point, and I can certainly accept your scenario "
3094,1997-05-20," My reading of first-quarter performance and incoming monthly  data suggests the economy will slow sharply in the second quarter in line with the Greenbook    5/20/97  forecast Special factors boosted growth in the first quarter while payback and special factors  are at work in the current quarter Inventory investment clearly is playing an important role  in the near-term dynamics On the other hand, the fundamentals supporting the expansion  remain very positive and suggest a rebound in the second half to at least slightly above-trend  growth As a result, the economy is likely over the forecast horizon and in the absence of  further policy action to remain at the high level of labor resource utilization rates reached in  April  Monetary policy decisions are appropriately conditioned by the inflow of data  between meetings I want to focus on an interpretation of that data, and there certainly was  something for everyone in that data First, we had the first-quarter GDP report with its  surprisingly robust growth immediately followed by a decline in the unemployment rate in  April to a 23-year low and to a level outside the narrow range that had prevailed over the last  year and half Second, we had reasonably strong evidence of a sharp slowdown in growth in  the second quarter Third, we had better-than-expected performance in labor costs, focusing  on the first-quarter ECI report and the April reading on average hourly earnings, combined  with mixed evidence on inflation On balance, the evidence did not suggest a trend toward  higher inflation, but it seemed to indicate a reduced prospect that core CPI inflation is still  declining  The data on the unemployment rate signal higher inflation risk The information  on current quarter growth, particularly when combined with the Greenbook forecast of  near-trend growth beyond the second quarter, suggests less risk of further increases in  utilization rates But these two developments do not offset The threat of continued  above-trend growth we faced at the last meeting has already delivered its consequence in the    5/20/97  form of higher utilization rates In the framework of utilization and growth risks that I have  been using to assess the risk of higher inflation, the data since the last meeting simply have  transformed growth risk into utilization risk This was a bad trade from the perspective of  inflation risk We traded a speculative increase in utilization rates, because that is what  growth risk is, for a realized increase in labor utilization rates  There are at least two sources of increased uncertainty suggested by the flow of  data between meetings Such uncertainty sometimes encourages caution in policy action, and  I expect it to weigh on our decision today First, there may be greater uncertainty about the  second-half outlook, given the sharpness of the slowdown that now appears under way in the  second quarter and given questions about the degree and persistence of the expected slowing  in inventory investment That is, even though the combination of stronger-than-expected  first-quarter growth and the sharp slowing projected in the Greenbook for the second quarter  leaves the first half stronger than was projected at the last meeting, the distribution of that  strength over the two quarters might add some downside risk to the second-half forecast  Second, the better-than-expected performance of labor costs in the first-quarter ECI report  and the April reading for average hourly earnings might increase further the uncertainty  about the estimate of NAIRU and hence increase the uncertainty about the degree of  deterioration to be expected in the inflation outlook if the economy returns to trend growth  and the unemployment rate stabilizes at its current level  I believe that the fundamentals supporting the expansion remain very positive I  am going to focus on two examples of the positive underlying fundamentals financial  conditions broadly defined and consumer confidence We might ask what factors have  contributed to the strong above-trend growth over the last year and a half A supportive set    5/20/97  of financial conditions certainly seems to have been a factor Financial conditions either  have been sufficiently stimulative to promote this strength or not sufficiently restrictive to  prevent the resurgence Borrowing terms generally are viewed as attractive for home buying,  for consumer durable purchases, and for business fixed investment If there is a problem, it  is the excessive amount of borrowing that some households would like to undertake under  prevailing financial conditions  How have financial conditions changed since the March 25 policy action? That  action was widely anticipated, so it largely was reflected in financial market conditions at the  time of the move Since the March move, however, long-term interest rates have edged  slightly lower, the stock market has rallied, the dollar first rose and then declined to below its  initial level A monetary conditions index for the United States, which took account of  short-term and long-term interest rates, the stock market, and exchange rates would, I  believe, show more favorable financial market conditions today than was the case  immediately following the March move  I do not ordinarily place great weight on measures of consumer confidence in my  own forecast, so I don't want to oversell the significance of the latest reading when it  supports the case I want to make But the preliminary report of the Michigan Consumer  Sentiment Index for early May was extremely interesting It shows a decline in the index as  it relates to current economic conditions that are consistent with the projected near-term  slowing But it also indicates a sharp improvement in expectations about future conditions  supportive of the prospect of a solid second-half rebound Let me read you a few sentences  from Richard Curtin's interpretation of the early May data on consumer sentiment  ""Extraordinary strength was recorded in consumer sentiment during the first half of May,    5/20/97  with the Sentiment Index reaching a new record level The early May gain reflected  consumer reactions to the very favorable economic news that has dominated the headlines  record low unemployment, strong GDP growth, and a resurgent stock market Moreover, in  sharp contrast with the initial reaction to the interest rate hike, consumers have now  concluded that the recent increase will have little, if any, impact on future economic  conditions To be sure, consumers have not changed their views that further interest rate  hikes would be forthcoming in the year ahead Consumers, however, no longer expect those  rate increases to damp income gains nor to represent a barrier to planned purchases""  My conclusion is that the projected slowing in the current quarter is part payback,  part special factors, part breather, but not likely to be the beginning of an extended period of  below-trend growth The underlying fundamentals remain very positive As a result, from  the perspective of monetary policy, we should give appropriate attention to the level of  utilization rates For better or worse, this is what will determine the course of inflation over  the coming quarters "
3095,1997-05-20," Let me begin with some further thoughts on the Taylor Rule  perspective on monetary policy options and the changes in initial conditions and forecasts    5/20/97  between this meeting and the March meeting This will lead me into my own version of the  policy options for today's decision, with special attention to the interpretations attached to  the options I will conclude with some considerations relating to initial conditions and to  other policy priorities that might justify a willingness to assume greater inflation risks  The Taylor Rule perspective underlies my strongly held view that prudent  monetary policy should lean against the cyclical winds by enforcing a procyclical pattern in  real short-term interest rates Specifically, I believe that real short-term interest rates should  rise in proportion to increases in utilization rates over the course of a cycle and that such a  disciplined response is especially critical as the economy approaches capacity I interpreted  our action at the last FOMC meeting as being justified by a forward-looking version of the  Taylor rule; that is, by a forecast at the last meeting of rising utilization and inflation rates in  the absence of policy action The wisdom of that move was quickly apparent, to me at least,  in the quicker-than-expected realization of higher labor utilization rates We might in  retrospect call it a ""just-in-time"" monetary policy action!  In my view, we tightened in March because we believed that continued  above-trend growth would lower the unemployment rate to or below 5 percent by midyear, in  line with the staff forecast The unemployment rate is already where we feared it might go  Why should a forecast of more moderate growth ahead make us more relaxed? All the  forecast of a return-to-trend growth guarantees is that the economy will linger indefinitely in  this precarious position until inflation does turn up  In short, we have more reason in my view to be concerned about inflation on May  20th than we did on March 25th, not less If one accepts the view that there is indeed  justification for some tightening, the next question is how much of a cumulative move is    5/20/97  justified by today's initial conditions and how gradually should such a tightening be  implemented over time We can get some guidance on this subject from alternative  specifications of the Taylor Rule as well as from model simulations of alternative funds rate  paths around the base forecast I conclude on the basis of guidance from those sources that  the real federal funds rate should move at least percentage point for percentage point with the  unemployment rate, with some of the evidence suggesting that the best stabilizing results  come from a gradual policy response that cumulates to twice this magnitude  The bottom line of the analysis is that some further tightening appears justified by  current initial conditions and forecasts On the other hand, it would be hard to argue that  recent data on labor costs and inflation suggest a high degree of urgency about taking the  next step today I also can accept the wisdom of a view that present uncertainties might  suggest a more gradual implementation of any cumulative tightening than otherwise  In my outlook statement, I noted two uncertainties that could influence our  judgment today, particularly about the timing of any action The first is that the data on labor  cost inflation in the period between meetings raised further questions about the estimate of  NAIRU and suggested that the staff forecast of rising inflation at prevailing utilization rates  may be too pessimistic The second is the sharpness of the projected decline in second-  quarter growth, which encourages the Committee to wait until we confirm the expected  rebound The Chairman has focused on a third uncertainty--heightened by first-quarter  profits data--the trend in productivity growth  With the above considerations as background, let me offer my own version of the  Bluebook policy options for your consideration First, we have alternative B, no change  This alternative could be supported on the basis of two quite different arguments I want to    5/20/97  place at least as much emphasis on the principles that underlie the action as on the action  itself Let me call the first rationale for no action the ""B/reactive policy"" alternative It  carries the following interpretation growth is slowing sharply in the current quarter, and it is  projected to be near trend over the remainder of the forecast horizon Therefore, we can  comfortably return to a reactive posture of watchful waiting A move to a tighter policy in  the absence of evidence of a sharper rise in labor costs or direct evidence of higher core  inflation would require at least a forecast of above-trend growth if not evidence of persistent  above-trend growth This justification for no action seems to make growth the issue rather  than utilization rates It seems to be a surrender to a reactive posture This approach could  be taken a step further to hold that, given the uncertainty about productivity growth, we  should not even worry about the strength of growth Do not worry about utilization rates  Do not worry about growth Do not worry about wages because their increase could simply  be a response to higher productivity growth Worry only about inflation, the ultimate  reactive posture This might be the best we can do if we believe that we know so little about  the structure of the economy that past regularities provide no guidance for current policy  For my own part, the puzzles of the current episode have not yet pushed me into this camp  Some might worry that this view suggests that irrational exuberance has affected more than  the stock market  I will take the liberty of redefining alternative C in my menu of options as 1/4  percentage point of additional tightening today This would be the second step in a cautious  but still preemptive policy posture It is justified by the increase in utilization rates since the  last meeting combined with the expectation, consistent with the Greenbook forecast, that  utilization rates are likely to remain at or below this level going forward In light of the    5/20/97  uncertainties I have previously discussed, we could accompany this move with an  announcement that indicates an intent to pause after the March and May moves The pause  would allow us to await confirmation of a rebound in demand in the third quarter, to assess  the degree and persistence of the projected slowing in inventory investment, and to evaluate  the implications of additional information on labor costs and inflation and whether utilization  rates were already so high as to yield a rising trend of inflation The pause also would  provide an opportunity to assess the July NIPA revisions for insights about trend productivity  growth Given the prevailing large statistical discrepancy and the recent unexpected surge in  tax receipts, there is reason to be particularly interested in this revision  Let me offer a third alternative as a compromise, which I call ""B/go slow,"" that I  hope is in keeping with the spirit of the Chairman's proposal Like the ""B/reactive"" policy, it  calls for no change in policy today, presumably combined with an asymmetric directive that  clearly is justified by the inflation risks in today's initial conditions But it also carries the  expectation that current utilization rates may justify additional tightening We postpone any  tightening today in light of present uncertainties in order to confirm expectations that demand  and growth do firm, that unemployment remains at 5 percent or below, and to have time to  assess the implications of additional data on trends in labor costs, inflation, and productivity  ""B/go slow""could be thought of as a slower moving version of ""C"" It still allows us to cling  to a preemptive posture, but it suggests additional caution in light of the present uncertainties  It might well be argued that there is only a hair of difference when all is said and done  between any of these alternatives But a ""B/reactive"" policy is of great concern to me It  suggests a willingness to abandon any sense of preemptive policy in favor of resuming a    5/20/97  reactive posture that history suggests will ultimately produce overheating and higher inflation  and that will end up threatening the expansion  I prefer ""C"" I think it is the more disciplined policy, the more balanced approach,  but I could live with ""B/go slow"" if it contributes to a stronger FOMC consensus about  current and prospective policy  Let me turn now to two quite different sets of considerations that would be  consistent with the choice of a reactive strategy I am not promoting either of these  justifications--I have already committed to preemptive ""C""--but I believe they deserve to be  put on the table The first is the economic and political difficulty, what I will call a ""reverse""  soft landing I view the monetary policy implementation through 1996 as an attempt to  achieve a conventional soft landing It involved slowing the expansion to trend before it  overshot capacity, thereby stabilizing inflation and extending the expansion We already  have seen that it can be difficult to muster public support even for such a sensible policy  effort Given the recent decline in the unemployment rate, we might now need a monetary  policy that is attempting a reverse soft landing in which we approach capacity from above  and thus require a period of below-trend growth to allow actual output to drift back down to  capacity Perhaps more to the point, it would be a period of below-trend growth to raise the  unemployment rate back to NAIRU Such a policy is very difficult to sell and very difficult  to achieve It might be argued in this case that the best we can do is to attempt to slow the  economy to trend, hope for the best, and react if necessary to clear and persistent signs of  higher inflation I wonder if this is a factor encouraging some to accept a reactive posture  A second consideration, and one increasingly talked about, is that a policy priority  for sustaining a high-pressure economy, one close to capacity, may have increased    5/20/97  Achieving maximum sustainable employment would ensure an environment that would  reduce the tensions and challenges associated with welfare reform and the associated  movement from welfare to work Given the continued uncertainty about NAIRU, it has been  argued that this is an opportune time to experiment by allowing the unemployment rate to  decline further, even below the best guess of the current NAIRU, to ensure that we avoid  sacrificing any employment that could possibly be sustained without accelerating inflation  I think these are provocative arguments for a reactive posture They do not,  however, sway me from my preference for a cautiously preemptive stance I am still aiming  to avoid overheating and sustain the expansion I like my version of ""C,"" but I can accept the  Chairman's version of ""B,"" which I take to be a ""go slow"" strategy and not a retreat to a  reactive policy "
3140,1997-08-19," I definitely identify with the old paradigm, albeit with an updated  estimate of NAIRU [Laughter]   But I am at least an old paradigm with a new NAIRU I recently have  become more optimistic about the near-term outlook in response to data indicating much larger  than expected inventory building in the second quarter, continued favorable inflation news, and the  further appreciation of the dollar These developments suggest that it is now less likely that the  economy will rebound to well-above-trend growth in the second half, and more likely that inflation  will remain well contained in the near term I guess that makes me, along with Bob Parry, an old  paradigm newly found optimist  This more benign outlook reflects crosscurrents on both output growth and inflation in  the near term, crosscurrents that are very well captured in the Greenbook forecast and discussion  The first crosscurrent is between slowing inventory investment and rebounding demand While this  was a minor story in the forecast at the last meeting, the higher pace of second-quarter inventory  investment, especially in light of expected revisions to the data, has made this a dominant theme of    8/19/97  the near-term outlook As a result, the economy is more likely to grow closer to trend in the second  half, and therefore there is less concern that utilization rates will rise further  A second set of crosscurrents affects the inflation outlook I continue to be concerned  about the risks of higher inflation as a result of an economy that is operating beyond its sustainable  capacity The resulting upward trend in inflation should be reinforced for a while to the extent that  the restraining effect of favorable transitory factors recently in play diminish over time  Developments so far this year, however, suggest crosscurrents that might slow this process  First, the better than expected inflation outcome this year, both in terms of lower core  and especially lower overall inflation, and the modest acceleration in compensation per hour will  act in the near term to restrain wage and price increases going forward In this case, it is inertia that  is our friend, and the result is a virtuous wage/price spiral  Second, some of the transitory factors that have been restraining inflation, particularly  the effect of the dollar on import prices, appear to be less transitory than previously expected  following the further appreciation of the dollar since the last meeting  Third, the upward adjustment of profits in the NIPA revisions suggests more of a cushion  that might delay passthroughs of any future increases in compensation While the net effect is still  likely to be higher inflation over the forecast horizon, any increase will begin from a slightly lower  base, and at least over the forecast horizon may be even more modest than previously expected  The net effect is the prospect of a more benign environment going forward, though one certainly  not without its challenges Looking at the Greenbook forecast, it's hard not to be delighted with the  projected outcome in 1998 unless we have become jaded by two years of stronger-than-expected  growth and lower-than-expected inflation    8/19/97  While the near-term outlook looks more benign, I still view the risks as asymmetric  Consensus forecasts for the second half, for example, still appear to be in the 2-1/2 to 3 percent  range, compared to the 2-1/4 percent rate projected in the Greenbook While the slowdown in  inventories should be a drag in the period immediately ahead, I would interpret the inventory  building in the second quarter as largely voluntary, and therefore a measure of the confidence that  businesses have in the economy going forward That confidence undoubtedly reflects the sound  fundamentals supporting demand and is consistent with the initial indicators of the strength of  demand in the third quarter Growth over the second half is therefore more likely to be above than  below trend in my view As a result, it remains more likely that utilization rates will rise further  rather than decline, at least for the second half of the year In addition, even without a further rise,  prevailing utilization rates continue to point toward higher inflation over time  One of the more intriguing aspects of the Greenbook forecast is the projection of  utilization rates The Greenbook projects a nearly unchanged unemployment rate, but a declining  capacity utilization rate even after taking account of a slowing in the growth of investment  spending in the manufacturing sector and a resulting moderation in the rate of increase in industrial  capacity A decline in the capacity utilization rate with an unchanged unemployment rate would  further widen the disparity between these two measures of resource utilization, already one of the  interesting anomalies of the current episode If this divergence is part of the explanation for the  apparent decline in NAIRU and the surprisingly favorable inflation outcome, the further widening  of this gap may further damp the responsiveness of inflation to the already low unemployment rate  Maybe But I expect one of the more important stories still to be written about this expansion is  how the economy will find its way back to NAIRU, assuming we are already below NAIRU In the  Blue Chip consensus forecast, the economy slows on its own over 1998 to a below-trend rate and,    8/19/97  as a result, the unemployment rate retreats slowly toward NAIRU, fortunately before inflation rises  to any considerable degree In this case perhaps we can sit back and watch  In the Greenbook on the other hand, the economy grows at trend, preserving the  prevailing utilization rates, and as a result, inflation rises gradually over time This version of the  story is waiting for us to write the conclusion The change in the outlook since our last meeting  suggests, however, that we may have more time to refine our forecast before we have to pen our  conclusion "
3141,1997-08-19," Don, before each FOMC meeting we are provided a memo on what  various rules are indicating, the Taylor rule particularly My recollection is that the equilibrium  real interest rate constructed in that case is for a 2 percent real funds rate, using the chained GDP  deflator   Do you want to talk briefly about the table at the bottom of chart 10 in  your handout and its implications? While I am a strong believer in some of the wisdom embedded  in the Taylor rule, I have been concerned for a long time that we need to be more careful about how  we set its level by coming up with a more reasonable estimate of the equilibrium real funds rate  The 2 percent comes from Taylor's heuristic rounding Do you think this table provides a  somewhat more thoughtful estimate?    8/19/97   Agree "
3187,1997-09-30," My view of the economic outlook has changed rather significantly since  the last meeting At that time, it appeared that growth had slowed more sharply in the second  quarter than now appears to have been the case and that growth might remain near its sustainable  trend in the second half and into 1998 To be sure, the risk of higher inflation remained, but the  slowdown in growth and the recent favorable inflation performance removed any sense of urgency  to the policy decision  The crosscurrents that underpinned the earlier forecast, specifically between the  projected slowing in inventory investment and the expected rebound in demand, seem well enough  in evidence now and continue to underpin the forecast of slower growth in the second half of this  year But crosscurrents do not necessarily balance, and the crosscurrents in question apparently  have not yielded a return to trend growth Indeed, growth in the third quarter appears likely to be    9/30/97  about as strong as it was in the second quarter Perhaps more importantly, the ample evidence of  positive fundamentals including, I believe, supportive financial conditions and the absence of signs  of imbalances suggest that growth is likely to remain above trend for some time in the absence of a  change in policy As a result, it now appears likely that the unemployment rate will decline to a  new cyclical low in coming quarters  Three important changes in the Greenbook forecast for this meeting effectively highlight  the key issues in the forecast First, the staff forecast for growth in the first half of 1998 was  revised upward to about a 3 percent rate, with the unemployment rate falling to 4-1/2 percent by  mid-1998 Second, a series of adjustments and forecast assumptions were introduced that  moderated the decline in the unemployment rate and the rise in inflation associated with a higher  growth forecast And third, the normal practice of a constant funds rate, either nominal or more  recently real, was replaced by a preemptive policy response The key is the interaction among  these changes Even with the more favorable assumptions about the link from growth to inflation  pressures, the higher growth path of the Greenbook forecast yields an unfavorable inflation  outcome, justifying a preemptive policy response  I believe that the risks relative to the staff growth forecast are now more evenly  balanced, and I would endorse a preemptive policy response to the projected decline in the  unemployment rate and increased risk of inflation I do have some reservations, however, about  three changes in assumptions in this forecast, each of which worked to diminish the response of  inflation to the upward revised path of growth The staff revised upward its projections of both  labor force and productivity growth, in effect raising the trend rate of GDP growth over the forecast  period and as a result moderating the decline in the unemployment rate In addition, the staff  revised downward the response of wages and prices to the lower unemployment rate Mike Prell    9/30/97  referred to these changes as a flirtation with new era thinking They are clearly an effort to balance  what I have called regularities and possibilities Whatever the merits of these adjustments, they  leave in my judgment considerably greater upside risk to the Greenbook forecast of inflation than  has been the case in earlier forecasts  I can appreciate the conditions that motivated such adjustments I too would like to get  the inflation forecast right for a change, and I too want to be careful to balance regularities and  possibilities in my forecast I can hardly argue that the adjustments that were made are implausible  or that the productivity path in the forecast is unbelievable But this does change the balance of  risks, in my view, in relation to the Greenbook forecast  While the policy change is introduced in an understated way in the Greenbook, it is also  an important change in the forecast assumptions It is notable not only because it is preemptive, but  also because the increase in rates is sharper than previously assumed and begins earlier The policy  message is clearer than it otherwise might have been, precisely because the staff leaned so far with  its forecast assumptions in order to limit the chance that the forecast overstated the risk of higher  inflation  I believe there are some interesting similarities today to the situation we faced at the  March meeting when we raised the federal funds rate Leading up to that meeting, the  unemployment rate had moved within a narrow range; it was near the bottom end of that range,  near a cyclical low and below estimates of NAIRU The forecast for near-term growth at that  meeting was revised upward from the earlier forecast of trend growth The resulting projection of  above-trend growth was accompanied by a forecast of a decline in the unemployment rate to below  its recent rate As a result, the forecast presented a combination of utilization and growth risks that  compounded the threat of higher inflation compared to the earlier forecasts and galvanized support    9/30/97  for a tightening move Given the changes in the forecast since the last meeting, we again face a  similar combination of utilization and growth risks going forward, and those risks are compounded  by the fact that we begin with an unemployment rate nearly 1/2 percentage point lower than was the  case in March Fortunately, we also begin at a lower inflation rate But as a proponent of  opportunistic disinflation, I want to hold on to this lower inflation going forward "
3188,1997-09-30," Mr Chairman, I agree with you and I endorse all elements of your policy  recommendation no change in the funds rate today; maintaining an asymmetric directive; and,  importantly, recognition that there is an increased possibility, if not a presumption, that a tightening  move will be justified in November, assuming the data between now and then confirm the thrust of  the Greenbook forecast  My view is that monetary policy should continue to lean against the cyclical winds and  be cautiously preemptive In my view, such a preemptive move might well be in order at the next  meeting By that time, we will have two additional employment reports, the third-quarter ECI  report, and a better feel for the momentum of the economy early in the fourth quarter This timing  is also consistent with my view that there are windows of opportunity for policy tightening We are  not, in my judgment, at such a window at this moment, but I expect we may be approaching one It  is easier to change policy, for example, when the financial markets anticipate a move and when the  public will understand it It is easier for this reason to tighten when growth is above trend and the  unemployment rate is moving lower than when the economy has slowed to trend and the  unemployment rate has stabilized, whatever its level  In my view, to maintain a preemptive course, to sustain the decline in inflation we have  recently achieved, and to take advantage of a possible window of opportunity, we should be  prepared to tighten in November if the data confirm continued above-trend growth and rising  utilization rates "
3235,1997-11-12," Thank you, Mr Chairman The outlook for monetary policy has  become more complex since our last meeting On the one hand, the slightly stronger-than-  expected third-quarter GDP report, indications that the momentum in economic activity has  carried into the fourth quarter, and a decline in the unemployment rate in October all underscore  and reinforce concerns voiced at the last meeting about the threat of higher inflation and the  convergence of growth and utilization risks On the other hand, the developments in Southeast  Asia suggest a new downdraft on growth next year and further restraint on inflation, reducing the  degree of tightening that would otherwise have been appropriate and adding an important  element of downside risk that perhaps was absent previously  How do these things balance out? Given the staff's judgment about the implications  of developments in Southeast Asia, the dominant concern in my judgment is the momentum in  demand and the recent and prospective declines in the unemployment rate that continue to point  to a growing risk of higher inflation While I am comfortable with the staff forecast of growth, I  am concerned, as I was at the last meeting, that the unemployment rate might drift lower than  projected by the staff and that inflation might rise more than they anticipate, reflecting my  somewhat less optimistic assessment of trend productivity growth    11/12/97  One doubt sometimes expressed about the need for further tightening in this  environment is the possibility that increases in real interest rates this year have already imposed  the requisite degree of restraint Although the nominal federal funds rate has increased only  slightly, the sharp slowing in overall CPI inflation this year has raised real short-term interest  rates--computed by subtracting 12-month CPI inflation from nominal rates--by more than a  percentage point This method of computing real short-term rates is used by the staff, for  example, in international comparisons of real short-term interest rates The effect is qualitatively  similar though somewhat smaller if real interest rates are computed, as in the Taylor Rule, by  subtracting core CPI inflation from nominal interest rates Should we therefore conclude that, in  effect, a sufficiently aggressive tightening in monetary policy already has occurred to inoculate  the economy against the risk of higher inflation? The most important considerations may be that  the current level of real short-term interest rates, however high and however much they may have  increased this year, does not appear to be restraining demand growth and that credit availability  in general appears to be supportive of continued strong growth  But the key to why overall financial conditions still seem to be highly supportive may  be that real long-term interest rates, generally viewed as the more important force in aggregate  demand, appear to have declined over the year, even predating the decline in long-term  government rates during the current turmoil The contrast between the increase in real  short-term rates and the decline in real long-term rates reflects both differences in the movements  in short-term versus long-term inflation expectations and differences in the movements in short-  and long-term nominal rates Long-term inflation expectations as measured, for example, by the  median expected long-term inflation measure in the Michigan survey and inflation expectations    11/12/97 76  in the Philadelphia Fed survey have not changed much over this year, in contrast with the sharp  decline in actual CPI inflation and the smaller but still significant decline in other measures of  short-term inflation expectations Also, nominal long-term rates have declined compared to the  small increase in short-term nominal rates This is reinforced by the comments of President  Broaddus about the recent de facto easing produced by the further decline in long-term rates  Two other developments have reinforced the effect of the small decline in real  long-term interest rates on the real cost of capital First, there has been a further increase in  equity prices this year, contributing to a further decline in the cost of financing capital spending  Second, the sharpest slowdown in inflation has been that for durable goods Indeed, outright  declines have occurred in the prices of some durable goods, and in comparison with the prices of  overall output, the reduction in the relative prices of durable goods has further lowered the real  cost of capital for such goods  My message is that we should not take too much comfort in the rise in real short-term  interest rates that has been produced by a decline in actual inflation and an accompanying  decline in measures of short-term inflation expectations The financial conditions that are most  important in underpinning real economic activity continue to be highly supportive, indeed more  supportive than at the beginning of the year I conclude that if we want financial conditions to  become less supportive, we will have to do the dirty work ourselves "
3236,1997-11-12," Let me offer at least a slightly different perspective In the absence of  developments in Southeast Asia and the related turmoil in world financial markets, I believe a  1/4 percentage point increase in the funds rate would have been justified today In my judgment,  this move would have been consistent with the concerns voiced at the last meeting, concerns that  were reinforced by the stronger-than-expected growth of GDP in the third quarter, the decline in  the unemployment rate in October, and the upward revision to the GDP forecast for the fourth  quarter Such a move would have insured the procyclical movement in short-term interest rates  that I believe is so important to achieving our macroeconomic objective  Let me comment a little on my views on productivity I frankly do not see anything  amiss in the staff forecast of a sharp slowing in productivity growth next year GDP growth  slows in that forecast from 38 percent to 22 percent If we get the slowing in GDP growth  anticipated by the staff, then actual productivity growth should be quite sharply below trend  productivity growth The staff estimate of that trend may be a little high, but I think it is  defensible I would not want to go higher than it is  The second point I would make is that I do not believe the anticipated reduction in  productivity growth would be an important factor contributing to higher inflation The reason is    11/12/97 96  that I think pricing is done more off trend productivity than off actual productivity I believe the  slowdown in productivity growth is the key story behind the projected downturn in profits So,  the behavior of productivity is really more of a profits story than an inflation story But I  certainly agree that there is a lot of uncertainty about what that productivity trend is going to be,  and that is why I focus on utilization rates From the standpoint of monetary policy, I think that  is really what needs to be kept in mind Utilization rates continue to increase, but I think it  would be prudent to accompany that increase in utilization rates with a somewhat firmer  monetary policy   I think we have to look two-fold I am focusing more on the labor  markets for all the reasons that you suggested, but I also agree that the gap between capacity  utilization and the unemployment rate is important If that gap widens further, then my view  would be altered a little There is also no question in my mind that developments in Southeast  Asia and to a lesser extent the stock market correction and the uneasiness in world financial  markets fully support delaying any move to a tighter policy The reason is not only because of  the turmoil in financial markets but because of some uncertainty about just how sharp the  economic impact is going to be in Southeast Asia and what the spillover effects to other  developed economies and therefore to the United States are going to be So, I think there is a  premium on additional information that comes only from waiting In my view, that does caution  some patience, but again I would be concerned if we did not respond over the longer term to  increases in utilization rates "
3285,1997-12-16," Thank you, Mr Chairman The forecast to which policy must respond  is now being shaped by three powerful forces The first is the strong cyclical upturn over the last  two years The second is the diverse set of factors--some combination of temporary influences  and longer-lasting structural changes--that have restrained inflation and resulted in a virtual  disconnect between the real sector and the wage/price sector The new ingredient, also  threatening to be a powerful player in its own right, is the Asian turmoil In terms of monetary  policy, we mainly have watched as the first two forces have battled to a near draw We have  remained alert and asymmetric to be sure, but mostly unmoved Our inaction has been rewarded  with exceptional macroeconomic performance However, the further decline in the  unemployment rate over the past two months and the evidence of growth at a pace still well  above trend in this quarter have begun, in my judgment, to tilt the balance toward policy action  to lean against the cyclical winds, notwithstanding the continued excellent inflation performance  Simply put, an economy growing at a pace near 4 percent and operating at a 46  percent unemployment rate deserves to have a little sand thrown into its wheels The Asian  crisis will throw a heap of sand into the wheels of the economy This should, in my judgment    12/16/97 52  substitute for at least part of any monetary policy tightening that otherwise might have been  appropriate This suggests the use of a comparison How much monetary tightening would be  required to yield the same slowing in growth over the next two years as the staff now expects  from the Asian turmoil? Between the September and the December Greenbooks, the forecast for  growth over 1998 was revised downward by almost a full percentage point and over 1999 by 1/2  percentage point The September forecast in this comparison is adjusted to reflect the same  monetary policy assumptions as in December The effect of the Asian turmoil with allowance  for a multiplier effect accounts for most of this revision We can compare this effect with that of  a 100 basis point tightening over 1998 as shown in the December Greenbook This tightening is  estimated to slow growth 03 percentage point over 1998 and 07 percentage point over 1999  The dynamics of the two shocks are quite different Nevertheless, this comparison suggests that  the effects of the Asian turmoil might easily match or exceed the outer end of any monetary  policy tightening we might have contemplated over the next year That is a lot of sand to throw  into the wheels of the economy The dynamics of the response to the Asian crisis are more front  loaded, and that may be even better suited to policy objectives at the moment than a policy  tightening  The next questions are whether the staff may have overestimated the spillover from  the Asian crisis or underestimated the momentum in the economy in the absence of an Asian  shock The reality is that there is a great deal of uncertainty about the dimension of the Asian  turmoil First, the situation has not stabilized in the region Second, it is very difficult to predict  the effect of the crisis on growth in that region And third, the degree of spillover to other  developing economies remains in question    12/16/97  The good news is that we may not have to wait long to grade this forecast The staff  expects the effect of the Asian turmoil on the United States to occur very quickly It may be  hinted at in a downward revision to the forecast for net exports and the less favorable mix  between inventory investment and final sales now projected for the fourth quarter It will be  clear for all to see, according to the staff, in the halving of growth in the first quarter relative to  the fourth quarter Nevertheless, most of the data we are likely to see between now and the next  meeting will be dominated by the monthly data for November and December and the NIPA data  for the fourth quarter These data will more likely, in my judgment, signal momentum rather  than slowdown So, we are likely to have to be patient and wait for the data that will come out  after our next meeting to see more clearly the effects of the Asian turmoil  The degree of the slowdown will, of course, dictate the nature of the challenge  monetary policy will face going forward The staff forecast, now close to where private sector  consensus forecasts have been for some time, presents one vision, a remarkably graceful  version of what I would call a reverse soft landing We begin from an economy already  operating beyond its point of sustainable capacity, with the prospect of a slow progressive updrift  in inflation Growth slows immediately to below trend where it remains over the next two years,  ending 1999 close to NAIRU Inflation is restrained over the interval by a variety of factors; it  rises only modestly, and the cumulative increase is limited by the return toward NAIRU by the  end of the period This scenario allows monetary policy to remain on hold and permits the  economy to move into the year 2000 near full employment and with inflation still low Maybe!  But given the more balanced risks going forward, I certainly cannot rule out that the next move  might be toward ease if the Asian shock turns out to be even greater than is now projected    12/16/97  Let me offer an alternative that I believe is at least as likely as the staff forecast This  is a forecast that already has been presented today by Presidents Moskow, Broaddus, and  Minehan The economy slows only to trend The unemployment rate stabilizes near its current  level, having declined by 1/2 percentage point recently without any response from us, and  inflation begins to edge upward over time This would be a challenge for monetary policy--to  tighten into an economy that already has slowed to trend when the updrift of inflation is still only  a forecast It is a challenge I believe we may still face Certainly, as Presidents McDonough and  Boehne have noted, flexibility should be our key word, both in respect to the outlook and to  demands on monetary policy going forward "
3286,1997-12-16," Thank you, Mr Chairman Given the expected effects and uncertainty  related to the Asian turmoil, I agree that we should hold policy unchanged today Because the  risks are better balanced, I also support a move to a symmetric directive It is, as President  Boehne suggested, likely to be a much better description of our intermeeting posture I believe a  symmetric directive has the advantage of signaling our flexibility to respond quickly to a worse  case scenario, should it materialize, without changing our view that the next move is still likely  to be in a policy tightening direction Thank you "
3338,1998-03-31," Thank you, Mr Chairman I want to focus on three aspects of  continuity in the developments since the last meeting First, there has been continued  exceptional momentum in private domestic demand and payroll employment, only partially  offset by a decline in net exports Second, the strength in domestic demand has continued to be  supported by very favorable financial conditions, including soaring equity prices Third,  favorable supply shocks, reinforced in this case by a sharper-than-expected decline in oil prices,  have continued to restrain inflation  I continue to accord an important role, indeed a central role, to favorable supply  shocks in explaining recent economic performance and assessing an appropriate course for  monetary policy When there is an adverse supply shock, it is well appreciated that the bad news    3/31/98  cannot be escaped, only shared in the near term between higher unemployment and higher  inflation And so it is with a favorable supply shock, only substituting good news for bad news  Policymakers cannot escape the benefits no matter how they might try [Laughter] They can  only influence how the benefits are shared between lower unemployment and lower inflation  There is, of course, much to like in the outcome of low unemployment and low  inflation and in the policy that has supported that outcome, so far at least In particular, it is not  imprudent to operate for a while beyond the point of long-run sustainable capacity as part of the  sharing of the benefits of the supply shock Still, the optimal course of policy in this case  depends on the expected persistence of the shock, although the length of time it persists is  sometimes as much of a surprise as the shock itself At any rate, the longer-than-expected  persistence or renewal of the favorable supply shocks has certainly contributed to the very  favorable outcome and to how brilliant monetary policy appears after the fact The danger in this  policy is the possibility of misperceiving the sustainability of the recent performance and  therefore of failing to appreciate the necessity of a transition at some point to a more sustainable  state Given the transition that must ultimately be made, it might be unwise to move still further  beyond the point of sustainable capacity  The key to the Greenbook forecast is the projected slowdown immediately ahead in  the rate of economic expansion to below trend growth The Greenbook forecast shares this  feature with almost all private sector forecasts This is worrisome because my experience as a  forecaster suggests that forecasters can get it all wrong, but they almost never get it all right At  any rate, I have described this widely shared forecast as tracing out a graceful reverse soft  landing Because the economy slows almost immediately to below trend growth, it moves  gradually from its initial point beyond sustainable capacity toward sustainable capacity just as    3/31/98  the favorable supply shocks that are restraining inflation dissipate The result is an economy that  glides toward full employment with still low inflation as we reach the end of the Greenbook  forecast horizon This is a remarkably favorable outcome, especially since it occurs while we  play spectator  The risks, however, seem weighted from my perspective to stronger growth and hence  higher average utilization rates and, given the projected slowdown, to even sharper increases in  compensation and inflation than in the Greenbook forecast There is still a potential for further  declines in the unemployment rate based on the momentum in demand before the slowdown  takes hold There is also the potential that the crosscurrents so clearly identified in the  Greenbook may work out a little less favorably for price inflation, exert somewhat more pressure  on nominal wage changes, and produce a somewhat sharper reversal in benefit costs The latter  developments, interacting with a slowdown in productivity growth, suggest the potential for a  less benign than projected path of labor costs in coming quarters Looking to 1999, I also am  concerned that there might be a somewhat sharper reversal in the supply shocks than projected  by the staff  Financial conditions in general and monetary policy in particular have played  important roles in supporting recent economic performance Favorable financial conditions have  been supporting aggregate demand, notwithstanding the sharp rise in the real federal funds rate  stemming from the decline in inflation Real long-term rates are steady to declining, equity  prices are soaring, credit availability is ample, underwriting standards may have eased  somewhat, loan pricing is aggressive, and money growth is rapid True, there is good reason to  project a decline in velocity in the first quarter, and there are some special factors that likely have  boosted M2 growth Still, there is a fairly clear signal in the acceleration of money growth that    3/31/98  should not be ignored Financial conditions in general and monetary policy in particular clearly  are not restraining aggregate demand The projected slowdown in M2 growth in the forecast is  only the mirror image of the projected slowdown in nominal income growth, reinforced by a  return to a more stable velocity path This simply indicates that if the Asian slump slows the  economic expansion to the degree projected, the current setting of the funds rate is consistent  with the slowing of nominal income growth and hence money growth Policy does not slow  money growth in the forecast; Asia does  The bottom line is that a slowing in growth is essential to avoid a sharper than  desirable reversal of inflation fortunes in 1999 and beyond The Asian slump may accomplish  this Some patience has been advisable early in 1998 as we wait for evidence on the degree of  momentum in domestic demand and the offset from Asia Patience is a virtue but only to a point  We may be able to remain spectators if economic growth slows and helps to preserve the low  inflation environment But the continued momentum in demand so far this year suggests that a  tighter monetary policy may still be required to slow the expansion and preserve the low  inflation climate "
3339,1998-03-31," Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation for no change in the  federal funds rate and for an asymmetric posture    3/31/98  I have some considerable sympathy with the notion that, rather than just expanding the  policy announcement, we have an immediate release of the directive that would indicate--   The whole directive On the other hand, I think that proposal deserves  a full discussion of the pros and cons before we move forward If we decide to go in that  direction, we might want to do so at a time when the directive would not create a surprise when it  is released There are some relevant issues A change from symmetry to asymmetry sends some  indication of partial tightening or easing to the market, and our willingness to move from  symmetry to asymmetry may be affected by whether or not we are going to announce that move,  depending on what impact it is going to have on the market Another consideration, Mr  Chairman, would be that your signaling to the markets in a speech would allow you to provide  more explanation, and I think that would be desirable at this point also "
3390,1998-05-19," Thank you, Mr Chairman I will be referring to a couple of charts  that I am having passed around2 At the last meeting, many members of this Committee expressed  concern that inflation risks might be increasing in light of the prevailing tightness in labor markets  and the momentum in domestic demand The question we confront today is whether developments  since the last meeting should encourage us to relax that concern or to act on it Of course, a serious  alternative is to remain concerned but on the sidelines, perhaps increasing vigilance instead of rates  I want to focus my remarks on the labor market, inflation data, and on the question of  whether the evidence points to a still higher trend rate of growth in productivity and the prospects  for an imminent slowing to below-trend growth I will have some comments on the monetary  policy implications of the stock market and of Asia during the policy go-around  At the last meeting, many emphasized that it was important that economic growth  slow quickly and significantly given the already tight labor markets I refer to this concern as  growth risk Specifically, it is the concern that above-trend growth would raise utilization rates  further and thereby exacerbate the risks of higher inflation The bottom line is that the tighter labor  2/ Copies of the charts used by Governor Meyer are appended to the transcript (Appendix 2)    5/19/98  market we worried about last time has already arrived Utilization rates rather than growth per se  drive inflation pressures A slowing of growth to trend at this point would only stabilize utilization  rates at their elevated levels  It is true that a decline of 04 percentage point in the unemployment rate in one month  makes no sense in terms of underlying fundamentals But neither did a constant unemployment  rate over the previous five months during which growth was so robust I, like the staff, would  assume an upturn immediately ahead to an unemployment rate of about 4-1/2 percent Growth  turned out to be 2 percentage points faster in the first quarter than expected at the last meeting, the  unemployment rate is well below where we expected it to be, and the staff forecast for the second  quarter was revised upward The bottom line is that if we were worried about the tight labor  markets at the last meeting, we should be more worried today I am  What about the prospect of an imminent slowing in growth going forward, perhaps to  below trend in the second half as in the staff forecast? It seems to me that the economy has  somewhat of a knife edge quality with respect to the pace of the expansion On the one hand, the  fundamentals continue to look very positive There is impressive momentum in domestic demand;  financial conditions appear to be very supportive; and interest-sensitive sectors of the economy  continue to prosper It is not hard to imagine that we could have continued above-trend growth  ahead  Still, three factors are likely to weigh on the expansion going forward First,  assuming that the latest staff estimate of a $103 billion increase in inventory accumulation in the  first quarter is on the mark and is not revised down going forward, the rate of inventory investment  in the first quarter is almost certainly unsustainable Indeed, the two most impressive numbers  related to this forecast are 43 and 103 The 43 percent unemployment rate in April highlights how    5/19/98  tight labor markets are, and the $103 billion rate estimated for first-quarter inventory investment is  a triple-digit weight hanging over the expansion going forward At any rate, while there do not  appear to be stock imbalances, there likely will be if the flow rate of accumulation does not slow  immediately A lower rate of inventory investment, a flow correction, should lead as opposed to  follow a slowdown in economic growth  Second, the external drag from a combination of the emerging Asian economies,  Japan, and the long cumulative appreciation of the dollar should continue, although at a diminished  rate after the first quarter  Third, the positive impulse from the stock market should at least diminish, partly in  response to a slowing in the expansion and hence in the growth of earnings This is in line with the  staff forecast and would contribute to a slower growth of the economy in 1999 after the effects  from reduced inventory investment and external drag had mostly run their course Particularly  because of the interaction of inventory correction and external drag and perhaps with some help  from the stock market, there is the potential for a significant slowing immediately ahead Still,  there is some question about how much longer one should wait for this slowdown especially in  light of the fact that growth has consistently outperformed expectations over the last two years and  in light of the very tight and indeed now tighter labor markets  At the last meeting, members of this Committee expressed the following concern  about wage pressures in the context of tight labor markets Here is a quote from the minutes ""but  additional improvements in productivity growth could not be counted on to offset further increases  in the rate of growth of labor compensation, which were more likely to occur if labor markets were  to tighten further"" The staff, however, does plan on higher productivity growth to offset the  effects of tighter labor markets, at least for a while This is very much central to their forecast    5/19/98  The staff's decision to raise productivity growth reflected their assessment of two new  pieces of data the adjusted productivity series, reflecting a correction of the data on hours--the  length of the pay period--and the report on multifactor productivity that indicated faster growth in  capital services in 1996 I followed with a lag and some discount factor the staff's earlier upward  revision in their estimate of trend productivity growth Perhaps I will ultimately follow this  revision as well but not now; I have some reservations My lower estimate and the staff's higher  estimate work about equally well in explaining the recent decline in unemployment via Okun's  Law The adjusted productivity series provides a hint of a sharper break in the trend rate of  productivity growth in mid-1995 but it is only a hint in my judgment and not definitive enough for  my taste to justify an upward revision in my estimate of the trend Indeed, assuming a constant  trend from 1990 onward, the staff's productivity equation yields an estimate of just 11 percent for  the trend rate of productivity There is in this case no difference in the estimated trend whether  published or adjusted productivity data are used This trend is also identical to the trend estimated  over the earlier 1974 to 1990 period While the staff's analysis is suggestive and it definitely got  my attention, it appears to me that the recent robust productivity growth can be explained by a  combination of a more modest increase in productivity and a normal cyclical rebound  What about the inflation and the wage data? Should developments since the last  meeting make us less concerned about the potential for an acceleration in wages? Let me focus  first on the recent data on core CPI The staff projected a 22 percent rate of increase for this  measure over 1998 and over 1999, the same as over 1997 On a consistent methodological basis,  however, this translates into an increase from 22 percent over 1997 to 24 percent over 1998 and  27 percent over 1999 The first question about inflation is whether the trend in core CPI is stable  or declining or already rebounding The 12-month increase is now 21 percent, a tenth below 1997    5/19/98  This perhaps suggests an underlying rate of inflation that is still stable to declining But as  indicated in the charts I have passed around, the annualized inflation rates over three-month and  six-month intervals exhibit quite a pronounced upward trend The three-month rate is now 28  percent and the six-month rate is 25 percent This leads me to suspect that the underlying inflation  rate may already be higher going forward than the staff suggests and it may also be rising faster  than they project  Let me admit that I have taken a very different approach in interpreting the CPI data  than I did with the productivity data I weighed more heavily the lower frequency data on  productivity, down-playing some signs in the higher frequency data that there might have been a  recent break in trend On the core CPI on the other hand, I emphasized the higher frequency data in  an effort to identify a change in the trend quickly I admit that I was looking for faster inflation and  I found it I was not looking for higher productivity growth, and I did not find it But this is where  my intuition has taken me  The wage and compensation data, including ECI, compensation per hour, and average  hourly earnings, point to some upward drift in wage and compensation rates But as shown on the  second page, the acceleration is much more evident in the 12-month rates than in some of the  higher frequency data Especially in the case of ECI, the latest quarterly reading is more benign  than what is suggested by the 12-month changes Putting it all together, on balance it seems to me  that the risk of higher inflation has escalated a bit further since the last meeting "
3391,1998-05-19," Thank you, Mr Chairman Labor markets are very tight, and a  significant part of the recent inflation performance owes to the temporary effects of favorable  supply shocks Inflation will almost certainly be on a rising trend going forward, but the published  rise will be partially offset by the effect of technical revisions Let me say a few words about the  stock market and then Asia and how they fit into the monetary policy calculus  For the stock market, I suggest two rules Rule number one is that, in general,  monetary policy should focus on our broad macro policy objectives, namely price stability and full  employment The stock market in this case has only an indirect influence on monetary policy  through its effect on aggregate demand, with no more influence than a host of other factors If the  FOMC is disciplined about its monetary policy and thereby contributes effectively toward its broad  macro objectives, the stock market in my view is likely to converge back to fundamental values and  to do so in a reasonably graceful and not very disruptive way should it drift away for awhile  Rule number two addresses the case when there is evidence of a bubble economy in  which asset values are more seriously stretched in both financial and real asset markets, as was  apparently the case in Japan in the late 1980s Failure to control such widespread over-valuations  can risk serious disruptions to the real economy down the road Rule number two suggests the use  of monetary policy to resist such wider and more dramatic asset market overvaluations The art of    5/19/98  good policy is knowing when to switch from rule one to rule two [Laughter] I do not think that  time has come yet Nevertheless, when there is an increased risk that equities are significantly  overvalued, it would be prudent for monetary policymakers to reassess how disciplined their policy  really is and perhaps to err on the side of restraint when there is a close call  What about Asia? Specifically, should the FOMC weigh the global effects of US  monetary policy? Applying my belief in rule number one for stocks, a globally friendly US  monetary policy is one that insures the United States is an anchor for strong global performance  This is generally achieved by promoting price stability and maximum sustainable growth and full  employment at home Like rule number two, there may be exceptions and the acute stage of the  Asian crisis toward the end of last year might have been one The recent sense of increased  fragility in the region and perhaps a greater sense of vulnerability of the Japanese economy at least  raises some question about whether today we are still or again in such a situation Another close  call  The bottom line is that this is a close call for policy I believe that monetary policy  needs to edge toward a tighter stance and soon unless either inflation moves still lower or growth  slows to below trend The staff forecast suggests that growth may slow to trend this quarter and to  below trend in the second half That would reduce the risk of rising inflation going forward But  such a slowdown is far from assured, and even in the staff forecast, inflation drifts upward Asia  encourages some patience  On balance I think I would support a tightening today if the consensus were there I  will use my energy today and in the days to come to try to move the consensus in this direction  unless, of course, the data going forward or further analysis of the data change my view of the  appropriate policy But today I will accept your recommendation, Mr Chairman    5/19/98 "
3439,1998-08-18," Thank you, Mr Chairman I expect both slower growth and higher  inflation over the next year and a half However, I expect faster growth than in the Greenbook  forecast, with the rate of expansion in GDP closer to trend and a slower rate of increase in  potential output These two factors combine to yield a lower path for the unemployment rate than  is indicated in the Greenbook In part because of this, I am skeptical that the recent pattern of a  rising rate of increase in nominal compensation will reverse next year, an outcome central to the  Greenbook inflation forecast  The story underpinning the forecast of a persistent slowdown in growth to below trend  begins with a sharper external drag associated with the turmoil in Asia The resulting decline in  net exports is projected to slow GDP growth The multiplier-accelerator effects of the slower  GDP growth then moderate domestic demand, reinforcing the slowdown in GDP growth If for  good measure we add a stock market correction that is sharper than might otherwise occur in a  period of slowing expansion to reflect some initial overvaluations, we get a slowdown in GDP  growth that carries into 1999 even though the external drag is fading It is a good story I have  told it more than a few times myself I think it is the story in the Greenbook, with the important  substitution of a realized for a projected stock market correction  What is wrong with this picture? Well, it does not seem to fit the facts of the first half  of this year very well The story in the first half was not that of a significant slowdown in GDP  growth The economy grew at a 3-1/2 percent rate in the first half despite a subtraction of 2-1/2  percentage points stemming from the decline in net exports This GDP growth rate is only 1/4  percentage point slower than over 1997, and it is fully accounted for by the GM strike True,  growth was unbalanced in the first half in terms of the pattern of growth in the first and second    8/18/98  quarters, but this difference was almost entirely associated with the pattern of inventory  investment  The real story in the first half was that a stronger-than-expected advance in private  demand was offset by a sharper-than-expected decline in net exports, leaving GDP growth about  unchanged That outcome suggests at least a couple of questions First, why did private domestic  demand accelerate? Second, why should private domestic demand now weaken so sharply as in  the staff forecast when there are no multiplier-accelerator effects to speak of stemming from  slower growth in the first half? One piece, but only a piece, of the puzzle of the further  strengthening in private demand may be the same Asian turmoil that was reflected in the  sharper-than-anticipated decline in net exports That turmoil resulted in at least $3 of the per  barrel decline in oil prices and was accompanied by a shift in portfolio preferences in favor of  dollar-denominated assets that contributed to lower intermediate- and long-term interest rates in  the United States  But the key question in the forecast is, what will now induce a slower rate of economic  growth in the second half and into 1999? It is not the external drag The decline in net exports in  the second half is about half as sharp as in the first half, and the decline then halves again next  year Therefore, in order for GDP growth to moderate going forward, the slowing in domestic  demand must be aggressive enough to more than offset the diminishing external drag The  bottom line is that we need a story other than just external drag to explain the slowdown in GDP  growth going forward  Part of the story is clearly the stock market decline, but this is not enough The  FRB/US model forecast identifies a second key underpinning of the slowdown scenario, and one  that, I expect, is also a factor in the judgmental forecast I call it the ""X"" factor in that it slows    8/18/98  growth through gravity It reminds me of my defense of a forecast of a sharp decline in long-term  rates in 1993 When I was asked why long-term rates were headed lower, I responded that it was  because they were too high The FRB/US forecast talks of error correction rather than force of  gravity, but it's the same story Many private-spending components have expanded at a rate  above what that model and most other models predicted This was true by the way during 1997  but perhaps even more so during the first half of 1998 Now, these spending components are  projected to return to fundamentals, hence the economy slows There is nothing wrong with this  story, but it is not an overwhelmingly compelling one, especially in terms of the timing of the  slowdown As a result, I have some doubts about the degree of the slowdown in the staff forecast  The second major call in the staff forecast is for a reversal in the recent trend toward  faster increases in nominal compensation This is partly due to a rising unemployment rate and  partly to the pass-through of lower inflation expectations The case was quite carefully argued in  the Greenbook in terms of a range of forecasts from different wage-price models Again, such an  outcome is possible, but I remain skeptical  Given the uncertainty about the structure of the economy and the forecast going  forward, it is likely that collectively we will become more reactive in terms of policy response  This makes reading the inflation data for signs of a change in the underlying trend more  important But this also has become more difficult I have noted before, for example, that the  core CPI data hinted at a rebound in the underlying inflation rate based on three-month and  six-month inflation rates However, taking account of the last two months of CPI data, the  three-month inflation rate of core CPI has receded from above 2-1/2 percent to about 2 percent, very  much in line with the staff forecast for the second half of the year    8/18/98  The data for the chain measure of GDP prices show, in contrast, a remarkable slowing  in the rate of inflation The four-quarter rate of inflation for this measure has declined steadily  from 2 percent in the second quarter of last year to 1 percent in the second quarter of this year  The slowing in the quarterly inflation rates occurred quite abruptly in the third quarter last year  Inflation by this measure has now been near 1 percent for four consecutive quarters The  widening gap and different trends in the alternative measures of inflation are making our job of  reading inflation signals more challenging, but on balance they are showing few signs of building  inflation pressure  The last topic I want to comment on is the risk to the forecast Given the tightness in  the labor markets, the lack of compelling evidence of a persistent slowdown even to trend growth,  and the likelihood of some diminution in the favorable supply shocks, there remains a risk of  higher inflation going forward The other major risk is that of a still worse outcome from the  Asian turmoil The forecast embodies a sensible central tendency for this external effect It still  appears to me, however, that the possibilities relative to the central tendency are asymmetrical I  see more chance of a much worse outcome than a much more favorable one For this reason, I  believe the risks to the forecast have become more balanced than I viewed them earlier Thank  you "
3440,1998-08-18," Thank you, Mr Chairman First, I strongly support your  recommendation for no change in policy at this meeting, but I want to focus my attention on the    8/18/98  issue of symmetry versus asymmetry In my view, the very tight labor markets impose a natural  asymmetry to policy in relation to growth prospects Specifically, a forecast of persistent  above-trend growth would, I believe, justify a tighter policy, but a forecast of modestly  below-trend growth would not immediately dictate an easier policy Instead, such a development  would help to unwind the very tight labor markets and contribute to a soft landing with maximum  sustainable growth and full employment This, I believe, is the foundation for the asymmetric  bias toward tighter policy that we have maintained since the March meeting I still believe that  very tight labor markets and likely growth near or above trend will ultimately dictate that the next  move for the funds rate will be up rather than down This balance of risks is best conveyed by the  current tilt in policy  But there is a second asymmetry in the outlook today This asymmetry relates to  probable outcomes versus central tendency forecasts for Japan and emerging economies in Asia  and elsewhere Relative to such a baseline forecast, there is in my view a considerably greater  risk of a much worse outcome in those economies than there is of a much more benign result I  see this downside risk of a worse case outcome in Asia, should it materialize, as likely to spread to  other emerging market economies and constituting the most serious threat to the US and the  global economies Such a worse case outcome does not have the highest probability, but it is the  most worrisome possibility that we face today On balance, therefore, I think a symmetric posture  is the best choice for now "
3499,1998-09-29," I continue to favor immediate announcement of the tilt I thought Tom  Hoenig and Jack Guynn presented the arguments extremely well, and I believe Tom improved  the draft language a little I recognize that there is some danger that an immediate announcement  could reduce the use of the tilt However, if we are disciplined, we can avoid that and honestly  communicate to the public exactly how we assess the risks going forward That is what the tilt  does Releasing the minutes more quickly would be a further constructive step toward  incremental transparency, and I think doing that would be a good idea   As we get under way with our F-6 study of systemic risk, I think this is  an important episode for us to study We are trying to decide what is systemic risk and what is  not--where we can draw the line I think we need some further analysis of this episode to help us  decide whether this was an appropriate involvement of the Federal Reserve There will always  be a matter of judgment involved, but this certainly was a close call We need to think about  that Secondly, we have the supervisory issue I think we are going to be called on to explain  whether or not our examinations and other sources of information provided us with what we  needed to know  There also is an issue that I would be remiss not to at least mention, namely that of  overseeing how these lending and investment decisions get made Rather well along in this  process, I was getting telephone calls from reporters who knew more about LTCM than I did I  don't think that was the way it should have been   Our committee will certainly be engaging in a broader dialogue with  all of you as we think about this "
3500,1998-09-29," Thank you, Mr Chairman What has changed between the last  meeting and today that could justify an easing? That clearly is the question of the day The  answer is not the initial conditions, in terms of very tight labor markets, nor the near-term pace  of the expansion Second-half GDP growth still looks to be close to trend, at least to my estimate  of trend That is, of course, a significant slowdown relative to the rate of growth in the first half,  but it is in line with earlier expectations and it will leave labor markets still very tight at the end  of this year Nor do I see anything in the most recent data relating to the strength of the  expansion to justify a change in policy The forecast? Well, that's a different story and that is  my point Any policy action today must be based squarely on and be defended in terms of the  forecast for 1999, specifically on the change in that forecast justified by recent developments  The staff did an excellent job of identifying and quantifying the effects of three recent  developments  The first is the downward revision to foreign growth due importantly to a downward  revision in growth prospects for Latin America The second is the sharper-than-anticipated  decline in equity prices that suggests a downward revision to consumer spending and quite likely  to business fixed investment and residential construction as well The third is a widening of risk  spreads and a generally reduced appetite for risk that might well have an incrementally adverse  effect on spending Taking the direct impacts of the first two, adding a smidgen for the difficult  to quantify latter factor, and then applying an appropriate multiplier gets me to something in the  range of a 3/4 percentage point downward revision to my growth forecast for 1999, albeit from a  somewhat higher initial forecast than that in the last Greenbook  The change in the forecast can perhaps best be understood by differentiating what I  call phase two of the global turmoil from phase one I date phase two from the Russian    9/29/98  moratorium and devaluation and the increased pressure on Latin American economies that  immediately followed Interestingly, phase two does not appear to have an especially adverse  effect in terms of its incremental effect on net exports, certainly when compared to the effect of  the crises among developing Asian economies and the deterioration of the Japanese economy  during phase one However, whereas phase one was accompanied by offsetting positive shocks  in the form of lower US interest rates stemming from safe-haven capital flows and lower oil  prices, phase two in contrast is accompanied by the reinforcing adverse effects of a decline in  equity prices and an increase in risk spreads as well as by a coincidental increase in oil prices due  to supply cutbacks A second likely difference is that whereas phase one was accompanied by an  unexpected and largely unexplained surge in private domestic demand, phase two will likely be  accompanied by a spontaneous unwinding of that exceptional strength  I have emphasized previously the distinction between central tendencies and  asymmetric risks in the current forecast, and I believe this aspect of the outlook is also relevant  to the policy decision I have to admit that when I hear someone say that the risks in their  forecast are asymmetric, my first inclination is to encourage them to rethink that forecast and  return when they have managed to produce one where the risks are symmetric I believe our  staff has followed this philosophy more than most forecasters They assume, for example, a  break in Brazil's exchange rate regime and a fairly sharp adjustment in growth in Latin America,  and they have a further decline in the stock market on top of the recent correction Nevertheless,  when there are potentially important one-sided discontinuities in the outlook, as I believe there  are today, risks can legitimately be asymmetric As a result, there could be an important  difference between the modal forecast--the best guess and the most likely outcome--and the  mean of the probability distribution of outcomes Both are relevant to the policy decision    9/29/98  On balance because my previous forecast for 1999 was not as pessimistic as that in the  August Greenbook, I end up with a somewhat higher growth forecast for 1999, even allowing for  a similar downward revision to growth But I do expect growth to be decidedly below trend next  year Given my expectation of somewhat faster growth than in the Greenbook and therefore a  slightly lower path for the unemployment rate, I anticipate a bit higher inflation than is projected  in the Greenbook However, I agree the weaker growth now in prospect and the projected rising  path of the unemployment rate should restrain inflation going forward The policy question, of  course, is whether the projected slowdown crosses the line from benign to undesirable I will  save that assessment for my policy statement "
3501,1998-09-29," Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation of a 25 basis point cut  in the target federal funds rate As I noted earlier, an easing has to be justified as a preemptive  response to a significant change in the forecast In regard to that forecast, we have changes that  involve some combination of a lower central tendency for growth next year and wider downside  risks The question we face in reaching this decision is the location of the threshold where such  a projected slowdown crosses the line from being benign to becoming unacceptable There is no  question in my mind that a slowdown of the dimension projected by the staff meets that test It is    9/29/98  a closer call from the standpoint of my less pessimistic forecast, but taking into account my sense  of asymmetric downside risks, I believe an easing is clearly justified today An easing can be  viewed as either a step toward filling an expected hole in growth in 1999 and/or providing  insurance against a bad draw from the unpleasantly fat tail of the probability distribution of  outcomes An easing also can be justified in terms of the minimax framework I previously  suggested in relation to our March 1997 tightening We should look at each of our options, in  this case no change or an easing, and ask what would be the worst possible outcome under each  option Then, we should select the option that yields the least-worst outcome As I balance these  risks today, I am convinced that the greater danger comes from an unacceptably sharp decline in  growth and that an easing is therefore justified  The next question is the size of the move It is useful to make a provisional judgment  about the path of the funds rate in relation to the forecast The path of the funds rate should be  set so as to partially offset the projected slowing in growth in 1999 The objective is to leave  growth below trend next year so as to reverse in part the prevailing tightness of the labor market  and also to avoid overshooting in the year 2000 as foreign growth begins to recover The  magnitude and timing of the rate cuts in the Greenbook look about right based on the above  considerations relative to the Greenbook forecast Since my forecast is less pessimistic, I would  not want to move more aggressively than the funds rate path assumed in the Greenbook I also  agree with your recommendation of an asymmetric posture toward further easing In my view,  such a posture better reflects where we are, assuming that we implement a 25 basis point move  today I would favor that posture whether or not we were to announce it today "
3565,1998-11-17," I want to join what seems to be the emerging consensus I, too, prefer  Option 2, and I would eliminate the sentence in question I don't think it adds anything, and  whatever is briefer and more to the point is better I also would echo the view that it would be  desirable for us to move at some point to the immediate release of this language after our  meetings Thank you   I think that President Poole is bringing up an extraordinarily good  point It is almost an embarrassment to use over and over a standard sentence that incorporates  an expectation that can only sometimes be right If we want to include this reference in the  directive, we should adjust it to reflect changes in the money growth forecast   As I listened to the discussion on TIPS and SOMA, I was struggling  with it for a while When I heard the Chairman's remarks, they seemed to summarize my views  just perfectly [laughter] because I wasn't quite sure where I would be Then when I heard  Governor Gramlich, I thought he really put it together very, very well [Laughter] On balance, I  think that it makes sense to treat them like other securities and to allow operations in TIPS as  well as other securities "
3566,1998-11-17," Thank you, Mr Chairman Let me start off by focusing on what I  think has changed and what has remained the same in the outlook since the last meeting and  particularly since the intermeeting move First, the second half looks stronger, with growth at or  above trend This reflects both the surprise in third-quarter GDP and the general resilience in the  spending data Second, I think the forecast going forward has been bolstered by depreciation of  the dollar and particularly since our intermeeting move by the resurgence in equity prices and  some relaxation in financial stress Third, the announcement of the Brazil package and some  other developments in the international realm have added at least a bit of optimism that the worse  case scenario for global turmoil might be avoided    11/17/98  What has remained the same? I think the general answer is the qualitative forecast  going forward It still appears that growth will be clearly below trend next year, though some  modest upward revision along the lines of the Greenbook forecast appears justified It still  appears that inflation will remain well contained And it still appears that downside risks  predominate though perhaps less so than before I think the main difference is that there is  renewed appreciation of some upside risk going forward  Why so little change in the forecast? First, I think the upward revision to the third  quarter was concentrated so heavily in inventory investment that it is more likely to be reversed  than extrapolated going forward Second, the rebound in equity prices appears to be  incompatible with a forecast of slowing growth and declining profits, and therefore it also is  likely to be reversed going forward Third, while the depreciation of the dollar is certainly a  positive, its effect is offset by some further slowdown in foreign growth, as in the Greenbook  forecast Finally, while the financial stress has been partially unwound, financial conditions, at  least outside of equity markets, have nevertheless significantly deteriorated since July  Here is how I would characterize the broad qualitative features of the outlook First,  private domestic demand appears to have decelerated to about a 4 percent growth rate in the  second half from the 8 percent rate in the first half, returning to its average rate over the previous  two years This is very consistent with the gravity story that I told earlier A further slowing in  private domestic demand, as in the Greenbook forecast, toward roughly a trend rate over 1999  looks plausible This partly reflects a diminished stimulus from the wealth effect, assuming  equity prices do not rise further, and it reflects, in addition, the effect of the recent deterioration  in financial conditions along with the projected further correction in equity prices This spreads  the effects of global turmoil from the external to the domestic sector Given the slowdown in    11/17/98  private domestic demand, even the slower rate of decline in net exports over 1999 is enough to  push overall growth below trend The slowdown is reinforced over the next couple of quarters  by a reduction in inventory investment from its unsustainable third-quarter pace I think it is also  reasonable to anticipate that growth will rebound to about trend in the year 2000  I would put my best guess of growth next year just a shade higher than in the  Greenbook forecast, but I would also take into account the still asymmetric downside risk that I  see to that baseline in setting monetary policy I'm a little less optimistic about the course of  nominal wage change and a bit more concerned about the size and inflationary effect of the  depreciation of the dollar than is the Greenbook, but I still believe inflation will be well  contained  I think what we do at this meeting is a close call But were we to move one more  time, which I would support, it would seem to me that that would bring to a conclusion the  cumulative adjustment in monetary policy that seems appropriate in light of the discrete change  in the outlook that has occurred We should find some way to perhaps signal that as well Thank  you "
3567,1998-11-17," Thank you, Mr Chairman It seems to me that we have been playing  catch-up to a discrete change in the outlook The question today is whether we have caught up,  and if not, whether we should complete the likely further move sooner rather than later It is  clear from the discussion around the table today that it is a close call On balance, my judgment  is that another quarter point move would complete what I think would be an appropriate  adjustment to the discrete change in the outlook Because the slowdown is projected to be  around the corner, a case can be made that the additional easing should be sooner rather than  later These considerations lead me to support your recommendation, Mr Chairman, to cut the  funds rate a quarter point today and return to a symmetric directive The move to a symmetric  directive signals the pause that I believe is in order after the move and highlights the possibility  that the move may have completed an appropriate response to the change in the outlook "
3627,1998-12-22," Mr Chairman, your proposal is a compromise that I can heartily  endorse Indeed, I think I would argue that it is better than either the status quo or at this point  going to the immediate release of the operating paragraph As you know, I have been an  advocate of the immediate release of the operating paragraph in general and the decision on the  tilt in particular But I also agree with you that a change like this should not be made unless  there is a stronger consensus than now exists  It seems to me that what your proposal does is that it respects the views of the majority  by affording an opportunity to make announcements about symmetry on those occasions when it  would be most constructive In that regard, this approach goes a long way toward fulfilling the    12/22/98 82  objectives that I have But it also respects the views of the minority by not making a formal  change in the operational procedures that cannot be easily reversed  And, as you also indicated, there is a chance to experiment Let's see what happens  Let's see how useful in practice these announcements are, and let's also get a feel for the degree  to which they affect the dynamics of our decisionmaking and consensus-building The  discussions we have had around this table over the last couple of meetings have given me a  better appreciation of the potential costs as well as the likely benefits of an immediate release  Given the uncertainty about this balance, I think your compromise is a perfect solution "
3628,1998-12-22," Thank you, Mr Chairman Like most forecasters, I responded to the  downward revision in foreign growth prospects and the abrupt deterioration in domestic financial  conditions after midyear by revising down my expectations for US growth over 1999 Unlike  most forecasters, I was in the position to ratify my earlier forecast by participating in monetary  policy decisions to lower the funds rate by 75 basis points I appreciate being in this unique  position [Laughter]  But monetary policy actions have not been the only developments that have supported  an upward revision to expectations for growth next year Three other developments are of note  First, the stronger-than-anticipated growth in the second half, maintaining the continuous pattern  of positive demand surprises over the past three years, is evidence of continued resilience in  demand and suggests greater momentum going forward and upside risks to the forecast for next  year Second, the external drag from declining net exports appears to be diminishing faster than  expected After subtracting more than 2 percentage points from growth in the first half, net  exports appear to be subtracting only 1/2 percentage point in the second half Third, the  deterioration of financial conditions that seemed so worrisome a short time ago now appears less  so The equity market correction has simply disappeared While private risk spreads have  widened in the capital markets, the absolute level of private borrowing costs, weighted across    12/22/98 51  risk classes, is about what it was at the end of last year and only modestly above lows for the  year reached at about midyear  On balance, financial conditions, thanks in part to recent monetary policy actions,  continue to be supportive of growth going forward There are nevertheless plausible grounds for  projecting a slowing of growth The rationale for the slowdown is well presented in the  Greenbook, though it should be admitted that virtually all the arguments, including the  dissipation of the positive stimulus from the wealth effect, the dissipation of accelerator effects,  etc, were considerations that underpinned the projected slowdown for 1998  On balance, I expect growth to slow to about 2-1/4 percent in 1999 and I see a somewhat  better balance now in upside and downside risks I think the upside risks principally reflect the  experience of continued positive demand shocks that after some point make me wonder what we  might be missing about the fundamentals driving this expansion The downside risks have been  well discussed around this table They relate principally to Brazil, to questions about the  sustainability of current equity prices, and to other pressure spots in the world economy  Let me note two upside risks relative to the staff's inflation forecast As I have noted  at recent meetings, I find the Greenbook forecast of a slowing in nominal wage growth  somewhat aggressive The risk here can perhaps be seen by comparing the forecasts for nominal  wage change based on wage-price and wage-wage versions of the Phillips curve, two  specifications that are routinely tracked by the staff The forecasts for the wage-price  specification point to a slowing of nominal wage changes going forward--and perhaps a  significant slowing--as the response to the recent decline in inflation and the projected modest  rise in the unemployment rate dominate the effect of the prevailing low level of the  unemployment rate Some of the wage-price specifications indicate a slowing of as much as a    12/22/98 52  percentage point in the rate of nominal wage gains in 1999 On the other hand, the forecasts  from the wage-wage specifications suggest a sizable increase in the pace of nominal wage gains  going forward Both of these specifications have yielded similar errors over the past four years,  and they are now generating forecasts that differ by as much as 1-1/2 percentage points over 1999  I think this highlights the considerable uncertainty about inflation going forward  Second, the Greenbook allows for some diminution in the favorable factors that have  been suppressing inflation a reversal of declines in oil prices; some further depreciation of the  dollar; a reversal of the recent decline in non-oil commodity prices; and a faster pace of increase  in health care and health benefit costs The dissipation of the contribution from these special  factors is the basis for the convergence of actual to core inflation in the Greenbook forecast But  I am concerned that the projected rebounds in these components could result in somewhat higher  inflation than in the staff forecast and that in addition there is a particular upside risk from a  sharper-than-projected depreciation of the dollar Thank you "
3629,1998-12-22," Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation for no change in the  funds rate target and to retain the symmetric posture for the policy directive I believe it is  sometimes useful to think about monetary policy in terms of the desired path for the growth of  output instead of the desired path for the funds rate The path of output for 1999 projected in the  Greenbook seems about ideal to me It shows a slowdown to below-trend growth, which I think  is very important, and some unwinding of the exceptional tightness now in labor markets but  leaving plenty of room, given the potential downside discontinuities in the forecast This means  that no policy action is warranted today and none would be warranted when and if the economy  slows to the projected path Looking beyond that, if we do not get a realization of those    12/22/98 68  downward discontinuities, I am struck by how brief the period of below-trend growth is in the  forecast and how modest the shortfall is relative to potential growth To me that means, after we  get a better sense that we have avoided these downward discontinuities, that we are going to  have to be very vigilant against potential upside risks to inflation going forward   I would delete the sentence in question in option 2, thereby going with  option 3 I would actually prefer to leave in the phrase ""in coming months"" in option 3 It goes  to the question of what we mean by symmetry and asymmetry Does it refer to the intermeeting  period or is it a statement about the balance of risks that we see that might influence when the  next move might occur over some reasonable forecast horizon? I like the broader context I  think that is what symmetry or asymmetry means Most importantly, it is not positioning  ourselves for either the intermeeting period or the next move but to provide some broader  concept of how we see the balance of risks  With respect to the last sentence, I would prefer to delete it because I don't think it has  to do specifically with the directive itself It could go elsewhere in any discussion of the  underlying forecast, but I don't think it belongs here   The decision is so clear from that discussion! "
3678,1999-03-30," Thank you, Mr Chairman The staff’s revised forecast   features once again an upward revision to growth and a downward revision to inflation   and hence a more favorable outcome for 1999 than was projected in the last Greenbook   Nevertheless, the staff forecast raises an important question for monetary policy going   forward How will the economy make a successful transition to sustainable growth and   labor market equilibrium without an unacceptable increase in inflation?  The forces that   threaten to raise inflation over the forecast horizon are the prospect of a dissipation of   favorable supply shocks and the expected persistence of very tight labor markets Of   course, the staff forecast may be wrong and inflation may continue to decline For my   part, I admit that to date I have not been able to retire from my discussions of economic   performance the phrase “stronger-than-expected growth and lower-than-expected   inflation” Nevertheless, if one accepts the staff forecast, and I do, then it seems to me   they have asked the right policy question and left it to us to answer it   The key to the outlook in the context of monetary policy, therefore, is not the   blissful state projected for 1999 but the pattern of rising inflation, especially in 2000, and   the prospect of further increases thereafter based on the continued labor market tightness     3/30/99 37   at the end of the forecast horizon The key policy question, therefore, is whether and   when to adjust policy to improve the prospects of a better outcome in 2000 and beyond   It is hard to make such a policy adjustment appear urgent today and, indeed, it is not But   I hope we can focus attention today less on the decision about what the target funds rate   should be during the period from March 30 to May 18, 1999, and more on whether and   when an adjustment in policy might be appropriate in light of the forecast through 2000   I would also note that if a tighter policy appears justified, it might be better to move in   that direction sooner, while the economy is still growing above trend, than later when   growth may already have slowed spontaneously to below trend I accept in broad outline   and in most details the staff forecast for growth over the forecast horizon, assuming   unchanged policy The key developments recently have been stronger-than-expected   momentum in domestic demand in the first quarter, partially offset by sharper-than-  expected declines in net exports and more-moderate-than-expected inventory building   But the upward revision to GDP growth and the more favorable mix of GDP projected   for the first quarter provide two reasons to expect stronger second-quarter growth relative   to the last forecast stronger momentum in demand and a positive contribution from   inventory building   My main quibble with the staff forecast relates to the further upward revision   to their estimate of trend productivity growth That revision, though small, lowers the   staff inflation forecast by perhaps as much as ¼ percentage point by the end of 2000 As   a result, I am a little more pessimistic than the staff about the inflation outlook in 2000   and beyond But the key to the inflation forecast is that the initial conditions--the very   tight labor markets--would make it very difficult to avoid a significant increase in   inflation without an adjustment to policy, even if the economy were to slow to trend   immediately   To put into perspective the implications of the initial conditions in the staff   forecast, let me pose the following question How well will we take advantage of the   extraordinary disinflationary forces during this expansion, given the staff forecast or my   slightly more pessimistic scenario, in order to lower the underlying inflation trend going     3/30/99 38   forward? Another way of asking this question is To what degree will the current   episode be an example of opportunistic disinflation?  Inflation measured by the core CPI   was 31 percent over 1995 before the coincidence of favorable inflation developments   impacted the economy How much will we lower inflation over the expansion from this   point with the help of the extraordinary disinflationary forces that are so clearly   important?   Let’s take the staff forecast first To put inflation on a methodologically   consistent basis, I add 06 percentage point to their estimate of 25 percent for the core   inflation rate over the year 2000 So the staff’s forecast says that we have not lowered   the underlying inflation rate at all We get the same conclusion if we use the GDP chain   measure of inflation Of course, inflation is rising at the end of the forecast period, so we   can infer that before this expansion is over inflation actually will have increased despite   the extraordinary disinflationary forces at work   In my forecast, the latter outcome is more evident and emerges earlier What   is driving this outcome?  Blessed with a combination of positive supply shocks and   supply-enhancing structural changes, monetary policy is the critical factor shaping how   the benefits of these developments are shared between higher output and lower inflation   during the expansion and, therefore, how they will affect the underlying trend of inflation   beyond this expansion To date their benefits have been split between higher output and   lower inflation However, in the process--in the staff’s judgment and mine as well--we   have allowed the economy to move beyond its sustainable capacity The low overall CPI   inflation during the period of supply shocks will be partly reversed as the supply shocks   dissipate That is an important part of the inflation story this year And the benefits of a   possible upward shift in the productivity trend itself are transitory, unless taken   advantage of by monetary policy   To be sure, recent economic developments have been exceptional It has been   a wonderful ride, and we have all enjoyed it But we will ultimately be graded--and   indeed we will grade ourselves--on the effect of current policy on the inflation trend in   coming years Might we not achieve a higher grade on the final exam by accepting a less     3/30/99 39   exceptional growth performance in the near term?  That is the question we have to   answer in coming months  "
3679,1999-03-30," Thank you, Mr Chairman I can support your recommendation   for no change in the federal funds rate target today In my view, however, monetary   policy should be biased toward tightening going forward Let me explain why and then   confront the issue of whether or not a move to an asymmetric bias should be made and   announced at this meeting   I think there are three important considerations that relate to possible   adjustments in monetary policy in the period ahead First, there is the reassessment issue,   which the Chairman articulated very clearly in his Humphrey-Hawkins testimony That   is, given what I see as an improvement in financial market conditions and given a   significant upward revision in our forecast compared to what it was at the time we     3/30/99 65   implemented the recent easing, we need to reassess whether the full amount of that easing   is still justified   Second, and here is where I place most of my emphasis, there is the question   of how policy should respond to developments going forward, specifically to changes in   the unemployment rate and inflation I suggested at the last meeting that we follow a   strategy that I call an incremental asymmetric Taylor rule This is a policy that is not   forward-looking but reactive; it responds not only to changes in inflation, but also to   changes in the unemployment rate Following the strategy would entail raising the real   federal funds rate in response to declines in the unemployment rate and to increases in   inflation Based on the staff forecast, following such a strategy would indeed result in an   increase in the federal funds rate over the next year   Third, there is the question of how monetary policy should respond if there is   in fact an acceleration in productivity growth under way This is an issue that the staff   has addressed recently and that President Broaddus talked about today I think the   conclusion that we reached in that analysis is that such acceleration in productivity   growth raises the equilibrium real interest rate of the economy and requires, in order to   maintain an unchanged stance of monetary policy, an increase in the real federal funds   rate   Governor Kelley along with the Chairman made a persuasive case,   nevertheless, for not changing the policy bias at this meeting given prevailing   international tensions and the prospect that the first announcement of such a change in   the tilt could produce a particularly large financial market response So I can accept the   Chairman’s recommendation for continuing the symmetric posture under these   circumstances with the understanding, as I’m sure we all agree, that this is no obstacle to   changing policy going forward  "
3722,1999-05-18," Thank you, Mr Chairman I continue to be impressed by the   recent exceptional growth in productivity The case for an increase in trend productivity   growth is now more compelling after the strength in productivity over the last five   quarters--and especially after the last two quarters--than it was based on the data for 1996   and 1997 And I believe the staff’s pattern of incremental upward steps in trend   productivity growth makes sense, with some acceleration in productivity beginning in   late 1995 and a further acceleration in 1998 My problem with the staff forecast is that its   projection of a 2¼ percent productivity trend over the forecast period is just too   aggressive for my taste This revision to the productivity forecast basically drives their   entire forecast It allows a significant upward revision in growth over the two-year   horizon with little effect on the unemployment rate and, hence, on inflation   It is important to note, however, as the Greenbook makes very clear, that the   revision of the productivity trend delays but does not remove the day of reckoning that is   still implicit in the staff forecast It is interesting that this “day of reckoning” seems to   have become the theme of this meeting The tight labor market gets still tighter The   favorable price shocks are still dissipating further  Ultimately, the very tight labor   markets and the dissipation of supply shocks put inflation on an upward trend This is an   important message Growth does not cause inflation; excessive utilization rates do But   another unexpected shift in the productivity trend, as assumed in the Greenbook, imparts     5/18/99 49   another disinflationary bonus and allows rapid growth to be accommodated for a while   longer with relatively stable inflation   My less optimistic assessment of the underlying productivity trend essentially   moves forward in time the rise in inflation that current initial conditions make so likely I   do believe that we are at an important turning point in this episode Inflation, after falling   throughout the last few years, is stabilizing in the near term, I believe, and is poised to   move higher going forward That’s how I read the recent CPI data   The continued favorable financial conditions and high level of consumer   confidence are helping to sustain robust demand While I still expect growth to slow   somewhat going forward, I believe it is more likely that growth will be above trend than   below trend in the near term, and that growth will not spontaneously slow enough over   the forecast horizon to prevent a rising trend in inflation   It might be useful to recall the forecast that motivated the easings in monetary   policy last fall At our September meeting, the staff projected a 12 percent growth rate   in 1999, assuming an easing in monetary policy  The current staff forecast has growth   almost three times as fast The unemployment rate by this point was projected to be   4¾ percent, ½ percentage point above where it is today It was projected to rise toward   5½ percent by the end of 2000, 1¼ percentage points above the current forecast And   equity prices have rebounded by about 40 percent from their trough in early October To   be fair, the other major developments since the September forecast were the much-  sharper-than-expected increase in productivity growth in 1998 and the upward revision to   trend productivity going forward Productivity growth over 1998 turned out to be almost   double what the staff projected at the September meeting--27 percent versus 15 percent   And the trend productivity assumption is ½ percentage point higher now in the staff   forecast than the 1¾ percent assumed at the time of the September meeting   One question we have to ask is whether we have become sufficiently   optimistic about the productivity trend going forward to justify keeping in place the full   amount of the decline in the federal funds rate that was motivated by a forecast that has   since been so significantly revised and by a set of financial conditions that have so   dramatically improved The second question we have to ask is whether we should   maintain the current policy setting for the funds rate if growth continues strong and labor     5/18/99 50   markets tighten further while inflation remains steady in the near term and is projected to   increase thereafter I will pick up from here in my policy position statement  "
3723,1999-05-18," Thank you, Mr Chairman I support your recommendation for   no change in the federal funds rate target and enthusiastically support your recommenda­  tion for a move to an asymmetric directive that would be announced after the conclusion   of this meeting The balance of risks in my view is toward continued strong growth,   possibly even tighter labor markets, and ultimately higher inflation As other members of     5/18/99 62   the Committee have noted, a case could be made for an increase in the funds rate to   reverse some of our easing during the fall in light of the upward revision to the forecast   and the improvement in financial conditions since that time It is especially important in   my view for us to respond to any further tightening in labor markets or to any increase in   inflation because I believe the unemployment rate is more likely to decline than to rise in   the near term And because I think it is more likely that inflation will be rising rather   than falling over the next several months and quarters, I believe an asymmetric directive   is appropriate at this time   Long-term interest rates have risen in response to the Chairman’s recent speech   and in response to the recent CPI and industrial production data Some might argue that   this rise in long-term interest rates alone provides a desired restraint and removes the   necessity of Fed action However, the rise in long-term interest rates reflects the   expectation of bond market participants that monetary policy will tighten in the not too   distant future, presumably in response to the considerations that I have just outlined The   bond market is in effect pricing in relation to the market forecast and our perceived   policy reaction function Such preemptive pricing in the bond market is in my view   desirable and stabilizing, but it will occur only if we consistently ratify the expectations   on which it is based when those expectations match our own   There has been some concern that the first time we move to a bias and   announce the change will have an unusually large effect on the market But today’s   meeting provides an opportunity to implement such a move with a relatively modest   effect precisely because the bond market has already priced in some expectation of a   near-term policy move While there is very little or no expectation of a change in the   federal funds rate target at today’s meeting, financial market participants are to an   important degree expecting the FOMC to move to an asymmetric directive In fact, I   would expect that the response to no announcement, which might be viewed by the   market as implying that there was no change in the bias, might be greater than the   response to an announcement of a change in the bias Thank you  "
3779,1999-08-24," Thank you, Mr Chairman I read the recent data as consistent with a   continued momentum in aggregate demand that is likely to support growth at or above trend   in the period immediately ahead and maintain very tight labor markets I see core inflation   stabilizing amid signs of a dissipation or reversal of many of the favorable supply shocks   that have contributed to low and declining inflation over the last couple of years and   stirrings, perhaps, of higher wage gains This sets the stage for a test of the role of tight   labor markets on inflation going forward I expect we all look forward to learning a little   more about just how new the new economy really is The story in the Greenbook--and one   that I can definitely relate to--is that the dissipation or reversal of favorable supply shocks,   including the stabilization in trend productivity growth, will allow the effects of prevailing   tightness in the labor market to show through We will maintain growth at near trend over   the forecast horizon with gradual upward pressure on inflation The result is a core inflation   rate that in the Greenbook forecast moves from about 2 percent recently to 2¾ percent by   the end of next year, with the momentum pointing to a further increase in 2001, even   allowing for two ¼ point tightening moves An interesting feature of the forecast is that the   initial step-up to a 2½ percent rate is already in train and is reflected in the quarterly data in   the forecast for the fourth quarter In addition, the 2¾ percent rate at the end of 2000 would   be higher on a methodologically consistent basis than the core CPI inflation rate over the   year 1995, before the coincidence of powerful disinflationary forces took hold   One of the issues that we face and will continue to face in our policy deliberations is   how much to take into account a forecast of rising inflation as opposed to the realization of   utilization and inflation rates going forward That is, how proactive and forward-looking   are we prepared to be in light of uncertainties about the structure of inflation dynamics and   the poor forecasting record of recent years?   Let me point out, relative to the Greenbook baseline forecast, a couple of   contingencies that I think are particularly important and deserve mention--that is, a   correction in equity prices and a sharper-than-projected decline in the dollar The   combination in the Greenbook forecast of a tightening monetary policy, slowing growth,   rising inflation, and a declining dollar appears to raise the potential for an equity market   correction However, I certainly would not want to temper a tightening of monetary policy   by relying on an expected equity market correction to slow growth Rather, we have to be     8/24/99 67   prepared to adjust monetary policy in light of how overall financial conditions evolve in   response to our policy actions   I read the Greenbook as suggesting that the staff has an asymmetric probability   distribution with respect to the exchange rate, with a much greater chance of a lower than a   higher exchange rate evolving over the forecast horizon Given the difficulty in forecasting   exchange rates and particularly timing the effect on exchange rates of a large and widening   current account deficit, the best way to handle the situation may be, as the staff has done, by   providing an alternative simulation with a sharper decline of the dollar But the recent   upside surprises to foreign growth and the high and rising US current account deficit   should weigh heavily on the dollar going forward This may temper any slowdown in 2000   and reinforce upward pressure on inflation Thank you  "
3780,1999-08-24," Thank you, Mr Chairman I support your recommendation for a ¼   point increase in the funds rate and the continuation of the symmetric directive I want to   focus a bit, though, on the issue of whether we need not just a symmetric directive, but a   “truly symmetric” directive And I’m going to give a contrary perspective The bond     8/24/99 83   markets today still have the expectation built in that if we move today, it won’t be our final   move--that there are still further, though modest, increases coming down the road I don’t   think it would be particularly useful to use the directive and our announcement to remove   that expectation from the bond market Indeed, I think it is a very reasonable expectation It   involves the same kinds of considerations that we have talked about around this table   There is a lot of momentum in the economy Labor markets are very tight The supply   shocks are beginning to dissipate So, I think the task we have before us is a rather difficult   one We need to combine the rate move, the tilt, and the announcement so as not to put into   place expectations of an immediate move--keep our options open to be sure--but not to   squeeze out of the markets what I think is a very sensible and rational expectation right now   I think we should try to be market neutral   Now, one reason that I support the symmetric directive is the reason that Presidents   Poole and Moskow and others have noted Right now we have the problem that symmetry   and asymmetry seem to mean different things to different members of this Committee   Until we solve our internal problem, it is very difficult to communicate our intentions to the   public effectively So, first things first During the interim while we clean this up, I think   we have to be more reluctant to use changes in the tilt and, if possible, stick with a   symmetric directive But again, the challenge is how to balance that approach with the   announcement so as not to convey an incorrect set of expectations about our policy   intentions going forward  "
3828,1999-10-05," Thank you, Mr Chairman I agree with Governor Kelley that today’s   decision is especially challenging The recent data for compensation and core CPI have been   remarkably benign On that basis it would appear to be a reach to argue that there is an urgency to   tighten But the Greenbook tells a different story, one in which the interactions of tight labor   markets, above-trend growth in the near term, and the dissipation or reversal of favorable supply   shocks result in a steady rise in inflation over the forecast period The challenge in our policy   decision today is to reflect our assessment of the balance of risks appropriately In my view, those   risks are tilted toward rising inflation   The inflation news has been so remarkably good in terms of both compensation and core   prices that it’s easy to lose sight of a key reality Overall CPI inflation is projected to increase by   almost 1¼ percentage points this year relative to last year This contrasts with a decline of about ½   percentage point in overall CPI inflation last year compared to the previous year This year   nominal compensation gains have been restrained by last year’s decline in overall inflation Next   year, in contrast, compensation will be boosted by the rebound in overall inflation this year This   development highlights what may be a fundamental change in the inflation environment Instead   of lower inflation blunting the force of low unemployment rates on nominal wage changes, rising   inflation going forward is likely to reinforce the effects of tight labor markets on nominal   compensation gains The Greenbook inflation story has many chapters I’m in broad agreement   with both the qualitative themes and the quantitative implications     10/5/99 41   By my count there are nine factors that contribute to higher inflation in this forecast (1)   tight labor markets today; (2) tighter labor markets around the corner; (3) rising capacity utilization   rates; (4) a rebound in nonoil import prices; (5) the secondary effects of the sharp rise in energy   prices this year; (6) a rebound in benefit costs; (7) an increase in the minimum wage; (8) an upward   trend in nonoil commodity prices; and (9) the stabilization in trend productivity growth There is   an important partial offset from an assumed declined in energy prices over next year and the   following year But the cards seem stacked To be sure, this is just a forecast You might say,   “Been there, done that!” [Laughter] Maybe productivity will accelerate further; I cannot rule that   out Maybe NAIRU is even lower than the staff estimate; it could be   But I find the Greenbook story line compelling If it is wrong, it is likely to be a matter of   degree rather than direction Perhaps it will not take four or more ¼ percentage point increases in   the funds rate to limit the rise in core CPI to 2½ percent over the forecast period But how likely is   it that we would come to regret another move this year? The case for tighter policy always seems   more compelling when near-term above-trend growth is projected to aggravate already tight labor   markets That is a one-two punch that should be resisted And once again the data point to faster   growth than previously expected The outlook for growth was revised upward from the last   Greenbook Growth appears to have moved again into the above-trend zone and remains quite   strong, though slightly below trend, in 2000 and 2001 This is the case despite the assumed tighter   monetary policy and flat equity prices in the Greenbook forecast Persistence of strong growth   reflects a combination of still favorable financial conditions even with a tightening, flat equity   prices, stronger global growth, a declining exchange rate, and increased fiscal stimulus   The generally favorite forecast paradigm since at least mid-1996, when I arrived at the   Board, has been slower growth and rising inflation One can say the same paradigm is reflected in   the current forecast But the slowdown in growth is now much more modest and the rise in   inflation more aggressive Instead of looking like a transition from exceptional performance to a   modestly uncomfortable period of stagflation, the forecast is beginning to look a little more like a   boom/bust scenario, with the boom part admittedly more evident than the bust in this part of the   forecast Thank you  "
3829,1999-10-05," Mr Chairman, once again your presentation was a most interesting one I   felt as if I was riding a roller coaster for a while [Laughter] Sometimes when you start out and   begin to talk about accelerating productivity, I feel a bit of discomfort But I’ve heard it often   enough to know that if I’m patient and just sit back, we’re going to end up pretty much in   agreement Nevertheless, I was holding on to my chair! [Laughter] But soon enough you came   back and we agreed that there are tight labor markets and potential inflation risks   The story is that we have two scenarios out there We have the Greenbook scenario with   constant trend productivity growth That’s the one I’m comfortable with and that’s why I am   concerned about inflation risks We have your alternative--one that’s certainly shared by others   around the table--that we could continue to see accelerating productivity growth Clearly, the task   here is to make monetary policy fully respecting that uncertainty That might be a little too simple,   though, because we might really want to ask the question of just how much of an acceleration of   productivity would be required to overturn the increase of inflation that’s in the forecast At any   rate, at times like this I like a maximin type of strategy that looks at each of these scenarios and   pairs it with the wrong policy action to see how bad the outcome is It seems to me that if we have   the wrong policy with the constant productivity growth scenario, we have a rather unpleasant   outcome ahead of us   However, if we begin to tighten and you’re right that productivity growth is accelerating,   it’s just hard to see, given the fact that rates of return are rising so aggressively in the economy, that   very much damage is going to be done The bottom line here is that I’d be very uncomfortable if   you had said that in light of your optimism about productivity the place to be was at no change with   a symmetric directive I do appreciate the leadership you provided in bringing us toward a   consensus We have a variety of options and I think I could live with a number of them     10/5/99 56   I have more than a slight preference for going “B” asymmetric and publishing it because the   artifice of saying that we’re not going to say we’re asymmetric but use language that reflects our   bias in that direction will seem strange to everybody People will note that we used asymmetric   language in our policy release but didn’t want to use the word in the directive and will then worry   about that In this circumstance we have the benefit that the markets expect, more than any other   outcome, the decision today to be no change asymmetric There was a survey in Stone and   McCarthy in which 46 percent of the respondents expected that outcome That was the largest   single expectation I think that gives us some opportunity to get the job done with an appropriate   announcement But if the preference were for doing it and saying that we weren’t going to vote on   symmetry or asymmetry but reflect it in the announcement, I think that would be fine too I would   prefer not to adopt “B” asymmetric and say we will let people find out in six or eight weeks That I   don’t like But I think an announcement to the markets that doesn’t mislead them about what our   assessment of the balance of risks is today would be appropriate    We ought to be careful There is a sense of causality here; this is what   we’re worried about I don’t see any reason to hide that    The point here, it seems to me, is that the more serious problem is in the   realization of above-trend growth in the form of high utilization rates Do you want to mention   what brought about the high utilization rates? This captures it pretty well    I disagree with that Take a situation where we have cost increases and a   02 or 03 percentage point decline in the unemployment rate next time I know where I’m going to   be If everybody else isn’t there, that’s fine Are preemptive responses by us to changes in the   balance of supply and demand appropriate even before those cost pressures show up?  That’s the   question If you’re not prepared to respond to that-­   That’s fine    I’m happy!    That says what we did but not why we did it It goes against the notion that   an announcement is supposed to give the rationale for what we’re doing  "
3881,1999-11-16," I’m concerned about the third paragraph It talks about slowing   growth down toward trend and I think there is a reasonable prospect that we might do that But I   heard concerns expressed around the table--and others can speak for themselves--that that might   not be sufficient to contain inflation going forward, or that at least the risks would still be   unbalanced and consistent with a likelihood that rates would have to rise more So if we’re   going to be symmetric, I don’t want to be so radically symmetric The idea of being symmetric   was to convey to the markets that we were unlikely to move in the very near term, but this     11/16/99 57   wording conveys a different message This says we think we’re done tightening now Okay,   bond and stock markets, have a nice day!    It would be better if you take out the “markedly”    I am not particularly wedded to the language in either of the options   But I strongly prefer the spirit of the second option, which focuses on the policy implications,   and here is the reason What is the tilt about?  What is the market trying to learn about?  Does   the market say “You are our favorite forecasters and we want to know how you view the balance   of risks in the outlook so we can think about the forecast”?  Or does the market want to glean   some information about our policy intentions?   Now, we can leave it and just say we’re going to talk about the balance of risks, but   then they will say that a balance of risks toward higher inflation means the Fed is more likely to   tighten There’s no great damage in that; I’m just saying they are going to infer that We can’t   hide it Why would we want to hide that?  If we want to hide that, we shouldn’t get into the   business of having a tilt at all If we don’t want to hide it, then we can just be more transparent     11/16/99 66   about it and say here is what we think the balance of risks is and as a result of that we think it’s   more likely that rates will be rising rather than falling   The next question is Can we really tie the hands of the FOMC with respect to the   future?  Of course not I wouldn’t want to do that We are not tying anybody’s hands At every   meeting we sit down and we start from scratch making an assessment about the economy and the   outlook We do the best job we can at that meeting So the question is whether we also should   provide some honest assessment of how we are leaning in the future That’s all we are doing,   and we can do that every time   Is the market going to be more focused on the policy decision at the next meeting if   we talk about it in terms of a policy leaning as opposed to talking about the balance of risks?  I   can’t understand why But if we’re concerned about that, why don’t we just communicate?  We   can tell the market that we don’t view this tilt as having any particular focus on the next meeting   We are not saying that we prejudged that we are going to move and that’s why we have the tilt-­  that we decided just not to do it this time but will do it next time We can tell the market that our   decision on symmetry encompasses a near-term horizon, typically perhaps a period of two or   three meetings   Another factor that goes into my thinking is that I believe it’s much more difficult to   convey why we might want to tighten than whether we might want to tighten There are a lot of   nuances, a lot of different models, and a lot of different perspectives around the table So we   might have more difficulty--though this is probably a minor thing--talking about what exactly it   is in the balance of risks that we’re weighing In the draft language in the memo we only have   two things that drive our policy each time--the risks are weighted either toward weakness in   economic activity or toward higher inflation    Or balanced I think that’s a relatively minor point But what I didn’t   like about the language was that it focused on the likelihood of a particular policy move That is   perhaps a little stronger than the language we have been using Instead of saying that in the   future we’re more likely to tighten, now we simply say that we’re more likely to raise rates than   to lower rates That’s a much softer way of conveying an asymmetry as opposed to saying we’re   more likely to raise rates than to hold them constant     11/16/99 67   So I would have preferred to marry the balance of risks and the likely direction of   interest rates I’d give a simple statement about the balance of risks and say that as a result it is   more likely that rates will rise rather than fall or that those risks are balanced, with an equal   likelihood that rates will rise or fall I’d go back to the same language that we have now in the   directive, but precede that with a sentence on the balance of risks    I just had a comment on the Chairman’s latitude When Ed Boehne   talked about it, the first thing he said was something like Of course, the Chairman must have the   authority to move in exceptional cases I didn’t see anything here about “exceptional cases,” and   that’s part of my problem If this were handed out as a public statement, I think it would seem to   convey the notion that the Chairman has more latitude than the market might have expected   There’s almost a sense of encouraging the Chairman to review the data during the intermeeting   period and to make adjustments as he sees fit I don’t think that interpretation is something we   want to encourage Most decisions should be made in FOMC meetings; that’s the best place to   make them In exceptional cases, though, it’s important for the Chairman to have that authority   October 15th of last year was a perfect example of it being used to its best effect That may be   understood inside this organization, and I wouldn’t want to convey an impression outside that   this latitude was for other than those exceptional cases   The other question is linked or de-linked, coupled or de-coupled It seems to me that   this statement says any decision and adjustment should reflect the Committee’s discussion and   decision at the previous meeting That might be a sufficient linkage There should be some   linkage If the Committee’s vote was for symmetry--if the Committee put out a statement that   said there was little chance that a move was going to be necessary--that doesn't mean that a move   couldn’t be made in exceptional cases It just raises the hurdle a bit higher than would otherwise   be the case Whereas if we thought it was more likely that the risks were tilted toward higher   inflation, there would be less of a hurdle for the data to push the Chairman toward an interim   adjustment    I read this change as almost an encouragement of more frequent   intermeeting adjustments I would prefer it to say that the Committee appreciates that in rare   cases the Chairman has the authority to act on the Committee’s behalf  "
3882,1999-11-16," Thank you, Mr Chairman We have a wealth of new and especially   revised data to incorporate into our assessment of the outlook On balance, the data suggest that   both productive capacity and demand are advancing more rapidly than previously expected The   further upward revision of the estimate of trend productivity does translate, as reflected in the   Greenbook, into a slightly more favorable inflation forecast over the next couple of years That   is, the temporary disinflationary force of higher productivity growth has been enhanced and   renewed in this forecast While this has taken some of the quantitative edge off the Greenbook   inflation forecast, it has not changed the qualitative picture or the balance of risks, which in my   judgment definitively continues to point toward an increase in core inflation over the forecast   horizon And I might note that if the Greenbook has lost some of its quantitative edge it hasn’t   lost any of its rhetorical edge, arguing very forcefully that inflationary pressures are building   The key to inflation prospects is not how fast supply or demand is advancing but   rather the degree of imbalance today between supply and demand, particularly in the labor   market, and whether or not this imbalance might be further aggravated going forward In the   Greenbook forecast growth slows to trend There is some discussion at several points in the   Greenbook that growth is slowing to below trend and that pressures in the labor markets are   easing, but I do note that the unemployment rate is 42 percent at the end of 2001 So that 01   percentage point increase in the unemployment rate is not much of an easing in labor markets     11/16/99 39   At any rate, my point is that the slowdown projected in the Greenbook only prevents the degree   of labor market tightness from becoming more acute   I agree with the staff that this degree of labor market tightness has prevailed for some   time and has been offset in recent years by a combination of favorable price shocks and the   disinflationary effect of the significant acceleration of productivity But I think the situation has   changed in a very important way with respect to the future We already can see that overall   inflation has increased significantly this year So we can look forward now to reinforcing   developments instead of offsets Rising inflation this year will reinforce the already tight labor   markets, putting upward pressure on nominal compensation next year That will be reinforced   by the effect of higher health care expenses, and the pass-through of those costs to inflation will   be reinforced by further increases in import prices   One of the most critical aspects of this projection of trend growth is that at the end of   the period--after which inflation has increased by perhaps as much as ¾ percentage point--the   degree of labor market tightness is the same as it was at the beginning of the period Inflation is   rising just as fast at the end as it was at the beginning, and it’s hard to see how this process gets   contained without inflation moving above 3 percent in the period going beyond the forecast   horizon   If I take one thing importantly away from the Greenbook, it is that it’s possible to be   an optimist about productivity and a pessimist about inflation at the same time I think that’s   important to keep in mind  "
3883,1999-11-16," Mr Chairman, I can support your recommendation for a ¼ point   increase in the funds rate and I can accept your recommendation for a symmetric directive The   problem I have is this While I want to convey to the markets the view that there is little chance   that we would make an additional move between now and our February meeting, I don’t   particularly want to convey to the markets that we now feel that we’ve done as much as is   necessary, that we’ve rebalanced the risks, and that it’s just as likely thereafter that rates will go   down as go up What I really want to avoid is turning a tightening into what appears to be an   easing We’ve had that problem before Now, I could make a case that it’s not that hard to   convey what we actually mean in our announcement  I could argue that we could go asymmetric   and tell the market that asymmetry doesn’t mean that during the period leading up to the century   date change we will tighten but that it reflects a policy tilt that would be in place thereafter I can   accept the symmetry, but I just want to raise the issue that we need to be careful about how we   convey our message in the announcement Now we’ve put added burden on the announcement,   which is okay as long as we use it effectively  "
3943,1999-12-21," Thank you It was clear at the last meeting, as it has been during the   deliberations of the Working Group, that I am part of a very small minority on this issue-­  maybe it’s just Bill Poole and I Nevertheless, I thank you for the opportunity to talk a little   about my views because I am strongly in favor of language in the tilt that refers directly to   prospective policy actions   I believe the best way to think about this is to reflect on why we are engaged in this   process and what we are trying to accomplish In my view, two concerns led to this   reconsideration of our directive and disclosure practices First, we became uncomfortable   with the market’s reaction to our announcements, particularly with its assessment of the   immediacy and the certainty of a policy move whenever we announced a shift to an   asymmetric directive Second, there was an additional uncertainty engendered by the   absence of a consistent interpretation of the tilt by members of the Committee Now, the   second problem is easy to deal with We have a process under way to develop a consensus,   and I think we have an agreement around the table that whatever that consensus is we are all   going to be bound by it going forward, whether we agreed with it or not   But the first problem, which I’m going to call the immediacy/certainty problem,   resulted in large part from the decisions we made when we adopted this disclosure policy   last December First, we decided only to announce a change in the tilt when the change was     12/21/99 64   significant and important for the public to know In retrospect, I think that was a mistake It   was as if we had said “If we are going to have a significant change in the directive, we   want to have it flashing on that big neon sign in Times Square” And then we were   surprised about how intense the market response was! Second, by explicitly tying the tilt to   the intermeeting language of the directive, we reinforced the presumption that the bias   referred to a very short-term policy horizon So, I think we unintentionally created the   problems that we are trying to respond to today   Now what do we do? We have already reached consensus on three constructive   steps to alleviate these problems First, we are always going to announce changes in the tilt,   thus removing the special sense of immediacy and certainty of announced tilts Second, we   are going to remove the tilt from the directive and not tie it to the intermeeting period   language And third, as I noted above, we are going to agree to be bound by the consensus   interpretation What more do we need to do?  Here is where we differ   The majority also wants to change the language to focus on the balance of risks in   the forecast in order to detach it from an explicit reference to policy Two quite different   reasons have been put forth for why we should not explicitly refer to the policy direction in   expressing the tilt The first is that by not linking the tilt directly to future policy prospects   we are taking a further effective step toward resolving the immediacy and certainty problem   The logic is that if we don’t mention policy, the markets will be less likely to infer from the   announcement of a tilt a sense of immediacy and certainty of a subsequent policy action   That may be the case But I’m not sure it will be   The second argument is that we can legitimately have an assessment of the balance   of risks to the forecast, but that it makes no sense to have a policy bias because we can’t   commit a future FOMC to a policy decision The view is that somehow the balance of risks   is accurate, but we can’t have an accurate policy bias I don’t understand it I’ll give you an   example We sat around this table today and discussed the outlook, and I think we all were   talking as if it was very likely that we would have to tighten policy even at our next meeting   in February Does that mean when February comes along that we won’t start afresh with a   zero-based review of the data and the forecast?  Of course not  Of course we will start   afresh, as we are required to do So I would reject that notion I don’t think that’s a good   argument     12/21/99 65   But there is a legitimate question as to whether or not the balance-of-risks language   will deal with this certainty/immediacy problem The markets really want to know about   our policy bias and they will infer that policy bias however we express the tilt We would   be deluding ourselves to think otherwise We can couch this bias in the language of the   forecast, but the market will read right through it to our policy intention Therefore, I prefer   the direct, transparent approach Specifically, I’d use the language we’ve been using rather   than this alternative language that Bill Poole has suggested And I would use the press   release to set out our interpretation of the tilt--specifically, that we don’t intend it to indicate   a precommitment to action at the next meeting, but to indicate a greater likelihood of   moving in one direction rather than the other over a longer time frame   If the majority view is nevertheless in favor of the balance-of-risks language, I   would strongly urge that we not assume that this language alone will convey the message   we want to send in terms of immediacy and certainty of subsequent policy action We   should make these points explicitly in the press release in exactly the same way we would   do if we used the policy bias language Thank you    We have gone through a process here and we have reached a   consensus It’s a quite overwhelming consensus, though it’s not 100 percent So I’m   perfectly satisfied that the process has worked I got the chance to try to persuade others to   my viewpoint and I was unsuccessful And I would certainly consider myself bound by this   consensus, so I think we ought to vote   SEVERAL Agreed  "
3944,1999-12-21," Thank you, Mr Chairman There is clearly strong momentum in   private domestic demand and at the same time few signs of rising core inflation So far so   good The issue is sustainability The Greenbook weighs in with an assessment that the   current state is not sustainable--not at the current monetary policy setting or even with the   75 basis point increase in the funds rate assumed in the Greenbook forecast This, we all   understand, is only a forecast and just one forecast at that And as several speakers this   morning have noted, there are many elements of uncertainty surrounding the outlook,   especially about inflation dynamics, NAIRU, and productivity   But I buy into the qualitative story of the Greenbook I buy into the balance of risks   that it identifies and into the message that I think it conveys about the challenges we may be   facing next year From my perspective the challenges are especially great because I think   we face two reinforcing elements of unsustainability We have an unsustainably rapid pace   of growth on top of an already unsustainably high labor utilization rate So, in short, I think   we have our work cut out for us   I believe next year will be an especially key one for monetary policy Even if we do   move to tighten policy next year, the overall picture of growth and inflation might still look   quite favorable, particularly if the staff is correct that we will face declining oil prices after   the peak in the first quarter But in the coming year we will have the opportunity to take the   steps that will improve the prospects of containing inflation going forward and, by doing so,   hopefully extend even further this remarkable expansion Thank you  "
3945,1999-12-21," Don, I thought that was a particularly outstanding presentation   except for the last sentence In the very last sentence you expressed some concern that even   if we were transparent and honest--if we told the market very clearly that our priority was to   assure liquidity over the century date change and that we wouldn’t be taking up the balance-    12/21/99 44   of-risks issue until the February meeting--an asymmetric directive could, nevertheless,   mislead the market Do you really think so?    There’s nothing new there! [Laughter]    As I was thinking about this decision coming into this meeting, my   inclination was for an asymmetric directive with language that during the intermeeting   period we would be focused on insuring liquidity in financial markets Basically I thought   that would be the most transparent and honest approach we could take But I must say that   the symmetric directive draft is extremely well done and I would be very comfortable with   that I feel that’s honest and transparent as well I’m 51/49 asymmetric, but I’m quite   comfortable with the symmetric one, too, because I think it is extremely well crafted  "
4000,2000-03-21,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  In my judgment little has changed in the   outlook and hence the appropriate course for monetary policy since we last met  Let me   emphasize the three features of the outlook that, in my judgment, support an increase in the   federal funds rate target today and suggest that further increases will be warranted over the   course of the next several months   First, the growth in aggregate demand continues to outpace the growth of aggregate   supply even allowing for the recent upward revisions to the productivity trend  Many apparently   have had difficulty with the story that the productivity shock itself could generate an increase in   demand that outpaces the increase in supply  But this link only provides a possible explanation   for why demand growth is exceeding supply growth  I believe this link is plausible  But all that   really matters for monetary policy is that the growth in demand is exceeding the growth in   supply at a time when labor markets are already very tight  Perhaps the more important point is              - 72 -     that whether or not demand grows faster than supply following a productivity shock depends   critically on the monetary policy response to the productivity shock, a point that President Jordan   made very effectively earlier  I find it very plausible that holding nominal rates constant in the   face of a productivity shock that raises the real equilibrium interest rate will result in an excess of   demand relative to supply  The test of whether or not demand growth is in fact exceeding supply   growth is what happens to resource utilization rates  The unemployment rate has been declining   by an average of almost 04 percentage point a year since the end of 1995 and has declined at   least 03 percentage point each year, confirming that demand growth has been exceeding supply   growth  The Greenbook projects a decline of about 1/2 percentage point by the end of next year   to 36 percent in the absence of further increases in the federal funds rate   Second, while core inflation remains well contained, I agree with the Greenbook   forecast that it will soon begin to rise, reflecting the secondary effects of the recent rise in oil   prices, the dissipation or possible reversal of various favorable price shocks that restrained   inflation earlier, and the effects of very tight labor markets  Monetary policy tightening today   would clearly be preemptive and appropriately so   Third, slowing the economy to trend is unlikely to contain the risk of higher inflation    I very much doubt that stable inflation is compatible with a 4 percent unemployment rate    Slowing the economy to trend may, therefore, be just the first step  It is an important step, but it   may not be--indeed, it is unlikely to be--enough  We should therefore be especially determined   to slow the economy at least to trend quickly and to be aggressively reactive to increases in core   inflation  "
4001,2000-03-21,"  Mr Chairman, I agree with your recommendation  I think a good case   can be made for the kind of gradualist policy that we've been following  However, since we are   obviously into confessions today, I should say that I, too, didn't come to this conclusion without   some internal debate of my own                - 91 -     I mentioned at the last meeting that I thought it was important, in terms of the   decisions we made on the funds rate and our announcements on the tilt, that we make sure that   the bond markets continue to build in appropriate assumptions about future interest rate   increases  But in fact, I think there has been some decrease in the extent of the expected rise in   short-term interest rates in the bond markets  I didn't read the incoming data as supporting that   conclusion  The Greenbook didn't read the data as supporting that conclusion  And that suggests   that a time may come when we are going to have to surprise the bond markets  Now, the   question is  When would we like to do that?  Would we like to do it today when the performance   of the economy is in some sense unblemished and before inflation starts to rise?  Or would we   like to do it in the midst of rising inflation and when economic growth may have already slowed   somewhat?  It's possible that we could improve the performance of the economy and do a lot to   reinforce the credibility of monetary policy if we decided to move more aggressively   Well, that was the 40 percent case; I'm still with the 60 percent that argues for a   gradualist policy today  But in coming meetings if the Greenbook forecast is correct and we do   see a rise in the core inflation rate, I think we will have a very good reason to move in a larger   increment  "
4046,2000-05-16,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Bluebook gets to the heart of what   has changed and what has not changed since our last meeting  I quote  “… incoming data   suggested both that aggregate demand had continued to grow more rapidly than potential   supply and that wage and price developments were becoming more worrisome""  So what has   not changed is the momentum in demand and production and the imbalance between the   growth in production and in potential supply  But the quote does not make entirely clear   whether the staff was referring to an imbalance in the growth rates between demand and   potential supply or in the levels of actual and potential output  It occurs to me that the   ambiguity might have been intentional to allow each of us to interpret the observation in a   way that we could accept  But I believe another critical and persisting element is a large   imbalance between the levels of actual and potential output  This view is very consistent with      73  the Greenbook and many other forecasts and it does suggest that we have a significant   challenge ahead of us  I don't know if we have “sweaty palms"" or even if I have “sweaty   palms,"" but I think the challenge is quite considerable  And it is along the lines that I think   Mike Prell laid out very well in his presentation  By the way, I thought that was a particularly   insightful presentation, although I should note that I always tend to find presentations   insightful when they tend to confirm my own bias  [Laughter]       But this is a good point for me to say how much I have valued your   presentations to the Committee during my tenure here  And you really ended on a high note   today!   So, what has changed?  Well, first of all utilization rates have increased slightly   further  There should not be any surprise about that  As long as demand is growing faster   than potential supply, of course utilization rates will increase  Now, I recognize that monetary   policy acts with a lag, but my view is that the restraint we have put in place since last summer   is not sufficient  The virtual absence of signs of slowing suggests that if we don't take further   steps to slow demand growth, utilization rates will most likely increase still further   A second change is that inflation has become both more of a reality and more of a   threat  It is more of a threat because of still high utilization rates and continued above-trend   growth  But it is more than a threat  We are seeing, I believe, the beginning of a pickup in   inflation rates for both compensation and core consumer prices   Certainly one can find some mixed signals, but I view the data on balance as quite   compelling  There is a conflict among some of the data on wages and compensation, but on   the basis of both the ECI and the higher frequency data for average hourly earnings I think it      74  is clear that we are at an inflection point here  To me this assessment is very consistent with   the reports summarized in the Beigebook and with the anecdotal reports that I am hearing as   the various state banking groups visit the Board   As for inflation, President Parry mentioned that the core PCE was moving up  Its   12-month rate is now 18 percent, which is the highest rate of increase since October 1997    And it has moved up 04 percentage point since just the end of last year  In terms of the core   CPI, of course, its 12-month rate is the same as it was a year ago  But if I look at the pattern, I   see that beginning in September the monthly increases were rather consistently higher  I note   that of the next four months to be dropped out of the 12-month core CPI, three of them were   01 percent and one was 02 percent  So, I think the 12-month rate is moving up from being   around 2 percent to being around 2-1/2 percent, consistent with what we are seeing in the core   PCE  Again, why should we be surprised?  Given the prevailing utilization rates and the   dissipation or reversal of favorable supply shocks, some deterioration in inflation is what most   forecasters have been expecting   I think the third change is in the nature of the forecast errors  For a very long time   we have been saying faster-than-expected growth and lower-than-expected inflation  No   more  So far this year there is relatively little surprise about the strength of growth, which   remains robust  And some key inflation data are now coming in either worse than expected or   at least confirming expectations of an increase in inflation pressures--particularly, as I said,   the core PCE and CPI measures, the ECI, and average hourly earnings  This reflects, in my   view, the fact that the dominance of favorable supply shocks is receding  And as a   consequence, the implications of the supply/demand imbalance are coming into clearer focus      75  At the end of last year there was a bold headline in the Wall Street Journal  “So   long supply and demand”  I have been waiting for a new headline “Welcome back supply   and demand”  And then today in the Wall Street Journal on the front page there is an article   about firms starting to raise prices  It begins, “Even in the new economy at least one old rule   still applies  If demand exceeds supply for long enough, sellers will raise prices""  Our job is   clear  We must restore the balance between supply and demand  Until we do so, the threat   and reality of higher inflation are likely to remain with us  "
4047,2000-05-16,"  Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation  I do have to admit   that I got to this decision by a rather different route than you did, but it is nevertheless good to   end up with the same conclusion  I am concerned that our challenge is much more demanding   than slowing the expansion to trend  The further increase in utilization rates and signs of   building inflation pressures suggest that we are ultimately going to have to slow economic   growth to below trend for a while  And until this process is much further along, there's a   threat of continued upward pressure on inflation  I think the gradual approach we've been   taking so far has been motivated by the possibility that our task might be a more limited one--  just slowing the economy to trend--and also by the fact that until recently there hasn't been   any sign of rising inflation  Moreover, we’ve had concerns or uncertainties about sustainable   utilization rates  But I think it has always been clear that there were risks in the gradual   approach  And the risks were that during the time we were trying to slow the expansion, the   imbalance between actual and potential output would become still worse and the threat of   inflation would become more of a reality   It seems to me that with a more aggressive policy action of 50 basis points today   the risk of a policy mistake is much smaller than with a more gradual policy response  What   we're doing in some sense today is moving forward a rate increase that in any event we likely   would have implemented in the near term  So, we don't have to have any larger cumulative   increase in interest rates than we otherwise would have had, but we put ourselves in a position   to implement a larger cumulative rise if it turns out to be justified  Thank you      95 "
4094,2000-08-22,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’m going to focus my remarks this morning   entirely on productivity, specifically on the implications for the outlook of the apparent further   acceleration in structural productivity growth  If I had a title, I think it would be “In Celebration of   Accelerating Productivity”  I’m going to use a handout a little later in my remarks--or at least the   first two pages of my handout--but please, no peeking yet!  3   As it turns out, I’m going to respond directly to Governor Ferguson who said that those of   us who characterize our views of the economic outlook and challenges for monetary policy in terms   of NAIRU have a very heavy burden in terms of communication  I think he’s absolutely correct    And I rise to the challenge!  [Laughter]  To me the most important developments since our last   meeting were the revisions to the path of productivity over the last several quarters and the higher-                                                    3 A copy of the material used by Mr Meyer is appended to this transcript  (Appendix 3)       61  than-expected value of productivity in the second quarter  Likewise, the most important parts of the   revisions to the Greenbook forecast for me related to productivity  They were the upward revision to   the assumption about structural productivity growth and the interesting decision to build into the   forecast a further acceleration in structural productivity, as implied by the capital deepening path   associated with the staff forecast   Now, I think President Poole made a very worthwhile point about the need for caution in   extrapolating productivity acceleration going forward  But I rather like what the staff did in this case   because it made their forecast more internally consistent  They have a path of capital spending; they   have an assumption about capital deepening  And what they really did was to endogenize their   projection of productivity to keep it consistent with the capital deepening going on in the model    Still, as others have pointed out, it probably would be useful to have alternative scenarios with   different productivity paths since this is so very important to the outlook   Let me now turn to an interpretation of the Greenbook forecast  What is happening in this   forecast is that the staff has revised upward the path of both actual and potential GDP growth by   about the same amount, preserving almost the same unemployment path as it had last time  But   inflation is lower as a result of the impact of a further acceleration in productivity on inflation, an   effect I want us to focus on in a minute  The picture is clearly bright  We have higher growth and   lower inflation than in the previous forecast  But what is also important is that the Greenbook has   preserved the qualitative story of the last Greenbook and previous Greenbooks, and that is that the   unemployment rate is still below the staff’s estimate of what I’m going to refer to as the short-run or   effective NAIRU  And as a result, there is upward pressure on inflation due to tight labor markets,   though less so than would otherwise be the case because of the acceleration of productivity  Indeed,   over the next year and a half, the dissipation of the secondary effects of energy costs on core       62  inflation just offsets the upward pressure that demand is exerting on it, leaving the core rate about   unchanged  But thereafter core inflation would begin to rise in a longer-run forecast  We would see   that, for example, in the five-year and longer kinds of projections like those we had in the Bluebook   at the meeting last time  And over the still longer run, as the short-run NAIRU converges to the   long-run NAIRU, there could still be more rapid increases in inflation unless and until supply and   demand were rebalanced     I think the keys to understanding the role of productivity in the forecast have to do with   two fundamental issues  One is the effect of productivity on aggregate demand as well as aggregate   supply  We know that the staff has argued, I think persuasively, that over the last four years the   increase in productivity has actually increased demand by more than supply, resulting in the decline   in the unemployment rate that we’ve seen  They make a break from that approach in this forecast by   moving to balanced increases in demand and potential supply  That, I think, is supported by the   more modest tone of the economic indicators and by the relatively subdued path of equity prices   recently  But we have an important element here of upside risk because we certainly could get a   repetition of the pattern we have had over the last four years, in that each acceleration of productivity   actually brought with it even sharper increases in demand     The second effect is the one I particularly want to focus on, and that is the temporary   disinflationary impetus that comes whenever we have an acceleration in productivity  Now, we are   only beginning to learn about the complex dynamics associated with an increase in productivity   growth  First of all, there is not even widespread consensus about the framework that I’m going to   be using here, though it is implicit in the staff forecast as well  But we really don’t have a lot of   historical data from which to learn about the impact of adjusting to big increases in productivity  We   had the big decline in productivity in the 1970s and we have this recent experience with acceleration       63  in productivity, and that’s it  We have very few data points  So, there’s a lot of uncertainty about   how it all works out   What I want to focus on, then, is the power and persistence of the temporary   disinflationary effect associated with the acceleration in structural productivity  Let’s look at that   first term on the first page of the handout  What I identify there is the effect on inflation of an   acceleration of productivity as being related to this term the difference between q, which is the   actual trend productivity now--for example, 3-1/2 percent in the staff forecast--and q*, which is a   moving average of trend productivity  The key in this analysis is that wages respond more slowly to   increases in trend productivity than prices, and this gap reflects that difference  The q* is a moving   average of that trend in productivity, which reflects the slower impact on wages  As a result of this   asymmetric response of wages and prices, an acceleration of productivity temporarily lowers   inflation  And that exact term shows up in the price specification of the Phillips curve if there is an   asymmetric response of wages and prices to inflation  Just to give you an idea of how powerful this   might be, take a look at the second page where I plotted out that term--the difference between trend   productivity and a moving average of trend productivity  I based the estimate of the moving average   on a 40-quarter moving average  I picked that particular length because that’s the specification the   staff uses in solving their wage equations and they found that that works relatively well  What we   see here is that because we have such a long lag length, the increases in productivity that we’ve seen   cumulate; they don’t dissipate  They are still cumulating and getting to the highest impact we’ve   seen  This term is now 1-1/2 percentage points; that says that the acceleration of productivity is now   responsible for about a 1-1/2 percentage lower inflation rate than we otherwise would have had     You don’t have to turn to the mathematical derivations on the third page unless you are a   glutton for punishment, but the estimation is all worked out there in gory detail  But I think it       64  probably overstates the disinflationary impact for a couple of reasons  One, there is a good reason to   believe, or I think it is plausible, that part of this acceleration of productivity would be absorbed by   firms through a higher profit share during this period  So, not all of this acceleration is passed on in   the form of lower prices  Secondly, it’s very hard to estimate the lag here  Some equations, in   particular those in the FRBUS model, have a shorter lag  To approximate this effect in that model   would involve a lag of about 3 years as opposed to 10 years  And if that were the case, it would cut   this disinflationary effect by about two-thirds  It would only be about ½ percentage point     So, it seems to me that this framework helps to explain why an acceleration in   productivity temporarily lowers inflation for a given unemployment rate while preserving the role of   balance between supply and demand in labor markets as an important force in inflation dynamics--  indeed, the importance of the long-run NAIRU once q* converges back to q  What it suggests to me   is that this further acceleration in productivity is definitely a powerful force holding down inflation   relative to what it otherwise would be  I think the staff forecast of about-stable core inflation   through next year and an upward creep after that makes a lot of sense  And it suggests that we might   have somewhat more time in terms of dealing with the day of reckoning  But we have to be mindful   that the unemployment rate might still be below the short-run NAIRU here and that ultimately these   demand pressures will become more meaningful should we get a convergence of the short-run   NAIRU back to the long-run NAIRU once productivity growth stabilizes     "
4095,2000-08-22,"  Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation for no change in the funds   rate and to maintain the assessment that the risks are still unbalanced toward higher inflation  I just   want to give a perspective on the unbalanced risks issue   Whenever we have an acceleration of productivity growth, we have the following choices    We can take it for a while in temporarily higher output or we can take it in potentially permanently   lower inflation  I think so far what we have done is to take it all in the form of higher output  Core   CPI inflation today is exactly the same as it was at the end of 1995 on a methodologically consistent   basis  That is fine  But I would argue that we have to be particularly vigilant about an upward creep   in inflation going forward because once this productivity acceleration effect dissipates, inflation will   rise  And it is better if that rise takes place from a level closer to our long-run inflation objective than   from a level that has already drifted above it          80   The second reason is that an acceleration of productivity is the classic opportunity for   opportunistic disinflation  So, it does seem a little strange to allow an extraordinary experience of an   acceleration of productivity to be accompanied by an upward creep in inflation  For both those   reasons, I think we need to stay with the statement on unbalanced risks  I think they are unbalanced   and even though inflation performance remains very favorable, I believe we have to be very vigilant   about rising inflation going forward    "
4143,2000-10-03,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I will focus my remarks this morning on what   I view as the three key themes in the Greenbook forecast  While David Stockton has already      68  emphasized the considerable uncertainty that attaches to each of them, these themes are consistent   with the qualitative aspects of my own view of the outlook  First, the economy appears to be making   a transition from above-trend to below-trend growth  Second, the balance of risks is nevertheless   toward rising core inflation  And this risk not only persists throughout the forecast period; it will   likely remain for a considerable period of time thereafter  Third, if oil prices decline over the next   two years, consistent with expectations in futures prices, overall consumer price inflation will likely   decline next year and the upward drift in core inflation will be significantly restrained over the   forecast period     The balance of risks toward higher inflation, even if growth remains modestly below   trend, reflects an assessment that the prevailing unemployment rate is below the short-run NAIRU   and the prospect that the short-run NAIRU will rise as productivity growth stabilizes, or at least rise   at a slower rate than over the last several years  The upward pressure on core inflation in the   Greenbook comes from the gap between the prevailing unemployment rate and the staff’s 4-3/4   percent estimate of the short-run NAIRU  The staff projects no increase in the short-run NAIRU   over the forecast period  And a subsequent convergence toward the long-run NAIRU would   presumably be a source of continuing inflation pressure beyond the forecast period     There have been already many well deserved compliments to the authors of the   Greenbook, but I can’t resist noting that no member of this Committee has a greater appreciation for   their careful analysis of the unemployment rate relative to the short-run NAIRU and the long-run   NAIRU than I do  Of course, the staff took no chances in this Greenbook  With all the alternative   simulations, including the one with a 4 percent long-run NAIRU, there was something for   everybody  And that’s a good thing, I’m sure       69  The first two themes in the Greenbook story, below-trend growth and rising core inflation,   are features of what I have called a “reverse soft landing”  There is a transition to growth at   potential from an initial point above potential via a period of below-trend growth  During the   transition demand pressure results in an upward trend for core inflation unless other supply shocks   intervene  So while many outside and some inside the FOMC will regret a slowdown to below-trend   growth, I continue to believe that such a reverse soft landing is the most benign outcome possible,   given my assessment of the relationship between actual and potential output today     The earlier period of above-trend growth and declining core inflation and the projection of   below-trend growth and rising inflation over the forecast period are, in my view, two sides of the   economy's adjustment to the acceleration in productivity growth  Initially, an acceleration in   productivity yields a powerful disinflationary impetus  It may allow a decline in both   unemployment and inflation  That is the bright side of the adjustment to the acceleration of   productivity that we have enjoyed for the last four or five years  It has offered policymakers a   choice among only favorable outcomes temporarily lower unemployment, lower inflation, or some   combination  Now the time may have arrived when we have to face the other side of that   adjustment  When the temporary disinflationary impetus of the productivity gains dissipates, the   demand pressure at the prevailing unemployment rate will begin to show through to higher unit labor   costs and inflation unless, of course, productivity growth continues to rise aggressively enough to   postpone that adjustment     On the other side of the adjustment process we face a less favorable set of choices--some   combination of below-trend growth and rising core inflation, as in the Greenbook, until output is   realigned with potential  The closer growth is to potential during this part of the adjustment, the   sharper will be the cumulative rebound in inflation  The staff forecast does, nevertheless, offer a      70  very benign outcome over the next 2-1/2 years  The key assumptions that contribute to that benign   outcome are that oil prices decline over most of the forecast period and that a tighter monetary   policy prevents a premature rebound in growth to or beyond trend as long as there is upward   pressure on core inflation The result is steady growth at a rate more than 50 percent higher than the   average of the 20 plus years prior to the mid-1990s, with an average unemployment rate still close to   the lowest over the last 30 years and still modest rates of overall inflation  This is not as good as the   experience during the bright side of the adjustment process, but it would still be a pretty impressive   next chapter in this expansion     While I appreciate the uncertainty about the estimate of both the short-run and the long-  run NAIRU, the Greenbook forecast and analysis highlights the risks of higher inflation that may   still remain, even if the economy slips into an extended period of below-trend growth  "
4144,2000-10-03,  I support the recommendation  
4187,2000-11-15,"  Yes, it’s like mixing apples and oranges here  You’re taking one   forecast and another rate assumption that’s based on a different model and a different forecast  I   think the comparison that is always worthwhile to make is to ask how your baseline federal funds               25      rate forecast relates to what’s in the futures market  But I don’t find particularly instructive a   forecast that uses the futures market interest rates and otherwise the staff assumptions  "
4188,2000-11-15,"  There is in my view relatively little change in the outlook compared to   the assessment at our last meeting  The data and developments we’ve seen since that meeting,   however, do reinforce the expectation that we have transitioned into a period of below-trend   growth  In addition they justify a small downward revision to the forecast of real GDP growth,   at least over the next few quarters, in line with the adjustment in the Greenbook forecast  The   two most important developments were highlighted in the staff presentation on the outlook this   morning  First, there has been a deterioration in financial conditions, including the wider quality   spreads, especially for below investment-grade bonds and tighter lending standards by banks   and, second, a heightened anxiety about the financial conditions of some emerging market   economies, especially Argentina   The deterioration in financial conditions in the United States reflects a response to the   slowdown that is under way and reinforces the prospect of continued below-trend growth  Both   developments add an element of downside risk to the forecast  The qualitative story nevertheless   remains unchanged  We appear to be headed, in my view, to a period of below-trend growth and   at the same time rising core inflation  If oil prices decline as projected in the Greenbook, overall   inflation is likely to diminish and the rise in core inflation is likely to be significantly damped   over the forecast period   The focus in our discussion this morning is clearly on assessing or reassessing the   balance of risks in the forecast  In assessing the balance of risks, we have to look at both the               71      risks in the baseline forecast and the risks relative to the baseline forecast  The risks, for   example, are balanced in the baseline Greenbook forecast between below-trend growth and a   rising unemployment rate on the one hand and rising core inflation on the other hand  This is an   uncomfortable mix but one that may be inevitable following the long period of above-trend   growth and the decline in the unemployment rate to its current exceptionally low level  It is this   balance that I presume encouraged the staff to maintain a constant nominal funds rate through   the next year in the Greenbook forecast     Relative to the Greenbook baseline forecast, I'm slightly more concerned about weaker   growth, especially next year  And if growth turns out to be in line with the Greenbook   projection, I'm slightly more concerned that inflation might turn out to be higher than projected   in the Greenbook  My assessment of the risks reflects my view that both the temporary demand   and disinflationary effects of the productivity acceleration may now be dissipating     While the risks in and relative to the baseline forecast may now be more balanced--  and I think that is the case--there are nevertheless a number of reasons for this Committee to   delay a move from a statement that the risks are unbalanced toward higher inflation to one of   balanced risks  First, we’ve had only a single quarter of below-trend growth after 4-1/2 years of   persistent above-trend growth  We might want to be more confident that growth will remain   below trend before we take such a step  Second, the unemployment rate today is at its cyclical   low and significantly below the staff's estimate of the short-run NAIRU  We might not want to   remove the disproportionate focus on inflation risks until we see labor market tightness unwind   at least a little  And third, the benign inflation forecast depends importantly on the assumed               72      decline in the price of oil  We might want to wait until we see at least some confirmation of that   trend   My greatest concern today is that a move to a balanced risk assessment would   reinforce expectations of a near-term easing  I would have less of a problem if financial markets   expected a balanced risk assessment and incorporated expectations of a stable funds rate going   forward  Perhaps the issue is how to communicate our assessment that the risks have become   more balanced without appearing to downgrade our concern about the risk of higher core   inflation and without reinforcing expectations of a near-term policy easing   Finally, with core inflation at or above my long-run target and with a further increase   in core inflation over the forecast horizon and beyond in the Greenbook and my own forecast, I   would prefer that we be very cautious about removing an assessment that the risks are weighted   mainly toward higher inflation  True, growth is also expected to be below trend, and we have to   be alert to the downside risks  But below-trend growth when output is above potential, as I   believe is the case, is desirable That’s exactly what we need to mitigate the risks of rising core   inflation  There is nothing, on the other hand, desirable about the projected rise in core inflation    Maintaining the statement of unbalanced risks would effectively reinforce the point that, given   the prevailing tightness in the labor market and inflation already above our long-run objective,   there is a higher than normal threshold before the Fed would consider easing  I believe that   would be the right message to send     Don, I have a question about the analytical framework you   used in the earlier part of your discussion  I may have misunderstood you but it seemed   to me that you were saying that maximum sustainable growth is the translation of the   objective of maximum employment--sort of identical to that in some sense  My reaction   is that that's not the way I ever thought about it  It seems to me that maximum   employment is a utilization rate concept  And we have the problem here that this   slowdown in growth may in fact be pushing the output level to our target--not away from   our target, but to our target And that's good     But inflation, given that we are perhaps already above where   we’d like to be, is clearly pushing it away     That’s absolutely fair  The question is how far along we are   and whether that's a situation that would really be useful in 2002 or 2003 or whether it’s   relevant in the next several months     I take it that’s from a framework similar to the Greenbook and   maybe that's my problem  But beginning with an unemployment rate of 39 percent,   where the long-run NAIRU might be closer to 5-1/2 percent, it just seems a bit premature   to be worrying about that  If we were at a different starting point, then I would agree that   that could be relevant     Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation in all respects    Specifically, I think we should retain the statement of unbalanced risks  And I thought   the statement that you read was excellent   "
4239,2000-12-19,"  Just one point to follow up on that One possible way to operate is to note   that while we’re no longer required to report targets for the monetary aggregate it doesn’t mean that   we shouldn’t be monitoring and looking at them  They still play the role of anchoring a sense of   inflation targeting     Thank you, Mr Chairman  There are two key questions that highlight, at   least for me, the challenges in making the forecast and setting the course of policy today  First, is   the growth rate in the Greenbook forecast over the next few quarters or the rate of revision in that   forecast over the two most recent intermeeting periods a better guide to what the forecast will be the   next time we meet?  If the current Greenbook forecast turns out to be on the mark, we have in my   view a relatively benign outcome  We would see some of the excesses arising from a long period of   above-trend growth unwind and would return to near-trend growth by 2002  That outcome would   contain the risk of higher inflation and likely extend the life of this expansion   I think there are two ways of describing this outcome  The first is as a reverse soft landing   emphasizing the therapeutic value of a slowdown  The second is a growth recession  We have had   around the table a bit of discussion of that concept  This emphasizes the pain associated with rising   unemployment, production cutbacks in areas where demand has weakened the most, profit   disappointments, declines in equity values, and the associated swing in consumer and business   confidence  But I'll remind you that these are just two different ways of describing the same   outcome   However, once the economy has slowed to below trend, the downside risks to the forecast   that earlier might actually have been welcomed, quickly become a source of serious concern  And as   President Moskow noted, when there is a rapid swing from above-trend growth to below-trend   growth it becomes, as it does at turning points, especially difficult to forecast  The internal      56  dynamics of the economy become very hard to anticipate  There are dangers of inventory cycles just   as there are at turning points and, therefore, of overshooting   While available monthly data seem consistent with the Greenbook forecast for the current   quarter, measures of confidence in some real-time anecdotal reports point to downside risks  In this   regard I really expect that the December data may be very helpful in getting a better handle on   whether the slowdown is stabilizing or deepening  I think an important key will be whether or not   production cutbacks in the fourth quarter make a significant contribution to slowing inventory   investment, as in the Greenbook forecast  Another important contingency is whether we face a   further significant decline in equity prices in response to additional profit disappointments   The second key issue we face today relates to the possibility--and in my mind strong   probability--that the economy was operating beyond sustainable capacity before this loss of   momentum  If so, the question is whether that requires a more cautious and measured policy   response to the slowdown to below-trend growth than would be the case if the economy were   operating close to capacity when growth moved to below trend  The answer here seems obvious, but   perhaps the real issue is the level of output relative to potential and our confidence in such a reading    Those who, like myself, believe we are operating beyond sustainable capacity welcome a slowdown   to below-trend growth while appreciating the importance of not allowing a slowdown to escalate to   one that is either excessive or to an outright recession  But certainly if I, like Governor Gramlich,   believed that 4 percent was a sustainable unemployment rate, I'd be right where he is in terms of the   need to ease quickly  "
4240,2000-12-19,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support your recommendation  I continue to   believe that a period of below-trend growth is constructive, but I'm mindful of the downside risks we   face today  I think one reason for being cautious about moving immediately is that the markets   already anticipate a move early next year and a cumulative easing of 100 basis points over the course   of next year  I don't think we should do or say anything at this meeting that would disconfirm or   unwind those expectations, but neither do I believe that it would be particularly constructive to   escalate them further  So, I think this is the right move for now  But this period of uncertainty is a   time when the incoming data may be very revealing, and an intermeeting move could certainly be a   possibility  "
4284,2001-03-20,"  Three highly interrelated developments over the intermeeting   period have, in my view, strengthened the case for further easing  The first relates to the   more powerful negative wealth effect due to the slide in equity prices, the further decline   in consumer confidence, the possibility of a more serious shakeout or retrenchment in   high-tech investment, and the prospects for weaker foreign growth  All those factors   point to weaker consumer and investment spending and weaker exports over the forecast   period for a given funds rate path  Despite these concerns, the incoming data are mixed   and there is considerable uncertainty about the strength of spending going forward   A second consideration reinforcing the case for further easing is that broader   financial conditions have not eased--at least not appreciably--despite the decline in the   funds rate to date and despite expectations in the market for considerable further declines   in the funds rate  Instead, the decline in equity prices and the strengthening of the dollar   have significantly offset the stimulus from lower short-term interest rates   Third, and perhaps more speculatively, although David Stockton mentioned   this in his presentation, recent developments may be consistent with a decline in the   economy’s equilibrium real interest rate  The staff, as you know, has been working on   estimating a time-varying measure of the equilibrium real funds rate  One of the key   drivers of the equilibrium real rate is the equity premium  To the extent that the recent   decline in equity prices is a reassessment of fundamental values rather than a cyclical     3/20/01 77  correction, it implies a rise in the equity premium and a decline in the equilibrium real   rate  In this case, the federal funds rate might need to be lowered more aggressively than   would be suggested by movements in the output gap or inflation  Of course, this line of   analysis has some implications for the appropriate response to a decrease in the equity   premium, but that’s another story   Let me turn to the question of why the economy has slowed so sharply and   what the implications are for the forecast and the policy response  One hypothesis is that   we’re in the middle of an IT inventory correction, one that is sharper and faster than   traditional inventory corrections but with less persistence  This would be consistent with   the so-called V-shaped recovery  I don't disagree that the current inventory correction   may be sharper and swifter than traditional corrections, but I do not think that is the most   important theme in the story nor even the most important way in which new economy   developments are shaping the slowdown  The deeper story in my view is the interaction   of a cyclical slowdown and a correction of pre-existing imbalances     Such a correction of imbalances is quite typical of recessions and, indeed,   often contributes to the severity of downturns  I will focus on two interrelated   imbalances at the start of the slowdown  One is the valuation of equities, particularly of   high-tech firms; the second is the rate of high-tech investment and/or stocks of high-tech   capital goods   First, consider the consequences of the apparent equity correction  The staff   estimates that the wealth effect, after adding as much as 1-1/2 percentage points to   consumer spending growth in the second half of 1999, will be subtracting about 1   percentage point throughout the forecast period  That will result in growth of consumer     3/20/01 78  spending at a rate below the growth in GDP  The tax cut assumptions in the forecast   make only a slight dent in the short run  As a result, returning to trend growth over the   forecast period requires a strong rebound in investment     Unfortunately, the second imbalance may be in the level of high-tech capital or   at least in the rate of high-tech investment  The V-shaped recovery depends on a strong   rebound in investment, reflecting continued high structural productivity growth and an   associated high expected rate of return on high-tech investment  But we also have to put   into the investment mix the legacy of excesses associated with the frenzied pace of   investment over the last few years  The result may be a period of shakeout or   retrenchment in high-tech investment that weighs against a quick and sharp rebound   Let me turn now to a critical set of assumptions underpinning the Greenbook   forecast  They happen to be very important in assessing the degree of cumulative easing   that might be required  Despite very similar paths for output, the Greenbook and Blue   Chip forecasts show very different paths for the unemployment rate  This is exactly the   issue that President Minehan remarked on earlier and that a number of others also have   mentioned today  The Blue Chip forecast, assuming what appears to be a similar policy   path to that in the Greenbook, depicts a quite benign soft landing, with the unemployment   rate moving just above 4-1/2 percent--close to the short-run NAIRU--and growth near   trend in 2002  In contrast, with about the same output path, the Greenbook has the   unemployment rate a full percentage point higher and growth still slightly below trend in   2002  As a result, that would call for a more aggressive easing over the forecast period    The first key assumption behind this difference, as President Minehan noted, is   the underlying rate of productivity growth  The staff assumes that structural productivity     3/20/01 79  growth is almost 1/2 percentage point higher than the assumption implicit in the Blue   Chip forecast  This explains a bit less than one-half of the difference     The second key may be how Okun’s Law is being applied  The Blue Chip   forecast seems consistent with applying a simple static form of Okun’s Law  The staff   appears to be applying a dynamic version, taking into account the delayed effect of the   slowdown to date, most of which has not yet passed through to employment  It’s hard to   argue with the Greenbook approach in this case  But there are some considerations that   might support a different dynamic in the labor market response to a slowing in growth    One example is the reluctance of firms to lay off workers, given the recent difficulty in   hiring them  At any rate, these considerations increase the difficulty of assessing at this   point just how much easing will be appropriate and provide a rationale for a gradual,   incremental strategy of easing     Thank you, Mr Chairman  My position is very similar to that   of Presidents Minehan, Broaddus, and Guynn, a little stronger than President Moskow’s    I support your recommendation for a 50 basis point decline in the target funds rate today,   along with a statement that the risks remain unbalanced toward economic weakness  But   I would very strongly prefer to avoid any direct or explicit hint in our statement of an   intermeeting move   I haven’t heard much support for a 75 basis point move, so I won't argue the   case for 50 as opposed to 75  A 50 basis point move today along with a statement of   unbalanced risks as always, as has been pointed out, holds open the possibility of an   intermeeting move  But hinting more directly at such a possibility in the statement,   especially if we repeat something like the words in our December 19th statement--in   effect using a code that will be interpreted as an inclination toward an intermeeting move   --would, in my view, be a mistake  It would leave market participants speculating day in   and day out about whether we were in or about to hold an emergency meeting to cut the   target funds rate  It could aggravate the market's response to every newly reported   indicator and it would leave equity prices continually buffeted by such speculation  This   type of uncertainty in my view has no up side   My preference to avoid a direct hint of an intermeeting move also reflects my   preference for policy decisions to be taken at our regular meetings  To be sure, there are   circumstances when an intermeeting move is a valuable part of our toolkit and, Mr   Chairman, you have used this tool sparingly and wisely in the time I've served on this   Committee  I am confident you will continue to do so  Still, I do not believe it would be     3/20/01 102  wise to set policy so as to leave the impression that an intermeeting move has a very high   probability or to tell the markets that we are so inclined     This is just a little stronger it seems to me because we didn't   say “especially” monitor, we said monitor “closely”     The discussion will all be on what “especially” means     I can’t vote “no”?     3/20/01 109    Okay  "
4328,2001-05-15,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  My views of the outlook are very   consistent with both the qualitative story and the general details of the Greenbook forecast    Relative to that forecast, the risks in my view have become more balanced  I also share the view   that several others have expressed today--that given that forecast, we’re approaching the point   where it would be appropriate to become much more cautious about further easing       5/15/01     71   In the near term, the negative wealth effect and the retrenchment in high-tech   investment appear almost certain to be significant drags on the economy  As a result, growth   looks likely to remain very weak in the second and third quarters and then to gradually, and only   gradually, move back toward trend  The prospects for a gradual improvement reflect in part the   stimulus expected, but not yet evident, from the aggressive easing moves over the first part of   this year  Clearly, there are still downside risks     We have approached the point where we also have to pay more attention to the upside   risks  That may seem odd given that so much of the rise in the unemployment rate in this   episode may still lie ahead of us  But the decision to move aggressively toward stimulus in 50   basis point increments, and including two intermeeting moves, means that we may also need to   end the easing sooner  Indeed, we may get to the point where we have put in place an   appropriate degree of stimulus even before much of the effect of that stimulus becomes evident   The modest rise in core inflation and the upward adjustment to the staff’s inflation   forecast support this assessment  These developments confirm, in my view, that inflation risks   were indeed building before the economy slowed so sharply  In addition, these developments   point to what might lie on the other side of recovery  After recessions, the buildup in slack often   allows a period of disinflation during the early cyclical rebound and, at the very least, a   considerable period before concerns about rising inflation surface  The slowdown in this case   began in my view with output above potential and growth in demand above the rate of growth of   potential supply  In the Greenbook forecast the slowdown under way results in output falling   below potential, but not very far below, by the time growth returns to its potential rate sometime   in 2002  Indeed, in the Greenbook forecast, the unemployment rate rises to about the level of the   staff’s estimate of the long-run NAIRU in 2002, with the staff’s estimate of the short-run NAIRU     5/15/01     72   lagging behind, but not very far behind, and still converging with the long-run NAIRU  At any   rate, more so than in most cyclical downturns, there is potential for overshooting   Let me conclude with a few comments on the role of the productivity assumptions in   the Greenbook forecast  We have new data  The staff revised the estimates for 2000 going   forward, and the projections now suggest that structural productivity growth stabilized in 2000   after ratcheting higher over each of the preceding eight or so years  The continuing rise in   structural productivity growth in earlier years renewed each year the temporary bonuses   associated with rising structural productivity growth--specifically, the stimulus to aggregate   demand and the restraint on inflation  The apparent stabilization in structural productivity   growth in 2000 may, therefore, have contributed at the margin to both a weakening in aggregate   demand and to the upward pressure on inflation   The second feature of the productivity story is the decline in structural productivity   growth that the staff now projects for this year and next year  Just as the staff was quick to   revise upward its estimate of structural productivity growth in response to revised data and   prospects for capital deepening, they’ve been quick to revise it lower  Assuming the staff has   that right, the decline in structural productivity growth could also reinforce both the downdraft   on aggregate demand and contribute to upward pressure on inflation     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I can support your recommendation for a   50 basis point easing today and a statement that the risks remain unbalanced toward economic   weakness  On the other hand, I could also have joined Presidents Minehan and Broaddus in   supporting a case for slowing the pace of easing today and moving only 25 basis points  That   might have been a very effective way of signaling the sentiment that we now need to move   toward a more cautious monetary policy and that we may not be far from ending the easing cycle     But more importantly, Mr Chairman, I agree with you on what I believe is the really   important issue, and that is the prospect that we may be near the point--and perhaps after this   move at the point--where we have to be very cautious about any further easing      Actually, I think that would be a good idea  I also would like to see   two parts of the statement adjusted  I’d suggest that the very last part of the second paragraph,   which reads “threatens to keep the pace of economic activity unacceptably weak,” be toned   down a bit  It could say these factors “continue to weigh on the economy” or something like   that  The proposed wording seems a little too sharp  And perhaps we could add a reference--  maybe after the sentence that says the reduction in excess inventories seems well advanced--to   the fact that consumption and housing expenditures have held up reasonably well  We might   also note that the considerable easing over the last half year should begin to support economic   growth      Well, I think it would be good to have a different statement  That’s a   good reason to change it     Is that including the change I suggested in that paragraph?  "
4371,2001-08-21," The previous Greenbook projected some strengthening in growth in   the fourth quarter and a recovery to growth near trend and to a level of output near potential in   2002 And I believe there was a sense of agreement that if the forecast stabilized, that forecast   provided a strong case for holding policy unchanged after last meeting’s move  On the other   hand, the pattern this year has been a continuing series of downward revisions to the forecast,   followed by additional easing moves in an effort to restore the earlier forecast for 2002  So the   first questions I asked myself as I prepared for today’s meeting were “Has the forecast   stabilized?” and “Is the forecast for 2002 still lined up to a reasonable approximation on trend   growth and full employment?”  The answers will help me to assess both the need for further   easing and the room to maneuver--or the threat of overshooting in easing further     This assessment, however, is complicated, as David Wilcox noted in his presentation,   by the NIPA and productivity revisions The outlook context for monetary policy decisions in   my view is best viewed in terms of growth in actual output relative to potential and in terms of   utilization rates From this perspective, the growth rates for 2001 and 2002 in the Greenbook   forecast were marked down just about in line with the staff’s downward revision to trend growth,     8/21/01 55   thereby virtually replicating the previous Greenbook’s projections for the unemployment rate   and inflation  So if the story is still that forces are in train that will move the economy to   recovery and that the recovery will put the economy near full employment and trend growth next   year, it’s hard to see the need for further easing or the room to maneuver   But to tell the truth, the story doesn’t feel entirely right  There remains a tension   between the evidence of persistent weakness in the incoming data and the story of recovery  The   question we face in each forecast round is how many quarters lie between the data and the story    And what we end up doing again and again is inserting one more quarter that looks more like the   previous weak quarters--in this case it’s the fourth quarter of this year--before we get a   transitional quarter or two on the way to trend growth  At the very least this pattern suggests that   there are significantly asymmetric risks on the downside     In assessing how much easing is appropriate and whether we have done enough,   another consideration is important  Declines in the federal funds rate have little or no direct   effect on aggregate demand but are an instrument for encouraging a more accommodative   overall set of financial conditions, as the lower short-term rates pass through to lower longer-  term rates, to equity prices, and the dollar  In fact--and this is an issue that President Poole and   Governor Gramlich have just commented on--long-term rates did not fall from their levels at the   time we began to ease, at least until very recently  Furthermore, equity prices are significantly   lower and the dollar is higher   I asked the staff to run some simulations with the FRB/US model to assess the effect   of the cumulative easing on overall financial conditions  First, they began the simulations in the   first quarter of 2001 and they held the real federal funds rate constant in the baseline forecast  In   the alternative scenario, they imposed the path of the funds rate in the Greenbook through 2002      8/21/01 56   They ran the alternative scenario under two assumptions  In the first case, they assumed the   historical regularities for pass-throughs to longer-term interest rates, equity prices, and the dollar    In the second, they constrained the latter variables to follow their actual paths through the last   easing The results indicated that, assuming historical regularities, there would have been   virtually no effect on real GDP through the second quarter  But real GDP would have been a   percentage point higher by the end of this year and more than 3 percentage points higher by the   end of 2002 However, given the actual paths of financial variables, the level of real GDP would   be only 1/4 percentage point higher at the end of this year and 1/2 percentage point higher by the   end of 2002 That is, instead of providing a powerful stimulus, the easing only about offset the   restraint coming from declining equity prices and the appreciation of the dollar, leaving little net   stimulus from overall financial conditions   The problem with this simulation experiment is that it fails to give the Fed any credit   for the decline in interest rates in the second half of 2000 in anticipation of Fed easing in 2001    So the staff then redid the simulations beginning in the third quarter of last year  By August of   last year, the federal funds futures indicated the absence of expectations of any change in the   funds rate over the next year The decline in long-term rates that followed reflected expectations   of subsequent Fed easing This approach counts the decline in long-term rates in the second half   as part of the stimulus from the cumulative easing  But the benefits of the lower long-term rates   were more than offset by the effects of the decline in equity prices in the second half of last year    So in somewhat of a surprise, to me at least, on net financial conditions have actually become   more restrictive rather than more stimulative if we begin the accounting from mid-2000   From the standpoint of monetary policy strategy, this raises the question of whether   and how monetary policy should be adjusted for variations in the pass-through from the funds     8/21/01 57   rate to broader financial conditions, episode by episode  If we make our policy judgments on the   basis of the forecasts, this adjustment would naturally occur  But it does raise a cautioning note   about guidance from outcome-based policy rules that in effect are calibrated off average pass-  throughs   At any rate, this analysis suggests some tension in the forecast  We all point to   monetary policy as one of the forces promoting recovery and yet the analysis shows that at best   we may be running in place  To be sure, it also suggests that our aggressive easing has prevented   what otherwise might have been a slide into recession  However, the recovery in the Greenbook   must be based not on improved financial conditions but on other forces in play--for example, the   effects of lower energy prices, more stimulative fiscal policy, or perhaps more importantly the   natural forces for recovery that follow the end of the inventory correction and the end of the   retrenchment in high-tech investment     While I worry, therefore, whether we are on the path to recovery, I also worry about   overshooting as well It seems to me that the dynamics of expansion suggest an upward   instability to growth In the dynamics of cyclical swings in growth, it’s not that the economy   returns to trend growth after a slowdown or recession and stays there, but it naturally moves to   above trend growth Therefore, once a recovery is under way we may face the twin challenges   of moving monetary policy back to neutrality in a timely fashion and contending with above-  trend growth at a time when inflation is a bit above at least my long-run target and the economy   is already operating at close to capacity  Further easing today will undoubtedly complicate that   adjustment  But the failure to see traction from our moves to date and the resulting downside   risks encourage taking some risk of overshooting today and leaving to tomorrow the task of   returning to neutrality and avoiding the inflationary consequences of any overshooting     8/21/01 58  "
4372,2001-08-21," Mr Chairman, like some others, I do worry a bit about the adjustments   that will become necessary as the economy begins to recover on the other side of our current   problem  But I support your recommendation  I think it’s right for today  "
4418,2001-10-02," Thank you, Mr Chairman  I found the alternative simulations   provided by the staff in the latest Greenbook to be especially useful  Given the   exceptional degree of uncertainty that we now face, the alternative scenarios help us to   better appreciate the range of outcomes  But in addition, they allowed me to easily craft   my own forecast by adding the alternative scenarios directly to the baseline subject to my   personal assessment of the probabilities associated with each  When I began this exercise   I thought that it would allow me to present to you an interesting, even compelling,   alternative to the Greenbook forecast  To my surprise--and I must say disappointment--I   found that when I completed this exercise, the alternative scenarios turned out to be   remarkably offsetting  That left me, no doubt, with the same uncertainty as the staff had,   and equally likely to be wrong, but with a forecast that turned out to be remarkably   similar to the baseline  While we face enormous uncertainty as I indicated, I think this     10/2/01 70   sort of experience adds a little to the credibility of the baseline  I did wonder a bit if the   staff might have been playing some games by offering us a series of alternatives that they   knew were entirely offsetting just to reinforce the baseline  But David Stockton assured   me that this was an accident of good fortune rather than a strategy!     I find that it’s useful in my own thinking to separate the forecast horizon into   two sub-periods The near term covers the next two or three quarters and the remainder   is the period through 2003 It seems to me that there are two key drivers of the near-term   forecast The first is the momentum in the economy prior to September 11th The second   is the effect of the events of September 11th through disruptions to key industries and via   consumer and business sentiment  With respect to the momentum, some saw the data   immediately preceding September 11th as very encouraging and signaling that the   economy was poised for a rebound  Others interpreted the very same data as indicating   that the economy had at most stabilized at a growth rate not much different from zero,   and they were still revising down their forecasts     I think there was ample scope in the data to support both of these differing   interpretations, but I was in the latter camp  And the more pessimistic interpretation   suggested that additional easing would have been justified in the absence of the events of   September 11th In part for that reason, my point of departure for the forecast was the   alternative simulation with easier money policy     But the events of September 11th clearly called for a downward revision to the   near-term forecast--at least to the estimate of the third quarter and the forecast for the   fourth quarter and likely into early 2002  Because a downward impetus to a considerable   degree reflects an assessment of the psychological effects of the events of September     10/2/01 71   11th, the uncertainty about the forecast is an order of magnitude above normal  But my   judgment is that over this time frame the risks are more likely asymmetric toward still   weaker growth So I give some considerable weight, 50 to 75 percent, to the alternative   simulation of a collapse in consumer and business confidence  Having said that, the   downside risk seems to be most acute in the fourth quarter because I’m also going to give   very high weight to the alternative simulation of major fiscal stimulus  And by the first   quarter, that also begins to weigh in importantly    There is little that monetary policy can do through traditional channels to spur   demand over this time frame  However, there might be and probably would be some   salutary effect by bolstering confidence in the future  What we do and what we say   should be designed to contribute to this end, and I think Governor Kelley made that point   extremely well     A second consideration concerns the implications for monetary policy of the   evolution of overall financial conditions  Once again, we’re confronted by a shock that   has had direct effects both on financial conditions, specifically on equity prices, and on   aggregate demand above and beyond the effect on equity prices  Monetary policy has to   move aggressively enough to counter at least the adverse effects on overall financial   conditions before it can hope to make a net contribution to offsetting the direct effect on   aggregate demand   Over the remainder of the forecast horizon it seems to me that the fiscal   assumptions begin to dominate the forecast, complemented by the details of the internal   dynamics of recovery as consumer sentiment and hopefully equity prices rebound  In   addition, the latter development should be reinforced by the delayed contributions of the     10/2/01 72   forces we expected to support recovery before the events of September 11th, including a   rebound in high-tech investment after a sharp and prolonged retrenchment and a return to   inventory accumulation after liquidation runs its course     Now, beyond the nearer-term period it seems to me that the risks turn to the   upside, at least after mid-2002 and especially into 2003  My reading is that the fiscal   stimulus will be an order of magnitude above that in the Greenbook baseline, something   closer to the major fiscal stimulus simulation  Over this time frame, therefore, perhaps   the key question is what monetary policy is a good fit with the assumed fiscal stimulus    There is a potential that an earlier and more aggressive reversal of recent and prospective   monetary easing will ultimately be called for than may be contemplated at this point    Still, there’s ample scope for additional monetary policy easing over the near term  In   part this reflects the fact that, given the prospects of a rise in the unemployment rate to   the 6 percent range, we should now be targeting a period of above trend growth  So,   whereas before we might have thought that we needed stimulus to get economic growth   back to trend as quickly as possible, now if we ended up with something that was less   than a percentage point above trend I think we’d be disappointed  We could probably   tolerate something even stronger than that for awhile  Nevertheless, as a number have   already suggested, monetary policy will face the challenge at some point during the   second period and beyond of a timely return toward neutrality   I think the other issue relating to the strategy of monetary policy relates to the   timing of any cumulative decline in the funds rate  Most of the bad macroeconomic news   in particular relates to higher unemployment that lies ahead and likely will extend at least   through the middle of next year  In evaluating what we do today, we should pay some     10/2/01 73   attention to how much more of a cumulative decline might be justified given the forecast   we now hold And then we need to consider how we should spread the change out over   time so that we don’t end up doing more than we would prefer to do  In addition, we   might worry a bit about how we should signal markets about our future intentions so that   we don’t face market pressure again to move further than would be prudent  I must say,   however, that I don’t think that is really a story of today, but a story of what we do at   subsequent meetings  Thank you  "
4419,2001-10-02," I wanted to follow up on that discussion of the equilibrium real   rate because I think many of us have come to believe that information on this--if we had   confidence in it--is very valuable to our setting of policy  I applaud the research that the   staff has been doing on this subject; I think it already has provided a lot of insights and   has been very useful I have to say, however, that I have a high degree of skepticism   about the amount of short-term variation in the staff measure of the equilibrium real rate    I think that at this point our methodology hasn’t really allowed us to separate out very   effectively cyclical from longer-term influences  So I think the issue needs some more   thought For one, the path of the equilibrium real rate has so much sensitivity to near-  term data that I think any estimate that is not based upon a forecast that goes out at least   five years for example--and returns to some sense of normality--has to be discounted   considerably  But I think that’s work for the future    I support your recommendation  "
4463,2001-11-06," Dave, one of your comments in your presentation surprised me a little, and   that was the link that you described between capital deepening, productivity, and inflation  You   emphasized the implications of a temporary investment incentive that raises investment, spurs   additional capital deepening, and leads in a sense to a positive supply shock  In the Greenbook,   though, it seems to me your emphasis was that on balance we face a negative supply shock because     11/6/01 20   of a significant slowing in structural productivity growth that is expected to occur for a couple of   reasons, including a slowdown from an unsustainable pace of technology spending and also the   reallocation of resources to security enhancements    Just to follow up on that, the slowdown in structural productivity growth is   really quite significant into 2002 in particular  We became somewhat familiar with the complicated   dynamics of how that plays out on demand as well as inflation when we had an acceleration in   structural productivity, so this is perhaps a factor that we should weigh in our real forecast as well    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Relative to the current Greenbook forecast, I   believe that there are still asymmetric downside risks to the first half of next year but that the risks   are more balanced after that time  Because of the near-term downside risks, I view the alternative   scenario of still weaker consumer spending as identifying a material risk  Given that risk and   considerations that, in my view, suggest that policy today should be set to err on the side of stimulus,   the path of the federal funds rate in my forecast is more consistent with the easier monetary policy   alternative simulation  Indeed, that would be the case even if I were beginning with the Greenbook   baseline Still, as David Stockton noted in his presentation, there is an unusual blend of pessimism   and grim data on the one hand and signs of resilience on the other hand, further complicating the   assessment of the outlook     But my major concern relates to the question of the appropriate monetary policy relative   to the forecast My first concern here is that monetary policy may be less effective in this easing   cycle than it normally has been because of the failure of the declines in short-term interest rates to   pass through to other dimensions of financial conditions that matter more for spending  In that   regard I recognize that my views run counter to the remarks we just heard and to many of the   comments around the table this morning that have emphasized the amount of monetary stimulus   already in the pipeline and its likely contribution to the vigor of the projected rebound     Financial conditions indices, including the one recently constructed by the Board’s staff,   are sometimes subject to difficulties in interpretation  But they do in my view highlight the risk that   financial conditions have improved much less than would have been expected based on the   magnitude of the cumulative decline in the federal funds rate over this easing cycle  The Greenbook   forecast presumably takes this into account  Indeed, I suspect it may be the reason why monetary   policy is assumed to remain so stimulative, measured in terms of the real funds rate relative to its     11/6/01 66   long-term equilibrium value and relative to the economy’s rebound  The implication of concerns   about the improvement in financial conditions is not that we should rely less on monetary policy but   that we may have to do more than would otherwise have been necessary   Second, I wonder whether we need to take into account another aspect of asymmetric risk   --what might be described as the two-states-of-the-world problem  The Greenbook, like most   forecasts, seems to assume a one-time terrorist attack with a near-term effect on confidence that   dissipates over time  That might be appropriate for a modal forecast  But relative to this   assumption, there seems to be significant asymmetric downside risks, specifically of further terrorist   attacks that affect confidence in the economy or perhaps for other reasons as well  The forecast for   the first state of the world is therefore likely to be biased in an optimistic direction though, as David   Stockton noted, we would be hard pressed to parameterize the downside risks associated with the   second state of the world Still this analysis suggests that the mean of the forecast might be   interpreted as being below the mode in this case  So the question is how policy should respond to   this type of uncertainty and whether policy should be set to err on the side of ease relative to the   modal forecast   This concern is reinforced by the implications of the zero nominal bound restraint  My   remarks here will elaborate on the points that have already been made by President Broaddus and   Governor Ferguson Some have suggested that the initially low nominal funds rate should   encourage us to keep our powder dry To the contrary, I read the lesson from our study of the zero   nominal bound constraint as pointing to an asymmetric policy response, one that is more rapid with   respect to downside shocks This allows policymakers to use a faster speed of response and   compensate for the smaller possible cumulative decline  The result of the more aggressive policy   would be to limit further declines in core PCE inflation, restraining it from falling below my long-    11/6/01 67   run target of 1-1/2 percent as it does in the Greenbook baseline  This maintains a cushion that would   allow a larger decline in the real federal funds rate if needed   This may be less of a pressing concern at the moment given the steepness in the yield   curve and the opportunity for long rates to fall relative to short rates if the downturn is deeper or the   recovery more gradual or longer delayed than now expected  A more rapid easing would, however,   provide an opportunity for long-term rates to fall by more over the forecast horizon if the sharpness   of the decline or the moderation of the recovery disappoints the financial markets  In any case, I   take the lessons from the zero nominal bound analysis to mean we probably should move more   aggressively in response to adverse shocks, not less when nominal short-term rates are already low   My last concern is about long-term rates  While they have declined somewhat further   recently, they have been sticky in relation to the cumulative decline in short-term rates  As a result, I   have become concerned that we may have lost the ability to lower them further with monetary policy   and, therefore, have quite limited leverage on aggregate demand  This stickiness may reflect in part,   as David Stockton noted, the offsetting effect of a revision in longer-term budget prospects  But in   my view, it may also reflect a divergence between the FOMC’s forecast for the economy and the   forecast implicit in the bond market, equity markets, and the federal funds futures market  Given the   more robust forecast apparently priced into these markets--most evident in the expectation of an   early and aggressive reversal in the federal funds rate--any further decline in the federal funds rate   may be viewed as unnecessary, even damaging, and in any case short-lived     As a result, I have mused, the best way to stimulate the economy might be not to lower the   funds rate further but to encourage a decline in long rates relative to short-term rates  How can we   do that, I hear you ask?  [Laughter]    Perhaps, I muse again, we could do that by being unusually transparent--  that is, by informing markets that we view the economy as weaker than they appear to be assuming   and that as a result the federal funds rate is less likely to rise as soon or as aggressively as they   expect As I said though, I am just musing here--I think--and perhaps amusing, [laughter] as   opposed to making a serious policy recommendation       "
4464,2001-11-06," I just have a comment on Don’s presentation I thought you were   especially effective this time, Don, in making the case for both a 1/4 point move and a 1/2 point   move Indeed, it was a bit of a roller coaster ride for me  I felt myself being swayed first in one   direction and then whipsawed back in the other direction  So it was an enjoyable ride!  Thank you   [Laughter]    Mr Chairman, I view the risks relative to the Greenbook baseline as still   to the downside in the near term  I believe that’s a case for erring on the side of stimulus relative to   the baseline, given the asymmetric risks and the relationship between the mean and the mode in the   forecast And I believe that’s a case for moving more rapidly than otherwise, given the zero nominal   bound constraint For these reasons I support your recommendation of a 50 basis point decline in the   target federal finds rate today and also your recommendation for a balance of risks statement toward   weakness    It’s in a slightly different location in this statement, but we always use it   "
4511,2001-12-11," Thank you, Mr Chairman  Recently at FOMC meetings, one of the key   issues that has weighed on the policy decision is whether or not the forecast is stabilizing  In fact, as   Governor Ferguson just noted, in each of the previous FOMC meetings this year there has been some   meaningful downward revision in the Greenbook forecast  And these revisions have been followed by   further easing So it seems that a precondition for an end to the cycle of easing is a stabilization in the   Committee’s forecast  This Greenbook delivers such a stabilization  Indeed, it has a small upward   revision in projected growth for next year  My forecast has the same property and a number of you   around the table have reached the same conclusion  This at least puts on the table the possibility of   holding the line on the funds rate, if not today then perhaps after today     Of course, we face a tension between the forecast and the incoming data on production and   employment  The incoming data reflect the projected decline in output this quarter, and over the next   several months we’re likely to see further increases in the unemployment rate until economic growth   comes back to trend  In my view, prudent monetary policy would call for an end to the policy easing   cycle before an end to the rise in the unemployment rate  Nevertheless, the sharpness of the increase   in the unemployment rate in November and the uncertain effects of that on sentiment and spending at   least put back on the table the possibility of a little further easing at this meeting     One way of thinking about monetary policy is in terms of the path of the funds rate  A   second way that I sometimes find useful is in terms of the desired path of real GDP growth, as if that     12/11/01 64    were the instrument under control  Given the lags in the response of monetary policy and the   preference with regard to moving interest rates, when I play this game I don’t adjust GDP growth for a   couple of quarters The question I ask as I look at the Greenbook is whether the strength of the   rebound as we get to the middle of next year is about right or, for example, would be better scaled up    I view that as a way of gauging whether or not there is room for further easing  That room depends on   three considerations the rate of employment in mid-2002, when growth moves above trend in the   Greenbook forecast; the inflation rate at that time relative to the Committee’s long-run objective; and   how much projected growth is above trend in the following year or two  The Committee does not   have an explicit long-run inflation objective, so I do the exercise in terms of my own long-run   objective for inflation, which is 1-1/2 percent for the PCE core inflation rate     It seems to me that these considerations reinforce each other and suggest relative to the   Greenbook forecast some room for further easing  The unemployment rate peaks just above 6 percent   and is still 5-3/4 percent at the end of 2003, as compared to my estimate of the NAIRU at that point of   5-1/4 percent And the inflation rate is almost 1/2 percentage point below my long-run objective at the   end of the period A number of people, Governor Ferguson and Governor Gramlich both, mentioned   the perfect foresight simulation, and this is the message that comes through in that particular forecast    On the other hand, just to keep it close, I expect that growth might be stronger by mid-2002   than projected in the Greenbook and I’m slightly more pessimistic than the Greenbook about inflation   First, I expect a sharper cyclical rebound in equities and therefore I start with the staff’s alternative   simulation with a stronger stock market  The Greenbook equity path is predicated on further earnings   disappointments and a perception that there is some overvaluation today, given the excessively   optimistic earnings expectations  There’s good logic in this assessment, to be sure  But I suspect that   this logic will be overwhelmed by a more normal cyclical rebound if the economy performs as     12/11/01 65    projected in the Greenbook  Down the road, we’ll face the implications of any resulting   overvaluation   Second, I believe we may be at an inflection point  We are shifting from progressive   downward to upward revisions to the forecast  And this reflects a tendency toward a coincidence of   positive errors or smaller negative errors in spending equations during recovery periods     With respect to inflation, the Greenbook focuses on the effects of declining oil prices and   the emerging slack in labor markets  I would put more weight than the staff does on the implications   of what looks like a significant adverse supply shock  The staff estimate of structural productivity   growth has declined from a bit above 2-1/2 percent in 1998 and 1999 to about 2 percent this year and   about 1-1/2 percent next year  We, or at least I, placed a lot of emphasis on the effect of the   productivity acceleration on both demand and inflation to explain the exceptional performance of the   economy in the second half of the 1990s  Now, the deceleration is different in character from the   acceleration, and perhaps this will matter  It reflects a move from overshooting in 1999 and into 2000,   relative to some longer-run sustainable growth rate for productivity, to undershooting next year  In   addition, it reflects some effect from increased spending on security  But it seems to me that this   swing could damp the projected disinflation  To be sure, the staff has taken this into account in their   forecast but not with the weight I would have given it  As a result, I view the negative supply shock as   at least a risk factor relative to the Greenbook forecast   The bottom line is that there appears to be a little room for further easing, but we are rapidly   approaching the point where it may be prudent to hold the funds rate stable for a while  Even at this   point, the Committee will still be able to adjust the degree of stimulus going forward by its decision on   how long to remain at the low prevailing funds rate and how gradually to return to neutrality    "
4512,2001-12-11," Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support your recommendation While I   support a statement of unbalanced risks toward weakness, I also believe that the Committee should   avoid encouraging an expectation of further easing at the next meeting  Given my recent experience   in communicating with the markets, I’m not giving any advice on how to do so!  [Laughter] I will     12/11/01 89    view with great interest the statement this time, as it tantalizes us with a possible way of   accomplishing that goal   I’m very pleased to see that the Committee will continue its practice of using its two-day   meetings as an opportunity to have a wider discussion of key issues related to the strategy of monetary   policy Because this is my last FOMC meeting I will not have an opportunity to participate in these   discussions or even to make suggestions for the agenda  So I thought I’d take this opportunity to   unveil some recommendations--in this case for improving the transparency of monetary policy--in the   hope that the Committee might find it worthwhile to discuss this topic in the future  Let me also note   the excellent contribution to this topic from the recent conference at the Federal Reserve Bank of   Philadelphia   Transparency means, in my view, revealing to the public both the objectives that drive the   policy decisions and the rationale for specific policy decisions  I see greater transparency as serving   both to enhance the accountability of the Fed and to increase the effectiveness of monetary policy by   improving the market’s ability to anticipate future policy actions  In terms of transparency about   objectives, I would urge the Committee to discuss again and to consider further setting an explicit   numerical value on its long-run price stability objective  I stated my case on this recommendation in a   paper earlier this year, so I’ll focus today on recommendations related to the minutes and the role that   document plays in conveying the FOMC forecast     The Committee’s press statements have become briefer and more repetitious this year and in   my view less revealing Moreover, some Committee members have expressed a preference for   moving further in this direction To be sure, it is a challenge to have more than a very brief statement   and still represent the consensus of the Committee  In any case, as a consequence the minutes have   become a more important vehicle for revealing the Committee’s views on the outlook and policy     12/11/01 90   options The minutes serve to illuminate the rationale of the recent action and in addition they   recognize the diversity of views on the Committee     The first change I would recommend is either to eliminate the discussion of recent   indicators at the beginning of the minutes or to move it to an appendix at the end  This discussion is   presented on page one, I presume, to set the context for the meeting, not to describe what we   discussed As it is today, it is the first substantial section in the minutes  To my mind at least it numbs   the reader [laughter] and may even distract those who continue on and remain for the summary of the   Committee’s discussion that follows     I had thought about recommending that the next section, which is the paragraph that   summarizes the staff forecast, be expanded maybe to a full page  In the end, after some quite   interesting and constructive discussion with the staff, I decided not to recommend this course of action   out of concern that moving in this direction might interfere with the freedom the staff currently   perceives in putting together its forecast  At the margin though, it still might be useful to expand the   paragraph a little to better tell a coherent story about what underlies the staff forecast  Furthermore,   particularly to the extent that the Committee’s press announcement on the policy decision becomes   less revealing, it would in my judgment be constructive to speed the release of the minutes--perhaps to   the third Thursday following the meeting, or just over two weeks after the meeting   My next set of recommendations relates to the FOMC members’ own forecasts, now   revealed twice a year in the testimony and report on monetary policy  My first concern is that these   forecasts may not be developed as advertised  That is, the forecast is supposed to reflect appropriate   monetary policy from the perspective of each member  This is a very weighty assignment, especially   if the forecast extends out beyond a year--perhaps similar to the perfect foresight policy in the   Bluebook this time  It might be helpful, therefore, if the Bluebook included such a forecast based on     12/11/01 91    perfect foresight in the policy-related material  I think the Committee members might want to discuss   whether they’re preparing the forecast under this type of model and if not, whether and how to do so   Second, these forecasts in my view should always cover a period of at least one and a half to   two years In particular, the forecast prepared each January now extends only to the end of that year,   while the forecast prepared in June extends one and a half years  The January forecast in my view   should be extended to the end of the following year, a two-year period Now, I appreciate that this   recommendation was considered and rejected in 1994  Some members of the Committee were   concerned at that time that such an extension could allow the public to infer the Committee’s   objectives! Should I repeat that?  To my mind, this is an advantage  Publishing an extended forecast   might require more discussion by the Chairman at his monetary policy testimonies and perhaps by   other Committee members  That’s what transparency is all about   Third, the ability of the forecast to serve as a rationale for the Committee’s decisions is   limited today because the Committee does not reveal the assumptions underlying its consensus   forecast and in particular the funds rate path  I understand that this is especially radical, but I would   encourage the Committee to consider revealing the central tendency of the funds rate path that   underlies its consensus forecast I’d also suggest perhaps looking for other ways to reveal the key   assumptions underlying that forecast   Finally, I’d encourage the Committee to consider increasing the frequency of such forecasts   from twice a year to four times a year  This forecast provides a rationale for the Committee’s   decision And it is more important in this respect because of the absence of a full statement that   otherwise provides that rationale Just as a picture might be worth a thousand words, so might that be   said of a forecast     12/11/01 92    Let me conclude by repeating what I said during my very first meeting in June 1996  This   has been even more fun than I expected it to be!  It has been a privilege to serve on this Committee    I’m certainly fortunate to have served during a time that has been so interesting and challenging  I’m   fortunate to have served on this Committee under the leadership of Alan Greenspan and with all of   you I’m fortunate also to have had the exceptional support of the staff, as I wrestled with the outlook   and tried to make contributions to the policy discussion     "
