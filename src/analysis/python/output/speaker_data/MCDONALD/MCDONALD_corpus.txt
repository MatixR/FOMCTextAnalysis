 Other than no baby to report I can pick up on President Keehn's comments about economic conditions Ours are the same or very similar to what they are in the Chicago District Our unemployment rate in April and May has been 12 percent And this occurred despite a slow steady reduction in the labor force in recent years Comments were made about steel operating now at 45 percent of capacity; and [conditions in] the auto industry and manufacturing industry are very similar, although our banks are showing less signs of strains than their counterparts nationally Loans and assets and deposit growth have exceeded the national average as well as the year- earlier performance Our loan-to-deposit ratio is about 75 percent, which is about 11 points below the national average Savings and loans, on the other hand, are plagued by continued deposit outflows In our ten largest S&Ls, losses were at the rate of a million dollars a month over the second half of '81 There's a possibility that half of these [institutions] will have to be merged, perhaps later this year The weak economy in Ohio has contributed to a projected billion dollar deficit in the Ohio budget by June '83 and this is going to be met by a 50 percent increase in the income tax surcharge effective tomorrow So, for low and middle income families, the surcharge will virtually offset the reduction in the [federal] income tax  On the state income tax, right As for the target ranges, we agree with the [current] path Longer run, I would agree with Presidents Black and Boykin and support, consistent with sustaining a gradual disinflationary posture, reducing them by 1/2 percentage point and staying within the targets There are those who say it's bracketitis or that type of thing But we are getting more  -22-    6/30-7/1/82  and more comments from bankers and business people saying that you at the Fed set the targets and you ought to stay within the ranges We all recognize the same thing that you do around the table, but that's seemingly very serious  I can sympathize with the desire and the need for lower interest rates, but higher monetary growth can be associated with higher interest rates I agree with Governor Wallich's comment that it's not time to make a fundamental change in policy or to convey alarming signals to the market, and I would support the 4 percent [M1 growth target] in alternative B
