782,1978-06-20,DENKLER,"  The problem that has caused us to place this emphasis on security is that of  the vulnerability of telephone communications to intercept  We have studied this problem rather   extensively, and essentially [the situation] is that, as now used, telephone communications rely very  heavily on microwave relay and as some of  you, I am sure are aware, microwave relay is  particularly vulnerable to intercept [even] by just an amateur  It is very inexpensive  [The  capability] is there; it can be done and beyond that we know that it is being done  It is being done on  a rather large scale by certain foreign governments  One of the ways to secure the microwave is to  revert to the use of cables  This can be done relatively inexpensively but in doing that, of course,  then you make yourself more vulnerable to wire tap      So, looking at the cost of doing something about the vulnerability from those two perspectives,  we have concluded that the best way to handle it is by using fairly sophisticated scrambler devices in  the handsets that would be involved in the communication  Now, point-to-point communication  involving these scrambler devices is relatively easy and is well within the present state of the art  As  I said in my memo it can be done, for example, between Washington and New York for about  $130,000  To go beyond that takes a giant step as far as the technology and the complexity of the  problem are concerned  Tying in a third station requires a mixer--a conference bridge or some  device to allow you to extend this beyond [two stations]  To go to the entire System, as an example,  [would require] a thirteen station network and becomes even more expensive on a large scale  That  [cost] would be approaching about $1 million     6/20/78                48     Looking at the risks that are involved and at the comparative expenses of the measures that we  could take, I came up with the recommendations that you have seen in my memorandum  It looks as  if at the present time the most cost effective measure would be to render the Washington to New  York circuit safe from interception and to defer anything beyond that until such time as the  technology is better proven  Then we can look at that in any manner that would be appropriate   Right now, frankly, it is something of an unknown  That essentially summarizes the problem      This uses a new technique  It digitizes the signal  I have used it and Steve  has used it and it worked well between here and New York        It=s the best-grade system that we have  In point of fact, it very marginally  degrades the voice signal  You will notice that you are on a scrambler, but when it works properly,  it=s a good system security-wise      That was an analog  Those old analog systems were terrible      That is correct      That=s correct  Dialing would have to be centralized, but any one extension  could talk to any other extension at the other end      Well, it’s relatively insecure, but more secure than the telephone  It could  be intercepted      Yes, for the same reason      There are certain automated features in connection with a cable system that  would allow us to do that      It=s a dedicated network    "
811,1978-07-18,DENKLER,"  The critical aspect, technically, is that of extending beyond just a point-to- point link between here and New York  As we pointed out earlier, any conferencing of three or  more stations involves a rather astronomical rise in cost  To tie in the twelve Reserve Banks with  the Board would amount to about $800,000, over half of which would be just the so-called  conference bridge that is necessary to tie in the twelve stations  So we are proceeding with the  point-to-point link, which will provide secure communications between here and New York  At  the same time, somewhat coincidental of that, we are going ahead with the plan to link all the  Banks with cable--safe telephone communications that will provide a modicum of security  It will  provide security against the most vulnerable aspect of regular telephone communications--that is,  microwave, which is very easily intercepted  Now, of course, that in our present mode would not  be used for the morning market call  There would be no way of tying in another Bank [and having  it] secure between here and New York and that Bank  So, we are up against the technical problems  of that      Because the secure link would be between Washington and New York  To  add a third station requires a conferencing capability; you can’t have half secure and half open      The Washington and New York areas are the ones that are most vulnerable  to microwave intercept      I do know that they will lease the security equipment itself on the bridge  I  have not asked that question      At this stage of the game, it would be a unique--      It may be that there are other alternatives, Mr Chairman  I am continuing  to look at them  The demand in the private sector is very strong right now, as you say, for this type  of solution  If suddenly one should appear, I certainly would be very interested    "
