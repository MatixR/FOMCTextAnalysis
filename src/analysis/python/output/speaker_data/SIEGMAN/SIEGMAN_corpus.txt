 No I think the Treasury's need for some contingency or a cushion for reserve is appropriate, given the uncertainties Otherwise, we'd have to review this on an emergency basis rather than--   Governor Angell, we have $339 billion in DM, in recent values   We did sell--   No, this is dollar values   In the past six weeks, on the balances of DM the United States in total lost approximately $3 billion, not including yesterday's appreciation And on the yen the United States lost close to $1 billion   But those are unrealized [losses]   We have $265 billion and they have $22 billion   Although on intervention policy the Treasury has the mandated authority--   --and we have to consult and work in conjunction with them  -15-    3/26/91   I just want to bring to your attention also, as you may have heard, that Congressman Gonzalez has raised all kinds of concerns about the ESF and Federal Reserve holdings He is proposing fueling that in a Congressional setting--tying all the accounts to the IMF legislation and other sorts of problems here It's very much on his mind and his staff is making noises to that effect So, it's not an academic issue of what happens to our balances; it has some other political dimensions  May I just have one other word about the discussion? The problem is that the level of the balances and disposal of the balances are two separate items As we just discovered, even when we agree we have too much, it is very difficult to sell except at a time when the dollar is under very severe downward pressure If the pressure is in the other direction, upward, the other side is very concerned and the timing is not right or, as currently, we have other financing problems in other countries So, the problem of the disposal is as difficult as the issue of the level The other point that I think deserves at least to be mentioned is that there's always room for replenishment It's a two-way situation If one does dispose of a certain amount and feels one needs more, when the market situation is right there is a chance through intervention to acquire additional holdings  One final comment with regard to the method of sales and whether it's off-market or on-market On-market sales are equivalent to intervention in the broader scheme of things If you do affect the market at all, within a certain time it could be neutralized; whatever effect it has is the same But when you have off-market sales the timing has something to do with the interpretation of whether you have a target for your rate And you do influence your co-central bankers of whether you're trying to protect a rate and not have it go higher or lower And that again complicates the matter of disposal   Well, as Sam just pointed out, we are in some sense a victim of historical accident The year when we really accumulated huge amounts--$22 billion--was 1989 Without that the numbers would look very different, even if you adjusted $22 billion [down to make it comparable] to other years So, that was the year that we probably overbought   [Statement--see Appendix]   [Statement--see Appendix]   President Minehan, in addition the Treasury has been seeking opportunities in market conditions where its intervention would have a positive effect and where it might ride a rally where one was already occurring So they piggybacked on the various measures that the Japanese took with regard to external investments, and they caught the market by surprise on several occasions And that turns out to be, for the moment at least, a little more effective than just intervening randomly   They found an opportune time   [Statement--see Appendix]   It is partly that the slowdown in the first half may well be an aberration with respect to underlying trends and underlying strength in those countries The German economy felt some impact from the depreciation of the mark, which is now being partially reversed We anticipate some Japanese policy measures as well, although we have projected a very slow Japanese performance So, there is a correction for the weakness of the first half that we don't expect will continue   Don's comment about real interest rates is obviously important If other news in the market is interpreted in a way that leads to rising inflationary expectations, then long-term interest rate movements need not necessarily affect the dollar   Thank you [Statement--see Appendix]   Again, we have few details For example, with respect to the composition of the decline of more than $2 billion in imports, about one fourth is accounted for by automobiles, and automobile exports went up a little Inventory movements play a role in this sector We just do not know how that will work out Imports of industrial supplies also declined $700 million This is not a sign of economic strength Again, we are looking at very preliminary information, but eyeballing the monthly trade data from the beginning of the year, it now looks as if the large May import number may have been the outlier because it was relatively high The number we have right now for June is similar to that for most of the other months of the year, but that again is the first impression   Thank you very much On my list of things from the Federal  Reserve that I will look back to, this is one of the activities that I will miss very much
