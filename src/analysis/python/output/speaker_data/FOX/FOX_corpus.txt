 The last sentence was “Separately, the Committee indicated that it plans   in January to make a public announcement about future adjustments to its disclosure policy   and the so-called ‘bias’ statement”    One reason to include it in today’s statement was to make sure that the   market understood that there had been no change in policy today and that the changes would   be announced later    Our stance then, when we’re asked about the Committee’s decision, is to   say that we have nothing to announce, period?     May I collect the drafts?     Actually, the sentence can be modified to say that the change is   effective in the Districts noted and is effective for St Louis the next day  Maybe that   would be better     In those Districts the change is effective immediately  In St Louis,   the change is effective tomorrow     1/30-31/01 191    We usually say this when St Louis is included  I don’t have a   strong feeling about it     Let’s just take it out  If people have questions about it, we can   answer them
