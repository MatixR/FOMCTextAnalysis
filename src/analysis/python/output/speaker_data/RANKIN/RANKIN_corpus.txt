  Thank you, Mr Chairman  At our board meeting last Thursday [for] the  Fifth District, most of our directors characterized retail sales as moderately strong  Construction  of single-family housing is apparently continuing at a high level throughout the District  There  are some indications that it will pick up in multiunit construction       8/16/77 - 6 -           Their comments regarding prospects for business capital spending during the second half,  however, were less optimistic  There is little evidence of any sizable increase in outlays for new  or expanded facilities  One director stated flatly that there is simply too much uncertainty  regarding energy and regulatory policy to permit major new undertakings  And on the financial  side, while consumer mortgage lending is expanding at a healthy pace, business loan demand  was characterized as still flat  And interestingly, the president of one of our larger banks  reported that he knew of loans that were being made below prime    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Well, I’ll just briefly say we could accept the  specifications of alternative B, but in view of the July experience, we certainly would not be  concerned if growth in the aggregates came in as much as 1 or 2 percentage points below the  lower limits of the alternative B tolerance range  In other words, 0 to 6 [for M1] is fine with us    Well sir, I would not want to speak for Bob Black, but I might speak  personally  I guess it would be a tough decision, and looking at what’s occurred in the funds rate  since April, the cumulative rise, it has been up about 1-1/4 percentage points  One could be  inclined, I guess, to kind of hold steady for a while in order to get a better line on the impact of  the actions that we’ve already taken  But I would think, if evidence isn’t forthcoming within the  next 10 days or two weeks, the time to increase the discount rate had arrived     8/16/77 - 41 -             Mr Chairman, in general we think the profile of the staff's forecasts  pertaining to inflation and moderate real growth is probably correct  We're not quite as optimistic  on real GNP over the forthcoming period; we'd guess it may go as low as 2-1/2 percent  The  fixed-weight deflator we'd guess at 8 percent and the unemployment at maybe 62 percent      Mr Chairman, we are pretty much in accord with what is being  recommended around the table  We came prepared to hold to alternative B M1 at 4-1/2 to 8-1/2;  M2 at 6 to 10; and the federal funds rate range [at 7-3/4] to 8-1/4 under the specification that we  expect the Desk to move the rate up to the 8 percent midpoint at an early date
