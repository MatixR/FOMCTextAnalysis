  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  You’ll find that we’re   fairly close to the center of gravity in this discussion  Let me start with the greater New York   region in the Second District, where we see growing signs of strength, most notably in the   financial and the business investment sectors  Early results from our forthcoming December   Empire Survey—I don’t think “Empire” refers to the imperial New York Fed—[laughter] show   widespread improvement in business conditions  A rising proportion of firms—higher than the   already high number in November—reported increases in employment and in the workweek    Notably, the December survey shows strong expectations for higher prices paid and received six   months ahead    The Securities Industry Association, as you may have read, projects that bonuses will be   up 20 percent from a year ago  The leaders of the financial community in New York generally   express growing confidence in the strength of the recovery, though they cite varying degrees of   concern about strategic or terrorism risk, about the caution induced by legal and corporate   governance accounting uncertainties, about the nation’s external imbalance, its fiscal deficit   trajectory, and about what one might call a modest erosion in the credibility premium that the   US financial system in some sense has enjoyed     For the US economy as a whole, we are encouraged by the breadth of the strength in   recent data and by signs, of course, that policy works  With consumer spending recently strong,   the initial signs of growth in employment, the strong response in capital spending, and low levels   of inventories, we feel more confident that the foundations have been laid for a sustained   expansion  Our forecast shows somewhat less confidence in the strength of consumption and in   the pace of employment growth than does the Greenbook, and we show a modestly higher   December 9, 2003 68 of 133    negative contribution from the external sector  But overall, we think the evidence supports the   view that the economy is growing at a reasonably healthy pace and will do so over the forecast   period at a strong enough level to begin to absorb the available slack   These factors and the initial signs regarding prices suggest a more balanced inflation   outlook  The extent of the remaining slack in the economy, the slow pace at which we expect it   to be absorbed, and the strength of productivity growth all suggest little basis for concern that   inflation will rise appreciably in the coming year  Yet the dollar’s decline, the run-up in   commodity prices, and the rise in some measures of inflation expectations suggest that the risk of   further declines in key price series has diminished     It’s important to note that we face a fair degree of uncertainty over many of the key   elements of this recovery  Consumption may decelerate more than we anticipate, as the force of   tax changes and monetary stimulus fade  The strength of underlying growth may surprise us still   and with that may come more modest job growth  The confidence necessary to sustain strong   business investment could still falter  Growth in Europe and Japan still looks very slow, even if   the downside risks have diminished  Emerging Asia is, of course, very strong, and there are   better numbers across most emerging markets  But many emerging economies remain very   vulnerable, with very large balance sheet exposures, weak institutions, and political systems very   open to populist pressure     The scale of dollar reserve accumulation and the exchange rate regimes that support that   demand for dollars seem unlikely to be sustained indefinitely  The combination of the sheer   magnitude of our external imbalance and the size of the gap in potential growth between the US   and other major economies will leave us exposed to considerable risk in financial markets, with   potential cliffs for the dollar and a sharper rise in interest rates  These risks and the troubling   December 9, 2003 69 of 133    fiscal trajectory mean that monetary policy will carry a greater burden for sustaining confidence   in US financial assets  The extent of the decline in credit spreads and the magnitude of   opportunities for the development of leveraged positions combined with the large scale of the   mortgage-backed market mean that we have to be attentive to the risks that will come from a   sustained period of low rates and to the forces that will be unleashed as its end approaches  This   requires careful attention, though it’s not clear what that really means for the policy judgments   ahead   On balance, we see the prospect of stronger real growth and a higher underlying rate of   potential growth, and we have greater confidence about a more benign inflation outlook  We’re   approaching a point at which we need to consider how to move to a more neutral, less   accommodating, policy stance  We will have time and perhaps reason to begin that discussion in   the New Year, probably sooner than we had thought would be necessary  I’ll wait for the   discussion on policy and our press statement to address those interesting questions  Thank you     I’m comfortable with both the policy recommendation and the   statement as crafted  I think the statement you’ve proposed is better than the alternatives  In my   view we’re at a point where it’s appropriate to dial back a bit the forward-looking signal we’re   sending  You’re proposing to do it in four different ways, and I think each of those is justified   and helpful  People say that there’s something of a paradox about policy and interest rates in   that, by the time we feel the need to talk about an exit strategy, it may be too late  I don’t think   one can make the case that we’re at that point yet, and I believe your recommended approach   gives us a little more flexibility as we confront the more difficult choices we’re going to face in   the first two quarters of next year     Let me just make a complicating observation, which is   that I’m not quite sure what we think we mean when we say we’re in favor of “gradual   evolution”  Many of you who have spoken today of gradual evolution have somewhat different   views about the future statement in terms of what the third paragraph should be  So I was just   going to ask this complicating question of you, Governor Ferguson  What does greater   flexibility in assessing the risks mean in terms of which direction you want to see flexibility?     Yes  I’m happy to associate myself with that   consensus     Coming new to this discussion, I have been more   moved by the arguments in favor of accelerating the release of the minutes than I am troubled by   the arguments against  But the arguments against are proliferating, and those arguments are   significant  Some of them I hadn’t thought through, and I believe they’re worth thinking about   carefully  My general sense is that we should try to get ourselves more comfortable than we are   now as a group with moving toward early release  Whatever ways we can get ourselves more   comfortable are worth investing in  I would offer the qualification, just to amplify what Don   said, that I doubt a dry run is going to tell us much about what’s really material to the choice   here  It won’t tell us anything about the market dynamics  It won’t tell us anything about how   the decision will affect the dynamics of the discussion  It won’t tell us anything about how hard   it is to get a consensus on the minutes if the differences of view become consequential  My   sense is that we should think through these two specific questions of whether it complicates an   intermeeting decision or reduces our discretion on intermeeting action  And we should explore a   bit Bill Poole’s question about whether there are discussions we would have in this room—on   subjects such as a major financial system issue—that we would not want to mention publicly    within six weeks much less three weeks or two weeks  I think those matters are worth exploring,   frankly, before we take this next step of going into a dry run  But just to end where I began, I   think it’s worth trying to see if we can get ourselves more comfortable with moving in this   direction because I suspect the returns are worth it     Why don’t we ask the barons of this place to explore a   bit some of these technical questions that haven’t been explored in detail in the paper?  Why   don’t we ask them to do that, and come back to us before we go through the mechanics of   launching a dry run?  I suggest that because I think those issues are more important, frankly, than   what we’re going to learn in a dry run       I have only the weakest of convictions on this issue  I   think Mike Moskow’s point is a very interesting one  If there are sensible changes that we could   all embrace in how we present these forecasts but we’re all against or uncomfortable with   elevating their importance, it may be a mistake to contemplate sensible changes  I have a   somewhat more open mind to the merits of thinking about some sensible changes even if we’re   going to retain the current relatively limited role of the forecasts in our thinking  So I’d say   those minor adjustments are worth thinking through a bit more  But I see no great benefit in   substantially raising the profile or the contribution of the forecasts—nor the time we invest in   them—as a guide to policy going forward  It may not be worth going through this, but I don’t   think there’s a case for increasing their frequency, and I don’t know how I come out on the   merits of separating them from the testimony itself  So I offer those weak convictions     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Developments in the   Second District seem to be tracking those in the nation as a whole  We are strong where the   national economy is strong  The Empire survey shows very high levels of business confidence,   orders, shipments, and most things we measure, but the slope of the increase has flattened    Employment is still soft, perhaps a bit softer than it has been nationally  In our neighborhood,   however, inflation seems to be running somewhat ahead of the national numbers, and our survey   shows further increases in prices received and paid as well as higher expectations for both six   months out     Developments in the national economy since our last meeting support growing comfort in   the outlook  The expansion seems more broad-based, with strength continuing in household   January 27-28, 2004 150 of 238    spending and housing, and capital spending growing at reasonably rapid rates  Exports are   performing well, consumer and business confidence are at quite high levels, and business caution   has receded  The increased confidence in the sustainability of the expansion seems justified    Although we have a somewhat softer outlook for growth than the central tendency of the   forecasts around this table, we share the general expectation that the payroll number should   begin to show more rapid growth  The fall in claims, increasing part-time employment, and   surveys of enterprise plans support this view  With demand growth strong, it would be   surprising if we did not see more-rapid growth in hiring  Inflation, of course, is still very low  It   is hard to find evidence yet of a change to the trajectory of a gradual downward drift in the rate   of increase in core inflation    Looking outside the United States, demand looks stronger and the news is generally   encouraging  Still, the major economies are growing at rates substantially short of the US pace   Policy in Europe and Japan may be getting better, but it doesn’t look too impressive when judged   against the scale of the structural challenges  Fundamentals in emerging-market economies have   improved, although perhaps not to the extent implied by the very low spreads to Treasuries  The   broad consensus in favor of open trade policies seems more fragile these days despite the   strength and breadth of the global recovery    Overall, we believe that the US economy is likely to continue to expand at a pace   somewhat above our estimate of potential growth and will do so for the next several quarters    We believe that the range of uncertainty around this outlook has narrowed, but the probability of   a stronger outcome may now exceed that of a weaker outcome, and this is a good thing  We   expect inflation to stay low  There is some chance that inflation will decelerate further in the   near term, but we can afford to be less worried about this risk given the apparent strength in   January 27-28, 2004 151 of 238    demand  We now face a rising, if still small, probability that inflation will find its floor and   begin to move modestly higher  The critical question, of course, is whether this will happen   even if the apparent slack in the economy is absorbed only gradually   This is a reasonably encouraging outlook, but it is probably healthy to acknowledge the   sources of uncertainty and risk  The sources of uncertainty and risk are not new, but they are   compelling still  The apparent strength of productivity growth supports the view that the   microeconomic fundamentals of the US economy are exceptionally strong relative both to its   recent path and to the performance of other major economies  There is a lot, though, that we do   not know about these dynamics and what they mean for employment and inflation, given our   forecast for growth, and what in turn the implications of these dynamics are and how soon it will   be appropriate for us to adjust policy  Caution here argues for giving ourselves more flexibility   than our statement now provides, with a possibility that we may need to move sooner than we   had thought and than the market now expects    The scale of the broader imbalances in the economy—the low level of private savings,   the substantial deterioration of the structural fiscal position, and the size of the external   imbalance—remains a source of considerable risk  Even if the long-run sustainable level of US   growth is higher than conventionally thought, the factors necessary to bring these imbalances   down to more comfortable levels are not now in place, and they do not appear to be in prospect    The fact that the dollar decline has been so benign should not be too reassuring, given the forces   at work to slow it and to support official foreign demand for US fixed-income assets and given   the extent of the further adjustment in the dollar that may still be required  These risks don’t   alter the balance for monetary policy now, but they may suggest that we need to be more   January 27-28, 2004 152 of 238    attentive to the downside of giving the markets too much confidence that policy will remain on   hold indefinitely   And finally, of course, financial conditions are now very accommodative  Asset markets,   credit spreads, risk premiums, and measures of volatility have all moved a long way toward a   very benign view of the world  These factors make the fundamentals look better than they   probably are  They make us more vulnerable to the buildup of distortions in financial markets   that can only be unwound with some drama  They amplify the force provided by our already   exceptionally accommodative policy stance  This merits attention, and at the margin it probably   also reinforces the case for recalibrating our signal a bit to position us more comfortably to deal   with the possibility that we may see a case for moving policy before the end of the year  This is   not a call to arms or a call to action  This is meant just to be a case—to borrow yesterday’s   formulation—for a gentle, gradual evolution [laughter] in how we frame the forward-looking   signal in our statement  Thank you     So do I     The third sentence in the second paragraph, which is   the sentence about labor markets, now reads in the proposed text  “Although new hiring   remained subdued, other indicators show an improvement in the labor market”  I was just going   to suggest that we replace “show” with “suggest”   SPEAKER(?)  Yes, that’s a good idea     January 27-28, 2004 188 of 238      Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll do this briskly    Economic developments in the Second District remain quite favorable  Business and consumer   confidence have weakened some, employment has fallen a bit, and in our Empire State survey   the forward-looking six-months-ahead expectations show somewhat diminished optimism, but   the numbers are still reasonably strong  Manufacturers report stronger pressure on input prices,   with particular concern in steel and energy, as many of you have said  Perhaps more   significantly, they are reporting higher prices received and expectations of more pricing power   ahead   The parts of the New York business and financial community with national and global   businesses continue to report a reasonably positive view of the outlook  They are a bit more   March 16, 2004 61 of 107    cautious than they have been, less because of concern about actual diminished growth in demand   or profits than because of uncertainty about the sustainability of the expansion if employment   growth fails to strengthen, the implications of the political calendar on the economic policy   debate, and renewed concerns about terrorism risks  Greater confidence in productivity growth   is not leaving people with as warm a feeling about the future as one might think is justified     In our view, the basic elements of the expansion appear to be on the same path as they   did at our last meeting  With powerful support from the forces of monetary policy,   accommodative financial conditions generally, and the structural acceleration of productivity   growth, we expect the economy to continue to expand at a reasonably healthy pace for the next   few quarters  Consumer spending may moderate a bit, but real income growth should continue   to support expenditures at a comfortable rate  We expect investment to continue to strengthen at   a quite rapid rate, supported by confidence in demand growth, competitive pressures to upgrade,   ample profit margins, and very favorable financial conditions  We’ve moved our forecast up a   bit, but we are somewhat lower in terms of GDP growth for 2004 and 2005 than is the   Greenbook  The main differences are in the expected path of consumption and a larger negative   contribution from net exports  We see consumer expenditures slowing somewhat because we   anticipate a gradual rise in the private saving rate—we are more optimistic about virtue  We are   less positive about impetus from asset prices, inflation, and interest rates  We also see   productivity growth staying at a more elevated level longer and falling less than does the Board’s   staff, and as a result we expect more-moderate employment growth  On balance, though, we   share the staff view that growth will continue at a level somewhat above what we consider to be   trend or potential   March 16, 2004 62 of 107    In our judgment, the core inflation numbers are likely to remain low, but we may now   have reached the point where the rate of increase will stop falling  Unit labor costs should start   to rise modestly as productivity growth moderates, but the increases should be quite modest for a   while  We suspect that the surveys on pricing pressure and a growing ability to pass on those   price increases mean something in terms of a diminished probability of further falls in inflation   On balance, we see the risks to this outlook for growth and inflation as quite close to   symmetric  Relative to our last meeting, the chances of a substantial upside surprise on output   growth seem diminished  And until we see employment growth strengthen and unit labor costs   turn, there will continue to be some chance of a further decline in core consumer price inflation    Even if—or when, I should say—those conditions materialize, we consider it unlikely that   inflation will accelerate over the forecast period to a range above our comfort level   So on this basis, we see monetary policy as appropriately calibrated to these conditions,   and we believe that could prove to be the case for some time  However, the Committee’s   success in convincing markets that it will be patient is contributing to conditions in financial   markets that could cause us and the macroeconomy—and even Don Kohn—[laughter] some   discomfort  I think we should be uncomfortable now with the extent to which expectations of   the turn in the fed funds rate have receded  With the overall risks close to balance, we have less   need for and face more risk in a communication signal that is still interpreted as designed to hold   interest rate expectations down well beyond the immediate policy horizon This is not an   encouragement that we act now to dial back that signal  But we need to consider thinking about   doing it soon, if only to increase our future room for maneuver  Thank you     Mr Chairman, I’m comfortable with your   recommendation both on policy and on the statement  I think it’s true that the anecdotal   information on prices is worse since our last meeting  But the numbers haven’t moved  And our   statement already reads that the risks on inflation are quite close to balance  “Almost equal” is   quite close  [Laughter]  On that basis, I’m comfortable with the suggestions you proposed     Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The balance of risks has   changed since our last meeting, and the changes seem largely favorable  The outlook for growth   seems stronger, with less downside risk  Inflation risks appear more balanced around a higher but   still quite moderate path   The economy of the Second District has continued to improve  The pace of the expansion   has increased  Where we were weaker earlier in the year, we are now stronger  There is less   caution in the commentary  Employment is increasing quite rapidly, and businesses report plans to   increase hiring further in the months ahead  We hear, as do others, lots of reports about skills   mismatches and difficulty in filling positions  Inflation in our region is higher than the national   average—about double—despite what seem to be higher levels of resource slack and a later onset of   recovery  Much of the rise in prices is due to housing, but business contacts in the District report   higher input prices and a greater ability to pass on these costs, on goods at least   For the nation, we continue to expect the economy to expand at a rate of roughly 4½ percent   this year even if monetary policy follows the path now reflected in market interest rates  The   fundamentals of an improving labor market, moderate compensation growth, and high reported   confidence levels seem likely to support a reasonably strong pace of growth in consumer spending    Investment spending seems likely to continue its rapid recent pace, supported by greater confidence   in demand growth, strong profit margins, and favorable financial positions  In contrast to the   picture at some points over the last few months, it’s hard to find evidence of actual or incipient   softness in demand  Although we forecast continued strong productivity growth, we expect the   pace to moderate and employment to expand at a rate somewhat above estimates of the underlying   rate of growth in the workforce  Overall, we continue to support a balanced risk assessment on   growth, with a path only moderately above what we consider to be potential     May 4, 2004 52 of 112       The inflation outlook has changed more significantly  The acceleration in inflation suggests   a more broad-based shift than simply the transitory effects of large changes in a few components of   the index  Surveys of establishments show a more generalized increase in the ability to pass on cost   increases  Unit labor costs seem likely to have shifted into positive territory in the first quarter—a   significant swing, even if the overall rate of increase seems only modestly positive  The TIPS   spreads show a significant rise in inflation expectations over the medium term and a very modest   rise—one could even say by some measures a small decline—over the longer term  These   developments do not, in our view, portend a significant risk of sustained acceleration in inflation in   the near term to levels inconsistent with our objective of price stability  We still believe that the size   of profit margins, the degree of slack remaining in the labor market, the fading effect of the decline   of the dollar, the recent surge in commodity and energy prices, and the pressures of competition will   work to contain the degree of acceleration in core consumer prices   Our forecast is for the core PCE to increase roughly 1½ percent in 2004  We are less   confident in that forecast, however, given the uncertainty we face about the path of productivity   growth, the size of the output gap, and the relationship between output and inflation in this   environment of transition  These developments alter the monetary policy calculation We need to   be more attentive now to the risk that a sustained increase in prices could materialize at an earlier   point than had seemed likely, and we can afford, of course, to be less concerned with the risk of an   unwelcome fall in the rate of inflation  The risks of being late compared with the risks of moving   too early are now more symmetric  We need to adjust our statement accordingly, to position us to   be ready to act soon if the numbers confirm the recent trend toward stronger employment growth   The financial markets seem to reflect a high degree of confidence in our capacity to contain   the risks of a significant acceleration of inflation  The stability in long-term expectations that seems   May 4, 2004 53 of 112       to be reflected in the term structure, however, can’t be separated from the substantial degree of   monetary policy tightening now priced in over the next twelve months  This is a sign of credibility    On balance, I think we should welcome the degree to which markets have pulled forward their   expectations of the timing of the first increase in rates  Thank you     I was going to give a less ringing endorsement by   characterizing the proposal as better than the known alternatives  [Laughter]  Essentially what   we’re debating is whether a statement with this ending is too soft, too reassuring about the future   May 4, 2004 90 of 112       path of the fed funds rate  I believe that’s the right question to debate  But I think it’s important to   recognize that this wording gives us the flexibility to move in June, if necessary  Although our risk   assessment is balanced, this statement has an overt asymmetric bias, whichever way one looks at it    As Roger just said, the last sentence is qualified in at least four different ways  It says “at this   juncture”; it is conditioned on certain fundamentals; it says “likely”; and the word “measured” itself   must have a range of possible interpretations  Now, it’s difficult to defend the statement both as not   constraining and helpful as a signal, but maybe that’s its virtue [Laughter]  So I’m comfortable with   it, and I support the recommendation     I have a question for Karen and Joe  Karen, do you   want to hazard a view on whether the probability of a benign adjustment exceeds that of a malign   disorderly adjustment?      So in a sense, you think we control the risk?      I want to come back to scenario 1 in your exhibit 5, in   which you have the dollar falling 30 percent in a year  Certainly an outright cliff of that   magnitude in a year—     In two quarters  And you assume that comes with no   increase in risk premiums on other US financial assets  I’m asking how realistic is that?      So you’ve drawn no particular policy implications in   terms of things we could do to mitigate the risk of an adverse outcome beyond what we would do   anyway, such as try to keep monetary policy credible, inflation expectations low, and rediscover   fiscal virtue  Another question is, Does it matter at all what happens to exchange rate policies in   greater Asia?      I know it’s about time to end this discussion, but I   have one more question  Does it matter what happens to the projected foreign share of the US   Treasury market under a scenario where our external imbalance is substantially larger—maybe   getting larger than the increase in the net borrowing requirement of the government?  Is there a   point at which you would worry about the implications of these lines going on indefinitely, with   a growing foreign share of the outstanding stock of US risk-free assets?     You assume that the preference would change?     You assume that their preference would change as   their share increased?     This goes to thirty years     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Developments since our last   meeting support a reasonable degree of confidence in the strength of the expansion and somewhat   more concern about the outlook for inflation  The economy of the Second District seems to have   strengthened further  Employment is growing very rapidly, and retail sales have been strong even in   the face of the softer national numbers  Our survey of manufacturers shows persistently strong   readings, with even more optimism six months out  Credit demand seems to be growing  Core   inflation in the region has fallen off a bit but remains well above the national average  The   anecdotal story in the District suggests a continued ability to pass on cost increases and growing   pressure to raise compensation to attract and retain workers with the requisite skills   At the national level, we think the fundamentals support continued strength in demand   growth at a comfortable, if somewhat softer, rate  High levels of reported consumer confidence,   strong income growth, and more-rapid gains in employment should support reasonably healthy   growth in consumption  Investment seems likely to have ample reason and room to continue to   grow at a rapid rate, with corporate balance sheets strong, profit margins strong, inventories low,   and orders running high  We think foreign demand looks pretty positive, too, but not strong enough   to avoid a significant negative contribution from net exports this year and next   June 29-30, 2004 122 of 203          On the assumption that monetary policy roughly tracks the present path of market   expectations, we project GDP growth of about 4½ percent in real terms this year and somewhat   under 4 percent in ’05  We see the risks to this path as balanced, with the principal downside risks   coming from the strategic realm rather than the economic—strategic in terms of a terrorist event or   a major oil supply shock  On the economic side, the principal risks seem likely to come from a   more substantial slowdown in household spending, a sharp reduction in near-term or expected   productivity growth, or a sharp decline in the willingness of nonresidents to acquire US financial   assets   We are somewhat more concerned about the inflation outlook  We have now seen   significant acceleration in underlying inflation to a level somewhat above our range of comfort  We   face some risk that a modest increase in inflation expectations—even after the recent moderation of   those expectations—will feed through to higher compensation growth  The extent of the swing in   unit labor costs, the various indications of supplier delays despite high reported capacity numbers,   and the persistent reports of pricing power all suggest a pattern of inflation dynamics that is hard to   reconcile with the degree of slack we thought we had perceived in the economy   So we have raised our inflation forecast for core PCE a bit to 1¾ percent for ’04, with a   somewhat lower rate in ’05  It stays below 2 percent in part because we still assume a reasonably   substantial monetary policy response that is effective in containing expectations, in part because we   believe oil and commodity prices will start to bring down the headline numbers, and in part because   we still think productivity growth is going to be reasonably high  All those factors, combined with   high profit margins, strong competitive pressures, and an expected gradual pace in the absorption of   remaining slack in the labor market, work to contain inflation going forward  But we think the risks   to that forecast may be somewhat to the upside  Or if we want to say the risks are balanced, we   June 29-30, 2004 123 of 203          think they are balanced around a higher path for underlying inflation and a higher bulge in the near   term     The uncertainty in the outlook reinforces the case for underscoring our commitment to do   what is necessary to contain the risks to our objective of price stability  The costs of being   perceived as too complacent about underlying inflation probably are now greater to us than the   alternative  Now that we’ve reached the point where we need to begin to move to a more neutral   fed funds rate, we take some comfort from the fact that financial markets seem reasonably well   prepared for the beginning of this transition  The things we can measure as well as the anecdotal   reports from a broad range of financial intermediaries suggest, as the Board staff now concludes,   that the anticipated change in the fed funds rate will not cause a lot of collateral damage or be   accompanied by a lot of volatility amplifying position adjustments and hedging  But there’s a lot   we cannot measure and cannot know about how the world will react to the initiation of what will   have to be a substantial increase in the fed funds rate over time, after a very long period of low rates,   and we’re likely to encounter some surprises even if they are not systemic in their magnitude   We are reasonably comfortable with the extent of the tightening that is now priced in, and   we are pleased with how responsive those expectations have been both to the stronger data and the   higher inflation numbers  However, the path of expectations still suggests a reasonably high degree   of confidence that we will move in only 25 basis point increments  I don’t think we can be fully   confident that we can afford that gentle a path  Our signal should aim to qualify further the   qualifications we have gradually introduced over the past few meetings and to emphasize that we   will act as necessary to keep expected inflation low  We don’t need to try to induce a significantly   steeper path for the fed funds rate right now, but it probably would be helpful if the market built in a   June 29-30, 2004 124 of 203          somewhat greater expectation that we could move in larger increments this year if circumstances   warranted  Thank you     On this same subject though, Vincent, isn’t it true that   the distribution, derived from options, about the expectations for the fed funds path doesn’t appear   August 10, 2004 8 of 103          to have narrowed substantially?  There’s still a fairly broad distribution in expectations, a fair   amount of uncertainty still priced in around the path  I don’t think it’s true, just looking at how   that’s changed over the past nine months or so, that the band of uncertainty is narrower     No, that has not changed  I’m just talking about   whatever concerns some people here may have about market participants displaying excessive   reassurance  If market participants feel reassured, it hasn’t produced substantially more confidence   around that band  I think that, combined with the fact that expectations are moving around in   response to the data is, again, good countervailing—     For the national economy, the underlying pace of growth   seems to have moderated since our last meeting, as have inflation risks  On the assumption that   monetary policy follows roughly the path now priced into markets, we foresee a somewhat softer   path for the expansion than we had in June, with growth moving back to a pace modestly above   potential— perhaps under 4 percent—for the balance of ’04 and for ’05 and the core PCE staying   just under 2 percent  We view the risks as roughly balanced around this trajectory but with a bit   more uncertainty and caution about the growth outlook and somewhat more comfort with the   inflation outlook   We are broadly comfortable with the Greenbook forecast  Relative to that forecast and with   a slightly steeper path to monetary policy, we expect somewhat less growth in consumption than the   Greenbook, somewhat stronger productivity growth, somewhat weaker employment growth, and   somewhat less moderation in the core PCE, but these differences are relatively small  We believe   the fundamentals of the expansion remain favorable even if the breadth of the recent deceleration in   spending is somewhat troubling  The productivity numbers seem to be holding up quite well    Income growth is reasonably strong  Corporate balance sheets, profit margins, and cash flow are   very strong  These factors combined with reasonably good confidence numbers among consumers   and establishments suggest that growth should move back to a level somewhat above potential  Our   August 10, 2004 43 of 103          forthcoming Empire survey, for what it’s worth, shows a significant moderation in the overall   outlook—a greater moderation than we’ve seen in the national surveys of business confidence  But   the overall numbers are still at a level that suggests continued expansion, and the six-months-ahead   numbers we look at fell by much less than those relating to the present    The risks to this outlook lie principally in the possibility of a shock that causes a very large   sustained further rise in energy prices, a substantial terrorist event in the United States, or some   abrupt change in the willingness of nonresidents to acquire US assets  But even without those   events, we could still see a new wave of caution induced by the threat of their occurrence, by   concern that demand may stay soft and employment growth remain weak and erratic, or by a further   rise in the saving rate  In a sense, our forecast requires a modest leap of faith that households and   enterprises will look through this latest softness and the increased uncertainty   On inflation, with monetary policy moving back to neutrality, we’re reasonably confident   that the core PCE will stay just below 2 percent  The recent moderation in the data helps support   this view, but we haven’t had that much confirmation of a downward trend yet  This follows what   had been a sustained large, unanticipated, and still-not-well-understood rise of underlying inflation   that should give us a bit of humility as we go forward  If monetary policy were not to continue to   adjust toward a more neutral position, then we would face the risk that the elevation in near-term   inflation expectations would feed through to a higher rate of underlying inflation  Back to our   Empire survey for a moment, it may be worth noting that the respondents report some moderation in   cost pressures and pricing power and a more substantial reduction in expected pricing power six   months out    I think it is encouraging that market expectations about the path of the fed funds rate are   proving so responsive to the data and that, despite concerns that we’ve provided too much assurance   August 10, 2004 44 of 103          about that path, there’s a fair amount of uncertainty reflected in those prices in terms of how far and   how fast we will move  I think it is hard to argue with the path now priced in  Or to put it   differently, given the thicker fog surrounding the near-term outlook, I don’t think we know enough   to want to use our statement today to try to induce a change to that path either by steepening or   softening it  Nor should we do anything to alter the presumption that now exists that we’ll be   moving toward neutrality at an appropriate pace and that the pace of that adjustment will depend on   the data and what they do to our forecast  Thank you     I’m comfortable with the statement and with your   recommendation  I just want to raise a question about your “no surprises” rule  That’s not quite the   way you framed it  I’m a little uncomfortable being in a regime where we never surprise—     No, no, I’m not trying to say that you did     Well, with that qualification, I’m fine  I just say this   because we’re in a situation where the market is now pricing in moves of somewhat less than   25 basis points a meeting for the next two quarters, but we want to make sure that we have the   capacity to move at that pace, if not faster, without creating the risk of adverse surprise  We have   the tension of that  Maybe the data will save us from that problem because the markets may react to   the data by pricing in a somewhat steeper path than is priced in now  But we shouldn’t be in a   position, if on the eve of the next meeting we have a somewhat greater distribution of views about   the outcome for that meeting and there has been some fundamental change in our forecast, where   we’re constrained to move another 25 basis points  So I just offer that slight qualification on an   extreme version of the no-surprise doctrine  I support your recommendation     Of course, I have no objection to a study  But I think   Vincent has it right when he says that the implications of the regime you are proposing, which as   I understand it is for the Desk to pre-commit to some amount of reserves that it is going to add   independent of—     When Karen did her June paper, I asked her if she was   going to recommend Plaza Two—that the paper was just the stalking-horse for recommending   Plaza Two  But I think it’s hard to conceive of a strategy that we could manage—you weren’t   suggesting this, but let me just say it—where to deal with the risks in our presumptively   unsustainable external position, we would induce a run on our currency and induce a broad-  based run on US financial assets     Yes  I think the lesson of those various periods is just   how hard it is—once the expectation is created that as a matter of policy we’re going to try to   induce a substantial decline in the value of our currency—to contain it or to slow it and manage   it  And yet if we could immaculately induce the rest of the world to revalue against us in some   gradual way, we’d do it if we could  That would be rather nice       Or the G-10     Karen, am I correct in remembering that one of the   things your June paper showed is how little an ambitious fiscal consolidation plan buys us in   terms of an improvement in the external position?     With the exception of the deterioration in the external   imbalance, our view of the outlook has not changed significantly since the last meeting  The   inflation news seems better  The growth news seems somewhat reassuring but not exciting    There do not appear to us to be any compelling signs at this stage of a deeper and more   protracted deceleration in growth that might raise concern about the sustainability of the   expansion   September 21, 2004 56 of 100          Relative to the tone around the room, I’d put myself at a slightly more optimistic point on   the continuum  On the expectation that we will continue to move monetary policy toward a   more neutral stance at a pace that matches present market expectations, we expect the economy   to grow at the pretty solid rate of around 4 percent in real terms for the balance of this year and   at a pace of just over 3½ percent in ’05 and ’06  And we see core PCE staying close to a range   of 1 to 1½ percent during that period   The fundamentals of the staff forecast remain as they have been  There is reasonably   steady improvement in the labor market, with healthy growth in compensation supporting   consumer confidence and consumption  Productivity growth reverts only gradually to the still-  impressive average of the ’90s surge  Global demand growth remains quite broad-based—at   close to potential—though not strong enough to help exports provide a positive contribution to   US growth  With strong balance sheets, enterprises commit more resources to investment and   to employment growth and compensation  Unit labor costs accelerate modestly, and firms   absorb some of that increase with lower margins, as competitive pressures contain pricing   power  We see the probability of a higher or lower trajectory to this outlook of 3½ to 4 percent   real growth and 1½ to 2 percent on the core PCE as roughly balanced for both growth and   inflation, though perhaps we should be uncomfortable on how moderate and benign this outlook   looks     This leaves us with slightly lower growth than the Greenbook and slightly higher   inflation, but those differences are not particularly large  The main differences in our views   involve the path of monetary policy and its consequences  The Board’s staff sees a considerably   more gradual move upward in the fed funds rate, with the consequence that the real fed funds   rate stays low relative to most measures of neutral or equilibrium for a longer time, without   September 21, 2004 57 of 100          inducing much in terms of a surge in growth above potential or in terms of accelerating inflation    In this sense, Janet raises the right question  I think she has the right answer   To us the greatest sources of uncertainty involve the issues of whether households decide   to save more of their income, whether enterprises show less tentativeness in spending, and   whether the process of arresting and reversing the deterioration in our external imbalance will be   traumatic or benign  Higher household saving, of course, would be a rational response to a   number of forces, including an increase in debt with interest rates rising, the prospects of lower   future returns on housing, the expectation that individuals will bear more of the burden of rising   health care costs and more of the risk in accumulating a viable pension benefit going forward,   and the prospects of higher taxes over the medium term   We don’t have a good explanation for the degree of tentativeness among US businesses   that remains  Perhaps it will fade  Businesses nationally are showing somewhat less confidence   in the strength and sustainability of this expansion than we seem to think is justified  The virtue   in this, of course, is that they’ve gotten themselves less overextended  Our Empire survey, for   what it’s worth, shows a significant recovery in September in sentiment about present and   prospective business conditions and almost every other indicator that we asked our survey   respondents about  Hopefully this portends good things for the nation   The deterioration in our forecast for the external imbalance puts us in very uncomfortable   territory, more vulnerable to a shock to confidence  The fact that the dollar has been broadly   stable and long-term rates have fallen in the context of the large upward revision to the expected   path of the current account deficit may suggest that the risks in this area have diminished, but I   suspect that is not the case  And just because a problem has no apparent solution does not mean   it’s not a problem  [Laughter]   September 21, 2004 58 of 100          I think we should be quite comfortable with the path of the fed funds rate now priced into   the markets; and we should be pleased with how responsive the slope of that path has been to   changes in the data  My view is that we should seek to leave that path unchanged in our signal   today  We don’t see evidence of upside risks at this point that would justify inducing a steeper   path  And absent a major change in our confidence about the strength of future demand, I think   we should be careful not to induce expectations of a more gradual tightening until we have   established a more definitively positive real fed funds rate and have moved closer to the range   that defines neutrality  Thank you     I support the recommendation     Yes, I was going to stay on this subject  It’s always a   pleasure to echo Don   I don’t know that I fully internalize Fed doctrine on imbalances and exchange rate policy   and things like that, but let me just say something from the perspective of my previous life  I   always had the sense sitting there in my position at the Treasury that US policymakers should   November 10, 2004 10 of 107    always be careful not to convey the sense that they actually know the desirable direction for the   dollar and that they should not in any way suggest that they were going to try to induce that move  I   think that’s true in general, but it’s much more important when we’re talking about a prospective   decline  Once established, the sense that a decline is desirable is very hard to reverse, and it makes   it very hard to manage the risk of a more acute decline causing broader collateral damage to asset   prices   So I just wanted to make the obvious point  Even if we’re very careful and even if we   allude only very generally and indirectly to our concern about the size of the imbalances and their   unsustainability—and that an adjustment in relative prices likely has to come as part of the   unwinding—I think our musings in public will make it harder for the Administration to discipline   its own ranks, which is always a formidable challenge   Let me also echo the conclusion of the committee of two  I thought the analysis was nicely   framed and did a good job of looking at the alternatives  And those alternatives met that critical   test, which was to illustrate why they were not particularly compelling against the regime in which   we operate now     Could I ask Karen a question?     Karen, I have a question on whether we’re seeing a   change in emerging Asia in exchange rate policies and practices  I’m curious about whether you   think there’s a common factor behind it in the following sense  Do we see across these countries a   significant change in underlying inflation that has caused them to decide that they want more   independence in monetary policy?  Or are we seeing something that is more idiosyncratic, with   different sets of forces at work?     David, maybe I misperceived this, but your model   seemed to have trouble generating a high inflation outcome  What is it that produces a “high   inflation” scenario with almost no material increase in inflation?  The difference in the monetary   policy assumption that underpins that scenario is not that large  So is there some failure of   imagination in the forecast that we could correct for?     We feel reasonably comfortable about the national   outlook  Anecdotal reports continue to convey a sense of tentativeness about the strength of   demand growth going forward, but the national numbers have been pretty solid  The surveys seem   to us to show some softening in expectations about the pace of expansion in the period immediately   ahead, but this still looks like a modest decline from reasonably high levels  On inflation, the   anecdotal reports still reflect concern about rising costs even beyond energy, despite the substantial   deceleration in the price indexes we’ve seen  On balance, to us the economy appears to have been   quite resilient in the face of the sustained rise in oil prices, terrorist concerns, election uncertainty, et   cetera  Our forecast for real GDP growth is between 3½ and 4 percent for 2005 and 2006, with   core PCE in the neighborhood of 15 percent on the assumption that monetary policy follows a path   of further measured tightening  We continue to see the risks as roughly balanced around this   forecast  Relative to the Greenbook, we are slightly less positive on growth, but the difference is all   due to net exports  Our quarterly pattern in the next two quarters is a bit different, but if you   average the two, we also show some deceleration   We have a bit less confidence that the now-prevailing equilibrium rate of interest is as low   as many believe, nor are we confident that we should at this stage plan to lean against the range of   potential headwinds out there—a higher household saving rate, fiscal contraction over a longer   November 10, 2004 53 of 107    period of time, negative net exports, sustained business caution, et cetera  By keeping the fed funds   rate lower than in the range of more conventional views on equilibrium for a longer period, the   Greenbook path is significantly lower than the market path  So we assume a different path for   monetary policy, one closer to that now priced into markets   In broad terms, we still see a moderate expansion in employment and in hours supporting   pretty healthy compensation growth and some deceleration of consumption expenditures    Businesses still seem to have the means and the justification for continuing quite strong rates of   growth in investment  Growth outside the United States has moderated some but appears to be on a   path around estimates of potential  For what it’s worth, the governors in Basel this weekend   seemed to share a fairly positive view of the strength of the expansion globally  As ECB President   Trichet put it, the world economy is somewhat less dynamic but still dynamic   Back to the United States, we see productivity growth slowing somewhat before returning   to what we hope is the medium-term trend of around 2½ percent  The associated rise in unit labor   costs in the interim is largely absorbed in shrinking profit margins, as competition holds down   pricing power  With output growth close to potential, inflation in our view should stay contained   even as the gap narrows     We’re pretty comfortable with this view, but we should recognize that it’s an exceptionally   benign view of underlying inflation, and there are risks in the other direction  We don’t know that   much about the size of the remaining gap or the likely path of productivity  We may face more   dollar depreciation, and it’s possible that pass-through may increase as foreign margins decline    The energy price pass-through could also surprise us; it could prove higher than we expect given   the size and persistence of the recent shock and the persistence expected in futures markets  Core   finished goods in the PPI, as we know, are still showing fairly high rates of increase  Some models   of inflation—time series models—show more-elevated rates of increase and a higher probability of   November 10, 2004 54 of 107    increases above our comfort range  Inflation expectations at the one-year and up to the five-year   horizon have moved up again materially—though, of course, some of that is just the response to   inflation in the pipeline from recent energy price increases   We face the same familiar risks to the outlook, which I won’t go through  The dollar’s   resumed decline has so far come without significant negative effects on risk premiums on other   financial assets in the United States or, I think, significant apparent damage to confidence in   Europe, Japan, and the other economies that have let their currencies move up against the dollar  I   think it’s very good to see some modest flexibility arising in many emerging Asian currencies, even   though China has yet to move  Perhaps this offers some comfort about the prospects for a benign   deflation of the US imbalance, but the magnitudes of these changes in relative growth rates and   exchange rates obviously aren’t large enough to make much difference now  We live, therefore,   with the vulnerability—of an indeterminate but growing probability—of a substantial change in the   terms on which nonresidents are willing to finance us  The world’s savers may still be somewhat   underinvested in foreign assets in general, but they seem to be quite concentrated in US assets    Our productivity growth premium doesn’t seem that high relative to the plausible estimates of the   dollar decline ahead  We have focused here so far primarily on scenarios that anticipate a very   benign adjustment process that’s basically positive on net for the United States and not that   damaging for the rest of the world  Perhaps it makes sense for us to think a bit more about those   scenarios that come with a lot more collateral damage   I think that we should leave our signal largely intact as we move today  The language of   qualified optimism we’ve used to describe the near-term outlook seems about right  I don’t see a   strong case for trying to convey more confidence or more concern at this stage  I think it’s a good   thing for us that the market is now pricing in a greater than 50 percent probability of a move in   December  In my view, we should seek to leave unchanged the market’s expectation of the path of   November 10, 2004 55 of 107    the fed funds rate going forward  We don’t know enough now to justify trying to talk them into a   different view in either direction   Now, on the questions of when to pause, how to transition to a slower pace of increases, and   the slope of the funds rate path going forward, we’re obviously approaching a more complicated set   of judgments  For now I think we want to continue to convey the sense that we plan to move   further over the course of this year toward a more positive real fed funds rate, though of course at a   pace that adjusts with changes to our evolving forecast   I would not be that comfortable with a presumption of a flat fed funds rate for most of 2005   or with that as the presumptive path from which we would deviate only in the event of a very   positive shock to growth or a negative upward surprise in inflation  I’d be more comfortable in a   world where we keep the presumption of a positive slope for the course of 2005  We can move in   either direction from that path depending on how events unfold  I think we would have to have a   fair amount of confidence that we are in the midst of a few quarters of significantly below-trend   growth to justify pushing expectations in the market down toward a flatter path  I’d rather take the   risk in the approach that’s now priced into the market than the risk that the fed funds rate would get   stuck too low for too long and thus face greater risk of inducing unanticipated changes in the rate in   the future  Thank you     I support your recommendations  I wish I knew what I   thought about the desired statement!  [Laughter]  I would just point out not only that the market   now expects us to slow the pace of increase significantly from what we’ve been doing but also that   the minutes from our last meeting have some nice artful language near the end—which is probably   November 10, 2004 90 of 107    relevant to some of the concerns many of you expressed—saying that the market has not   misinterpreted us as signaling a steady reflexive march up at 25 basis points per meeting  I think   the minutes are helpful against that risk of being misinterpreted, and I look forward to a discussion   about the future structure of the statement in December and beyond   SPEAKER(?)  You may be the only one!  [Laughter]     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’m overwhelmed, as   always, by the intelligence and imagination of the staff, [laughter] and I don’t have too much to add    Our view of the outlook hasn’t changed much since our last meeting, and we’re very close to the   Greenbook on most dimensions of the forecast  The sentiment in New York seems to have become   December 14, 2004 42 of 118           a bit more positive over the last few months  Our forthcoming Empire survey for December has   very strong readings and shows a very substantial improvement in most measures—orders,   shipments, employment, and general conditions   Nationally, we see more momentum in demand growth going into the new year  The main   fundamentals of an expansion at slightly above trend growth seem intact  Global demand growth is   a little softer but still pretty good  Our forecast for real GDP growth remains between 3½ and   4 percent for ’05 and ’06, with core PCE in the neighborhood of 1½ percent, with a path for   monetary policy close to that now reflected in the market  We see the risks as roughly balanced   around this forecast, with a bit less downside risk to growth and somewhat greater probability of a   higher inflation outcome than we thought a few months ago   We’re at least one quarter and perhaps two quarters now into a different constellation of   factors affecting inflation fundamentals  productivity growth slowing significantly, unit labor costs   rising at a rate perhaps slightly above that of core PCE, and margins starting to come in a bit  Even   allowing for the normal fog that surrounds these judgments, this constellation of factors seems   likely to continue over at least part of the forecast period  This transition comes on top of an   environment with significant other cost pressures in the pipeline, a declining dollar, a smaller output   gap—with the gap perhaps now within the margin of error—and demand growth, as I said, slightly   above trend    Inflation expectations are sticking at a level somewhat above what we consider comfortable   or consistent with our implicit inflation target, even though they have come off a bit since our last   meeting  So in this context, I think the overall stance of monetary policy should continue to be   directed at moving the real fed funds rate higher, with a significant positive slope to the path of the   fed funds rate for the forecast period  I don’t see a compelling reason to seek to alter the market’s   December 14, 2004 43 of 118           expectations today for the near-term path of the funds rate  This suggests a signal today that is   neutral to present market expectations, which I think implies very little change to the structure or   content of our statement   Now, would leaving market expectations unchanged today risk leaving the stance of   monetary policy too tight and jeopardize the expansion?  I think that seems unlikely  Might we end   up having to move further and faster in ’05 than is now priced into the futures path?  Possibly  On   balance, I think the probability that we will end up moving along a path that is slightly steeper than   is now priced in seems to exceed the probability that we’d move on a path that is softer than what is   now priced in  But we don’t face that choice today  I think the best way of avoiding a more   damaging adjustment to balance sheets or a more damaging adjustment to the overall economy, as   we move on this path to equilibrium, is to continue to make sure we move far enough fast enough   that we don’t raise the risk that we end up having to catch up and move more abruptly in response to   a rise in expectations  Thank you     Oh, no!  [Laughter]     I support your recommendation     I support early release  We don’t have to do this, but I   think it’s the sensible thing to do, and I think it’s the sensible time to do it  I can’t improve on the   arguments made in favor of it by Don, Gary, and Ben  I would say, Bill, that the argument you led   off with is sort of an argument for extending the delay and taking release of the minutes out of the   time frame when they would be viewed as having any signal value for the future stance of monetary   policy  You weren’t advocating that, but I think it’s awkward to suggest that we should release the   minutes outside the time period of the meeting to which they relate  In my view it’s better to take   the risk of some noise added to the signal by releasing the minutes between meetings, closer to the   relevant meeting, than to have the risk that the release comes after a new policy decision has been   made and thus creates broad confusion about how to interpret the minutes in that context  Generally   I think early release will add more perspective to our views about the outlook for inflation and   output growth and will provide more context to the range of views across the Committee    Therefore, I believe it will give people a better sense of the factors shaping our decision, and in that   sense, I think it would be helpful     Mr Chairman, just one more question or suggestion for   Vincent  Maybe you’ve already considered this  When you release the minutes for the first time,   you might want to consider adding some of the Secretariat’s clarifying information about the   conventions in the language—an explanation of some of the terminology  I don’t know if you were   intending to do that, but I think it would be helpful      And the hierarchy of the language around the terms   “majority” and “several” and so forth might be helpful, too   December 14, 2004 102 of 118            Thank you I think anybody who looks at US monetary   policy today and in the recent past would have to be impressed with what this Committee has   achieved And I can’t really imagine any other regime under which I’d rather live and have to make   policy There are two aspects of our current regime that give me some discomfort  One is that I’m a   little troubled by the concern that exists, not just around this table but more broadly, that there is an   undesirable degree of ambiguity in our communications to the public regarding our objective for and   our definition of price stability  I am uncomfortable with the extent to which the people who   actually think about and make policy believe there is some ambiguity in how we define our price-  stability objective The other piece of our regime that gives me a little discomfort is how we think   about the forecast and how we explain at each meeting the basis for our decision   I think it is worth investing time and effort in thinking through those two attributes of our   regime—which are the two things that in my view distinguish us from most other credible central   banks in serious countries—in terms of whether we can do somewhat better than we do now and   how to do that And I, for one, would prefer to invest time thinking this through while this Chairman   sits in that chair than I would deferring further consideration of these questions until some more   remote time in the future   I do think that the issue on the table, even though it’s presented in a very qualified soft form,   would amount to a change in the regime  I don’t really think one can think about the merits—and in   my view most of you addressed the merits appropriately—without a change in regime  To me this   would be—just to invoke an awkward metaphor—a regime change of choice, not a regime change   of necessity And, as in the case of war, those are the kinds of decisions that we should make   cautiously and only after considering very carefully the full implications of the change and how we   would live within and operate in that regime  And I don’t believe we’re in a position at the moment           February 1-2, 2005 56 of 177  to make that kind of judgment about a regime change, despite the fact that there’s a fair degree of   consensus around the Committee on many of the questions that were raised   I am uncomfortable with any change that would require us to seek the consent or explicit   approval of the Administration or the Congress, even if it didn’t require a change in legislation  My   gut feeling is that there are huge risks for us in that process and that it would be damaging to our   credibility and damaging to the independence of this institution  So I would take that step with great   reluctance   I would also want to consider very carefully the implications of this change in regime for   how we communicate about monetary policy, and I do not believe that our communication policy, as   it now stands, is up to that challenge We would have to adjust our communications in some way,   and I think it would take a lot of careful work to decide how we should talk about monetary policy in   this new world We should discuss fully the attributes of the communications process we would use   in connection with this change before we actually do it   I would want to be very comfortable that there is a very strong consensus—it may require   unanimity—of the Committee about all of the important attributes of this basic regime and what they   mean  On all the questions raised by Vincent I think we’d want to have a very high degree of   consensus Before we launch a new approach, we’d want to know that we agree on what is a   credible or optimal way to proceed  I’m not sure we know what that is  But if there is an optimal   way to do this, I’d want to know that the consensus is going to be close to that before I moved   The questions that have been raised—how we talk about the time horizon, how we resolve   the debate about zone versus point, how we think about where to set the upper end of the zone if it is   a zone, and what our tolerance is for deviations from the upper or the lower end of the zone for long   periods of time—are the sort of questions that we have to think through carefully and about which   we need a fair degree of comfort that we have a common understanding of what our answers mean   for monetary policy before we launch a new regime           February 1-2, 2005 57 of 177  Let me just end with a somewhat awkward point, which relates to the succession process    We are going to have a new Chairman in the not-too-distant future  Even if there were unanimity   around this table that we should go this route, I don’t think it is a decision we should make at this   time  I do not believe it would be fair to the Chairman’s successor to bequeath to him or her this   change in regime  I say that in part because it’s appropriate deference to the successor, but also   because operating within this regime—which I think is the equivalent of a soft, flexible, inflation   targeting regime—may be difficult to do  It will put a much greater burden on communication  The   challenges of how to explain monetary policy in this context will increase  Let’s ask ourselves   whether we would be taking a step that would be beneficial to the Chairman’s successor in forcing   that person to operate at the beginning with a much greater burden of communication  In that   context, I think moving forward at this time may not actually help the credibility of monetary policy   and may hurt it  I think it would be a challenge that would test the competence of any plausible   successor, and it would take a fair amount of time for anybody to be comfortable operating in that   regime   So, I’m in a slightly awkward position, in the sense that I think there is a lot of merit in   exploring an evolution in the US monetary policy regime and our communication regime around   these two dimensions which now distinguish us from other models out there  I think the arguments   in favor of moving in this direction are reasonably compelling and have a lot of merit  But I don’t   believe that it would be prudent to move in that direction now, without a much more careful and   thoughtful deliberation So I would encourage us to use the next six months, year, or perhaps   eighteen months to think through the implications of living within a regime like the one being   considered, rather than put this in a little box and come back to it a decade from now, which is in   some sense what we’ve done since 1996  Thank you, Mr Chairman    We haven’t changed our view of the national outlook   significantly since the last meeting  Our forecast is quite close to the Greenbook in all components,   and quite close, I think, to the central tendency of the rest of your forecasts I don’t have anything   material to report about the economy of the Second District that I think has relevance to the national   outlook   On the assumption that monetary policy follows a path close to that now priced into markets,   we expect growth to be above potential over the forecast period, at slightly above 3½ percent, with   core PCE inflation staying around 1½ percent We think the distribution of probabilities around that   forecast is roughly balanced, and we have somewhat more confidence in our forecast this time than   we did at the last FOMC meeting  At the margin, we see less downside risk to the growth forecast   than we have over the past few meetings    The resilience of the expansion in the face of recent shocks, the breadth of underlying   strength in the main components of GDP except net exports, the fundamental sources that seem   likely to underpin a continuation of recently strong consumer spending and investment, the survey-  based measures of consumer and business confidence, the anecdotal reports of somewhat diminished   business caution, and the moderate pace of the expansion so far all seem to add to the arguments in   favor of a forecast for solid growth slightly above trend                     February 1-2, 2005 111 of 177  There is some talk among people who run major global corporations in New York about   fragility remaining in the outlook, about a world of lower growth and higher volatility, about more   lurches in the outlook for economic activity and asset prices  But I think the overall tone is a bit   more positive; it has become progressively more positive over the last few months   On the inflation outlook, we face diminished risk of a significant decline in inflation from   current levels and somewhat higher risk of some acceleration of inflation from these moderate   levels, although the recent news, of course, has been reassuring As productivity growth slows,   resource utilization increases, and unit labor costs accelerate, we lose some of the cushion that has   supported what has been a very benign performance of inflation recently  Profit margins are   substantial enough to absorb significant acceleration in labor costs and other costs, but firms seem to   be reporting increasing pricing power still With the markets apparently confident that we will   continue to move the fed funds rate closer to equilibrium—whatever that is—we’ve been successful   in keeping inflation expectations stable at relatively low levels   This forecast, of course, looks implausibly benign  It’s hard to imagine that the path of the   economy between now and the end of 2006 will materialize as the consensus not just around this   table but among private forecasts seems to envision  The confidence around this view, which is   evident in low credit spreads—low risk premia generally—and low expected volatility, leaves one, I   think, somewhat uneasy  The general reduction in fear and uncertainty that now prevails has the   effect of making everything look better  But, of, course it also may increase our vulnerability to   some adverse shock and could magnify the effects of some types of shocks   The greatest risk to the forecast, I believe, involves this combination of very low risk premia   with our large growing external imbalance, uncertainty about the prospects for a meaningful   improvement in the fiscal baseline, and uncertainty about the sustainability of high structural   productivity growth Together, these factors increase the probability of some unwelcome surprise—   some unwelcome shock to asset prices which, of course, could feed into a substantial slowdown in   consumer spending                       February 1-2, 2005 112 of 177  Obviously, it would not make sense for us to use our monetary policy signal to reintroduce   more cautious risk premia and greater uncertainty  But we probably need to be careful over time, to   the extent that it is possible, to avoid doing things that reinforce an unhealthy degree of confidence   in the future path of the fed funds rate or leave that path less responsive to changes in the data and   the outlook   Monetary policy should, in my view, continue to be directed at moving the fed funds rate   higher toward a level more comfortably in the range of equilibrium and at convincing markets that   we will continue to move the funds rate higher at a pace determined by our evolving view of the   outlook—that is, sufficiently fast to keep inflation expectations stable at low levels  I don’t know   whether that path will end up being steeper or softer than what is now priced into markets  As we   move today, I think the signal in our statement should try to be neutral to the expectations now   prevailing about the near-term path of monetary policy  Thank you    Vincent, in exhibit 2, this is a measure of the point on the   calendar where the market expects us to stop?    Again, I’m sorry to ask this; I should know the answer    But are you projecting forward the range of estimated equilibrium real rates?    That they move sideways?  Does that make sense?    Wouldn’t that significantly alter the path in the upper   panels if that were true?                              February 1-2, 2005 127 of 177   Should we infer from your presentation that you would   not change the structure of this paragraph until we reach the point where the probability of a move   up equals the probability of a move down?  Would you say that the point at which the desirable path   of the fed funds rate is flat is the optimal time for evolution or would it be ahead of that point?    You’d say that would be an obvious intermediate change    I have one more question  Should one also infer from   your presentation that you think the optimal path of monetary policy in the period ahead is to get   behind us all the moves necessary to get the funds rate closer to the midpoint of the range of its   equilibrium?  Are you saying that we should steadily get those moves done, so we get more quickly   to the point where one could expect a flatter path going forward, or are you not suggesting that?    And yet if you repeat that language in the minutes again,   as you suggested, reasonable people might interpret that as a conscious decision to try to signal in                    February 1-2, 2005 130 of 177  some sense that a pause is approaching  That’s a little awkward to justify, given that we’re in a   period of time where I think the probability the market is attributing to the next three moves is higher   than it has been over the last six to nine months    I support your recommendation    So moved    Karen, could you give us a fair and balanced view—   [laughter]—of the significance of the changes to the Stability and Growth Pact?  On net, are they   really that bad?  The market didn’t seem terribly worried about what they mean for fiscal policy   going forward There were some aspects of the revised agreement that might be regarded as a   tightening, which I don’t really understand What is your assessment?    But they didn’t accommodate greater cyclical   divergence on their path    It really is accommodating structural changes that go   in the wrong direction to the objectives even if those changes otherwise make some sense    PAYGO does not apply  [Laughter]    I have no humor in my statement and nothing that differs   from the consensus    Careful [Laughter]  The near-term outlook appears more   favorable to us, as it does to everybody else We have moved up our forecast to reflect stronger­  than-anticipated underlying growth and somewhat greater price pressure  On the expectation that   we will move the fed funds rate up at the somewhat steeper path now priced in the market, we now   expect real GDP to grow at a roughly 4 percent pace in real terms this year before moderating to   around 3½ in 2006 And with this tighter monetary policy assumption, we expect core PCE to come   in a bit above 1½ percent but not above 2 percent   As this implies, we are very close to the Greenbook on the broad outlines of the story and   quite close in the components, too  We have a bit more investment and less consumption and a little   higher net export drag this year We have productivity growth a bit stronger but compensation                             March 22, 2005 54 of 116  growth and unit labor costs a bit softer But overall we have a very similar view to the staff forecast   on the broad forces supporting the expansion And we are quite comfortable, as a result, with the   case this story presents for tightening policy further and for signaling more tightening to come   We see the risks as roughly balanced around this slightly higher path for growth and   inflation If there’s a case for asymmetry or less balance in our uncertainty, it seems more likely to   be on the upside than on the downside The rise in the two- to five-year inflation expectations in   TIPS, in the face of what is otherwise reasonably encouraging news on inflation fundamentals, bears   careful monitoring  We now face a lower probability that the core PCE will come in at 1½ percent   rather than above, and this itself suggests a higher path for the nominal fed funds rate   The anecdotal stories seem to have improved alongside the strengthening of private   forecasts Our Empire State Survey shows greater confidence—greater optimism about the next six   months—than we’ve seen in some time  I think we should be relatively comfortable, therefore, with   both the direction and magnitude of the change since our last meeting in market expectations   regarding the likely path of the fed funds rate I would be somewhat more comfortable if the market   were pricing in a somewhat higher probability of a 50 basis point move at some point in the near   term  I say this not because I think we can make the case now that we will need to move by 50 basis   points any time soon but simply because we need to make sure that we have the flexibility to do so   One of the consequences of the structure of our statements these days, at least until very   recently, is that the markets have responded to stronger data or more inflation risks by raising the   probability of another 25 basis point increase beyond the next meeting or two, but not by pricing in   any significant probability of a steeper slope than 25 per meeting  This has contributed to a   remarkable reduction in uncertainty about monetary policy expectations, which in turn has   reinforced other factors that have worked to bring about this broad pattern now evident of lower risk                             March 22, 2005 55 of 116  premia across financial markets  Part of this is due to fundamentals, but part seems due to our   monetary policy signal     At the margin, this implied ceiling on the slope of the path toward equilibrium raises the   possibility that we will be perceived at some point as taking some risk of getting behind inflation   expectations Buying some insurance against this prospective small cloud on our credibility is   prudent risk management  This argues for adjusting our statement to condition or qualify   “measured,” and for doing so ahead of when we might be forced to  This makes sense even if we   don’t want to significantly steepen the implied path at this point  Buying this flexibility now may   entail some modest steepening in the path, but some risk in that direction is worth it  The additional   benefit in gradually exiting from the “measured pace” language as we approach equilibrium, of   course, is that it will prepare the ground for a flatter path when that proves appropriate   Greater confidence in the sustainability of the main forces driving the expansion suggests   that the greatest risks to the forecast, apart from some shock, still lie in the imbalances we face in our   economy  Those imbalances are evident in the combination of the sustained rise in household debt,   the projected increase in public debt, and the deterioration in our net international position This   probably argues for trying to get the real fed funds rate up to a more positive level than might   otherwise have seemed appropriate  That will help provide more traction—or at least some traction,   since we don’t see much traction yet—to the process of adjustment, allowing the forces of gravity to   contribute to a more gradual unwinding of these internal and external imbalances and reducing some   of the risk in the forecast A more contractionary fiscal policy stance would make this less   necessary, but this does not now seem in prospect  Thank you    I think there’s a disadvantage in validating the market’s   current expectations so explicitly There are two ways to think about framing our policy assumption   or giving a signal One is to say, “with policy unchanged, et cetera” The other is to say, “taking the   expected path now priced in the markets, we think X”  That’s an approach a number of central   banks have taken   To me it doesn’t make sense to make that significant a change in our basic signal at this time;   I think there’s a lot of risk in a validation that explicit  In my view, there’s actually a lot of virtue in   the combination of these changes to the statement, because they condition and qualify “measured”   without taking that word out So it’s a move in the direction of giving us more flexibility without   claiming we think there’s been any abrupt change in the balance of risks  As Vincent said, we can   fall back on making explicit what has been implicit—which is that the risks have been balanced only   if we commit to do the right thing  If you don’t believe we’re going to do the right thing, …    I support your recommendation to move 25 basis points,   and I support alternative B as described here Actually, I think it’s a pretty good statement,   considering the alternatives [Laughter] It does two important things in that it conveys an evolution   in our signal in two respects It acknowledges the change in the outlook in important dimensions,   and it conveys more qualification and conditions on our serenity in a way that introduces more   uncertainty I think it’s also desirable that it does so in a nice, relatively delicate way, and I believe   it’s a pretty good outcome—again, relative to the alternatives                                   March 22, 2005 100 of 116  It’s less clear to me what is going to make sense at the next meeting  Obviously, we’re   probably going to want to look at a broader range of changes to the statement, but I don’t know what   those are going to entail And I suspect there’s some risk that we’re going to find that we’re more   comfortable with a less dramatic evolution than may be implied for the statement   Let me make one comment on the minutes  There’s a risk that the minutes, if they look more   like a transcript, would suggest that we were all over the map, with a very thin consensus regarding   anything about how to craft a signal for monetary policy  To me that would not do justice to the   Committee and the discussion  I think the minutes would be best designed—I know we can’t   massage them ex ante—if they just acknowledge the reality that we want to take a look at a number   of different dimensions about the signal when we convene in May and if they convey some of our   motivation for wanting to look at that  I think that can be done without going so far as to suggest   that our views are all over the map on this and that we’re fundamentally uncomfortable    David, you referred in your remarks to the exercise   shown in the package of materials for Monday’s Board briefing  I’m looking at the pass-through   into core inflation of the rise in energy prices, import prices, and commodity prices  If back in   December ’03, which is your baseline for this exercise, you had had a forecast for energy prices,   commodity prices, import prices, and the dollar that is consistent with what happened, would you   have expected your model to show this much pass-through to core inflation prices?  Or would this   result have been surprising?    Thank you, Mr Chairman  We think the fundamentals   underpinning a forecast of a reasonably strong expansion with moderate inflation seem reasonably   persuasive However, we are less confident than we were at the last meeting  On the assumption   that we continue to move the fed funds rate higher on a path close to that now in the market, we   expect the economy to grow at a 3½ percent rate during the balance of this year and in 2006  And   we still expect core PCE inflation to come in below 2 percent, although just below, over the balance   of the forecast period, but we think it will follow a somewhat higher path  As this implies, we’re   very close to the Greenbook projection on the overall contour of the forecast, and we’re close on the   components as well   We see greater uncertainty in the forecast, with some downside risk to growth and some   upside risk to inflation We think the probability of inflation coming in higher is greater than the   probability that growth will be lower And, of course, that judgment about the change in relative   probabilities is the key to one’s judgment for monetary policy                                    May 3, 2005 56 of 116  On the growth front, the anecdotal reports we’re exposed to are weaker than they have been   They’re weaker than the national numbers and may imply some further deceleration ahead  We   don’t have much basis for confidence that these numbers tell us much about the future, but the   sentiment does seem a bit more fragile  The fact that confidence seems to have eroded so quickly in   the face of a relatively limited period of weaker numbers might itself suggest greater vulnerability to   the forecast   Despite all of this, though, we think the near-term fundamentals of the economy look fairly   good The resilience of the recent past seems likely to be durable  We think the labor market still   looks to be on a path of gradual improvement  Investment growth still seems likely to be pretty   healthy, with profit margins high, balance sheets strong, and credit conditions favorable  We think   the factors supporting solid investment growth remain compelling  And we still are inclined to   believe that structural productivity growth is likely to remain strong, which should provide both   continued impetus to investment and continued confidence about future income growth  It’s hard to   find other constraints out there that could limit the expansion  Of course, we still face some risk of   an abrupt change in household saving behavior, and the effects of that could be significant   On the inflation front, we’ve been surprised by the extent of the acceleration in core prices   and we are a bit concerned about the higher expectations reflected in some surveys  The economy is   growing at a rate that seems likely to be sufficient to continue to absorb remaining slack, unit labor   costs have moved up, and we hear continued reports of increased pricing power  And some   measures of expectations at the intermediate horizon—the horizon over which we expect monetary   policy can affect inflation—are above the desirable level of inflation  Accordingly, we see greater   risk that inflation will follow a higher path than we are comfortable with  This seems a prudent view   of the risks to us, despite the comfort we continue to derive from the fact that compensation growth                                       May 3, 2005 57 of 116  has been modest to date—profit margins remain very high, of course—and despite expectations of   fairly good future structural productivity growth   The modest widening in credit spreads and the volatility in equity prices we’ve seen recently   have been absorbed reasonably well I’d be inclined to view this modest repricing of risk and   uncertainty as welcome and healthy rather than as foreshadowing a deeper, more protracted   deceleration   On balance, we believe that monetary policy should continue to be directed at moving the   real fed funds rate higher At our last meeting we introduced a bit more uncertainty into the   monetary policy signal by putting in more qualifications about the likely path of monetary policy   going forward and about the cumulative amount of tightening  The overall effect of these changes to   our statement was to continue to signal that we think the slope of the funds rate path remains   positive, implying, of course, that monetary policy is still too accommodative  But we also   indicated, through these changes to this statement, that we have less certainty about the slope and   shape of that path   Long-term measures of inflation expectations moderated immediately following the meeting,   and some measures of uncertainty about future rates went up  And since then, market participants   have demonstrated a very significant degree of sensitivity to incoming data—at least in terms of the   fed funds path priced into the markets  To me this suggests that we got the balance about right last   time  We bought ourselves the desirable increase in flexibility to respond to a somewhat more   uncertain set of conditions going forward, and I think we should try to preserve that balance in our   signal today We need to acknowledge, of course, the moderation in the rate of growth in output   and demand we’ve seen and the higher inflation numbers, but I don’t see a good reason to try to alter   in either direction the expectations for the path of the fed funds rate going forward                                 May 3, 2005 58 of 116  The increased uncertainty in the market about the forecast reflects some greater dispersion in   the likely path of the fed funds rate, and I think it suggests little gap between the market’s view and   our own view of policy uncertainty going forward So I don’t see a case for altering the statement   significantly today in a way that would introduce a greater degree of uncertainty about monetary   policy than is already reflected in the markets at this point  Thank you    I think it makes sense for us to raise the funds rate 25   basis points, and I support alternative B Fortunately, we don’t need to decide today whether this   statement is going to make sense in its current structure in June or in August or October  We can   make the decision at those times  The only thing we need to decide today is whether we want to   alter significantly the expectations now priced in the markets for the future path of the fed funds rate    And I agree with what a number of you said—that there’s not a compelling case for doing so    The second thing one can say we need to decide is whether we want to introduce more   uncertainty or greater dispersion around the set of expectations that now exists  Again, I don’t think   there’s a compelling case for us to try to do that as a conscious act of signaling today  I think   alternative B is actually a pretty good signal for today, and I don’t actually know what is going to   make sense in June or for the structure of the statement going forward     I remember that bubble!  [Laughter]  I have two   questions My first is for John Williams or perhaps for Dave Stockton  What is the right way to   think about dealing with uncertainty in considering the policy question?  Put aside Glenn’s question   about whether you know anything ever about the relationship between prices and fundamentals at a   given point  What if what you don’t know is simply the likely path of home prices going forward?   You could take the group here around the table and assume some path, but there would be a fairly   fat band of uncertainty around that path  What does your regime imply, John, for policy in that   particular circumstance?  Do you basically ignore housing prices and look at all the other things we   look at?     And you wait and see and then adjust course based on   developments as they unfold     My second question is about policy, but not monetary   policy  Glenn, in your note, you allude to other instruments if monetary policy doesn’t seem to be   the appropriate tool to address a concern about lower value prices  What do we know about the   history of the use of the supervisory tool in past periods of concern about real estate bubbles or   imprudent lending?  Do we have a rich history on the use of those instruments that tells us   something about the efficacy or about our foresight in deploying them?     Since the bills doctrine  [Laughter]     I meant in our history  In our history, have we used that   tool to good or ill effect?  Have we used it wisely and with foresight?                                                 June 29-30, 2005 45 of 234    Is the history one of using it too late, or of using it and its   having no effect because there are other ways to get money?     So moved     Let me just follow this conversation a little further  If I   get this right, what is new in the forecast, based on this conversation today, is that you’re   anticipating a little more persistence in what we view as the underlying rate of the core PCE   deflator  And it ends the forecast period higher than we previously expected  Again, that is in the   context of a forecast where you’re expecting both oil and commodity prices—and import prices,   too, I think—not to be a source of negative pressure  They constitute a sort of positive factor on the   inflation dynamic  And you’re expecting structural productivity growth to stay fairly high  What is   interesting, I think, is that you haven’t changed your implied path for the fed funds rate   significantly  I guess my question is Why is that?  It’s not that your growth forecast has come   down and is significantly softer  It’s not as if you’re substantially more pessimistic on the outlook   for growth relative to potential  So why wouldn’t that view on inflation, if it’s right, have induced   you to prescribe a slightly higher path?                                             June 29-30, 2005 97 of 234    If I understood the Bluebook discussion of this correctly,   in that optimal control exercise, whatever its merits, with your assumption about the symmetrical   tolerance or intolerance to deviation from your objectives, still you have the nominal funds rate   going to 4 percent with an inflation objective assumption of 1½ percent in that context  And the   difference between that view and the view that you put into the Greenbook, which I realize is not a   prescription—I’m sorry I used that term—is what explains the difference between those two things?     But are you assuming a higher implicit inflation   objective in the way you think about the Greenbook construct?     I wanted to ask a different question on the international   side  Karen, on the external forecast, how much of a change is this view of where the current   account-GDP ratio goes relative to your expectation six months ago or thereabouts?  It seems to me   that it looks slightly darker    Yes, that’s my point  Where do you expect it to stabilize   now?     No What happens to the current account if you project   out a little longer than the forecast horizon you have now?     I know, but it crosses 8 percent and goes to what?                         June 29-30, 2005 99 of 234    Thank you We’re somewhat more confident in the   strength and sustainability of the expansion than we were in May  Our view is very similar to the   staff forecast We expect real GDP growth to average roughly 3½ percent over the forecast period    We expect core PCE to follow a somewhat higher path and to end the forecast period slightly higher   than we expected in May, at just under 2 percent    This forecast assumes that we’ll continue to tighten monetary policy, perhaps by a bit more   than foreseen in the staff forecast and than is currently priced into the market  To us, the risks to   this forecast seem roughly balanced  We see no new sources of potential risk  This is not to say   that the usual sources of uncertainty and the usual candidates for a negative surprise are not                                  June 29-30, 2005 138 of 234  daunting It’s worth noting, though, that these risks—from a cliff in housing prices to a sharp   increase in household saving, to a larger and more sustained oil shock, to less favorable future   productivity outcomes, to a sharp increase in risk premia or to declines in asset prices—in general   are risks that we can’t really mitigate substantially ex ante through monetary policy   However, by making sure we get the real fed funds rate up to a more comfortable level we   can help  The alternative strategy, to oversimplify it, would be to follow a softer path for monetary   policy to provide a preemptive cushion against the negative effects on employment of a fall in   housing prices, a rise in risk premia, some rise in saving and a fall in consumption, and so forth    This would, I believe, be a less prudent strategy   Although there have been persistent concerns about the vulnerability of this expansion and   about some of its less robust characteristics, the two most remarkable aspects of this recovery are   encouraging The first is its resilience  So far, each episode of incipient softness has proved to be   shallow in depth and short in duration  Despite very prolonged and substantial headwinds in the   context of an oil shock, a large ongoing drag from net exports, a significant tightening of financial   conditions, a modest withdrawal of fiscal stimulus, etc, quarterly GDP growth—as Janet said— has   shown impressive stability around a 3½ percent annual rate over the last year and a half  And this is   a dramatic reduction in realized macroeconomic volatility  It makes the much-heralded “great   moderation” look turbulent    The second positive feature of this period has been the behavior of underlying inflation and   inflation expectations  Of course, underlying inflation seems to have moved up a bit, but large   changes in oil and commodity prices and import prices have produced periods of substantial   acceleration in headline inflation without, at least to this point, causing more than short-lived   upward moves in core inflation or inflation expectations                             June 29-30, 2005 139 of 234  The behavior of productivity growth and expectations about future productivity growth   explain some of this Also important, of course, is the credibility engendered by the record of the   FOMC  Changes in the structure of the financial system must matter, too  There are almost surely   other factors—luck for one—that are at work   Among the choices in Vincent Reinhart’s note on interest rates, I’m inclined to support the   more benign assessment of the recent behavior of forward interest rates and term premia, even   though these factors can’t fully explain those moves, and even though the future may prove to be   more volatile and adverse than the markets now seem to expect and than those explanations would   imply     So what about monetary policy going forward?  There are two salient dimensions of the   forecast One, of course, is growth slightly above trend from a starting point where the remaining   amount of resource slack, if any, is substantially diminished  The other is an underlying inflation   rate—just to focus on the core PCE—that now seems to be running at a modest margin above 15   percent and that we expect will end the forecast period above 15 percent  And inflation   expectations, at the horizon over which monetary policy operates and with reasonable adjustments   to translate them into a view on the PCE deflator, are still some margin above 15 percent     We don’t consider this inflation forecast a cause for serious concern  We anticipate upward   pressures on inflation from some firming of compensation growth and from higher unit labor costs    We expect those pressures will face the countervailing forces of relatively moderate inflation   expectations, strong competitive pressures, still substantial profit margins, the potential for some   increase in the labor force participation rate, and pretty strong expected future productivity growth   And yet it should matter to us that, even in a world where the nominal fed funds rate peaks   at 4 percent, models envision a relatively extended period during which the core PCE deflator stays                                June 29-30, 2005 140 of 234  meaningfully above 15 percent  The range of estimates in the forecasts and model simulations   before us, and the expectations we can derive from the market, place the terminal rate of the   nominal fed funds rate now between 3½ and 4½ or between 3¾ and perhaps 4¼ percent  These   estimates have moved down a bit over the last few months, but the shape of the path has steepened a   bit I don’t think we really know how much confidence we can have in these estimates, even if the   forecast unfolds as we expect today  But my view remains that we are better off following a path   that would put us at the higher end of these estimates than in taking the risk of doing too little and   stopping prematurely or trying to manage the communication challenges of a temporary pause when   we still believe we have further to go  Thank you     Mr Chairman, I support your proposal to raise the fed   funds rate another 25 basis points, and I support the language in alternative B, which I believe is   accurately represented on this piece of paper  In my view, this statement is as close to neutral as we   could get relative to current expectations, and I think that’s the appropriate signal for us to deliver at   this time     So moved      As opposed to the others  [Laughter]    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Like everyone else, we think growth has   strengthened since our last meeting  We’re going into the second half with more forward   momentum, and this has been accompanied by a broad-based improvement in confidence about   the outlook We expect a stronger second half of ’05 than we did at the last meeting  But our   forecast for next year remains essentially unchanged, with real GDP growth still a bit above   potential—we think around 3½ percent—and the core PCE deflator at around 2 percent  On the   assumption that we move the fed funds rate up on the higher path now reflected in the market,                         August 9, 2005 62 of 110  the risks around this forecast seem broadly balanced to us, with perhaps a slightly greater   probability of outcomes on the higher side   As this implies, we’re very comfortable with the basic Greenbook view, the story behind   that view, and the evolution in the estimated output gap the Greenbook expects  I guess the one   qualification I’d mention is that we don’t see a strong case yet for as significant a downward   revision in our estimate of potential growth or actual growth in ’06   The fundamentals supporting consumption and investment growth still seem intact    Underlying productivity growth still seems fairly good  Real yields appear to have increased   materially, and equity prices, credit spreads, and risk premia generally suggest a pretty favorable   view of this expansion and its durability  Our various surveys of sentiment, formal and less   formal, support this more positive view of the national outlook     We think the underlying inflation rate is following a slightly higher trajectory than we   thought at the last meeting, and we think a lot of the forces at work in the economy that we have   discussed today will continue to put some upward pressure on the inflation rate going forward    But we don’t expect a significant acceleration in inflation above this 2 percent band, and that   view, of course, is consistent with the moderation in inflation expectations we’ve seen since the   start of the year However, even this relatively modest path leaves us some margin above the 1½   percent pace for the core PCE that we believe should be our objective over time  And, of course,   even this forecast of 2 percent could prove to be too benign    All of this suggests that we should try to design our monetary policy signal to achieve   three objectives  These will be familiar objectives  First, we should reinforce the sense that the   fed funds rate needs to move higher for us to achieve our price stability objective  Second, we   need to emphasize that the extent and pace of further moves will depend on how the outlook                         August 9, 2005 63 of 110  evolves We want to ensure that expectations of policy continue to be responsive to changes in   the forecast, and we want to make sure that we have the flexibility to alter the trajectory as   appropriate It’s important in this regard that we not give the market more certainty about the   future path of the fed funds rate than we can reasonably expect to have ourselves  I think we also   want to avoid conveying the sense that our task is simply to get to neutral, that we’re confident in   our estimates of what neutral is, and that we’re unlikely to need to move beyond that point  Even   if the data continue to support this very favorable forecast we all seem to share, we may find it   increasingly difficult to decide how far we’ll need to move  And, finally, given the move up   since June in the market’s expectation of the fed funds rate path, I think we should try to leave   the expected future path of the fed funds rate largely unchanged today—or perhaps a bit firmer    But I don’t see any reason now to try to induce, or to take the risk of inducing, a major shift in   current expectations Thank you    So you have the same path here for the reversion of the term premium   to its historic average as is in the Greenbook baseline?    I support your recommendation, and I agree on the   arguments made in favor of retaining the structure of paragraph four  Let me just add one   argument to those already made  Bill, if we look at your structure in terms of what we would be   changing from the June language in section four, all we’d be doing is adding the thought that   core inflation has been relatively low in recent months  So I think the net effect of that change                                     August 9, 2005 93 of 110  might be that it would come across as somewhat more reassuring than we would want  That’s   why I think the evolution in this language from the initial draft Brian circulated to the current   draft is actually good in capturing the sense of what is slightly different in the outlook  So I   think it has a slightly better balance as currently structured     So moved     Karen, do we know anything about the remaining   capacity—or perhaps I should say, the will and capacity—of those other countries that have   substantial stocks of refined products to release them to us if we had another significant supply   shock that affects refined product capacity?     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The balance of evidence   since our last meeting still supports, in our view, a reasonably positive outlook for output and   inflation If we look through, as we should, the transitory effects of Katrina and the   reconstruction, and if we factor in what the futures market tells us about the expected magnitude   and duration of the rise in energy prices, we still see an economy growing slightly above trend   with core inflation following a path somewhat, but not substantially, above our preferred range    The fundamentals still seem favorable to continued expansion with solid productivity   growth, strong corporate balance sheets, reasonable growth in household income, and favorable   financial conditions And on the strength of this view, with real interest rates still quite low, we   believe that we need to continue to tighten monetary policy at this meeting and beyond  At the   national level, Katrina seems more consequential politically than economically                         September 20, 2005 73 of 117  Now, of course, the degree and balance of uncertainty has changed  We face a higher   degree of overall uncertainty It will be harder to assess over the next few quarters the   underlying pace of demand growth  The rise of energy prices pre-Katrina—some of which   remains even as the initial effects of the hurricane on expectations have washed out of energy   markets, except for natural gas—creates some risk of a larger shock to confidence and behavior   than seems to have been evident over the last two years  Damage from future hurricanes to   energy and product output may prove harder to bridge through the release of international   product reserves Our capacity to discern the underlying rate of inflation is also somewhat   diminished, perhaps less because of the effect of energy prices than the difficulty of sorting out   what is actually happening to productivity growth and unit labor costs   Apart from reducing overall confidence around the forecasts, the balance of risks has   probably shifted, too—shifted toward a somewhat higher probability of slower growth relative to   the path of potential output and toward a greater risk of a larger and more persistent rise in core   inflation If the former risk materialized, the latter might be mitigated  These are risks across the   spectrum of scenarios, rather than the most probable combination   But to acknowledge the change in uncertainty is not to suggest that it would be   appropriate for us to stop or to push down the expected path of the nominal fed funds rate until   we can better assess what we do not know now The net effect of the changes to the outlook, on   balance, probably does not alter the desirable path of the nominal fed funds rate relative to what   we thought in mid-August  With the real rate still rather low, my inclination would be to   continue to weight the upside risk to inflation as greater than the prospective risk of a significant   slowdown in output relative to potential  As best we can tell today, that latter risk of weaker                            September 20, 2005 74 of 117  growth is still only prospective This implies that the slope of the expected fed funds rate should   remain materially positive, even if we move today  And I think we would be better off after this   meeting if the markets raised the expected path a bit than if the path were to fall from its pre-  meeting trajectory    I think we probably know a little less today than we did in August about how far we are   going to have to move, even if the economy appears to be following the path of our forecast  If   we move today, all we know is that we’re 25 basis points higher than we were  The fact that we   are that much closer to some point we can’t measure is a less valuable observation  We may   even know less today about where equilibrium lies and whether that range has moved  And, of   course, we still face some probability that we’ll have to move past it, or past what in retrospect   we thought was equilibrium   Most of the hard questions we face look pretty much like they did at the last meeting    How strong and durable can we expect the expansion to be in the face of less optimism about   future housing price gains or other factors that could cause household saving to rise and   consumption to grow more slowly?  Will this dramatic rise in energy prices over the past two   years cause more substantial damage to business and consumer confidence?  Will the world’s   private savers continue to be willing to acquire claims on the United States at the higher rate   implied by our current account forecast, and to do so on such favorable terms?  Will business   margins start to erode in a way that will portend slower investment and employment growth?    Will the US political system be able to make a credible effort in the near term to improve our   medium-term fiscal position and sustain our relatively open trade policy?  And, if not, do we risk   a reduction in expected potential growth in the future?                   September 20, 2005 75 of 117  These are all factors that could hurt future growth, but that doesn’t mean that monetary   policy should be more accommodative than would otherwise make sense in anticipation of those   negative effects or should try to preempt them  Rather, these familiar imbalances and concerns   make the cost of any erosion in our credibility greater  Thank you    I support your recommendation    Actually, I believe Colombia’s was pure local currency,   domestic, at a 10-year maturity for the first time in a long time       There’s a moral hazard in there, too, if you look at it    [Laughter]     Dino, did I hear you correctly?  What is the probability of   a move in March?     So moved      We view the balance of developments since the last   meeting as strengthening the case for further firming of monetary policy  The underlying pace of   demand growth seems reasonably strong—a bit stronger than we thought at our last meeting  The   inflation outlook to us looks largely the same as it did in September, with the expected path of core   inflation higher than we would like and some risk of further acceleration   On the assumption that we increase the fed funds rate on the higher trajectory now priced into   market expectations, our forecast is for growth to continue at a pace just above our estimates of                         November 1, 2005 62 of 114  potential in ’06—somewhere between 3 and 35 percent—and for the rate of increase in the core   PCE to stay in the vicinity of 2 percent  Of course, this has to be considered an implausibly benign   view of the world [laughter] and the expansion still faces a familiar array of risks  But we don’t see   evidence yet of a substantial slowdown in demand nor of a troubling acceleration in underlying   inflation   The balance of risks in this forecast has changed a bit  I’m a little less concerned that the   cumulative rise in energy prices will itself bring about a more substantial and extended slowdown in   growth, although that obviously has to remain a concern and possibly the principal risk to the   growth outlook We believe that the modest expected tightening of financial conditions will have   less of a dampening effect on demand growth than the Greenbook assumes  We don’t see strong   evidence yet of a significant deceleration in housing price appreciation or expectations of that   outcome in household spending behavior, although both would be desirable  The evidence of   strong stability in the growth of household consumption is, in a sense, borrowing against a future   cushion, and that perhaps raises the probability of a more adverse path to future consumption  But   it’s not here yet   As in September, the relative probabilities of alternative inflation outcomes still seem slightly   skewed to the upside, thus probably justifying more cumulative firming in monetary conditions    Core PCE has remained moderate, compensation growth modest, productivity growth strong, and   long-term inflation expectations reassuringly low  But the size of the rise in headline inflation and   the deterioration in near-term expectations creates the possibility of some further drift up in   underlying inflation if, as we expect, the labor market firms further and unit labor costs eventually   start to rise more rapidly  We’re seeing some drift upward in core inflation outside of the United   States                                          November 1, 2005 63 of 114  On balance, to us this suggests we need to make sure that the market remains confident we’ll   do enough to bring inflation and inflation expectations down over the next two years  To put it   differently, we should make sure that we take out enough insurance to avoid a more adverse   inflation outcome, and in this sense we should be pleased that the market has raised its estimate of   the terminal fed funds rate to around 4½ percent  Our statement today, I believe, should be   designed to be neutral to those expectations, rather than to raise or lower the expected path   I do think it would be helpful if the minutes reflected some discussion today about the   approaching need—the approaching need, not the need today—for some changes in the structure of   the statement We’ve been very fortunate to date in how well we have managed this transition in   monetary policy, with the market expecting a sustained period of tightening but its expectation of   the terminal fed funds rate varying with changes in the outlook   Our decision to put a soft,   qualified, conditional ceiling on the fed funds rate path at 25 basis points a meeting has not cost us   to date any erosion in long-term credibility, though it probably has encouraged the market’s   investors to take more duration risk  The remarkable stability in quarterly GDP growth and in core   inflation we’ve seen has tended to reinforce expectations about the outlook for monetary policy,   adding an unusual degree of certainty about the likely path of the fed funds rate     This has to change  As we become less certain about the path ahead, that increase in   uncertainty needs to get built into market expectations  The question is when and how we alter our   statement to reflect this  So far, the dominant strategy before us has been to keep moving 25 basis   points, to signal that we will continue to do so, and to defer any major changes to the structure of the   statement until we are confident we have made our last move  Now, this may turn out to be the   optimal choice, but the language feels increasingly stale  And it may be better, in fact, to change the   language before we are forced to, when we still believe we have some firming ahead of us  This                                              November 1, 2005 64 of 114  might make the transition ahead more gentle  It would give us more than one shot at recalibrating   the signal, and it might help bring the market’s uncertainty about what’s ahead more in line with our   own   There are two areas where changes in the statement seem indicated  The first is in how we   characterize the rationale for our action  There we have some room to become more explicit about   our view of the outlook relative to our objectives without going all the way to a fully articulated,   quantitative forecast The second, of course, is in the end of the statement  If the world in   December looks about how it looks now, with a high probability of one or more moves still ahead   of us, we could, for example, replace the last three sentences of the statement with two which state   our views more simply  They would state first that the outlook for growth and inflation suggests   that further monetary policy firming is likely to be necessary, and, second, that the Committee will   respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to maintain price stability so as to achieve   sustainable growth   This would get us out of some of the risks of repeating “measured” going forward  It would   help address some of the problems in using the word “accommodation” to signal tightening  And it   would eliminate the awkwardness in the superfluous balance of risk sentence we now have  This   would allow an easy evolution to a more neutral signal when that becomes appropriate—with a   simple statement that policy is now roughly appropriate but that we will act as necessary to achieve   our objectives going forward   Of course, the world may look different in December, and we have to assess then what makes   the most sense  I don’t know that we can say with confidence today that evolution in December is   ideal or necessary, but I think we need to prepare ourselves and the markets for some evolution    Thank you                                         November 1, 2005 65 of 114    I withdraw the word “stale”  [Laughter]     May I just add to that comment?  I think we need to be   careful not to telegraph in the minutes any change until we have a little more confidence about how   we want the statement to evolve  So I think the minutes can reflect the fact that we’re discussing, as   the world hopes we’re discussing, what evolution might be sensible  We’re not—     But, Mr Chairman, may I say something?     I don’t think we normally take it upon ourselves to try to   interpret the minutes for the world  We let the minutes speak for themselves, and we convey   whatever personal views we have about what we think going forward, but—     I support your recommendation to raise the fed funds rate   25 basis points and to use the language of alternative B  And I want to clarify just for the record,   given what Mike Kelley said last night, that in not rushing immediately to compliment you on the   brilliance of your proposal I’m not implying any less confidence [laughter] but actually more   confidence     We need to believe in something!  [Laughter]     So moved    Our forecast for the national outlook has not changed   substantially since the last meeting, and relative to the discussions so far, I guess we’re slightly at the   stronger end   The recent data have been encouraging both here and internationally  The underlying pace of   demand growth seems pretty good to us—good enough to raise the probability of the expansion   continuing at a pace at or slightly above trend  The inflation news has also been reassuring, though   underlying inflation is still running somewhat above what we’d like to see over time                             December 13, 2005 51 of 100  We believe these conditions justify some further tightening of monetary policy, perhaps   another 50 to 75 basis points We are, therefore, comfortable with the expectations now built into the   market  And with that monetary policy assumption, we think the risks to the forecast and to our   objectives are roughly balanced  So, relative to September and October, we see somewhat less   downside risk to growth, perhaps even some upside risk, and somewhat less upside risk to inflation    As this implies, our view is very close to the Greenbook   Let me mention a few other points  The apparent strength in productivity should make us   more comfortable about the sustainability of the expansion and a bit less concerned about the near-   term inflation risks because, of course, if the productivity growth stays stronger longer, we can be   more confident that consumer spending will stay reasonably strong even if a more substantial   slowdown in housing materializes  Scenarios in which more-moderate house price appreciation or   some decline in housing prices leads to a sizable increase in the personal saving rate are probably less   plausible or less troubling in an environment where consumers are more confident in the outlook for   the economy or more confident in their future income growth   The productivity news, combined with continued moderation in the core inflation numbers   and the moderation in measures of inflation expectations, make the inflation outlook somewhat more   favorable  But against these factors there are others that justify some continued attention  Of course,   overall inflation is still high, even though we expect it to moderate  Various measures of underlying   inflation are still above what we would be comfortable with over time  There probably is still some   energy cost pressure in the pipeline  And the TIPS-derived measures of inflation expectations over   the medium term, if you adjust for the carry effect, have not really moved down that much  With   compensation growth accelerating, we would expect eventually to see some upward pressure on labor   costs, though of course less than would be the case with lower productivity numbers  Moreover,                                   December 13, 2005 52 of 100  surveys and anecdotal reports of pricing behavior, as we read them, suggest that businesses are able to   pass on some share of their increased costs  So for these reasons, even with the additional tightening   priced into the markets, we probably face some modest upside risk to our inflation forecast and to our   objective, and we should continue to lean against this risk in what we do and what we say   We don’t see evidence yet to support a concern that the path of the nominal fed funds rate   now priced into the markets risks going too far  Housing may be slowing a bit, but not really much    Other spending indicators look strong—probably stronger than we thought—and the strength is   broader than it has been across the components of GDP  Expected real rates don’t suggest a high   degree of concern, in our view  It’s just some concern, but not acute concern about the downside risk   to future growth  If you try to take out expected inflation from forward rates, it looks as if real rates   move up over the 2- to 5-year horizon  Equity prices, credit spreads, and the implied volatility of   most asset prices don’t seem to suggest a lot of concern about significant deterioration ahead in the   pace of the expansion   Although we don’t think the narrowing of the term spread itself or the low overall level of the   yield curve offers clear guidance about monetary policy—clear guidance in terms of arguing for a   softer or firmer stance than the other fundamentals might suggest—we’re somewhat more inclined to   take the view that this change in the structure of term premia suggests we will have to do more than   otherwise would have been the case  So all of this suggests to us that we should continue to tighten   further and signal that we think we have still more to do     Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation to move 25   basis points and I support the language in alternative B  I think it’s a nice, balanced formulation, and I   do believe it’s the best way to leave expectations roughly neutral   I think we view the probability as very high that we’re going to need to move in January and   that March is maybe an even bet  That seems about right  This probably introduces a little bit more   uncertainty into the signal about monetary policy than has been the case before, but I think that’s   desirable  It’s a fairly flexible formulation and allows us to adapt reasonably easily going forward  I   agree that “may” would carry too much risk of taking out a good deal of the tightening that is now   built into the market, and, therefore, I don’t think it would be desirable   The problem with “measured,” of course, is that in our discussion there is so much dispersion   on how we interpret the implication of “measured” today that it’s a little hard to justify retaining it    Nevertheless, I’m comfortable retaining it because it has two virtues that are not necessarily                                December 13, 2005 89 of 100  inconsistent  One is that it does keep a bit of a cap on expectations about how much and how fast we   need to move, and I think that’s probably desirable now  The second implication it carries is the sense   that we may be facing two more moves rather than just one  Again, I think that’s desirable now, too;   so, on balance, it makes sense to me to keep it   Also, I just want to echo what many of you have said in that I agree that this was a pretty good   process  Committees sometimes have a bad name  We were a group of seventeen people this time   and I thought the process was quite good  I think the language got better through the evolution of this   statement, and that makes me more hopeful  Thank you     So moved     Nathan, if you look at the differences between the   Greenbook forecast of the path of the external balance and those of other forecasters, can you   summarize for us what the major sources of differences are?  Are they about the exchange rate   assumption, or are they about something else?     Mr Chairman, in the interest of crispness, I’ve removed   a substantial tribute from my remarks  [Laughter]     I’d like the record to show that I think you’re pretty   terrific, too  [Laughter]  And thinking in terms of probabilities, I think the risk that we decide in the   future that you’re even better than we think is higher than the alternative  [Laughter]   With that, the economy looks pretty good to us, perhaps a bit better than it did at the last   meeting  With the near-term monetary policy path that’s now priced into the markets, we think the   economy is likely to grow slightly above trend in ’06 and close to trend in ’07  We expect   underlying inflation to follow a path close to current levels before slowing to a rate closer to   15 percent for the core PCE sometime out there  Relative to the Greenbook, we’re a little softer on   growth in ’06 and a little stronger in ’07, but our inflation outlook is similar   The uncertainty around this forecast still seems considerable, perhaps more than the market   has priced in  On the positive side, consumer and business confidence still seems pretty high, with   January 31, 2006 55 of 106    employment growth solid and compensation growth likely to pick up  We think that household   income growth is likely to be pretty strong  Investment may be strengthening, and it could surprise   us with more strength  The tone of the anecdotal to us seems more positive, less cautious than it has   been  And just to cite our Empire survey, the six-month-ahead numbers show a fair amount of   optimism  Overall, financial conditions, of course, still seem quite supportive of continued   expansion  Global growth has strengthened  And like the staff, the market seems to have looked   through the negative surprises in the fourth-quarter numbers and priced in a bit more, rather than   less, confidence about the strength of demand growth going forward   On the darker side, we have the familiar concerns about potential adverse shocks, energy   supply disruptions, terrorism, et cetera  But even in the absence of these events, we face a fair   amount of uncertainty about key elements of the forecast  The prevailing expectation of a gradual   moderation in housing prices and a relatively small increase in the saving rate could prove too   optimistic  Private investment growth could slow further, productivity growth could disappoint, risk   premiums could rise sharply  And, of course, that could happen even in the absence of a major   deterioration in the growth or inflation outlook  But this, on balance, still leaves us with what looks   like a relatively balanced set of risks around what is still a quite favorable growth forecast   The inflation outlook still merits some concern—I think modest concern—about upside risk    Underlying inflation is still somewhat higher than we would be comfortable with over time  The   core indexes are running above levels said to define our preference over time  Other measures of   underlying inflation are running above the core rates  The behavior of inflation expectations at   longer horizons has been reassuringly stable in the face of the elevated headline numbers, but the   levels are still at the higher end of comfort  With the economy near potential, unit labor cost growth   should accelerate  And, of course, although profit margins still show ample room to absorb more   January 31, 2006 56 of 106    unit cost increases, their behavior suggests continued pricing power  The strength of global   demand, the continued rise in commodity prices, other input costs, and the latest increase in energy   prices all suggest a possibility of further upward pressure   With this outlook and this set of risks, we believe some further tightening of monetary   policy is necessary with another small move today and a signal that some further tightening is   probable  We’re comfortable with how the market’s expectations have evolved over the past few   weeks and with the present forecast of perhaps one—maybe slightly more than one—move beyond   today  It’s hard, though, to understand why the market attaches so little uncertainty to monetary   policy in the second half of the year  And this underscores the fact that one of our communication   challenges ahead is to make sure we convey enough uncertainty about our view of the outlook and   its implications for monetary policy  In this regard, I want to compliment the recent innovations to   the Bluebook presentations and hope that they persist     Let the record reflect that the Committee has thwarted   the attempt by the Chairman to change the process in a way that— [Laughter]     Mr Chairman, I, too, think that we should move by   25 today, and I’m comfortable with the language as it’s modified here  I do think that it’s important   to note that the market judges the odds of March as probable  The Greenbook assumption is more   consistent with that and, as Janet said, some of the Bluebook filters we can use to look at things are   slightly more in that direction  But having said that, I think it’s fine to leave the statement with   “may,” and I don’t really know whether the market’s reaction to that statement would take out some   of the pricing now built in or leave it where it is  It’s hard to know   January 31, 2006 71 of 106    I want to say one thing in response to Vince’s second question, although I’m not sure that   we need to spend much time on it  I think we should defer this decision until March  My own view   is that the actions the Committee takes are really not principally the changes in the fed funds rate we   announce or don’t announce at the meeting  They have a lot to do with how we characterize our   view of the path of output and inflation relative to our objectives, the risks around that, and what we   signal, if anything, about the monetary policy implications of that judgment  Having said that, I   think it is hard not to argue that the Committee needs to express a view when it votes on that basic   set of signals  I think it’s worth deferring that judgment, though, simply because we should talk   through a little more what it really means for our process and how we’re going to manage the   preparation and the discussion in a world where we’re more explicitly deciding what we’re going to   vote on  So my compliments to Vince for framing it the way he did, and I suggest we defer the   vote     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Like all of you, we think the   underlying trajectory of demand and inflation seems quite favorable, perhaps a bit more so than it   did in January  We expect real GDP to grow at a rate slightly above the rate of increasing potential   in ’06 and to slow to the range of potential in ’07  We expect the core PCE to rise at a rate in the   neighborhood of 2 percent over the forecast period  Differences between our forecast and the   Greenbook’s are minor  In our forecast, we assume that inflation expectations remain anchored and   the term premium remains low and that we are now at a point where little or no resource slack is left   in the domestic economy   The monetary policy assumption we adopt is the path currently priced into the futures   markets  The major sources of uncertainty in our forecast are the size of the wealth effect we might   see accompanying any slowdown of housing, the flexibility of profit margins, and the sustainability   of this present configuration of low risk premiums  We view the risk to the growth forecast as   roughly balanced, although the usual suspects provide a source of concern  The risk to our inflation   forecast, in contrast, still seems slightly tilted to the upside     March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 68 of 167       On the growth front, as I said, we think the underlying pace of demand growth is pretty   strong, and we don’t see any signs yet that would point to evidence of a significant slowdown   relative to potential in prospect  We think productivity growth is likely to remain quite high, rising   perhaps a bit faster this year than in ’05  With the labor market growing on trend and some increase   in labor’s share of national income, we expect consumption growth to remain reasonably strong    Stronger income growth offsets the expected deceleration in housing-price appreciation and the   effect that might have on consumption  We expect a slight increase in the contribution of business   fixed investment to demand growth, due principally to a rise in spending on equipment and   software  We expect, of course, the contribution of residential investment to slow with the forecast   period  World GDP growth seems stronger and more broadly based  We expect net exports to be a   persistent drag, shaving about ½ percentage point off growth for each of the next two years   Despite this forecast of pretty strong spending growth and high levels of resource utilization,   we believe core inflation is likely to remain moderate  Under the assumption of a relatively stable   dollar and with the energy-price assumption taken from the futures curve, we expect headline   inflation to slow to a rate closer to the core over the forecast period  But this forecast rests on three   important foundations  The first is that we succeed in keeping inflation expectations reasonably   well anchored  The second is that demand growth not only does not accelerate to a rate   substantially above trend but also slows to potential over the forecast period  And the third is that   the expected rise in compensation and unit labor costs results in a rise in labor share of income—in   other words, that compensation growth accelerates but the increase is absorbed by some   compression of profit margins and does not lead to a significant acceleration in core inflation   Now, the sources of potential upside risk to the inflation forecast are several  One, of   course, comes from the interaction between our views about productivity growth, compensation,   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 69 of 167       and profit margins  If the pace of productivity growth slows significantly relative to our assumption   and if, at the same time, conditions in labor markets continue to improve, unit labor costs are then   likely to accelerate  A rise in compensation, however, would not by itself portend a troubling   increase in core inflation  The extent of this risk, as I said, depends on the degree to which rising   unit labor costs are absorbed in shrinking profit margins rather than triggering output price increases   as firms attempt to defend existing margins  And because the labor share of income seems   somewhat low and, as historical averages suggest, there’s room for unit labor cost growth to be   absorbed in profit margins rather than causing price increases, we need to be attentive to the risk   that this process may produce a short-term increase in core inflation, perhaps also in inflation   expectations   A second potential risk comes from what we think we know about the pace of demand   relative to potential supply globally  A continued increase in commodity prices around the globe   and, more recently, some modest increase in capital goods prices may suggest that global pressures   on resource constraints are pushing up prices  This raises the risk that the recent weakness in core   goods prices in the United States may not be sustained  Service price inflation in the United States   has shown signs of slowing   Our central forecast, as I said, is conditioned on little movement in the dollar over the   forecast period, but any sizable depreciation of the dollar would still carry the risk of some   acceleration in core goods prices   For nearly two years, overall inflation, as what is measured by the PCE or the CPI would   suggest, has been running substantially above core, and this is true for a range of alternative   measures of underlying inflation  If the underlying inflation rate were closer to 15 percent than to 2   percent, we might view these potential sources of upward pressure with more equanimity    March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 70 of 167       Although the probability seems low that these forces will act to produce a significant acceleration of   core inflation or a significant deterioration in inflation expectations, we need to be careful about   those risks  So with underlying inflation at the upper end of the inferred inflation preference of the   Committee, we need to be more attentive to these risks   On the growth side, the most obvious sources of downside risk to growth are a substantial   rise in energy prices from current levels, a slowdown in productivity growth, a sharp rise in risk   premiums, and a more-adverse effect on saving and consumption from the expected adjustment in   housing markets and prices  Like the staff forecast, we think it’s reasonable to expect household   saving to rise a bit and consumption growth to slow, in part because of changing expectations about   the pace of future appreciation in the value of home equity  But we believe that, absent some large,   negative shock to perceptions about employment and earned income, the effects of the expected   cooling in housing prices are going to be modest  Of course, this view may prove optimistic  We   take some reassurance from the fact that the average growth forecast in the private sector probably   anticipates a significant cooling in housing and a significant effect of that cooling on saving and   consumption     Developments in asset prices and risk premiums over the past several months seem to   support this picture of stronger confidence in the growth and inflation outlook because real rates   seem to have risen  Equity prices and credit spreads suggest considerable confidence in the   prospect for growth  Implied volatilities remain quite low  We don’t know how much of this is   fundamental and how much will prove ephemeral  At the moment, though, overall financial   conditions seem pretty supportive of the expansion     So with this forecast of growth in the vicinity of potential, core inflation at around 2 percent,   and the risk somewhat to the upside for inflation, we think the principal responsibility of monetary   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 71 of 167       policy remains to preserve the sense that we will act to keep long-term inflation expectations   contained at levels consistent with price stability     As in many cases, I am not sure what you can take from   the anecdote, but I guess some people say that you see a little of the froth dissipating  But I don’t   think the adjustment is acute  If you see hiring at the New York Fed go up substantially in the   market, that will be a good leading indicator of housing prices reverting somewhat  [Laughter]       Dave Stockton gave us a gentle admonishment yesterday   to clarify our inflation preferences  At least that is the way I interpreted it  You can interpret it that   way or that he responded to a question by suggesting that, in the absence of that clarity, [laughter]   the staff should not be vulnerable to the criticism applied  But I wonder whether Vince or David   wanted to say a bit more about whether it actually matters in thinking about the optimal terminal   point for the fed funds rate in this tightening cycle whether we have a 15 percent objective for core   PCE inflation over time or whether that objective is at 2  If you look at the Bluebook, chart 7—I am   not sure what page that is on—     Page 19  You can get one set of answers to that  You   have not given us this time the perfect-foresight, optimal-policy-rule type of prisms to look at the   same question  But could you give us just a little sense of whether it matters now?     I want to echo Vince on the question raised by President   Pianalto  If you look at current expectations now and as the Desk survey tells us something about   the assumptions behind those expectations (though it’s not a perfect proxy for them), there’s a high   probability of a move today, a significant probability that the Committee will decide to move in   May, and little expectation of a material change in the statement and the signal  That combination   of assumptions has not led to a significant probability of additional moves beyond May  That may   not be terrifically reassuring against the risk you’ve raised  The constellation of assumptions in the   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 108 of 167       Desk survey previewed one way of judging what that risk is  But if you repeat a formulation that’s   similar to January’s, are you going to take too much risk that people add to the probability of a third   move or a second move beyond today?  I think that risk seems low, but this is essentially   unknowable     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I think we really do have a   remarkable degree of consensus around the table about the forecast, and you did a very nice job of   capturing that consensus  The consensus is really quite close to the Greenbook, closer than it has   been perhaps in recent meetings  The Greenbook forecast is conditioned on a monetary policy   assumption that has us essentially stopping at 5 with the path pretty flat from 5 on   The question, of course, for us today is whether we want to alter current market expectations   about the path of policy, and I think it is hard to find a compelling case to do so, either from what   we discussed around the table or from what the Greenbook provided  The Bluebook provided   alternative prisms to look at the implications of past policy  The presumption is that we don’t want   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 137 of 167       to change expectations substantially because we don’t see a case for changing the current stance of   monetary policy as embodied in those expectations  The question is how best to do it, and I think B   is probably the closest we’re going to get to that   I agree with the concern that Sandy began with and which I think Dino echoed—that there is   some possibility, maybe even a likelihood, that B is interpreted as raising the probability of not just   a move in May but a move beyond May  Again, I don’t see any need to do that  I don’t think it   should be our objective to try to raise the probability around June  The question really is how to   avoid that  I do think that adding the sustainable growth reference in the second row and adding   “possible,” as Vince explained, helps against that risk, but it probably doesn’t take away all of that   risk  The problem with doing things that create the risk of pushing down the curve is that people   would react to that by saying, “Well, what does that mean about how confident they are about the   strength of underlying demand growth?”  One consequence of an alternative that would be designed   to push down that curve would be, in some sense, questions raised about how confident we are in   our forecast about the underlying strength of demand growth, which I don’t think that we have a   basis for signaling at this point   Is there some risk we are going to go too far?  Of course there is  What are the best tools we   have to assess that risk?  Again, I think the Greenbook and the Bluebook give us a number of tools   to assess that risk; and if the Greenbook forecast, with a monetary policy path close to what’s priced   in the markets, showed a different trajectory of output growth and a different trajectory of inflation,   then there would be more substantial reason for us to be concerned that the path that’s roughly   priced in now creates too much risk that we would be pushing demand growth below potential over   the period  And, again, I think it is hard to say that  It has been said that the output-based policy   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 138 of 167       rules we use aren’t a particularly good reason to be concerned about that because of the way they   are constructed   Are we too hostage to the markets in our current approach?  I think that is always something   to be worried about  Again, the best check against that risk is to look at the implications of these   alternative policy paths for the forecast  I think it’s hard to find in the range of paths that the staff   has given us significant justification for concern against that risk today   So I would support moving 25 today; and for the reasons discussed, I think B does a pretty   good job of capturing the basic objective of a signal that’s fairly neutral to expectations  I’d rather   take the risk at the margin that we’re pushing it up a bit than the risk that we end up pushing it   down     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I would be comfortable   deciding now that we are going to do two-day meetings as a matter of course going forward, even   though we may not want to fill the time, in part because I think it’s important to give us time to do   special topics as many of you have said  I would generally be in favor of that  And I think we   should figure out how to reconcile our director meetings’ calendars with that     I think the idea of separating the discussion about the outlook from policy is a good thing to   do, but it’s a little awkward to have these conversations about the forecast without people actually   revealing what their conditioning policy assumption is, and it is slightly artificial to separate them   completely  So in some sense I think, as the Greenbook does, that we should all take on the   obligation in talking about our view of the forecast and the outlook to be a little more explicit about   what we think at that stage is the conditioning assumption of the policy  It doesn’t always matter a   lot, but it probably does matter   March 27-28, 2006 Authorized for Public Release 148 of 167       In a two-day meeting, it’s probably good to make sure that we have enough time on the first   day that everybody has a chance to do an initial statement  I think chopping it up as we were forced   to do today is a little suboptimal  It’s nicer to give everyone a chance to put their basic views on the   table at the beginning, and that may require, as Tom said, that we all be a little more selective in   how much we say in that initial round  It is in some ways a better basis for give-and-take once   people have been able to make their initial statement   Compliments to Dave Stockton for the evolution in the Greenbook presentations of   alternative scenarios  I think that, as Dave implied, there’s probably room for further evolution in   how the staff structures its contributions to the meetings  As we think about it and as you pointed   out, Mr Chairman, how we think about evolution in our monetary policy regime and our   communications regime, we should give some thought at this stage to what kind of supporting   material we want to have to underpin that evolution  I think that’s all I’ve got     What’s the probability that this is going to pass?     So moved     So moved     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The basic contours of our forecast   are essentially unchanged since March and are very similar to the Greenbook’s  However, the balance of   risks has changed a little in our view, somewhat to the upside on inflation  But as in March, we expect core   PCE inflation to run a little over 2 percent in ’06 and to moderate slightly below that in ’07 as tighter policy   works to slow overall demand growth  We expect real growth to rise in the vicinity of its potential rate—  3¼, 3½ percent—throughout ’07  So we are a little higher than the Greenbook in that sense   As before, this forecast rests on some important assumptions  that little or no slack is left in   resource utilization, that inflation expectations are held in check, and that term premiums remain relatively   low by historical standards  The recent moves in medium-term inflation expectations and the rise in the   other components of forward interest rates cast some doubts on these last two assumptions  For these and   other reasons, we see a little more uncertainty around our central forecast than we did in our last meeting   However, on the growth outlook, on balance the recent data seem to confirm the picture of real   GDP moderating toward potential  We face the familiar sources of risk to the downside, but not all the risks   are to the downside  We may be underestimating the momentum in final demand growth  I think it is   important to note that it is hard to find evidence in credit spreads or in equity prices of a substantial growth   slowdown in prospect   On inflation, recent developments are not all that dark, but neither have they been entirely   reassuring  Let me just go through the factors that we think are critical to the outlook on the inflation side    Almost every measure of underlying inflation that we look at is now above the level we generally associate   May 10, 2006 54 of 120    with price stability  Headline inflation has been running and is still running substantially above core, and   even with interest rates close to long-run measures of equilibrium, the staff forecast does not anticipate   much moderation in core inflation over the two-year or even three-year or four-year period  Compensation   growth does not yet appear to have accelerated significantly, and the growth of unit labor costs has   remained reassuringly moderate  However, compensation to us seems likely to strengthen, and it is unlikely   that productivity growth is going to accelerate significantly from current levels  Demand growth is still   probably running a bit above potential here and in large parts of the world economy; with real short-term   rates still quite low around the world and monetary policy only just beginning to tighten in many of those   economies, global pressure on resource utilization may intensify or at least continue at its current intensity   rather than moderate  And the rise in energy prices and commodity prices, of course, suggests a fair amount   of strength in global demand   Our assumption that energy prices follow the futures curve means that our forecast is, of course, still   vulnerable as it has been over the past three years to further upside surprises  It would be easier to discount   this risk if we could determine with confidence the extent to which temporary supply factors rather than   unrecognized or unanticipated strength in global demand have accounted for the trajectory of energy prices   over the past few years   We face a lot of uncertainty about the likely path of the dollar, and the prospect of a significantly   weaker dollar adds another source of upside risk to inflation and expected future inflation  We obviously   have some uncertainty about the extent to which margins will prove flexible in the face of higher cost   pressures   Finally, we have seen a material rise in long-term inflation expectations in the United States over   the past several months, and this should make us somewhat less confident that we can assume that the gap   between headline and core will be closed with headline moving down to core  Inflation expectations seem   May 10, 2006 55 of 120    to have risen more here than in other countries, and the recent changes in the relationship between changes   in short-term expectations about US monetary policy and changes in breakeven inflation rates is somewhat   disconcerting, with expectations deteriorating when statements by Committee members were interpreted as   lowering the probability of moves beyond our meeting today  This pattern is more troubling than the size   of the rise in medium-term inflation expectations  And I just want to make one comment in response to   something Janet said  Even if we could tell with confidence how much of this rise in breakeven inflation   was about uncertainty or inflation risk premiums and how much was actually about future expectations   about inflation and even if we thought a substantial amount of that was uncertainty, it is not clear that that   would be particularly reassuring in terms of credibility or in terms of its implications for monetary policy    So underlying inflation is less contained than we would like it to be, and it is expected to moderate less than   we might hope  Both short-term and long-term measures of expectations have moved up uncomfortably,   and we see somewhat greater upside risk to our inflation forecast than we did in March   Now, what might we learn over the next six weeks that would change our view about the outlook   and its implications for monetary policy?  We actually think it is unlikely that data are going to provide us   with very strong signals that policy is markedly off track, but there are two important things to watch  One   is the behavior of long-term inflation expectations  If those expectations were to continue to rise, that   would obviously be a source of concern; and if inflation expectations were not responsive to changes in   expectations about the path of the funds rate, that would also be troubling  On the data front, we at least   will want to watch to see if the expected moderation in manufacturing activity in the United States   materializes  If, in contrast, manufacturing activity here sustains its recent pace, it might suggest that   growth abroad has picked up more than we thought or that the dollar is having a bigger effect in stimulating   exports than we anticipated  These conditions would increase concern about upside risks to our central   May 10, 2006 56 of 120    forecast because, of course, that forecast relies on a slowdown in overall domestic demand growth   mitigating upward pressure on inflation over the forecast period   Just a few points to end on the topic of uncertainty  Even though the fundamental news is pretty   positive and reassuring, we are now at the point where the limits of our knowledge about the underlying   forces that affect the outlook for aggregate demand, supply, and inflation matter more than they have in the   recent past  Relatively small differences, differences well within the limits of our knowledge about trend   growth and productivity or employment or other factors, have more impact on our choices about monetary   policy in the near term than they would have had over the past two years     What should we conclude from the substantial rise in real forward rates that we have seen over the   past few months?  This move, which has occurred across the major economies, brings expected real rates   more in line with long-term averages, reducing, if not eliminating, the anomalistic line we had such trouble   understanding  Now, does this mean we have less to do in terms of future tightening than we thought?    Maybe  Or it might mean that monetary policy has been more stimulative than we thought and that we will   have to do more to make up for that going forward  The fact that we cannot fully explain why these   measures of expected real rates have moved around as much as they have just adds to the uncertainty we   face today about how tight policy actually is  It is also a bit of a puzzle that measures of uncertainty about   future interest rates have not increased very much, and I do think it is important that we try to continue   encouraging—it is uncomfortable to say this—or to at least avoid discouraging an increase in uncertainty   that is more commensurate with what we are experiencing ourselves  [Laughter]  Monetary policy works   through expectations, but our job is harder when we are not truly sure what we want to do to those   expectations  Trying to make sure that we are not pushing down uncertainty as we continue to make sure   that the markets understand that we’re going to work to keep inflation low and stable remains our principal   challenge  Thank you   May 10, 2006 57 of 120      I agree  I am not sure that the movements are that large and that   you can attribute that much to these differences, but I do think you want to look carefully at what happens   to those expectations when expectations change about monetary policy in the near term  It is that pattern   which is somewhat disconcerting     Thank you  My sense is that we probably have a bit more to do,   and it would be helpful to signal that  Of course, we cannot be sure we have more to do, and we certainly   cannot be sure how much more, if anything, we have to do   We have sort of debated two views on the optimal path going forward at various times  One option   is that we move until we are confident that after the move we can leave policy expectations flat  Another   option is to say we move until just short of that and pause at a point that leaves some positive slope to the   path going forward  I guess I am a little more comfortable with the latter strategy than with the former    Even if we knew with confidence what was clearly optimal, we really would not know at this point when   that pause should come  We always face some uncertainty about the band that defines the appropriate   policy path, but I think we still want to err on being at the upper edge of that band, wherever it is  We   probably want to stop tightening before inflation peaks, given the lags with which policy operates, but we   probably do not want to signal that we are going to stop when expectations at long horizons are still moving   up a bit   A few final points  I think inflation expectations require a difficult balance  We don’t want to look   as though we are spooked by the rise in inflation expectations, nor do we want to look as though we are   indifferent to them  I can see lots of ways we can strike that balance   A rhetorical preference  We all like to use the simplifying rhetorical device of saying that we are   going to be more “data dependent” going forward  I prefer that we say that we are going to be more   “outlook dependent” or “forecast dependent” so that we do not look as though we are going to be a little too   volatile in responding to near-term changes in the data  I am broadly comfortable with the language in B,   and I think we should obviously move 25 basis points today   May 10, 2006 98 of 120      I would append to Governor Kohn’s remark and just say that for   that reason, President Minehan, it does have the benefit of adding to flexibility     So moved      Thank you, Mr Chairman  I guess I’d say the center   of gravity of this discussion is a little stronger than the Greenbook, and I think that’s pretty much   where we are, too  We expect real GDP growth to follow a path pretty close to potential in the   balance of ’06 and in ’07, and we expect core PCE inflation to moderate gradually to around   2 percent in ’07  This forecast assumes a monetary policy path close to that of the Greenbook,   somewhat under the market’s forecast  Since May, in our view, the balance of risks has shifted a   June 28-29, 2006 72 of 177    bit toward the less-favorable mix of somewhat more downside risk to real growth and somewhat   more upside risk to inflation  Relative to the Greenbook, however, this implies that we have a   stronger trajectory for demand growth and a slightly lower path for inflation    On the growth side, I guess I’d say we see a pretty healthy adjustment process under way   with a change in the composition of growth  We don’t see the incoming data, the anecdotes, and   the recent developments in financial markets as supporting the view that real growth is likely to   stay significantly below potential over the full forecast period  We had already anticipated the   slowdown in residential investment that has now materialized; therefore, we didn’t see that as a   basis for revising down our forecast  We believe the changes in household wealth in general   have less effect on consumption than the Board staff believes, and as a result we expect a more   modest deceleration in growth  We expect stronger employment growth, too, and we have a   stronger view of the rate of growth in private investment going forward  The world economy   still looks pretty robust to us  So overall, in our view, this supports a forecast for the economy to   be growing at a rate a bit above 3 percent over the next year and a half    But the risks to this forecast of growth seem a little less balanced than they did in May    We see less chance that the expansion is going to reaccelerate to a pace significantly above   potential, and we see a bit more chance for a weaker outcome  The principal source of downside   risk to us remains the possibility that households are going to reduce consumption growth   significantly because they feel less rich, less secure, less comfortable borrowing, and less certain   about the future    On the inflation outlook, we have moved up our expected trajectory for core PCE price   inflation, but we still expect this measure to moderate, as I said, to around 2 percent by the end of   ’07  This forecast is pretty favorable  It rests on the familiar fundamental forces of energy   June 28-29, 2006 73 of 177    prices, if they follow the futures curve, becoming a source of moderation to price pressure going   forward  Strong productivity growth keeps unit labor costs from accelerating sharply  Profit   margins adjust to absorb any increase in unit labor costs that might come if labor’s share starts to   move back toward its historical average  Growth of aggregate demand moderates to potential—  it probably has already moderated to potential—which attenuates the risk of further upside   pressure on resource utilization going forward  Most important, long-term inflation expectations   have come down a bit  They remain in the range of the past few years, and they have proven   responsive to changes in policy expectations in a more reassuring way than we saw very   recently    As in May, however, we believe the risks to this forecast are still somewhat to the upside   because of the following  Headline inflation and near-term inflation expectations have been   running substantially above core for some time  Virtually all the ways we try to capture   underlying inflation have been running above core  The recent rise in core may imply more   momentum in inflation dynamics  You might say that long-term inflation expectations are a   little higher than we want over time, and they may have been too responsive to changes in the   incoming data  The medium-term trajectory for the dollar seems likely to be down  Profit   margins, for reasons we don’t fully understand, have been very high and have been rising, and   maybe that tells us something about inflation psychology that we don’t see in the long-term   breakevens and TIPS  The long-term forecasts of inflation that the staff presentations give us   show a lot of persistence of inflation  Inflation falls very, very slowly over time; and if that path   is right, it could cause some further damage to inflation psychology    If you just step back and look at how much our expectations and the markets’   expectations about the terminal rate, the funds rate at which we’d stop tightening, have changed   June 28-29, 2006 74 of 177    over the past two years, it’s really remarkable  The expectations eighteen months ago were   about 200 basis points below where we are now  That change may imply that we will learn in   retrospect that we were too loose for too long, and therefore we’ll have to do more than we   thought to counteract that effect on inflation  That’s a possibility, not a prediction    So as I said in the beginning, in some sense the balance of risks has shifted in a way that   complicates the monetary policy choice for us, and the shift leaves us with less confidence about   the appropriate path for policy going forward  On balance, monetary policy appears to be getting   some traction in the United States, and the expansion still looks to be in good shape  Inflation   risks seem a bit tilted to the upside, and monetary policy needs to continue to be directed at   ensuring significant moderation in the trajectory of inflation over the next few years  Thank you       Richard, let me just clarify for a second  So you think   we should move today but then leave expectations flat, not 50-50 on another increase?   June 28-29, 2006 108 of 177       Well, I would have a hard time reconciling Jeff’s   comments with the ones that followed  In some ways we need to make a choice  It may be true   that we’re not sure at this point what’s going to make sense beyond June, but we need to make a   conscious choice about what we want to do with the expectations the market now has  Therefore   you can’t evade that reality  You have to consciously decide what you want to do with those   expectations  You have to decide fundamentally whether you want to leave them neutral, push   them down, or push them up  I was trying to read where you would be on that spectrum      It sounds as though your objective with those changes   would be to push up expectations      I would have read the net effect of your proposed   changes as pushing up expectations  Even if we’re uncomfortable with how much confidence   we have about where we want expectations to be, we need to make a choice about what we want   to do  And I would have read the net effect of those changes as pushing up expectations or   leaving them unchanged      Thank you, Mr Chairman  I would read our discussion   yesterday as implying a central tendency to our forecast of an economy that’s growing basically at   potential over the forecast period with a trajectory for inflation that is higher than we’d like if it   were to extend over time and that moderates slowly and modestly over that period, and the risks of   that forecast are still slightly to the upside  Even if we were all quite confident about that basic   forecast and had the same view of the risks around it, we couldn’t say that we actually know at this   point how much more tightening we will need to achieve our target   June 28-29, 2006 129 of 177    I think it’s obvious that we should move today  I think we need to send a signal that we   want the fed funds rate to have a positive slope going forward  Achieving the probability of 50-50   around a move in August would be terrific, but I don’t know if we can do that  We want to have as   much flexibility as we can have  We want the market’s expectations about policy to be responsive   to the data going forward, not sticky because of anticipation of what we’re going to do; and I think,   of course, that we don’t want to pre-commit  I believe that alternative B actually does a very nice   job of achieving this objective  But it’s all about the alternatives, and I think that alternative B, like   democracy, is better than the alternatives  [Laughter]   I think we face two types of risk now  One risk, which I think Janet articulated best   yesterday, is that we may already be in the midst of what will prove to be a more acute adjustment   in housing and a much more dramatic response by households to the change in expectations about   future income and wealth and that the saving rate has been unsustainably low and will have to rise   more significantly  That is a plausible scenario going forward  A second risk is that, under an   expectation that we stop at 525, we may be left below the optimal path for policy  I want to say   two things emphasizing that risk, even though I don’t think we can judge it as the predominant one    First, to echo what I said yesterday, if you look back at where we thought we would end and where   we thought prevailing estimates of the neutral rate were, we have been way under and the market   has been way under  The Bluebook estimate of now-prevailing equilibrium illustrates a basic   200 basis point move in estimated equilibrium over this period, and the market’s expectations of the   terminal rate have moved a lot  So we may have been too loose for too long, and we may have to   do more moves to adjust for the effect that our stance has had on inflationary behavior, inflation   acceptance, psychology, and momentum   June 28-29, 2006 130 of 177    The optimal control exercise—and I thought the memo that you gave us before the meeting   was very helpful—left me a little troubled because you can read those exercises as saying that, if our   objective for inflation really is 15, we’re going to have to be tighter than 5¼ percent; and if you   relax the assumption around smoothing, you get a significantly higher near-term path for the fed   funds rate that is judged to be optimal   But even with that, those exercises imply a view about inflation persistence that says we’re   going to be above 15 percent for a very, very long time  That situation, as I said, does create some   risk that people will read the persistence of inflation as implying that we have higher inflation   tolerance than we do or it may make us vulnerable to some further gradual erosion in credibility  So   it’s possible that we’re going to need to be higher than the funds rate path assumed in the   Greenbook, but we just don’t know, and we don’t need to make that judgment today  We do not   want to try to cap expectations at any particular level and hold them down   Just a few things on the suggestions made  All the suggestions were very thoughtful, but I   would oppose all of them  [Laughter]  The rise in core inflation would be unwelcome if it was   sustained or if it represented an expected path for inflation that was significantly higher than the   central forecast  To say that a bulge like the one we’ve seen today, given what we think is driving   it, is unwelcome increases our vulnerability to the perception that we’re going to be a little too   backward-looking  We need the flexibility to stop at the point where core inflation is still   accelerating, and “unwelcome” would limit our capacity to do that   I think Governor Kroszner was exactly right in resisting the suggestion that we characterize   our current stance of policy as somewhat restrictive  We don’t know how restrictive policy is; but   even if we did, we should not be in the business of calibrating a judgment in our statements about   how restrictive we are  Most important, the statement says implicitly what I think, Bill, you’re   June 28-29, 2006 131 of 177    trying to achieve, which is to convey that we see monetary policy as getting some traction on the   economy today  We also don’t need to be quite as vivid in saying our expectation is to bring core   inflation down over the medium term to some implicit level  “Medium term” does have a lot of   flexibility in it, but as the optimal control exercises suggest, we don’t really know what the costs are   of adopting a specific horizon now for bringing inflation down from what is only a very small   deviation from our implicit target   I think that alternative B strikes a good balance now, and each suggestion would alter that   balance in a way that would not be as good at capturing the consensus about the trajectory that was   described yesterday  So I support moving 25 today and the language in alternative B     I guess I don’t have any concern with doing it, except   that I wouldn’t know how to answer a question about why we took it out of the formulation after   having it in for some time  Every change we make to the statement has to meet that test, and I’m   not sure how I would explain it, although I think I agree with you, Governor Bies, about the reason   for it  But I just don’t think the benefits of doing it offset the need for explanation     That would be fine  Good point, Sandy     What does that actually mean we are going to do in   August?  Are we going to have an existential conversation without facts, just a sort of general   discussion about conviction?    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Growth has moderated,   but the economy still seems, to us at least, likely to grow at a reasonably good pace over the   forecast period, somewhere in the vicinity of 3 percent  We expect core inflation to moderate   gradually from current levels, declining to around 2 percent in ’07  This forecast assumes that   monetary policy follows a path fairly close to what’s in the market and in the Greenbook   The key difference between our view of the outlook and that of the Greenbook forecast is   in the strength of demand growth relative to potential next year  We have reduced a bit our   estimate of potential and also of actual growth, but we still expect the economy to expand at a   rate close to potential This is a very favorable forecast, and we have to recognize, of course,   that the economy is going through a set of extremely complicated transitions, including a large,   adverse, sustained relative price shock of uncertain duration and a substantial adjustment in asset   prices that is now concentrated in housing Our capacity to anticipate the evolution of these   forces and to assess their effect on growth and inflation is, of course, very limited  The forces   that now appear to be working on the economy still present the unpleasant combination of upside   risk to inflation and downside risk to growth; but for the moment we believe that the former, the   possibility that our forecast is too optimistic on inflation, remains the predominant risk   I have a few points on the growth outlook  The economy has clearly slowed, and the   composition of growth within the United States and here relative to the rest of the world has   changed These changes were inevitable, and if they continue to occur smoothly, they seem   desirable and necessary  As a share of aggregate demand within the United States, residential   investment had to contract and consumption had to slow  And US domestic demand had to   slow relative to domestic demand growth in the rest of the world  The key issue we face is   August 8, 2006 56 of 158                      judging whether we have significantly more weakness ahead of us than we are now expecting    In our view, most signs at present point to fundamentally healthy economic conditions   The survey-based measures of confidence are holding up okay  Real household income   growth seems likely to be good going forward  Businesses have the resources and the motivation   to sustain fairly strong rates of investment growth  Structural productivity growth, even post-  revision, still seems strong  Inventory levels remain relatively thin, and the tentativeness that   characterized much of the expansion in terms of investment and hiring should be a source of   some comfort  Global demand is still quite strong, of course, and together these forces will   offset part, but not all, of the weakness coming from the adjustment in housing and consumption   growth The principal risk to this outlook for growth lies in the possibility that households will   slow consumption more sharply because of rising energy costs, higher interest rates, greater   pessimism about future income gains, or the effect of the housing adjustment on perceived   wealth   Financial markets are showing a little more concern about future growth, but not a lot    This concern is most evident in the greater inversion in the yield curve that has emerged at the   one-year to two-year horizon I think you can see in the market some moderation of exuberance   in credit markets, but just a little  Overall, the markets seem to reflect a reasonably favorable   view of future growth prospects   On the inflation side, as I said, we expect core inflation to moderate, not quickly and not   dramatically but by enough and soon enough to bring core PCE inflation down to just below   2 percent over the next 18 months  The issue we face is not so much about the acceleration in   core inflation that occurred in late 2003 and 2004  After that acceleration, core inflation was sort   of trendless, in the vicinity of 2 percent for much of the two-year period, until the past six   August 8, 2006 57 of 158                   months, when we saw this uptick The real problem we face is assessing the extent to which the   very recent acceleration in core inflation reflects transitory factors, such as the indirect effects of   energy prices, and the extent to which it may reflect pressures from higher resource utilization   and other things less benign and less transitory Energy pass-through, of course, seems part of it,   but probably not all of it Shelter doesn’t account for all of it either  This judgment is critical for   us, and we need to be careful that we’re not assuming away the more uncomfortable explanation,   such as a broader inflationary impulse or a rise in pricing power that could reflect increasing   acceptance of higher inflation   How confident can we be that the pressures that have induced this rise in core inflation   will moderate sufficiently to bring down the rate of increase in core PCE prices to the vicinity of   2 percent or below?  Reasonably confident, I think  With the economy growing at or slightly   below trend, with growth of unit labor costs peaking and decelerating a bit as the Greenbook   forecast anticipates, with inflation expectations moderating at short horizons and pretty stable at   longer-run horizons, with energy prices flattening out, and with the dollar falling only a little,   this forecast seems reasonable  But note the number of assumptions and conditions this forecast   depends on Also, the expected path for inflation implies only a very gradual moderation and a   period of sustained inflation above what is presumed to be consistent with this central bank’s   long-term preferences  The risks of this forecast, as I said, still seem to lie on the upside  It may   be some time before we can be confident that the forces are in place to produce the necessary   moderation   More generally, however, we face the very difficult consequential challenge of trying to   figure out the longer-term consequences of having been in an exceptionally long period of   exceptionally low real interest rates—both real short rates and forward rates—that were induced   August 8, 2006 58 of 158             by monetary authorities here and around the world   Real short rates now look as though they   were perhaps lower relative to the estimates of equilibrium even than we thought  Perhaps more   remarkable was the low level of forward real rates during much of our tightening phase  These   financial conditions may have produced more inflation momentum than we thought, and this   may be the case even though there is some reassurance in the stability of long-term expectations    Those expectations are substantially below the peak in ’04 at the long horizon   However, the rise in asset prices and residential investment and the leverage caused by   this long period of very expansionary monetary policy may lead to a process of adjustment in   asset prices that could be more sustained and more damaging in terms of confidence and of   demand than we expect  This risk is greater if we end up allowing more inflation than our   forecast anticipates, for the required monetary policy response could induce an even sharper   adjustment in risk premiums and asset prices  This possibility argues for a lot of humility in   judging the appropriateness of the present stance of monetary policy and what will be   appropriate over time, and it argues mostly for having as much flexibility as we can going   forward, emphasizing that the inflation risks remain the predominant concern of the Committee    Thank you     Mr Chairman?  May I ask Mr Poole a clarifying   question?    So, Bill, you would want to do what to expectations?    How would you want expectations to evolve in response to your preferred version of the   language associated with a pause today?  Do you want them to be flat going forward?   August 8, 2006 97 of 158                          Thank you, Mr Chairman  We could obviously   justify moving today, but we don’t need to move today  We don’t need to move today   principally because we have an economy that has already slowed to what we think is trend and   because we have inflation expectations at the long horizon staying relatively stable despite   adverse inflation news and a fair amount of uncertainty about the path of inflation going forward    That has happened, as many of you have said, in the context of substantial downward revisions   August 8, 2006 106 of 158                         of the expected terminal fed funds rate  That’s a bit of an experiment in credibility  We don’t   want to take too much reassurance from that, but it’s positive    I think we have to signal that inflation remains the predominant risk and that we may   have more tightening to do  We have to make it clear that, if expectations deteriorate or if our   forecast for inflation changes materially, we are prepared to tighten further  Many of the prisms   we look through to judge the appropriate path of policy going forward suggest we may have   more to do They don’t tell us with any certainty that we have a lot more to do; they suggest that   we may have more to do  If you choose the 15 percent target for core PCE and take out the   inertial preference in the optimal policy rules, the case for going significantly above 525 on the   funds rate is pretty strong   We need to look for the combination of action and message in the statement that gives us   the most flexibility going forward  It’s hard to know with confidence what that combination is    My own view is that, if we don’t move today but we have a strong statement about the   asymmetry around the risks, we preserve the possibility of tightening further  If we move today   and the world unfolds as we expect, I think in some ways it’s harder at the margin to tighten   further But none of us knows that with total confidence because we don’t know how the market   is going to interpret the statement   Credibility is a very complicated thing  If we look as though we’re moving out of fear   that we’ve lost it, you could say that might be more damaging to perceptions about our   credibility You can think about the dominant option on the table as a pause coming from a   position of strength and confidence and a move in these circumstances coming from a position of   greater tentativeness and weakness  I don’t think that would be desirable—it is something we   should try to avoid   August 8, 2006 107 of 158                         Looking at market expectations today, I see three things that make me uneasy  One is the   high degree of confidence that we’re pretty close to being done  The second is the inversion—   the speed with which they have us removing a bunch of policy tightening ahead  The third is the   degree of certainty or confidence in the path for interest rates  I don’t know why they have that   degree of confidence and certainty; [laughter] I don’t think we have it  It’s hard to know,   however, how to get us out of that mix  I think that, as several of you have suggested, it would   be nice if we made the market a little less confident that we’re going to be taking out the last   move or two of tightening pretty quickly  How to do that is difficult   Alternative B, as modified by Don Kohn, comes the closest to doing so  I would also   favor a second suggestion, which is putting back in the reference to ongoing productivity gains,   for the following reason We revised down our estimate of structural productivity growth a bit,   and that’s a material change in our view about productivity  But the basic forecast, as we best   judge it, is still a pretty good one for productivity growth  We don’t want to look as though   we’ve lost conviction about that basic positive outlook for productivity growth  Its omission   would be very conspicuous, and I don’t think we’ve learned enough to justify the risk of creating   the signal that we’ve lost confidence that we’re going to have productivity growing in the   vicinity of 2, 2½, 2¼ percent  For those reasons, I’d favor putting that back in     Just to summarize, I’m reasonably comfortable not moving today, but I think we should   send a strong signal that the risks are still predominantly to the upside on inflation  I also think   that alternative B, as modified by Don, does the best job of communicating that message    May I say something on the mention of housing?    I think Bill’s reservations about it are right  Of   course, they would have applied the last time we used it, too I guess I would argue for keeping   housing in on the grounds that it’s happening It is the principal area in which we see some   weakness going on in the economy, and not to make reference to that reality seems a little   awkward It would be like having a statement that didn’t mention what’s happening in either   energy prices or housing, and that would be hard to justify  So I would keep it, on the simple   grounds that it is happening and it’s an accurate description of reality  I don’t think it’s a   problem     Thank you I want to start by saying that I think we’re   confronted with a set of issues that really aren’t principally about communication and transparency    I think they’re fundamentally about how we conduct monetary policy and the monetary policy   regime we’re going to operate under   I want to say a little about what I see as the hierarchy of challenges or decisions we have to   make in that context  We have to have a discussion about what objectives, particularly in terms of   inflation, will guide this Committee’s decisions going forward, and I think it’s hard to do that   without a discussion in quantitative terms  We also need to get in the position of thinking and   talking through more directly and candidly at these meetings how we make decisions about the most   appropriate path for inflation and output, especially at times when we’re way off our basic   objectives  We don’t really do that now  We’ve been living with a lot of ambiguity about whether   we’re operating with, in effect, an objective of getting core PCE down to some particular level at a   certain time or not, and I don’t think we can be comfortable living with that degree of ambiguity   much longer  In some ways, that set of issues is the first we have to confront  We may not get   consensus or resolution, but we have to talk through those issues     We also have to decide what we want to disclose in terms of our objectives, our forecast, the   policy consistent with that forecast, and uncertainty We face a lot of choices in terms of what we   do and how we do it regarding quantitative versus qualitative and explicit versus implicit   approaches to communications  Several of you said that in our statements we should simply say   what we decided and why, but I don’t think it’s quite that simple  The “why” has a lot to do with   August 8, 2006 142 of 158                                           the forecast, and to say nothing about the forecast in the statement would be communicating little   about the reasons for our policy decisions  But the “what” is also not simple  It is certainly not   principally about whether or not we move the fed funds rate  The “what” we’re deciding has to do a   lot with whether we take a view about or try to change or validate the market expectations going   forward over some period  So I don’t think we can get through the choices about communication   and transparency by just agreeing that we want to limit ourselves to the more-minimalist objectives   of communicating what we did and why  It feels to me a little more complicated than that   The third point is a general point  If we are going to change the regime, we can’t do it   piecemeal  We can’t decide that we want to announce a quantitative definition of long-term price   stability without confronting the kind of disclosure regime that we have to adopt in support of that    Also, we can’t think sensibly about the evolution of our disclosure regime around the forecast, for   example, without coming to some greater understanding about whether we disclose a quantitative   objective for inflation  So I think they need to be viewed as a package  For a similar reason, I think   we can’t approach this set of changes by saying let’s move on the things that are easy or less   contentious or have more of a consensus without having a better sense of where we really want to   go That doesn’t mean that we should change all at once or, if we decide to change things, we do   them all together We can still decide to have a graduated approach to introducing the changes in   the regime, but before we make an incremental move, we need to have a better sense about where   we want ultimately to go  If we don’t have consensus about where we want to go, then it’s harder to   decide what the incremental move should be  It doesn’t mean we should be inert   It’s very healthy to have a candid discussion about what we think is wrong with our current   regime  I used to work with somebody who said to me, “Don’t bring me problems without   solutions”  Therefore, discomfort with a set of attributes of our regime relative to the experience of   August 8, 2006 143 of 158                                   other countries is really not enough to justify change  We have to be able to look at the proposals   for change and be very comfortable that they’re going to respond to the problem without leaving us   with a set of other collateral risks or disadvantages  It’s also good to have a direct and open   discussion about what we do not want to try to achieve through communications  I’m very   uncomfortable with what I think it would be fair to say is a substantial faction in the academic   profession now, which says that the optimal communication policy of central banks should be to   seek very close alignment between the market’s expectations about future policy and the central   bank’s and to achieve that alignment in real time and not have long periods of wide divergence   between what the market thinks and what we think is appropriate  That position strikes me as   highly unrealistic and complicated and maybe difficult to achieve, but we should talk through that   issue I think it’s also unrealistic to say that we should avoid clarity about our views on the future   course of the economy and policy  That pure fog alternative seems unsatisfying and uncomfortable   to me   I have nothing to add to the discussion about diversity  There are great benefits to diversity    I do think we should try to avoid having, because of scheduling, many members of the Committee   talking in the same period  It is difficult to achieve but worth thinking about   Finally I just want to compliment the subcommittee  The way you have laid out the issues is   very nicely done  I also want to compliment the Chairman for approaching this subject very openly,   having us try to think through all the difficult choices involved together, and allowing some   analysis, debate, and a little competition for ideas help inform choices about how we go forward  I   think that approach is admirable, and I commend you for it     What if we don’t know what we don’t know? [Laughter]       New York’s view is that they work for Rick    [Laughter]    Thank you Let me just start with the broad contours   of our outlook Growth has obviously slowed The second half is likely to be relatively weak,   but the only place we see pronounced weakness is in housing, and we expect a return to   moderate growth going forward Core inflation seems to be easing a bit, and it may have peaked   in the second quarter, if you look just at the three-month annualized numbers  But inflation   remains uncomfortably high, and our forecast assumes only a very gradual moderation over the   next two years In terms of numbers, we expect the real economy to grow at around its 3 percent   potential rate in ’07 and ’08 We expect core PCE inflation on a Q4/Q4 basis to come in just   below 2½ percent in ’06 and to moderate to about 2 percent in ’07 and 18 percent in ’08  Our   outlook is largely unchanged from August  It’s conditioned on a path for policy that is flat at   current levels for two to three quarters This puts us slightly above the level that is currently   priced into the risk-adjusted Eurodollar futures curve   In terms of uncertainty and risk, we see somewhat greater downside risks to demand   growth than we saw in August, but the inflation risks still seem likely to be to the upside    Weighing the balance among these competing risks, we believe, as we did in August, that   inflation risks should remain the predominant concern of the Committee, not so much, to borrow   the Chairman’s formulation, because the probability of a higher inflation outcome is   substantially greater than that of a much weaker growth outcome but because the costs of an   erosion in inflation performance would be more damaging   September 20, 2006 67 of 132                           On the growth outlook, we’re seeing a somewhat greater adjustment in residential   investment than we anticipated, but this has not yet induced or been accompanied by a   significant weakness outside housing  Of course, the outlook for the economy as a whole should   not be particularly sensitive to plausible estimates of the direct effects of the remaining   adjustment, whatever it is, left in residential investment  What seems more important, of course,   is the potential effect of what’s happening in housing on consumer and business spending  We   just don’t see troubling signs yet of collateral damage, and we are not expecting much  The   fundamentals supporting relatively strong productivity growth seem to be intact  The   acceleration of the nominal compensation growth that appears to be under way, combined with   the moderation of headline inflation that we expect as energy prices moderate, should produce   fairly strong growth of household income, even with the moderation in employment growth to   trend   Corporate balance sheet profitability remains strong  Domestic demand growth outside   the United States is expected to remain quite robust even though there has been some moderation   in current measures of activity in some markets  Of course, the level of interest rates is not   particularly high in nominal or real terms  Equity prices and credit spreads suggest a reasonable   degree of confidence in the prospects for future expansion  Financial market participants report   very strong continued demand for credit and for risk generally and very ample liquidity  This   strength may reflect other factors that are operating on demand for financial assets, but still   survey-based measures of confidence have not deteriorated dramatically  This, of course, may   prove too optimistic on the growth outlook, and the risks seem weighted to the downside   On the inflation front, recent data have not altered our forecast or, really, our assessment   of the risks to that forecast  Although there are signs of moderation in underlying inflation, the   September 20, 2006 68 of 132                   core PCE and a range of alternative measures continue to grow at levels that are uncomfortably   high We expect further moderation to occur only gradually over the forecast period  The latest   data have been somewhat reassuring, and inflation expectations at various horizons have   behaved relatively well since our last meeting  The acceleration in compensation growth and   unit labor costs does not justify a higher inflation forecast in our view, provided that expectations   remain well anchored, business markups fall, the ongoing moderation in growth reduces pressure   on resource utilization, the futures curve proves a reasonably accurate prediction for the path of   energy prices, the dollar declines only modestly, and so forth  These are reasonably good   arguments, but we still think the risks are to the upside  Over the past two years, we have   consistently revised up our forecasts for inflation  I’m not sure we really yet understand the   forces behind the unanticipated acceleration in underlying inflation  Medium-term inflation   expectations, while not rising at stated levels, may be higher than is consistent with an inflation   objective in the range the Committee has talked about in the past Containing these upside risks   should be the dominant focus of policy until we see a more-pronounced moderation in current   and expected underlying inflation As my comments imply, we don’t have a lot of differences   with the Greenbook on the contours of the outlook  The Greenbook shows slower growth   relative to lower potential but also more inflation than we do  It also shows more slack with   more inflation and a little less confidence in the strength of demand growth than we do for the   reasons I hope I explained   I see certain questions as key  On the growth front the question is, Will weakness   cumulate?  If we see a more-pronounced actual decline in housing prices, will that have greater   damage on confidence and spending?  But the more interesting questions are really on the   inflation forecast, and let me just talk very briefly about two   September 20, 2006 69 of 132                     First, does the Greenbook forecast produce enough moderation in inflation soon enough   to keep inflation expectations anchored?  The baseline forecast has inflation falling to   15 percent, at least based on the last time we saw a long-term forecast, only over a very   protracted period—a period that is significantly longer than the one many central bankers would   consider an acceptable deviation from an inflation target  We have already seen a bit of   troubling speculation from people who write about us  This Committee may have more inflation   tolerance or a higher implicit target than its predecessor  Should we try to achieve a more rapid   moderation of inflation? How should we evaluate the costs and benefits of trying to achieve a   quicker and more substantial moderation of inflation, particularly given the tenuous state of the   evidence on inertia and persistence?  Is this gentle and gradual expected moderation in inflation   optimal, given the softness of the outlook for demand?  These are questions that are worthy of a   more explicit discussion by the Committee, particularly if we’re going to talk about moving   toward a quantitative definition of price stability with more disclosure around the forecast   The second and related question is about inflation in our forecast  With the stance of   monetary policy that is now priced into the markets—this is a softer path than the one in   August—how confident can we be that we are likely to achieve the forecast of sustained growth   and gradually moderating core inflation?  I think we can be less confident than the confidence   you might read into current market expectations and the uncertainty that surrounds them  Of   course, the behavior of long-term inflation expectations in financial markets suggests that this   risk is not particularly high at present and that we can take some more time to get a better handle   on the evolution of the economy before deciding what is next in terms of monetary policy   actions But I think that we may have more to do, and we should try to avoid fostering too much   September 20, 2006 70 of 132                     confidence in the markets that we’re done  We need to preserve the flexibility to do more if that   proves necessary to keep inflation expectations anchored  Thank you     I was fairly comfortable with our decision in August, and   I am fairly comfortable with that decision in retrospect  Whether we were wise or we have been   lucky is something only history will judge  I would be more comfortable if there were a slightly   positive slope to expectations about the future path of policy and less certainty around that path, but   I don’t know how to achieve that responsibly with language today  As Governor Kohn said, despite   whatever discomfort one may have with that path in markets today, we can’t say that path is   fundamentally getting in the way of our confidence or the world’s confidence in our capacity to   achieve our objectives  So I’m comfortable with not moving today and basically fine with the   language in alternative B   I have just two other observations to make  It is striking that we have an asymmetry in the   growth paragraph and in the inflation paragraph in that we have slipped into giving a   forward-looking view about the likely path of inflation in a qualitative sense but have not done so in   the growth paragraph for lots of reasons  I think that the asymmetry creates a bit of a problem for us   today in trying to explain how we view the outlook and the risks to the outlook  The absence of any   language about the future path of growth makes me more uncomfortable than I felt about the path   today, and so I think we should come back and think about whether we want to correct that    Correcting that asymmetry might help a bit in explaining to the world any difference between the   staff forecast, which will be clearly reflected in the minutes, and the implicit forecast of the   Committee   My second point is just about the minutes  I think that there is an issue regarding the   minutes in that the staff forecast gets expressed with a clarity that is not expressed about the   Committee forecast The Committee forecast is necessarily described more vaguely  It’s harder to   find what the center of gravity is, and even the tails don’t necessarily come through  We probably   September 20, 2006 113 of 132                     saw the reaction we did to the minutes last time because, even when the Committee’s judgment is   much different from the staff’s, that difference is hard to characterize in the minutes  That is   another topic for future discussion  Thank you     Second     Second     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Our view of the national   outlook hasn’t changed much since September  If monetary policy follows the path that’s laid   out in the Greenbook, and it’s flat for the next few quarters, then we expect growth to return to a   level close to 3 percent in ’07 and for inflation to moderate gradually from current levels    However, we still face the basic tension in the forecast—the combination of relatively high core   inflation today and an economy that has slowed significantly below trend—and we still face the   same basic questions  Will inflation moderate enough and soon enough to keep inflation   expectations reasonably stable at reasonably low levels?  Will weakness spread beyond housing   October 24-25, 2006 56 of 203    and cumulate?  Relative to September, we see somewhat less downside risk to growth and   somewhat less upside risk to inflation, but as in September, I think inflation risks should remain   our predominant concern   Relative to the Greenbook, we expect somewhat faster growth in ’07, but we have a   higher estimate of potential  The difference is really mostly about hours and trend labor force   growth  We expect more moderation in core PCE and expect it to fall just below 2 percent in   ’07, but this difference is mostly the result of different assumptions about persistence  With   these exceptions, our basic story about the contour of the expansion is fairly close to the   Greenbook, and the implications for monetary policy are similar   The markets do seem relatively positive, a little more optimistic about the near-term   outlook  Equity prices, credit spreads, and market interest rates all reflect somewhat less concern   about both recession and inflation risks  Some of this, however, is probably the result of the   exceptional factors supporting what the markets call liquidity  What is liquidity, and what’s   behind it?  I don’t know that we have a good answer to that  Most people would cite a   combination of the facts that real interest rates are fairly low in much of the world still, that   reserve accumulation by the countries that shadow the dollar is still quite large, that a big   energy-price windfall is producing demand for financial assets, particularly in dollars, and that   there is confidence in the willingness and ability of the central bank, particularly this central   bank, to save the world from any significant risk of a recession  I don’t think all of this,   therefore, is the result simply of confidence about fundamentals, so we shouldn’t take too much   reassurance  But it still is a somewhat more positive constellation of asset prices, of market   views about the outlook   October 24-25, 2006 57 of 203    Someone wrote this week that the fog over the outlook has lifted  I don’t think that’s   quite right  It’s true that the economy still looks pretty good except for housing, and I do think   it’s fair to say that core inflation is moderating and that expectations are behaving in ways that   should be pretty reassuring to us  But it is too soon to be confident that inflation is going to   moderate sufficiently soon enough with the path of monetary policy priced into markets today,   and it is too soon to be confident also that the weakness we see in housing, in particular, won’t   spread and won’t cumulate  So I think that overall the balance of risks hasn’t changed   dramatically, and as in September, I still view the inflation risk as the predominant concern of   the Committee     I think I’m echoing Michael, but I want to compliment   the staff on the evolution of the Bluebook  I think that seeing that complement of prisms on   different policy choices or different paths is useful, and we should see them all the time and more   of them  I sort of missed the inclusion of the range of ones we saw in June  But having said that,   may I ask a broader question?  I want to come back to the debate we didn’t really have about   whether what we see in TIPS about long-term inflation expectations should be encouraging or   discouraging about the prospects for achieving sufficient moderation in inflation  Would Vince   or David or anybody else like to speak to the question of whether, if TIPS five-year inflation   compensation five years forward stayed at its current level of between 2 and 2½, that would be   holding up underlying inflation going forward?  Or would that be consistent with moderation?    Now, you’ve given us a bunch of charts that express a view on that, I think  I don’t know much   about the assumptions underpinning those about the path of expectations going forward     Bill, I’m not sure this is quite the way to ask the   question, but if the Committee adopted that approach and if the market’s response to that change   in the signal were to lower the expected funds rate path because of the way they interpret the   change in the signal, would that be consistent with the objectives you’re trying to achieve?      So that would leave you with a forecast for inflation   that you’d be comfortable with?     I wasn’t trying to talk you out of your view, [laughter]   but don’t the policy rules, as a prism on these choices, tell you that, if you alter your weights on   your loss function—     This is really just a question about the framework the   policy rules give us for this choice  The way I understood this is that, if you alter the weights   and you’re asymmetric in your weights, in your policy rules, but you’re talking about a forecast   that’s sort of the basic central forecast underpinning your rules, don’t you get a higher path?     I agree with you on that     This is a glossary or dictionary question  Like Don, I   interpreted “moderate,” because I was advised by the staff to do so, as “at or slightly below   potential”  Have we used that phrase in the recent past in a way that would allow the reasonably   informed outside person to interpret it that way?     What is our euphemism for “potential”?  Is it “solid”?    Is “solid” the conventional use?   October 24-25, 2006 96 of 203      If we consider the merits of Don’s change, or the   Kroszner-Kohn change, to that second section, does it convey the sense of growth?  If you look   through the recent slowdown, growth strengthens relative to the pace in the second and third   quarters  Does “moderate” imply some modest strengthening relative to the pace of the second   and third quarters?     Professor     Why don’t we say, “Whatever that is”?  [Laughter]     I am, as I think the center of gravity in this Committee is,   somewhat uncomfortable with the amount of moderation that the Greenbook expects to see in core   PCE inflation, and I’m somewhat uncomfortable with the view that, with the markets’ expectations   for the fed funds rate, we’re going to see enough moderation of inflation  We can’t be that   confident—even if the fed funds rate stays constant, as the Greenbook suggests, over the next few   quarters—that we will get the right amount of moderation  So I think the range of plausible   outcomes for monetary policy is likely above the path that’s now priced into the markets, maybe   somewhat above the assumption that underpins the Greenbook  I’m not confident that we can   effectively alter those expectations or calibrate our signal in a way that can engineer that kind of   desirable change two to three quarters out in the expected path of the fed funds rate  I don’t think   there’s a good case for moving policy today, of course  I think the first sentence in C is sort of what   we meant in August, and if we had used it then, I’d be in favor of using it today  But I don’t think   there’s a strong case for putting it in today on the grounds that I don’t know that, on the basis of the   evidence we’ve seen over the past five weeks, we can justify what would be interpreted as a   significant firming in the signal the Committee is sending  I also think it has the slight disadvantage   of maybe being harder to extricate ourselves from than the current formulation  Having said that, I   think the signal needs to be asymmetric and the risks are still asymmetric  We should be more   October 24-25, 2006 119 of 203    worried about the risk that inflation doesn’t moderate enough than we should be worried about the   other risks to the forecast   I would be reasonably comfortable with the changes to sections 2 and 3 that Don proposed    I have some uneasiness about whether section 2 as modified conveys the sense that, if you look   through the adjustment we’re seeing so far, we have growth strengthening from the pace in the   second and third quarters to a level that’s at or close to potential, and I do think the sense we want to   convey is pretty close to what Charlie, Bill Poole, and perhaps Kevin in a sense said  But I just   don’t think we can at this time wade into a characterization of potential or what’s sustainable   without the risk that we’d regret the formulation that we used  So on the grounds that I don’t have a   better alternative, I would support the modifications to sections 2 and 3 and leave the risk   assessment in section 4 unchanged  I think that will leave us in a pretty good position  We should   be pretty comfortable with where we are, but I do think the plausible scenarios for what we’re likely   to do with the fed funds rate lie above what’s now priced in the market and maybe above the   assumption that underpins the Greenbook forecast     Mr Chairman, may I ask one clarifying question?  Will   someone remind us how the minutes are going to characterize the conversation we will have over   the next several meetings?  Is it going to be a standard section like the one we used the last time,   which was pretty much without content?  [Laughter]   October 24-25, 2006 126 of 203      Tell us what you really think  [Laughter]     I’m tempted to say that I was hoping we would run out   of time  [Laughter]  I’ll be very brief  Let me just compliment Don and his subcommittee and   the Chairman for how you’ve laid out the issues  This decision is important to think through   carefully, even if we quickly find a comfortable center of gravity  It’s going to be consequential,   I’m sure   October 24-25, 2006 185 of 203    On the questions—I’m changing them slightly  Would an explicit, publicly disclosed,   numerical definition of “price stability” be helpful?  Probably, but it depends on how we do it  It   depends on what else we do about the way we talk about our forecast, and it depends a lot on   how we think through the implications of the way we make policy   How will, how should, how would, how could the FOMC choose or choose to reveal an   inflation objective?  Three broad options that are implicit or explicit in this memo are worth   thinking through  I’m sure that, if we choose to reveal publicly a quantitative definition of our   view of long-term inflation, we have to do it as a decision of the Committee  It’s hard for me to   imagine how one could do that on the basis of some averaging of preferences, which would   change with the composition of the Committee over time  Much of what’s been said about the   other two choices is right and sounds sensible    Would the quantification of an inflation objective be a new influence?  Of course it   would  That has to be why it’s worth thinking through  As Janet implied, thinking through what   it would mean for our behavior is a critical part of this process  I’m going to discuss the other   questions very briefly and make just two points about process     First, when you look at the broad evidence, I think it is fair to say that the evidence is   weak on the achievable credibility gains relative to what we’ve already achieved  I’m uncertain,   of course, whether those gains come from actions over time or what you disclose about your   regime, your objectives, your framework  The evidence is somewhat stronger against the   concerns of the skeptics and the critics in that there’s little basis in the experience of other   countries to justify the broad concerns exist—that embracing the softer responsible variants of   inflation targeting bring with them too much risk; that you lose flexibility to respond; that you’re   forced into suboptimal weights among your various objectives; that, for example, you are   October 24-25, 2006 186 of 203    compromised in your capacity to respond to threats to financial stability  I’m not sure that’s   right, though  Of course, we’re not New Zealand, Norway, or Sweden  We say that a lot  But   we should talk through what it is that makes us different  How are we different, and how might   that difference make us view the evidence?  In some sense the question we face is, Do the soft   variants of the approach offer convincing credibility gains without significantly reducing the   risks and concerns that have to accompany consideration of this objective?  That basic tradeoff is   what is critical   Second, how do ignorance and uncertainty about inflation dynamics, about the   responsiveness of inflation to some of its traditional determinants, about the shape of the Phillips   curve, and about inertia and persistence affect our choice of regime?  How does uncertainty   about all the other dimensions of how monetary policy works and how we measure this affect   our choice of regime?  This uncertainty is critical to how we choose among alternative paths for   bringing inflation back to target, how we choose among alternative horizons, and how we think   about policy consistent with those different paths  All the variants of the regimes on the table, all   of which are of the softer form, would still force us to be more explicit in public about where we   are seeking to move inflation and over what horizon  I think we have to ask ourselves whether   we can be confident about how compelling those arguments will be in public given the relative   weakness of the analytical foundation that exists to help inform those choices  Even with a no   horizon, a long horizon, or a variable horizon approach to the disclosed explicit inflation   objective, you don’t avoid confronting the choice about your horizon or how you come up with   an alternative horizon, and so forth  I think that the dimension of ignorance and uncertainty we   live with is inherent, and it is not going to change dramatically over time  Thus it has to inform   how we think through these broader options   October 24-25, 2006 187 of 203    The third question is, how would alternative variants to the regime affect the dynamics   around the policy setting?  As I said, and many others said, they will and must affect it  You   have to assume they will  It’s prudent to assume they will  It’s very important to think through   those dynamics  Would we really be comfortable—even in a very long-run horizon, no horizon,   or flexible horizon regime—producing a forecast that has inflation staying well above our target   for very long periods of time?  I’m not sure that you wouldn’t want to assume that over time the   Committee would be less comfortable with that and want to hope and declare as an objective that   we move inflation down quicker over time  I don’t think analysis or evidence is going to help us   think through those dynamics, but I don’t think we can assume them away  I think they’re   important   I have two quick comments about process  One is—I’ll call it the Kroszner proposal,   though he didn’t make it  [Laughter]  I think we should spend more time, and Don should build   into his time frame more in-depth discussion, on what we think we understand about the models   that underpin our decisions and what’s in those models about inertia and all the fundamental   determinants of inflation  We’ve had a lot of turnover in the Committee  We discussed it once   over lightly—in August, I believe  We should discuss it in more depth, at least to make sure we   have a common understanding about what we’re working with and what the limitations and   benefits are relative to the alternatives  Two, I think it’s important not to get into the process   discussion prematurely  A lot of thoughtful, interesting ideas were put forth about intermediate   steps toward some broad change in regime  I don’t think it’s worth spending a lot of time on   alternative variants of the intermediate steps until we’ve really thought through ultimately where   we want to go  If we spend time on and get enough depth about the merits of that choice and we   October 24-25, 2006 188 of 203    find some consensus with which we’re comfortable, then we can go back and figure out how we   want to get there  Thank you     We’re trying to decompose changes in forward nominal   interest rates and figure out what are risk premiums, term premiums, real rates, and so forth  Have   you looked at what’s happening globally with the same basic objective and tried to decompose   changes in forward rates or real rates outside the United States into their various components?     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Our forecast hasn’t   changed much since the last meeting  We still expect growth to move back to potential in the   first half of next year and to stay in the vicinity of potential, which we think is around 3 percent,   over the forecast period  We expect inflation, as measured by the core PCE index, to fall to just   under 2 percent by the end of ’08    Our view of the outlook differs from the Greenbook in two respects, as it has over the   past few cycles  We have a higher estimate of potential growth, with the difference due to higher   estimates of labor force growth, and we expect more moderation in inflation than the Greenbook   does, principally because we believe there is less inertia, less persistence in inflation in the   United States than does the staff  Both these issues, of course, deserve continued analysis and   December 12, 2006 56 of 134         attention by the Committee  These differences in our forecast relative to the Greenbook don’t   extend to the policy assumption  Both outlooks are predicated on a likely path of the fed funds   rate that’s nearly flat over the next several quarters  This path, of course, is above the one   currently reflected in financial markets  Of course, although some disagreement between our   view and the market’s view is not unusual, the size of this gap is significant enough to warrant   some attention  It’s hard to know, however, what the source of the difference is and, therefore,   what the implications are for what we do in terms of policy    The risks to the forecast may have shifted somewhat in the direction of less upside risk to   inflation and more downside risk to growth  But to us, the current weakness in the economy still   seems principally to stem from the direct effects of the slowdown in housing on construction   activity and related parts of the manufacturing sector as well as from the reduction in automobile   and auto-related production  As things now stand, the softer-than-expected recent numbers don’t   argue, in our view, for a substantial reassessment of the risks in the outlook  Surveys of business   sentiment outside the manufacturing sector still seem consistent with reasonable growth going   forward  A slowdown of investment in equipment and software doesn’t seem to be particularly   troubling to us at this point  Consumer spending seems to be growing at a fairly good pace    Employment growth, of course, is still quite solid, and growth outside the United States still   looks pretty good    We think the fundamentals of the expansion going forward still look good, with strong   household income growth even after the lagged effects of the recent downward revisions,   productivity growth in the range of 2½ percent for the nonfinancial corporate sector, and strong   corporate balance sheets in the United States, and prospects for continued expansion outside the   United States  Our recent financial market data don’t, in my view, provide a convincing case for   December 12, 2006 57 of 134         a substantial increase in the probability of a much weaker path for growth going forward    Although the yield curve is inverted and long rates continue to drift down, staff research and   other indicators suggest that part of that is due to a decline in term premiums, and forward rates   seem to be coming down around the world still  This gradual reduction in term premiums and   forward real rates globally suggests that what we’re seeing in the long-term interest rates in the   United States may not be principally a sign that confidence in the US growth outlook has   deteriorated    It’s not clear even 18 months after the conundrum first emerged whether equilibrium   rates globally have really moved substantially lower  The Bluebook estimate suggests we’re still   within most estimates of equilibrium real rates in the United States  Equity prices and credit   spreads are consistent with the view of sustained expansion going forward  All this seems to   reinforce the case for the judgment that we have not yet induced overly restrictive financial   conditions    We still face considerable uncertainty about the outlook for growth and the familiar   sources of downside risk, but to us these still seem to rest mainly with the possibility that a   more-acute and protracted fall in housing activity and prices will cause a significant deceleration   in housing and household spending and ultimately business spending  The nature of these risks,   however, hasn’t changed in our view, and the probability that the risks will materialize may have   risen a bit but not much  On balance, this situation should reduce the probability that we’ll have   to tighten further, but it doesn’t seem to suggest that today we need to induce a further easing in   overall financial conditions    On the inflation front, we confront the familiar mix of underlying inflation still at   uncomfortably high levels and considerable uncertainty about whether we’ll see enough   December 12, 2006 58 of 134         moderation soon enough to keep expectations stable at reasonable levels  The remaining   inflation risks, in other words, are about whether we get enough moderation  In the absence of a   dramatically different outcome for the dollar and energy prices than what’s in the forecast, we   don’t see much risk of inflation accelerating from current levels or remaining stuck at current   levels  We haven’t had much evidence to justify a significant change in the expected path of   inflation or in the risks of that forecast  The news on unit labor costs may be a bit reassuring    Surveys seem to suggest some evidence of diminishing pricing power, which might imply that   margins will adjust downward to absorb future rises in labor compensation  The odds of an early   return to above-trend growth seem to have receded a bit  Most of the alternative measures of   underlying inflation that many of us look at seem to have moderated a bit after the sustained   earlier period of acceleration  Inflation expectations derived from TIPS have eased a bit  These   pieces of information are somewhat comforting, but they don’t change the fact that our   expectation that we’ll achieve the desired moderation in inflation without further tightening of   monetary policy remains just that  It is an expectation or a hope; it is not yet reality  Thank you      I have two questions about the prisms you gave us for   looking at the current stance of policy and the likely path of policy  Brian, in your comments on   exhibit 3 you said that alternative A, as your last bullet says, “is consistent with estimated policy   rules”  Can you just elaborate on that?  My quick reading of it suggests that, as long as our   inflation objective is 2 percent, the range of policy rules that we look at basically will show the   funds rate at or under the market path  If you have a different inflation objective, then we’re at   the middle of the distribution or maybe slightly under the plausible distribution  Am I reading   that right?       My second question is about the Bluebook chart 5,   which shows a range of alternative estimates of the equilibrium real federal funds rate over time    I want to come back to the Chairman’s discussion about the saving glut and what it might mean   for the way we think about monetary policy today  The bottom panel of that chart shows a   substantial upward revision in most estimates of equilibrium over the period from ’02 to ’04 and   shows us coming back to something close to our long-term averages  Is there an intuitive   explanation for how you reconcile that chart with the preponderance of evidence out there, which   the Chairman drew to the world’s attention, that suggests you have a big increase in ex ante   saving relative to perceived investment opportunities?  Wouldn’t that have produced, in at least   some mix of these estimates, a sustained and substantial secular decline in estimates of current   prevailing equilibrium?      Wouldn’t you have expected to have come back to a   point that was below past estimates of equilibrium over time?  I know I’m confused about this    [Laughter]      One way to look at this, I guess, is to say that we just   don’t know much about what equilibrium is  [Laughter]  It tends to move around a lot, and the   bands are kind of fat       I have one final question in another direction  Would   you expect to see significant changes in measured term premiums over short periods?  You gave   December 12, 2006 89 of 134         us a bunch of reasons that you don’t have much confidence in the model estimates, but would   you ever want to attribute much to what looked like significant moves in short periods?      Mr Chairman?      I have a clarifying question raised by Pat’s question    Please remind us, Dave—has real consumer spending slowed more than anticipated?      The other difference between exhibits 4 and 5 is   “weaker” versus “subdued”  Does “subdued” sound weaker than “weak”?  [Laughter]  Or is   “weak” weaker than “subdued”?       May I begin with a question?  When was the last time we   used the phrase “indicators have been mixed”?  Is there precedent for that?     As being mixed?  It’s probably true that at any time the   indicators are mixed, but does this phrase have substantial connotations based on precedent?     All right  My basic view, Mr Chairman, is that we   should keep the fed funds rate unchanged  Circumstances justify a very modest softening of the   signal in the statement  I don’t think we should do that by changing the balance-of-risk assessment    I think we should do it by acknowledging very subtly that things have turned out slightly softer than   perhaps we expected and that we might have a little more uncertainty going forward  The virtue of   Governor Bies’s suggestion is that it acknowledges uncertainty, and the combination of the   acknowledgment that the downturn in housing has been substantial and the phrase indicating some   December 12, 2006 111 of 134         uncertainty about the future is pretty good  So I’d be comfortable with that  President Poole made a   very good case for the importance of reminding ourselves that we need to make sure we have some   flexibility going forward to react to a material change in the outlook  But I don’t think we’ve had   enough changes to our outlook to justify a substantial change in the signal at this point  To go to a   balanced risk assessment or to go substantially further toward one would likely induce some larger   change in market expectations and some greater easing of financial conditions than we have already   seen  That is not something we need to induce at this time, principally because of our uncertainty   about whether we’re going to get enough moderation in inflation  So I would be comfortable with   “recent indicators have been mixed”  I think I’d slightly prefer that to going to alternative C, section   2, and I would prefer both of those to alternative B in either exhibit     I would not interpret Tom’s “no comment on the issue”   to be inconsistent with what you were proposing, Don     No, go ahead     Let me just say a couple of things  I think Rick’s point   about education is right  You can make a statement educating people about the virtues of price   stability and anchoring long-term inflation expectations and the reason that’s important, without   taking on the challenge of educating people today about alternative ways of achieving that   objective  Our debate about inflation targeting and communications is really about means not ends;   and my view about education on the latter issue about means is to avoid taking on the challenge of   educating the public until we know where we want to go  Once we know where we want to go, we   can figure out how best to create the broader public foundation to make that possible  I’m sure that   we’ll have different views on that     My second point is about past positions  This is easy for me because I don’t have past   positions about these issues to echo or to repudiate in public  I would make a slightly different   suggestion for the way to respond to those questions from, I think, Bill  You can refer people to   your past positions without repeating them in substance and nuance  I don’t know what the   Chairman and the Vice Chairman of the Board plan to do, but I expect that you won’t feel the need   in public going forward to repeat your past positions on these issues  I suspect that you will refer   people to your past positions without reminding them about what those were  That distinction is   important, I think, because I don’t know how you get into repeating or summarizing your past   position without inevitably getting into the broader set of choices that we’re going to be debating in   the Committee   December 12, 2006 120 of 134         One final point, and I think Don said this more eloquently than I can say it, which is that we   all have an interest in having this discussion take place below the radar screen of public debate until,   again, we have a better sense of where consensus is going to lie  The more we move it into the   public debate, the more risk we face of all the concerns that Governor Kohn referred to     I think we should rule out humor  [Laughter]  This is   an important annual process, and New York plays an important role       Bill, could you or Dave remind us what share of the   total outstanding stock of mortgages consists of subprimes or what share of the housing stock do   we think is financed at the subprime level?  My recollection is that the share is still small even   though it has been a large part of the recent flows        I have two questions  The first is about our inflation   forecast  We’ve discussed several times the basic question about whether the now-prevailing   level of long-term inflation expectations in markets is likely to provide support for forecasts of   further moderation or likely to constrain the prospects for further moderation in core inflation    My recollection of that discussion, although a little hazy, is that expectations might be a bit of a   constraint  Am I right in my recollection?  Has your view on that changed?        This is a different question for Joe  Your exhibit 10   describes broad trends in net official capital flows from emerging markets to the United States and   global real interest rates  Has your view about the relationship between them changed?  I thought   we had sort of the conventional view  The accepted view within the System was a little skeptical   that there was much of an effect, and I didn’t think the research that looked at the relationship   between these two things suggested that the effect was that large  Has your view about that   changed, or is this exhibit consistent with it?     No, between official flows and global—really industrial-  country—real interest rates   January 30-31, 2007 26 of 255      Charlie, I’m not sure I understand your thinking  You   said that you expect what sounded like a pretty significant moderation in core PCE, but that’s on a   monetary policy assumption that implies further tightening     Though I don’t want to pin you down, that sounds sort of   modest  You are saying that with another 25 basis points you’d get what core PCE inflation over   the forecast period?     Just in orders of magnitude—if we did another 25 or 50   basis points and there were some sort of associated changes in overall financial conditions so that   that was reinforced, you’d get a core PCE inflation forecast that would go how far down?  Would it   go to 15?     Does Mr Lacker have an alternative explanation?       Thank you, Mr Chairman  Just a few quick points    We feel somewhat better about the outlook for growth and inflation, but we haven’t really   changed our forecasts for ’07 and ’08  So just as we expected over the past few cycles, we   January 30-31, 2007 67 of 255    currently expect GDP to grow roughly at the rate of potential over the forecast period, which we   believe is still around 3 percent, and we expect the rate of increase in the core PCE to moderate a   bit more to just below 2 percent over the forecast period  We see somewhat less downside risk   to growth and somewhat less upside risk to inflation than we did, but the overall balance of risks   in our view is still weighted toward inflation—the risk that it fails to moderate enough or soon   enough  The basic nature of the risks to both those elements of our forecast hasn’t really   changed    As this implies, our forecast still has somewhat stronger growth and somewhat less   inflation than the Greenbook does  The differences, however, are smaller than they have been    We see the same basic story that the Greenbook does in support of continuing expansion going   forward  We have similar assumptions for the appropriate path of monetary policy—at least two,   perhaps several, quarters of a nominal fed funds rate at current levels  The main differences   between our view about the economy and the Greenbook’s relate first, as they have for some   time, to the likely growth in hours; we’re still not inclined to build in a substantial reduction in   trend labor force growth  Second, our view is that inflation has less inertia, less persistence, than   it has exhibited over the past half-century  Third, we tend to think that changes in wealth have   less effect on consumer behavior than does the staff    We have seen a general convergence in views in the market, as we just discussed, toward   a forecast close to this view, close to the center of gravity in this room, and a very significant   change in policy expectations as well  We can take some comfort from this, but I don’t think we   should take too much  Markets still seem to display less uncertainty about monetary policy and   asset prices and quite low probabilities to even modest increases in risk premiums than I think is   probably justified   January 30-31, 2007 68 of 255     Let me just go through the principal questions briefly  Is the worst behind us in both   housing and autos?  Probably, but we can’t be sure yet  If we get some negative shock to   income—to demand growth—we’re still vulnerable to a more adverse adjustment in housing   prices with potentially substantially negative effects on growth, in part because of the greater   leverage now on household balance sheets  How strong does the economy look outside autos   and housing?  Pretty strong, it seems  We see no troubling signs of weakness, despite the   disappointment on some aspects of investment spending  What does the labor market strength   tell us about the risk to the forecast?  It seems obvious that on balance it justifies some caution   about upside risk to growth and more than the usual humility about what we know about slack   and trend labor force growth  But I don’t think it fundamentally offers a compelling case on its   own for a substantial change to the inflation forecast or the risks to that forecast    Is there any new information on structural productivity growth?  Not in our view  We’re   still fairly comfortable with the staff view of around 2 percent or 2½ percent for the nonfarm   business sector  I’m not a great fan of the anecdote, but I’ll cite just one  If you ask people who   make stuff for a living on a substantial scale, it’s hard to find any concern that they are seeing   diminished capacity to extract greater productivity growth in their core businesses  That’s not a   general observation, just a small one    Have the inflation risks changed meaningfully in either direction?  I think the recent   behavior of the core numbers and of expectations is reassuring  The market doesn’t seem   particularly concerned about inflation, and the market is therefore vulnerable to a negative   surprise, to a series of higher numbers  Can we be confident we’ll get enough moderation with   the current level of long-term expectations prevailing in markets, with the expected path of slack   in the economy, and with the range of potential forces that might operate on relative prices—  January 30-31, 2007 69 of 255    energy, import, and other prices?  Again, I think this forecast still seems reasonable, but we can’t   be that confident, and we need to be concerned still about the range of sources of vulnerability of   that forecast  Another way to frame this question is, Is the inflation forecast consistent with the   current expectations for the path of monetary policy acceptable to the Committee?  We haven’t   fully confronted that issue because we don’t get much moderation with a monetary policy   assumption that’s close to what’s in the markets  But I don’t think there’s a compelling case to   act at this stage in a way that forces convergence on that  In other words, how tight is monetary   policy, and how tight are overall financial conditions today?  I don’t think there’s a very strong   case for us to induce more tightness or more accommodation than now prevails  There’s a good   case for patience and for giving ourselves a fair amount of flexibility going forward, within the   context of an asymmetric signal about the balance of risks and a basic judgment that we view the   costs of a more adverse inflation outcome as the predominant concern of the Committee      This is more an observation than it is a question  I   guess I’m a little uncomfortable the way you framed, just in the paper, exhibit 3, in the sense that   I don’t think it would be great if we came to view alternative B in the statement as, in a sense,   validating a higher implicit inflation objective than members of the Committee heretofore talked   about   It is true that, with the stance of policy implied in markets today, under reasonable   assumptions you may not get below 2 percent any time soon  But if you have different   assumptions about the structure of the economy, about the way inflation works in this economy,   January 30-31, 2007 96 of 255    or different views about the period that’s optimal for bringing inflation down, it’s plausible that   you could have a forecast that gets inflation below 2 percent with the stance of policy not   dramatically different from what’s in the Greenbook  I know that you didn’t mean to imply that,   but I don’t think it would be good for us to create a sense of validating the monetary policy   expectations that are in the markets or in the Greenbook  We would be accepting that we have   allowed our implicit objective to drift up      Mr Chairman?      May I ask a clarifying question?  It’s not actually clear   to me, really, that alternative C, section 3—the inflation section—is more hawkish than   alternative B      So you were speaking in its favor not because it is   more hawkish but for what reason?       My concern is that, as the Chairman has said, if you   look at the three-month annualized rate for a whole bunch of measures of core, “elevated” might   be overstating it a bit      I tried to qualify my comment with as many qualifiers   as I could  I didn’t mean to imply that the Committee had an implicit objective    I’m not sure I understand, Jeff   With regard to   section 4, what is your preference?      Well, no, I’d just make the observation that we   debated this before and we debated several times the question about whether the best   introductory phrase to that balance of risk assessment was exactly that language  The problem in   doing it now—this is just one man’s view—is that I think it will be read as a significant   alteration of our signal, and on the strength of what we’ve discussed about changes to the   outlook in December, we can’t justify a significant change in the signal  The second reason not   to do it is the one that the Chairman raised  It introduces a slightly infelicitous framing when   there is some risk that people will read everything we say through the prism of whether we’re in   the midst of altering implicitly the hierarchy of objectives that we have as a Committee in some   broad sense  That’s not the way you framed it, Mr Chairman      But I think we haven’t changed our view of the   outlook enough to justify that significant a change in the signal       Thank you, Mr Chairman  The most important thing for   us to do today, and it’s really the only thing we need to do, is to convey a sense that, on the basis of   recent data, we see somewhat less downside risk to growth and maybe somewhat less upside risk to   inflation  But the principal issue we face is whether we’re going to see inflation come down far   enough with the current constellation of financial conditions, which we’ve helped induce  That’s   the issue that we will be debating for some time  It’s possible, maybe probable, that we will have to   tighten further, but we don’t know that yet  I don’t think we need to change our basic signal about   the probability that we’re going to have to tighten more, and I’m very comfortable with the   language in alternative B  Of course, all the alternatives are flawed  Alternative B seems the least   flawed among the alternatives  An interesting question is whether referring to current core inflation   as elevated today is helpful  You could amend B(3) to say, “Although core inflation remains   elevated, recent readings on core inflation have improved modestly in recent months”  But you   can’t really do that without doing what Don suggested—that is, distinguishing more clearly between   a twelve-month and a three-month rate—and it’s hard to argue that doing so is really worthwhile    So I’m comfortable with alternative B as it is drafted now     I’m not sure we’ve done this consciously, but the way   the discussion in the minutes has evolved in the past several cycles is that we’ve made an effort not   January 30-31, 2007 125 of 255    to provide more nuance in the policy signal that is in that last paragraph  In fact, we’ve adopted the   simplifying convention of pretty much repeating the part of the policy statement that is supposed to   signal a judgment about what policy is likely to be going forward  The minutes provide—and this is   valuable—a much more textured sense than the statement can about the central tendency of the   Committee’s view of the future  I don’t think it makes sense for us to try to agree now to provide in   the minutes more texture about what’s, in effect, an elaboration of the risk assessment in section 4    It is hard to do while negotiating the minutes and there’s not much virtue in trying to do it  All the   emphasis should go toward making sure that we characterize the sense of the Committee about the   rationale for our decision, which essentially concerns how our view of the outlook has changed and   what the variance of views is around that     I don’t think it’s a problem regarding that penultimate   paragraph of the minutes, in which the staff tries to capture the texture of what people say about   their thoughts on what policy is likely to do  But in the basic framing paragraph at the end, which is   designed to capture whatever we as a Committee are willing to say about what’s likely, we’ve tried   not to elaborate on or add nuance to the basic statement  So I guess I’m agreeing with you, Jeff  I   would have thought that the penultimate paragraph might describe whatever the range of views is   about that but not try to capture the consensus of the Committee     Just answers  [Laughter]     You said one thing that surprised me, Jeff  You began   by saying that the objective should be to help reduce the public’s uncertainty about future   macroeconomic outcomes generally  Now, I can see that we have some capacity to reduce the   public’s uncertainty about what inflation is going to be over time, but is it realistic for us to have as   an objective to reduce broader uncertainty in the public about macroeconomic outcomes?  Is that an   achievable or desirable objective for communications?  We can maybe reduce our uncertainty about   what we think about what those outcomes are, but even we don’t know much about the dimensions   of the future     Sorry, Mr Chairman  May I just try this again?  I   interpret you as saying that you infer a central tendency from this process you outlined     You discern a central tendency of the Committee about   our view about GDP or unemployment     Then you attach some other method for framing   uncertainty based on past forecast errors—for example, of FRB/US, Greenbook, Blue Chip, or   somebody else     But, no, it can’t be that either  That’s a little different,   isn’t it?   January 30-31, 2007 160 of 255      But you’re not suggesting that we try to aggregate or ask   the staff to aggregate our own uncertainties that we convey with our own individual forecasts, right?     Do you have a sense, a reasonable expectation, of   when you think we’ll try to stop?  It’s very important, but we could do this for days       Thank you, Mr Chairman  I want to say just a few   things quickly about internal transparency, about the analytical framework that we use to make   decisions about monetary policy, and then about the external dimension of the forecast process    First, on internal transparency, I think that it makes sense for us to be a little more   explicit with each other about assumptions underpinning the forecast that we bring to the table    That’s why I circulated the note—just to lay it out there in a clear way  Without that   information, it is very hard for us to know, when we are debating what to do, what we are really   debating  Generally, being more explicit with each other in private—discreetly—about the   conditioning assumptions that are important to our forecasts, about what we mean by   “appropriate policy,” about why and where we differ from the Greenbook, how we see the   balance of risks, and maybe, if we can, at least a qualitative sense of uncertainty would be useful   and would enrich the conversation    On the analytical framework for monetary policy, I just have two suggestions, one I’m   going to repeat from our last conversation  The first is that I think we need to broaden the set of   analytical tools the staff gives us now at each meeting to think about the consequences of   alternative views in the forecast of different monetary policy choices and so forth  You give us a   January 30-31, 2007 205 of 255    range of things now that are very helpful  The two things we don’t get now fall in the following   categories  One is that you don’t give us a simple way to look at what it might mean for an   inflation forecast and an optimal policy exercise if you have a very different view about   structural inertia in inflation—not that there’s any great way to do that now, given the state of the   art—but it would be nice to have a way we could distinguish a little more clearly what a   backward-looking, highly inertial view about inflation fundamentals means for the way we think   about the forecast and monetary policy and what a more forward-looking view of inflation   determination means  That’s one area in which having something broader would be helpful,   even if it’s a set of highly simplified, highly imperfect analytical prisms, reference frameworks,   or reference models  The other thing that we don’t get now is a way to think through how we   make more explicit choices about the appropriate period, for example, for bringing inflation   down to a more comfortable level  That’s, of course, an important way to tease out what   people’s different loss functions or reaction functions are  Right now we aren’t really presented   with, for example, a set of alternative horizons for bringing inflation back down to target and   what that would mean for the rest of the things that are important to us  Those are two areas in   which it would be helpful to have a broader set of reference frameworks to underpin our   conversation of monetary policy  That’s an important investment to make if we’re going to do   anything to change our current regime—whether in the direction of an explicit quantitative   objective for the definition of price stability over the long run, even with no horizon, and   certainly if we’re going to evolve in how we publicly describe our forecast    My second suggestion echoes a suggestion that Randy Kroszner made before  I think   that we would benefit from spending a bit more time as a Committee on thinking through what   we understand about inflation, both how it is captured in the model the staff uses and what are   January 30-31, 2007 206 of 255    the important distinctions between our views on these questions  We don’t go very deeply into   those distinctions—just a little  You can see this in both President Plosser’s and President   Lacker’s descriptions of their views of the forecast because they have a lower inflation forecast   than the staff has without a very different view about unemployment and with a modestly tighter   monetary policy  The case for that view deserves some reflection, and we don’t spend a lot of   time talking through that  That’s an important investment to make if we’re going to be more   explicit in public about choices concerning, for example, how fast we want to bring inflation   down to our objective    Two small things on that ground would be helpful when the staff comes back to prepare   for the discussion in March about inflation objectives  First, a short treatment about the issue of   what makes the United States different would be interesting  We have a lot of international   experience to look at, but we’re not Norway, and we’re not New Zealand  I don’t know how to   think through that interesting issue  I’m not sure it’s right, but I don’t think we can dismiss it out   of hand, and I’d like some help thinking it through  Another small thing, to elaborate on a   discussion that Janet, Don, and I had on the margins  If you could tell us a bit about what the   past forecast error is of the mean FOMC forecast and how that compares to the Greenbook   forecast error, that information would be interesting to have  It’s a small thing        Good  And about forecast error?        Finally, I have just a few quick points about the   external dimension of the discussion  I’m in favor of exploring a narrative that describes the   story of the Committee’s central tendency about the outlook  It’s worth doing, and the range of   January 30-31, 2007 207 of 255    issues on the table today in that direction I feel really quite comfortable with  I’m in favor of   doing it quarterly, but I wouldn’t want to make that decision without thinking through very   carefully whether it makes sense  I would want to explore different ways of expressing the   variance across the Committee  I like the histogram approach  I’d even be open to the fan chart   device, as Janet described it, for trying to capture different forms of uncertainty  I don’t think we   should try to agree as a Committee on a path for what appropriate policy means  Therefore, I   would not be in favor of working toward disclosing an agreed-upon path, for many of the reasons   that are familiar to all of us  I want to experiment with a minutes-like iterative process for   coming to some level of comfort with how that central tendency is described, but I’d be willing   to give the Chairman the role of final arbiter of what gets presented, to save the staff from   endless negotiation    I think the horizon question is very interesting  I was inclined to think that three years   makes sense  A concern I have about three years—apart from the one that Janet raised, which is   that it probably tells you only a little about your view of potential or your objective, and it may   not have much information beyond that—is the following  If we’re thinking about the merits of   a regime in which we will not have a defined period that we commit to for bringing inflation   back to target, we need to be comfortable with showing a forecast that maybe has inflation above   target for possibly a significant period of time  If the period is two years, it will be easier not to   get ourselves in a position in which we feel compelled to show a more acute decline in that path    If we’re at three years, it will be harder to avoid that  We will be uncomfortable, I think, if we’re   in a three-year regime going for sustained periods with inflation staying outside that range    Therefore, I am a bit tentative about three years   January 30-31, 2007 208 of 255     Whatever we do, we should experiment first  We should be careful not do any damage to   a staff forecasting process that has worked very, very well and serves the Committee very, very   well  Also, we should recognize the ignorance we all live with and should be careful not to start   down a road that would give the markets false comfort, a false sense of precision, false   confidence in our view of the world, and all those other things many people have spoken about    Let me say something about skepticism  Skepticism is a very important virtue, but its   virtue is not in the service of inertia  Its virtue is in the service of trying to figure out how we   can improve what we do and how to save ourselves from mistakes along the way  So I don’t   want to be “outskepticked” by anybody  [Laughter]   I think it’s important to think about it that   way    As all this implies, I don’t think it makes sense to have uniform conditioning assumptions   imposed on our individual forecasts, certainly not uniform conditioning assumptions on the   monetary policy path, but also not on any of the important dimensions that are the focus      As President Hoenig’s suggestion, President   Moskow’s suggestion, and your suggestion implied, there is a range of variance around that, and   that’s one of the things we’ll have to work through as well as how this fits within a set of existing   processes and disclosures that we’re going to preserve      You made a distinction at the beginning between   something that was fundamental and something that was about a change in risk perception  Just   conceptually, how do you distinguish between those two things?  Is the latter something that you   can’t attribute to a change in observable economic conditions?     I guess my question is, How do you know?     You don’t know  Thank you     Mr Chairman, may I follow up?     Bill, one of the factors you said that might account for   the gap between the primary dealer expectations about the fed funds rate at different horizons and   the average market pricing might be the flight to quality  It’s not quite a flight to quality, but it   reflects the demand for safer assets      A flight to liquidity or something like that  Do you think   the same story might account for what happened in far forward interest rates in the Treasury market   as well?  Would you say that perhaps the same kind of phenomenon might account for that?     Let me just say for the record that I don’t think Bill is   saying that the market is mispricing the value     I think he is just saying that the primary dealers whom   we survey, who are a strange group, [laughter] have a view that’s somewhat different from the view   of the markets     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Our view of the outlook has   changed since our last meeting, but more in the balance of risks and the sources of uncertainty than   in our actual forecast for growth  But just to go through the changes quickly, we’ve reduced our   forecast for growth in ’07 a bit, to something less than 3 percent, and we see more downside risks to   that forecast  We’ve moved up the expected path of core PCE inflation just a bit in light of recent   numbers, but we have maintained essentially the same view as before—that inflation will moderate   to around 2 percent by the end of this year and a bit below that in ’08  We see the risk to this   forecast still to the upside  We face greater uncertainty about the near-term outlook than we have   over the past few meetings  Looking to the medium term, although we haven’t yet reduced our   estimate of potential growth, we’re a bit more concerned than we’ve been about the strength of   March 20-21, 2007 55 of 196    underlying structural productivity growth going forward  We have also changed our view of the   appropriate path of policy a bit, introducing a gentle move down now in the fed funds rate   beginning around the middle of the year  So this puts us a bit below the assumed path in the   Greenbook, but we assume a slower, smaller reduction in the nominal fed funds rate than the market   does today  Our forecast is quite close to that of the staff’s in the Greenbook, and the basic story is   similar  Our differences are the same as they have been for some time—we have slightly more   growth and slightly lower inflation  That reflects things we talked about before, different views   about information dynamics and about potential growth  Our view of the output gap and its   evolution, however, is similar   I have just a few points on some issues  On the growth front, the recent numbers suggest   both a deeper adjustment in housing and a broader weakness in the economy than we anticipated,   notably in capital goods orders  The effect of these developments on our forecast is not that large,   however  Their significance is more in the risk to the outlook and the uncertainty, the puzzle that   the investment weakness presents for the medium term  On housing and consumption, the   probability of the dark scenario is still small, but it is higher than it has been and deserves some   attention  The dark scenario is the risk that the reduction in credit to the household sector amplifies   the decline in housing demand, which leads to a greater adjustment in prices, with a risk of a more-  pronounced, prolonged decline in growth and spending  Monetary policy should not be directed at   trying to put a floor on housing demand or on prices, only at limiting the risk that the weakness   accumulates substantially or spreads to overall demand  Regarding capital spending, we just don’t   have a good explanation for why—with margins that are still pretty good, reasonable earnings   growth, solid growth in aggregate demand here and globally, relatively low interest rates, and   reasonable levels of business confidence—spending has continued to come in well below our   March 20-21, 2007 56 of 196    expectations  This series of disappointments, of course, has been going on for some time; it’s not   just about the latest numbers for durable goods orders  Perhaps this situation will prove transitory,   but it justifies a bit more caution to the outlook  Of these two risks—in housing and in   investment—I’d say the latter matters more and is potentially more consequential  But both of these   effects are offset, in our basic view, by the expected strength in personal income growth going   forward, by what are still fairly favorable overall financial conditions, and by fairly robust external   demand   Regarding productivity, productivity growth per quarter at an annualized rate has, over the   past ten quarters, come in significantly below 2 percent, kind of close to the estimates of the trend   rate for the period between ’73 and ’95  Some of the analysts who spend a lot of time thinking   about this are starting to lose conviction that trend growth is still in the neighborhood of 2½ percent   for the nonfarm business sector  We’re still viewing the recent weakness as transitory or cyclical,   but the risk that trend growth is below our estimate is, I think, increasing   On inflation, despite the higher recent numbers, not much has really changed in our view    We still expect core PCE to move to below 2 percent over the forecast period, and we still see the   risk as not getting quite that moderation  The sources of the recent negative surprises in the core   data, which seem concentrated in medical services, probably don’t say much about monetary policy   or broader inflation dynamics, and inflation expectations remain stable at reasonable levels  So our   view of the growth outlook has changed a bit, but our view of the inflation outlook hasn’t changed   much based on these numbers   On the markets, as many people have said and as Bill discussed at the beginning, I don’t see   much that’s been troubling thus far  Although correlations across asset markets have risen, overall   liquidity seems fine  There’s been very limited contagion from mortgages into other credit markets    March 20-21, 2007 57 of 196    Debt issuance seems to be continuing  People are able to raise money to finance corporate   restructuring investment  There is very little concern, I think, about substantial losses, on the basis   of what’s happened to date, in the core of the financial system and very limited evidence of stress   among the various funds  But it’s still early in some ways, and the fundamental outlook for growth   is a bit weaker and more uncertain  Risk premiums, credit spreads, and volatility still look   potentially vulnerable to a more substantial reversal  The weakness in the subprime market will   take some time to work through the full range of securities issued against pools of collateral that   include mortgages  The complexity in valuing structured mortgage products, the difficulty in   designing hedges that actually work against exposure to that risk, and uncertainty about the shape of   the adverse tail and that part of the credit spectrum are all conditions that apply to a range of other   structured credit markets and credit products  In the debate about the implications of this prolonged   yield-curve inversion, we have tended to side with those who have found comfort in the contrary   signal you see in lower levels of risk premiums and credit spreads  Yet it’s possible that the forces   that may have been holding down forward rates are also holding down credit spreads and holding up   the value of other assets and, therefore, may be masking weakness in the economy rather than   masking strength   On balance, although the outlook still looks fundamentally positive, we see a more   complicated and less benign set of risks to the outlook, more downside risks to growth, and some   continued concern that we won’t get enough moderation in inflation  To us, this outlook justifies a   stance of policy with a path for the fed funds rate somewhat above what is now priced into the   markets  This doesn’t mean, in our view, that we need to signal that nominal rates going forward   are more likely to rise than to fall from current levels; it means only that we should convey the sense   that our view of the most likely evolution of policy still implies a higher path than is now priced into   March 20-21, 2007 58 of 196    the markets  We can afford to be patient before adjusting policy, as Sandy said, but we need to have   as much flexibility as possible going forward  This suggests that we acknowledge that the overall   balance of risks has shifted a bit toward neutral, toward a flat stance of policy, but not all the way   there  A delicate task for us is to do this without inducing a reaction in the market that pulls forward   significantly more easing than has already occurred       Do we have any precedent, Vince, for reference to   financial conditions described as favorable or otherwise?  We’ve said that it’s supported by   accommodative policy     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’m very comfortable with   the center of gravity in this discussion  The boundaries have shifted just a bit, and we face a little   more uncertainty on the growth front  But I think there’s still asymmetry in the balance of risks that   we face, and we need to continue to highlight the risk that inflation may not moderate enough  The   probability that we will tighten further has significantly diminished, but I think our expectations   about what makes sense for policy are still above the market’s expectations  I don’t think that   situation means that we need to try to push the market’s expectations up to ours  By adjusting the   statement slightly in the direction of neutral, we face the risk that we all acknowledge that the   market will price in more easing than they already have  But it is better to live with that risk than to   preserve a formulation that implies a probability of further tightening that I don’t think is justified    We need to give ourselves the flexibility now to move to neutral sooner than might have seemed   likely  Therefore, the broad outlines of alternative B make sense to me   March 20-21, 2007 102 of 196    On section 2, as Don said, the reason for putting more texture about the basis for our   forecast going forward was, in part, to counteract the fact that we’re suddenly darker about the near-  term outlook  The absence of any texture on our forecast makes the statement darker and conveys   more concern  So although I like minimalism and although a lot of sensible things have been said   about the specific references to financial conditions and housing, I think there’s some value in   having more texture about the basis for our view  I’m not as troubled about the reference to   financial conditions as many of you are  We could modify the rationale to say “supported by   income gains, overall financial conditions, and the gradual waning” so that the characterization of   financial conditions is implicit rather than explicitly favorable  But I don’t think that doing so   would go far in meeting the concerns expressed around the table  So I would be fine with the   Moskow formulation, stopping after “quarters”  I think the rest of the wording has it right   On “predominant” versus “principal,” let me give just the following argument  I don’t   believe that a plain language reading of the two words justifies the conclusion that “principal” will   be read as softer than “predominant”  People disagree, and in answering the question about what   we expect to achieve by changing “predominant” to “principal,” I’m not sure we’d win the basic   argument that people would say, “Yeah, it’s softer”  So, on the argument of consistency, I would   stay with “predominant”  I don’t think our views of the risks on the inflation front have shifted   significantly since the testimony, and so I don’t have any problem with maintaining that  Thank   you, Mr Chairman     Mr Chairman     That wording has the virtue of being true in that it is the   basis for the central forecast     It is what we think  The problem with it is that, as Don   said, the reference to gains in income itself is empty, and putting so much emphasis on housing as   part of our forecast for growth being basically fine going forward is a little awkward  My view is   the corner solutions are more attractive than the intermediate, and they are either some modified   version of what we have now or a return to minimalism with a stop after “quarters”     Considerable uncertainty has surrounded our forecast of   inflation for some time  That’s how we refer to the fact that there are inflation risks  We have now   changed the characterization of the statement to acknowledge the fact that the recent readings have   been somewhat elevated  That implicitly acknowledges that there’s some uncertainty to our   forecast  I don’t think it’s a justifiable change  I don’t think there is substantial increase in our   uncertainty about the inflation forecast today versus January or even December     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I think three things about our   current regime are worth reflecting on as to whether we can improve them  They are, first, the lack   of clarity that exists about how we define our objective; second, the relative lack of texture that we   provide about the outlook and the risks that underpin our decisions relative to some other central   banks; and third, the way we run our internal conversation  In all these areas, because institutions   are subject to inertia, we’re probably short of the frontier of the achievable, but I think it’s worth   thinking about whether we can get closer to the frontier  I just want to raise some questions that I   think are the hardest for us to work through in figuring out how we should evolve—and I think we   should evolve   The first issue is about the balance between the benefits of the regime and the costs  The   problem we face is that, based on what we know about the theory and the experience, the gains on   expectations relative to what we have already achieved as a central bank look pretty small  I think   there’s a broad consensus that they’re small  There’s a greater dispersion of views about what the   costs are  Some of them are transition costs—how you get where you’re going and the political   issues that surround that  Some of the costs are more uncertainty about the effect on how you   operate going forward  The difficulty in judging the balance between what we think we know about   the potential gains and those costs is that it’s hard to narrow uncertainty around the costs even after   looking at the experience of other central banks  As many people have said, the experience of other   central banks is pretty reassuring as to the costs  It’s hard to argue that they are worse off because   they have achieved this in terms of outcomes  But some of that uncertainty is difficult to narrow ex   ante, and a lot of it will depend on judgments that we make about the design of the regime  But   even those judgments won’t fully answer the questions because, even if we tied them down now,   March 20-21, 2007 173 of 196    they would still leave some uncertainty about the effect on our incentives, our behavior, and our   management of a regime that will have much more exacting demands on communication     This problem is magnified by the fact that it is hard for us to adopt a regime with an explicit,   fixed, relatively short horizon and to justify it as consistent not only with the dual mandate and the   politics that surround that, but also—based on what we know about the experience of other central   banks—with making sensible decisions about monetary policy that has multiple objectives over   time  I don’t think that outcome is realistic for us as a Committee  Therefore, you’re talking about   a range of options that are much toward the softer end—no fixed horizon, a horizon that varies   according to the circumstances  The gains are going to look more tenuous That’s one issue that I   think is interesting for us to think through   The second issue concerns the initial conditions and the transition costs  If you’re going to   adopt an objective that’s different from what people think your objective is and different from what   best estimates of trend core inflation or trend inflation are today, those conditions and costs are very   complicated  The dialogue between Rick and Jeff was very interesting  Both choices that exist   today, if we were going to launch today, look very unattractive  You can basically decide that you   will pick a target that’s pretty close to what your judgment is about trend because that is slightly   above what the market infers our objective is  To validate a higher objective than what they have   been inferring is awkward and hard to see  It would be easy to say that you’re going to adopt an   objective substantially lower than that and believe that it would be easy for us to make it a simple,   compelling political endeavor to achieve  So I think that issues about timing, initial conditions, and   transition costs are very important and complicated to work through  But I thought you did a nice   job of laying out the obvious issues on both sides   March 20-21, 2007 174 of 196    The third issue that I think is interesting is the question about the strength of the consensus   necessary to go forward and how you deal with it  I think you’d need a very strong consensus to go   forward  Some would view this change in regime by the Fed as the most significant since   Humphrey-Hawkins, maybe since well before Humphrey-Hawkins, and so you’d want to have a   very strong consensus  When you decide, on the strength of that consensus, you had better move   forward  You have to have agreement  People have to agree that they’re going to operate under   that regime, and I think we will, in effect, need to bind our successors to operate within that regime    Even if you have a regime in which, because of the legal or practical circumstances surrounding the   institution, you have to have a periodic reaffirmation of that objective, in effect you’re binding our   successors because we all agree that once you do this you can’t go back  We can’t contemplate the   possibility that we’re going to adjust it in response to the changing preferences of different   Committees over time   The fourth issue that I think is interesting for us is that we have to design a process of   internal deliberation before launch that allows us to get more comfortable with the way we would   operate  The aspects of our internal decisionmaking process that are least well suited to operating   comfortably in any of the variants of the regime that we’ve been discussing are the lack of clarity   that we live with about what our individual preferences are, about how that informs our different   views about the structure, about how we inform our choices about appropriate, desirable paths for   inflation, and about what monetary policy we think is consistent with that  As we’ve been   discussing, we need to bring a little more internal clarity to that conversation  We need to know   why we’re disagreeing when we disagree if we’re going to be better at thinking through difficult   choices  There is also the related gap in how we talk about this stuff today, as Don Kohn said    Even if you only talk about a regime toward which you may be leaning or publicly disclose things   March 20-21, 2007 175 of 196    about your forecast or move in the direction of a quantitative definition of inflation, we’re going to   have to have a more explicit conversation about what we think is the appropriate path or slope of the   path  Even if we don’t want to adopt a fixed horizon that varies over time and have that embedded   in what we disclose about our forecast, we’re going to have to have more explicit conversations   about what we think is an adequate, acceptable path toward trend  That is a complicated   conversation to have, and in my brief experience on the Committee, we haven’t spent much time   thinking about those kinds of choices  We’d prefer to live with squishiness, lack of definition, and   ambiguity around those kinds of things because it is easier  I don’t think we’d have that option in a   regime in which we’re moving toward more-frequent disclosure, three-year forecasts, and a central   tendency of a path for these kinds of things  So my fourth issue is that we need to be careful in   thinking through how we’re going to get comfortable with the evolution in our internal regime that’s   going to be necessary to live within these kinds of regimes before we launch   My last point is—I’m not sure how to describe this—about the stability in any proposal we   adopt  We’re all going to be tempted to soften the edges of what we’re agreeing on to make the   consensus as broad as possible  We need to be careful that, if we adopt the intermediate things, we   look at them and think they will stand up pretty well to external criticism and that we’re not going to   find ourselves uncomfortable with having moved to that intermediate position  I think we’re going   to get pulled naturally further toward more clarity  The discussion about the past—for example,   whether we reveal the conditioning assumptions of our forecast—is the best example of that  That’s   one instance in which you might decide that it’s expedient to agree today that we’re going to have   an unstated, undisclosed, appropriate policy conditioning assumption for a forecast that has more   clarity  But over time, as we’ve seen in other cases, there’s going to be a lot of pressure to say, “But   what does this tell us really?  We don’t really understand this”  So we want to think through this   March 20-21, 2007 176 of 196    question about how to do something that is going to look stable over time  It doesn’t mean we have   to fix it and say we would never evolve beyond that  But if we know we’re going to adopt   something that’s going to be unstable and subject to pressure to move, let’s try to think through a bit   in advance how we’d anticipate that pressure and respond to it  We can make the same point about   the importance of thinking through the sequence of any evolution  I take Rick’s point about the   importance of being evolutionary in that respect  Just as an example, if we decide that we want to   go first with the transparency around our forecast before consensus or clarity on a quantitative   objective as publicly announced, we should be sure that we think that’s an optimal chain of   decisions, too  So the questions about sequence are going to be important to work through  I have a   bunch of comments on the initial proposal for a narrative description of our forecast and the way   uncertainty is captured  But if the Chairman permits, I will submit those directly to the staff for the   record     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Our outlook has changed   very little  As in March, we see the expansion continuing, with growth moving back up to   potential—we see potential around 3 percent—later this year  This view rests on the familiar   expectations  Housing stabilizes relatively soon without a major drop in prices; investment   spending strengthens somewhat as the temporary factors holding it down recede and positive   fundamentals reassert themselves; consumption moderates a bit but continues to be supported by   strong income growth; the saving rate moves up but only modestly and slowly; and external   demand remains strong  We still expect inflation to moderate gradually to a rate just below   May 9, 2007 49 of 130    2 percent for the core PCE by the end of ’08  We view the recent numbers as somewhat   reassuring  Recent data in general have provided a bit more comfort for this scenario  On   balance, the downside risks to growth have diminished a bit  The risk that inflation will fail to   moderate sufficiently, however, remains significant and material  But in general, the overall   outlook, in our view, hasn’t changed that much   Now, our forecast assumes that we hold the fed funds rate where it is for a while  Our   expected path is above the market’s but below the Greenbook’s  We’re below the Greenbook   because, although our expected forecast is really similar, we attach somewhat greater weight to   alternative scenarios that suggest slower growth  The recent growth numbers have been, on   balance, encouraging, and the markets are a bit more confident about the outlook than they were    But I still think the downside risks to growth are significant  Housing could still surprise on the   downside, and we could see a deeper, more protracted contraction in activity and, of course,   broadly based more-substantial declines in prices  Consumption could be weaker for this reason   or because the saving rate rises for other reasons, such as pessimism about long-run income   growth  The household sector is substantially more leveraged than it was, and it has less of a   cushion to absorb shocks and, therefore, presents some risk of amplifying rather than mitigating   broader weakness in the economy  Although a bit better than it was in March, the investment   outlook is still a bit tenuous, and it seems unlikely to be a substantial source of strength if   broader weakness in demand in the rest of the economy materializes  The most rapidly growing   parts of the world are growing well above potential and face rising inflation and substantial   asset-price inflation, and I think the authorities there are generally starting tentatively to tighten   policy more significantly   May 9, 2007 50 of 130    On the inflation front, we still face substantial uncertainty about what is happening to   underlying trends and how they will evolve  The broader inflation environment is, if anything,   less benign than it has been over the past three quarters, with inflation accelerating a little outside   the United States, energy and commodity prices continuing to show signs of rapid demand   growth, the dollar potentially weakening further, compensation here firming a bit, and   productivity growth probably staying a bit below what we thought was trend  In this context,   with inflation still running about 2 percent, inflation expectations could drift up   Continuing on the risks for a bit, I still think we live with a significant risk of a sharp   deterioration in financial markets  Credit spreads, other risk premiums, low levels of implied   volatility, and the strength of asset prices in many parts of the world—all imply a level of   confidence in ongoing, stable growth and low inflation that seems a bit implausible  In addition,   the low level of long forward rates seems hard to reconcile with the strength of demand growth   outside the United States, suggesting that much of the world is likely to need to move further   toward tighter monetary policy  As financial conditions exert more restraint on demand growth   globally, we could see a rapid unwinding of this long period of very benign assessment of   fundamental risks  We, of course, face some risk of policy actions here in the form of trade or   investment protection  This risk, against the backdrop of some uncertainty about the strength of   productivity growth going forward, might make the rest of the world less comfortable financing   our still-large external balance on the favorable terms that have prevailed thus far   On the longer-term outlook for potential in the United States, we are sticking with our   forecast of 3 percent, but we have altered the mix a bit, just as the Greenbook has in some sense;   however, we feel a little less comfortable with our basic view about potential  We lowered our   productivity growth assumption a bit, to 225 for the nonfarm business sector, and raised our   May 9, 2007 51 of 130    estimate of trend hours a bit  If potential is lower than we’re assuming, then we are less likely to   see the moderation of inflation that we currently expect, but we would expect a lower path for   output growth as well  At this stage, however, in view of the strength in income growth that   we’ve seen, earning expectations, and other measures, we’re reluctant to embrace a more   negative view about growth in potential   On balance, in view of these risks, I favor staying where we are for a while  I don’t think   there is a very strong case for tightening policy or for inducing a significant rise in market   expectations about the path of the fed funds rate going forward, nor do I think now that we’re at   risk of being too tight  So, in general, I think the best choice for us is to continue to lean against   the expectation that we will move to reduce rates soon  Thank you     Sorry?  Which was a little more?     It would be a more hawkish signal than a statement with   “on balance”?       Mr Chairman  In the same vein, may I just ask a   question about the likely conclusion that people would draw from the change in the second section?    It has the virtue of truth  [Laughter]  You could interpret it, relative to March, as a softer   characterization of the recent news  It goes in a slightly different direction from the center-of-  gravity of this discussion, which is to say that indicators have actually been mixed  They are   sometimes a little softer or sometimes a little stronger, but we think there is maybe a slightly thinner   adverse tail in the growth outcome than we had thought in March  I am not particularly troubled by   that  But, Vince, do you think that this would be the plausible reading by the market to the change?    How would they interpret the intent of the change in section 2?     Mr Chairman, may I ask just a clarifying question on   this discussion?     Don raised the obvious question, which is whether we   want to introduce the characterization of uncertainty on one piece of our outlook but not the other    But, Gary, did you suggest that uncertainty about the inflation forecast is greater today than it was in   March?       But is your rationale mostly about greater uncertainty, or   is it mostly a continued aversion to implicit reference to the output gap as being a significant force?     I don’t know that it will help  [Laughter]     I think we’re in a fairly good place in terms of the   policy and the signal  The language in March and in alternative B today preserves a nice balance   between the need to signal concern that we may not get as much moderation in inflation as we’d   like and acknowledgement of some of the dispersion of views around the Committee on what our   ultimate objective should be, what our preferences are, and over what period we’d like to see   inflation come down to whatever level  It also gives us more flexibility  I would not want to   jeopardize that balance today  I don’t see any compelling need to alter market expectations   today, and as I said, I am quite comfortable with alternative B     Just on the latter, deeper conversation about where we’re going in June—things will   change between now and June  June will be interesting, I suspect, even if it unfolds in the way   the forecast implies  But ultimately our judgment is about whether we have an acceptable   forecast for inflation  It’s whether the path going forward is acceptable to us in some sense, and   that’s what our discussion should be about  Of course, you can’t separate that from where   inflation is today because that’s where you’re starting  But as Rick and many others have   consistently reminded us, the language is about the forward-looking effects of policy today, or as   May 9, 2007 101 of 130    they are built into market expectations, or as we assume today for the expected path of inflation   going forward  But I like B and would be averse to changing it     You know, we’re going to have to talk through a lot of   substantive issues on this  I thought, if we’re going to do it, let’s do it now  But you’ve all   raised some of those questions  I’m looking at the clock  My suggestion is this  I don’t know   what we are planning for June—June is a two-day meeting, right?     So I don’t think we can have these conversations   before the next round  Let’s make sure that we give ourselves time in June and beyond so we   can start to talk through this—so that those who didn’t speak today about their initial reactions   aren’t left without the opportunity to engage in this because there’s a whole range of things we   could address, including the three issues raised so far     I was going to follow up on Cathy’s point, but I   think Don is, too     I agree with all of that, but the relative size is   much smaller—much narrower in the type of positions to which they’re exposed  The state   of the world is dramatically different  Direct exposure of the counterparties to Bear Stearns   is very, very small compared with other things  Bill is exactly right  These guys are making   a loan against a set of positions—a right to those positions—not equity, and what they   realize in the value of those positions over time will be determined  They think there is   positive value in that  So the situation is dramatically different  It does not mean that you   should view it as particularly reassuring  You know, these people were exceptionally   experienced in the mortgage credit business, and there were smart people in LTCM, too   [Laughter]     But these guys were regarded as very smart   people, who knew the business well, and this is just a good example of how little one can   know in some sense and what leverage does to your exposure to liquidity risk  In this case,   people were just not willing to give them the time to realize whatever value might be in   these positions, and this is just a natural consequence of leverage  People think they had   substantially less leverage than LTCM had in some sense, but that is hard to measure     I don’t think, Richard, you need to be in a   position to offer an opinion on what happened in Bear Stearns in particular  I don’t think   you need to or want to be in the business of doing that in that particular case  Regarding a   broader understanding about the implications of what we see in these markets, Bear Stearns   is relevant also in some broader sense  There is obviously value in trying to make sure that   people have as much understanding as they can  My suspicion is that you are going to find   yourself where most people are on this, which is with some differing mix of unease and   reassurance that you’re not going to resolve fundamentally until we get through the next   period of excitement     Thank you  We are happy to share all the   information we have about the specific case and its broad implications with everybody—in   confidence, of course     But to make sure that is right, the red lines are   subprime?     Subprime are?     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The outlook looks a   little better, I think  The United States looks okay, and the world looks very strong    Housing here seems as though it will get worse before it gets better, but the rest of the   economy seems to be doing reasonably well—with output and investment spending perhaps   a bit firmer than we thought they would be and employment growth and income growth   looking reasonably good   We have not significantly changed our central projection  We still see an economy   growing around 3 percent over the forecast period, about our estimate of potential, with core   PCE inflation falling just below 2  This assumes a path for the nominal fed funds rate that is   flat for several more quarters, essentially the same as in the Greenbook and in the market   now  The risks to this outlook, though, have changed  We see less downside risk to growth   but still believe the risks to our growth forecast are weighted toward the weaker outcomes    Although the recent inflation numbers have been good, they probably exaggerate the   moderation of underlying inflation, and we see, therefore, continued upside risk to our   inflation forecast  I still think this latter risk should remain our more consequential concern    Relative to the Greenbook, we have a bit more growth because of our higher estimate of   growth in the labor force and a bit less inflation, but these differences are small, smaller than   they have been, and they do not have significant implications for our views on monetary   policy  The markets’ perceptions of fundamentals have in some respects moved in our   direction in the past few weeks  I say “in some respects” because we need to be attentive to   June 27-28, 2007 71 of 261    the rise in implied inflation that you see in TIPS  Our view and the markets’ view of the   expansion, the risk to the outlook, and implications for monetary policy have converged    This means that the effective stance of monetary policy is a little tighter than it was   A few important issues going forward  On the growth front, I still think that the   probability of weakness exceeds that of strength  There is still a significant risk that we will   see a more substantial adjustment of house prices, perhaps drawn out over a sustained period   of time with greater adverse effects on confidence and spending  Of course, if employment   and income growth stay reasonably strong, the effects of that potential scenario should be   manageable  If not, we will have more to worry about  I note that some major financial   institutions are now starting to report signs of rising delinquencies in consumer credit   products outside mortgages such as automobile loans and leases  This is the first time that I   have heard that report in a significant sense, and maybe it is a sign of some vulnerability   ahead  The strength of demand growth outside the United States has been helpful, and we   agree with the Greenbook that it looks likely to continue for some time  But things could be   kind of bumpy out there, particularly in places like China, and monetary policy in much of   the world is only now starting to move short-term real rates higher into positive territory   On the inflation front, it seems early to declare satisfaction or victory, not   particularly because of the recent reacceleration in headline inflation but just because of the   role of transitory factors in the recent moderation in core and the rise in breakevens in TIPS    We cannot be fully confident yet that a constant nominal fed funds rate at current levels will   deliver an acceptable inflation forecast  We do not, in my view, need to try to induce right   now a further tightening of financial conditions to push core inflation down further and   faster  But we need more time before we can justify shifting to a more balanced risk   June 27-28, 2007 72 of 261    assessment of inflation or something equivalent, something that would have the effect, for   example, of indicating satisfaction with current levels or of suggesting that the risks are   balanced around the path of inflation that we see in our central tendency projections   With financial markets, we are at a delicate moment  The losses in subprime are still   working their way through the system  Rating agencies are likely to downgrade a larger   share of past issues, more than they have already  The marks that people show indicate that   both hedge funds and dealers in a lot of this stuff may still have a way to go to catch up with   the movement in market prices  This dynamic itself could induce a further reduction in   willingness to finance new mortgages  You could see pockets of losses in the system,   liquidity pressures in hedge funds and their counterparties, and further forced liquidations    It is possible that we will still have a bunch of that effect ahead of us, even if no big negative   shock to demand occurs and induces a broader distress in consumer credit  We could also   see it spread to commercial real estate  We could see a broader pullback from CDOs and   CLOs as well, either from a general erosion of faith in the rating models—as Bill said, it is a   possibility—or from just concerns about liquidity in those instruments  We could see a   sharp, substantial widening of credit spreads provoked by an unanticipated default or two or   just a general reassessment of risk at current prices  A very large amount of LBO financing   that is yet to be closed, distributed, and placed is still working its way through the system    As in the past, we could see a deal or two get hung, the music stop, and that force some   broader repricing  People get stuck with stuff they don’t want to hold or did not expect to   hold  I think we now see more sensitivity in markets about the prospect of a diminished   appetite among the world’s savers and central banks to increase their exposure to the United   States, or at least we see more sensitivity to the perception out there that the dynamic might   June 27-28, 2007 73 of 261    be unfolding  You can see a bit of all this in some spreads, in some reports of resistance to   further erosion in covenants, in some reduced appetite for new bridge book exposure to   leveraged lending  You can see it in some changes in margin terms in some instruments vis-  à-vis some counterparties  For now I think it is a relatively healthy, still pretty modest, and   quite contained shift toward a more cautious assessment of risk, but these things generally   don’t tend to unfold gradually  On balance, though, I think we are in a pretty good place in   terms of policy, in terms of the market’s expectations about policy now, and in terms of how   we have been framing the balance of risks to the outlook     We are talking about the economy, so   mentioning it twice seems to be reasonable  [Laughter]     I actually agree with—and am happy   associating myself with—much of what has been said  I am totally comfortable with   alternative B as amended by Don or with the Kohn-Kroszner amendment because you   don’t need to repeat “inflation” twice in the end, [laughter] and I think we should keep   the rate as it is     Several of you put on the table a bunch of   broader questions about communication going forward, which I would like to talk about   now, but I think we should defer that until we come to the later conversation  So I am   fine with alternative B as amended   I do think that a lot of you made many interesting suggestions about the language    But there is much virtue in making minimal changes at the meeting because, even if they   sound small, I think it is hard in the few minutes we have before we vote to really step   back, take stock, and ask whether we altered the balance in ways that we fully intended to   be understood  Thus I would be for minimalism in changes at the table generally unless   we have something really consequential that we are trying to shift in the statement  In   June 27-28, 2007 120 of 261    that spirit, I would keep the changes small and stay with a modest amendment to   alternative B     Vince, it’s a little unclear from what you’ve   circulated what the subcommittee is recommending or presuming about the pieces of   material that would go into the Monetary Policy Report  Do you want to say just a little   about options there?  I assume you want people to comment on that question, too, and that   goes to the core of this next stage of evolution in the transparency     Those choices I think I understand, but I was   really thinking about the pictures  You circulated a whole different set of new things,   innovative pictures that showed dispersion, uncertainty, balance of risk, histograms, and so   forth  I guess you don’t need to answer this question, but do you want people to react, in the   first round at least, with a view on which pictures we think should be part of the narrative?     How small a subset?     I didn’t mean that  I’m sorry  I meant the graph   showing the evolution of the central tendency with things plus the histograms?  That’s what   I meant by subset     This may get us slightly ahead of ourselves, but I   think it’s important to what we’re asked to do now  It makes sense to get people to focus on   how comfortable they are with what has been on the table regarding the range of options on   projections and to say what they’re comfortable with and what they’re not comfortable with    But as I see this plan, you’re still building in some time for refinement over the next several   months to get this to the point where it’s ready for prime time  So I don’t think you’re   asking people—you really can’t because you’re not quite there yet—to commit right now to   views on all specific attributes of this  It seems to me you’re a step short of that  Broad   elements of the package on projections would then provide a basis for the subcommittee and   the staff to refine this further over the next several months  That’s what I understood the   plan to be  I think you’re right, Cathy—there’s a lot here  You can get a lot from asking   people to give that broader orientation and still recognize that this is going to need a little   refinement  Is that fair, Don?     Mr Chairman, may I?     So, President Lacker, is it your view that if we’re   not at this point prepared to announce a quantitative definition of the Committee’s long-term   objective, that we should not do a third-year projection?     May I ask a clarifying question before I speak?      This really goes to the remarks of President   Moskow and to the relationship between a narrative to accompany the projections and the   description in the minutes  If you did that model, which as I understood it, President   Moskow, is to incorporate a narrative as an appendix to the minutes, how then would the   description of the outlook that is in the minutes now—the narrative description of the   central tendency of the Committee that now goes in the minutes—relate to the narrative   description about the projections?  What would be the relationship be between those two   things, if you did them as separate but linked documents?     So that is the distinction  You would say the   minutes are the description of the near-term outlook that underpins our judgment about   the decision at the meeting, and the annex would be more of a focus on the description of   the medium term?     Okay  So, Mr Chairman, I am very supportive   of the path you laid out  I think it basically is the optimal balance today between what   the consensus of the Committee will bear now on the merits and what our unique   institutional structure as a central bank permits  Now, your view and the Committee’s   view of that balance may change over time, but I think what you described has to be   pretty close to the optimal balance of those needs today  What is the objective of this   exercise?  I think I am completely comfortable with what you and Don said in terms of   the broad objectives of what we are trying to achieve through these enhanced projections    But I think fundamentally that it is important to recognize that we are not principally   trying to give a lot of detail about dispersion and variance within the Committee  What   we should try to do mostly is to give more texture around the central tendency view of   the Committee about the likely evolution, the desirable evolution, of the economy over a   two-to-three-year, maybe longer, period so that people have a better sense of what   informs our basic judgments about the appropriate stance of monetary policy  We should   make sure that we keep to that objective as we think about what to put into a proposal   regarding enhanced projections   June 27-28, 2007 164 of 261    On the specifics, I am fine with a third year  I would like to discuss a little further   the merits of three years versus three to five years  I think the tradeoffs between the two   are very interesting, and I want to say something about that in a bit  I am fine with   quarterly  I agree that we should have projections on both headline and core and that   they should be based on the same index, not different indexes  Before we decide to go to   PCE and core PCE, again, we should discuss how to think about what it will be like to   live in a world where we still have TIPS paying the CPI  We still have a whole bunch of   survey-based measures reporting the CPI  If we’re going to give a lot more emphasis to   the medium-term implicit objectives of the Committee in some quantitative sense like   this, we should think through whether it will work or be comfortable over time  I agree   that this should be done on a view of optimal policy that is undisclosed for the reasons   that have been put in favor of that, although I think President Plosser did a nice job of   explaining the alternative view   I would also be in favor of expediting the minutes on the grounds that I think   there is a lot of virtue in saying that you want to have a short period between what we say   about what we did and why we did it and the greater narrative texture that has to come in   the minutes  The longer the gap between those two things is, the greater the risk that you   have two events with signaling impact on monetary policy rather than one  This is   complicated to do and must have some cost, but I’d say that a bias toward collapsing the   two as close as possible is the right bias   On the third-year question, Mr Chairman, you talked about how you would   describe what people should infer from the third-year projection about the objectives and   preferences of the members of the Committee individually  My own bias would be to   June 27-28, 2007 165 of 261    still try to qualify heavily whatever we say about the meaning of that third year  If we   believe, as you’ve said many times I think, that one wants to think about the period for   bringing inflation back down to objective as something that will probably have to vary   based on the circumstances, it is really important not to set up a dynamic in which people   view that third-year projection as our fixed objective for that horizon  We want to have a   fair amount of flexibility for a view of the appropriate path of inflation over time to   change meeting to meeting and not be too locked into a judgment about that  So I would   say that I am inclined to keep that softer for all the reasons the proponents of a flexible   horizon have laid out     There is virtue in laying out the central tendency of the Committee’s view about   what the appropriate path is likely to be today, but there may be circumstances in which   we want to be above target or objective for a longer time than three years  Again, our   view about that path might actually vary meeting to meeting  So I would want to soften   that up a little  But as we elaborate the package and the drafts of how this gets presented,   people will have a chance to look at whether the balance is right   On dispersion and what we say about dispersion across the Committee, I think the   histograms have a lot of appeal, and I have been in favor of them and of disclosing them   in the past  But I am a little worried about the following  There is some risk that they are   demystifying  Either the dispersion is going to look too wide, or it is going to get kind of   narrow  If we had to decide today, I would be inclined to say for this next step that we   should use the narrative description rather than the histogram to characterize dispersion    One reason is that we don’t have nineteen people doing independent, fully fledged,   internally consistent forecasts with a fully elaborated view that is independent of the   June 27-28, 2007 166 of 261    Greenbook’s view of the structure of the economy and its evolution We are not like the   respondents to the Survey of Professional Forecasters in some sense, and so to have a   histogram presented of nineteen different views with this degree of diversity and what   goes into that gives probably a bit too much emphasis to the quantitative number of the   individual views with which people come to the table  But they are very appealing as a   device for conveying uncertainty, so that’s the virtue  I would say maybe start with   trying to put more texture into a narrative description rather than in a histogram   The issue about the relationship between the narrative description that would   accompany the projections and the minutes is something we need to think through more   carefully  I’m still uncomfortable in that I think what we want to do is to try to give   people a little more sense of the story that defines the central tendency of the Committee   about the likely desired evolution of the economy—of output and inflation  The part of   the minutes that talks about the outlook shouldn’t be too narrow and shouldn’t be too   short in its horizon  In many ways, we are making a broad judgment about the forecast   horizon at every meeting  I don’t know what the solution to this is, but I would think   through the relationship a bit more carefully, and my inclination is to go for integration    Four times a year we do minutes like today, and four times a year we do something that   has more texture, more detail, and a little bit more on the medium term and has some   tables accompanying it  Again, what we should try to do is give people more of a sense   of the view of the central tendency of the Committee that informs that judgment about the   appropriate stance of monetary policy over time  To view them as separate, distinguished   things leaves me slightly uncomfortable, so I think the topic deserves some more thought   June 27-28, 2007 167 of 261    On timing, Mr Chairman, in terms of it launching in October versus January, I   think we should defer to your basic judgment about what makes sense  My view is that   you should set a dynamic in motion now that gives you the option of doing it in October   if people are comfortable enough by that time and if it looks as though the state of the   world at that point would be conducive to this kind of announcement  But I think that   you want to make sure before we go forward that you have a good sense of how we’re   going to describe this, what it’s really going to mean, and how we handle all the obvious   complicated questions that we’re going to get   Is this enough?  Will it leave us with an unmanageable set of problems internally   in how we think about decisions on monetary policy or externally in terms of the   ambiguity it still leaves in the market about what our objective is?  Let me just say a few   things about that  I don’t think it is right to say that the market is fixated particularly on   the question about whether our implicit view about what we’d like to see inflation do   over time is 15, 175, or 2  I think what the market wants, really, more than anything is   to know what we are going to do with the fed funds rate [laughter] at the next meeting,   the meeting after that, and the meeting after that  They would like to know more about   what we think about the economy, but really what they want to know is what we are   going to do with monetary policy tomorrow  It is very important—as you read that   people complain about the ambiguity we live with today, have lived with for several   decades, and are likely to live with in the future about what we are going to do to   inflation over time—to remember that what they want to know is what we are going to do   with the fed funds rate tomorrow  My own sense is we can manage, as we have managed   in the past, with a framework that leaves the present degree of ambiguity about our   June 27-28, 2007 168 of 261    objective unresolved  There is a lot of value and flexibility in that ambiguity  I don’t   view it as a particular vice  I don’t think that there is any compelling evidence to support   the view that the burden that ambiguity presents today is unmanageable—certainly not   relative to the past two decades  Of course, we can evolve further  As the Chairman   said, we should view this as an evolutionary process  We should be prepared to revisit   over time each judgment we make and to continue to explore whether there are things we   can do beyond this to improve the way monetary policy works in the United States  So I   think it’s not right to think about this as the beginning with a clear evolution for   something beyond this  It is also not right to view this as the end  I think you should   view it as this is what is next, and we’ll continue to think through things that might help   us do monetary policy better over time  That’s all I’ve got     Perhaps I could say my piece again, just so he   didn’t misinterpret it  Of course they care about inflation, and of course they care about   whether we are going to competently deliver acceptable inflation outcomes over time    My only point was to say that even if you gave them clarity on an objective at a certain   horizon, in quantitative terms, fundamentally they would still want to know how you are   going to achieve that, and you are still going to leave unmet their principal demand  Of   course they care about inflation, and we care about inflation  But I believe that the   differences they are concerned about today—a central tendency that has a 50 basis point   spread on it—are small compared with the uncertainty that they would like us to resolve   about how we are going to react to stuff  What they really want is something that I don’t   think we can fundamentally give them  They really want more certainty than we have at   any given time about how we are going to react to a changing world, and they would like   us to resolve the mystery in what the future will hold about the evolution of the economy    It is important to recognize that  But you are right, of course they care about inflation   and how we’re going to react to inflation       Thank you, Mr Chairman  I think the statement   has been evolving sensibly  The process is basically working  I don’t think we need to lock   ourselves into any fixed view of the optimal structure of the statement over time  We should   be open to changing it if it suits our purposes in specific circumstances  Obviously, shaping   expectations about the stance of monetary policy is a vital part of what we do  I’m   pragmatic on all the questions about whether or not to have forward-looking language    There are some circumstances in which it may make sense in the future as it has in the past    Those should be exceptional circumstances, and using it should be done very carefully and   thoughtfully  But we do not need to commit not to use it  I also think the basic structure of   saying something implicitly about the forecast, the outlook on which our decision is based,   is very important  So we should have something in there that refers to the expected path of   output and inflation and the risks to that generally as part of the signal  Without that, you’d   lose a lot of value  I think I’d still be open to experimenting further as we have been doing   with introducing a bit more forward-looking view about the outlook for demand and   inflation as part of the statement, even though that will be hard to do well   On governance, I have a very different view  I think that we really should stay in   this governance limbo that we now have  It’s very important to recognize that we’ve had a   huge amount of turnover in this Committee  It’s important to give the Chairman the   flexibility to ultimately be the arbiter of the nuance in the statement without having to go   through a process in which he will have to figure out whether he’s prepared to have a vote   with significant dissent in that context  Right now we have a process in which the   Committee has substantial input into the shape of the signal that’s in the statement  The   minutes actually say that the Committee agreed that the statement should say X  It’s clear   June 27-28, 2007 217 of 261    that the Committee is implicated in the statement  The Chairman is obviously very   deferential to the views of the Committee in shaping it, but we’re close to 80 percent of the   way in having a formal endorsement by the Committee of the statement  I don’t see any   virtue in going the next 20 percent and a lot of virtue in preserving the possibility for the   Chairman to say, “My sense is that we should do X,” (I know that’s not acceptable to all of   you) and not have that come with something that forces a vote in that context  I just don’t   think the balance we have now is problematic, but I can envision a circumstance in which   the state of the world, the state of the Committee, or a bunch of other things might make a   formal vote unnecessary and tilt the balance in a way that may not make sense for the   institutional structure we have  You know, we have a group of nineteen, not of seven    Fundamentally the Fed model institutionally is based on a strong Chairman, and I’d preserve   that particular remaining piece of that model     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The balance of risks has   changed since our last meeting—significantly, in my view  Overall spending by households and   businesses is weaker  Housing, of course, is significantly worse, and the underlying pace of   productivity growth and potential growth seems lower  In addition, financial market developments   have deteriorated with a very broad based increase in risk premiums, decline in some asset prices,   pockets of liquidity pressures, and some disruption in mortgage markets and high-yield corporate   credit markets  These developments in financial markets, even though they represent a necessary   adjustment, a generally healthy development, have the potential to cause substantial damage   through the effects on asset prices, market liquidity, and credit; through the potential failure of   more-consequential financial institutions; and through a general erosion of confidence among   businesses and households  If this situation were to materialize and these effects were to persist,   they could have significant effects on the strength of aggregate demand going forward  The process   now under way in financial markets could take some time to resolve, and finding a new balance   could take a while   We have modified our forecast in ways similar to the changes to the Greenbook  We have a   slightly weaker second half of ’07 and a slightly lower estimate of growth in ’08 and ’09, reflecting   August 7, 2007 60 of 136    a downwardly revised estimate of potential growth  Our growth numbers for ’07, ’08, and ’09 look   roughly like 2½ rising to 2¾ percent  Our inflation forecast is essentially unchanged, with core   PCE inflation moderating to slightly under 2 percent over the forecast period  Our differences with   the Greenbook are not trivial, but they seem well within the somewhat greater uncertainty we now   face about the outlook for growth  The negative skew in our view of the risks to the outlook   suggests a somewhat downward slope to the path of the fed funds rate going forward, to the   appropriate stance of monetary policy, rather than the flat path assumed by the Greenbook  So even   if financial market conditions stabilize and credit markets, particularly the mortgage markets, find   equilibrium relatively soon and start to open up again, the growth risks have shifted a bit more to the   downside around the lower expected path  In contrast, if the disruption in credit markets persists   and liquidity markets are further impaired, then we face the prospect of a significantly weaker path   to aggregate demand     Inflation risks in our view, however, remain slightly tilted to the upside, but these types of   risk are very different  The inflation risks are modest and manageable  We characterize them as   skewed to the upside in part because of the differences across the Committee as to our desired   individual long-run views about the inflation level, in part because of our differences as to what’s an   acceptable period for bringing core inflation down to that objective, and in part because of different   views about the structure of inflation dynamics in this economy  The risks to markets and   ultimately to growth are very different  There’s a much longer negative tail in terms of the range of   potential outcomes, and those risks are going to be harder for us to manage, partly because they   depend on confidence  Because of these differences, I think it’s hard to counterpoise these two risks   against each other and assess the balance between them  Of course, as always, we should weigh   each by their probability, their effects, and our capacity to manage those effects  I think that the   August 7, 2007 61 of 136    probability of a bad inflation outcome has diminished from what we would have said two quarters   ago and the probability of an adverse growth outcome has increased  As I said, the latter risk is   interesting and complicated in part because it might be harder to manage   I want to make two points in this regard  First, a number of you have said that we want to   see more evidence of adverse effects on aggregate demand before we change our view about the   appropriate path of monetary policy  I don’t really think that’s the right way to think about this  If   we took that approach, we’d inevitably be too late  Just as we think about inflation risks by looking   forward and looking at expectations, we need to be forward looking and thinking about the potential   implications of these dynamics of financial markets on the growth outlook  The information we   have now about what’s happening in markets and about the implications for credit markets and   ultimately for confidence and demand is very stale and uneven  My second observation about this   challenge is that what makes it hard is partly that you are seeing a combination of things  You are   seeing a loss of confidence in the capacity of investors to assess underlying risk in mortgage   markets in part because of uncertainty about what housing prices are going to do and in part because   of uncertainty about correlations in losses across households  You are also seeing a collapse in   confidence, as Bill described it, in how to value complex structured credit products, probably from   the loss of faith in ratings and from the changes ahead in ratings methodology and in actual ratings    You’re also seeing the difficulties that investors and counterparties now have in evaluating the risk   in exposure to financial counterparties, and you’re seeing in some ways reflecting all of this a   diminished willingness to finance what’s relatively high quality paper  We live in a system in   which risk has been transferred much more broadly, but a lot of that risk has gone to leveraged   funds that have much less capacity to absorb this kind of shock without facing a lot of liquidity   pressures  The combination of these things means that you’re seeing some impairment in the   August 7, 2007 62 of 136    natural dynamic by which, when prices adjust, you have new people coming in willing to buy at   those low prices  But these challenges in information and in diagnosing what’s happening in   markets mean that the process is not working as quickly as you might have thought in mortgages   and in high-yield corporate credit  You can see this sort of skew in the risks reflected, I think   sensibly, in the change of market expectations about the fed funds rate  You can see this balance in   the distribution that Bill described, where you see a sharply negative skew in expectations about the   path on the downside, and you see that come also in the context of relative stability of inflation   expectations  That shift of mean expectations, in the distribution, does not come with any sense that   the consequence might be some erosion in confidence about our capacity to keep inflation   expectations down   Now, in terms of policy, I personally wouldn’t want to lean against the change in market   expectations that we’ve seen so far, even though it has moved a long way in a short time  It’s really   important to give ourselves more flexibility than we now have to respond to what could be a rapidly   deteriorating overall environment; that’s just pragmatically essential, given that the range of   foreseeable monetary policy actions we’re likely to confront has broadened very substantially   relative to where we were a quarter ago  The challenge, of course, is to figure out a way to   acknowledge and to show some awareness of these changes in market dynamics without feeding the   concern, without overreacting, about underlying strength in the fundamentals of the economy as a   whole or in the financial system  That is a difficult balance, but I think it requires some softening of   the asymmetry in our assessment of the balance of risks now   An advertisement in response to a bunch of points made so far, including by President   Fisher—the Morning Call that Bill Dudley’s staff runs from New York is a very good, fairly   textured prism of what’s happening across these markets  They do a good job of trying to integrate   August 7, 2007 63 of 136    a bunch of the anecdotes and the facts, and it’s the most efficient device any of us have to check in   about that evolving balance  It won’t satisfy everybody’s demand to have as much information as is   out there, but it’s a fairly efficient way to get a pretty good picture, and so I commend that to you    It’s a really good, thoughtful, and reasonably deep collection of wisdom in the markets today     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Just quickly, I think we are   actually all in a fairly similar place, not far apart in our basic diagnosis, and that’s good, given the   complexity of our decisions going forward in some sense  We want to soften slightly the   asymmetry in our current statement to give us a bit more flexibility and to show some awareness of   the change in the reality out there   Quickly on the statement, first, I agree that, on the question of how we characterize and how   we display some recognition of financial market developments, the reference to volatility itself may   not capture it  Somebody suggested that we say something instead about going to “risk premium”   or something more generally, and I think that might be slightly better—a small point  The second   question is whether we should revert to June on the inflation readings in response, I think, to the   right observation by President Plosser that this does convey more comfort with a level than the   previous wording did  So I would be fine going back to June, but I could also live with this because   August 7, 2007 107 of 136    it conveys a sense that the readings have been and continue to be reasonably favorable  So I would   be fine with the way it is, but I could go back to the June language   On the question about whether we refer explicitly to downside risks to growth, which we’ll   be doing for the first time—a sort of consequential act—and, if so, how we do it  I would have been   fine leaving it implicit rather than introducing it explicitly  I think Don is right  If we’re going to   do it, unless we’re going to change the structure of the statement significantly and put some risk   assessment on growth in paragraph 2 and some risk assessment around inflation in paragraph 3, then   we need to leave it in paragraph 4  So, again, on the risks to growth, I’m okay with putting that   language in  I think it’s consistent with the broad objectives  I guess my preference would have   been to leave it implicit   Finally, on “predominant,” my own view is that we should not repeat “predominant” and   that we would be better off simply stating that the Committee remains concerned about the risks or   concerned that inflation will fail to moderate as expected  I don’t think the arguments for sticking   with “predominant” are that compelling  I don’t think that taking it out constrains our options going   forward  It is true that it’s a shift in some broad sense, but I don’t think we need to say so starkly   now that we’ve looked at this set of risks—very different types of risk, some very fast moving, very   uncertain, and some slower moving, probably manageable over time—and say that we weighed that   balance and we think the latter risks continue to predominate  I think that’s the substance of the   argument we face  I think it would be better to slightly soften that further  Having said all of that, I   can live with alternative B as drafted  [Laughter]     Don’t give up yet  “Risk premiums in financial markets   have increased, credit conditions have tightened for some households”—it is true that you don’t   August 7, 2007 111 of 136    really know what the source of the increase in risk premiums is, but it is true that risk premiums   have increased  Volatility itself is not particularly interesting from a policy perspective, and as   many people have said, we’re not here to damp volatility  The considerations relevant to the   macroeconomy and to financial market stability in some sense are what happened—and that’s a   different way of saying it      I am okay with that     Tom, this is Tim  We have no indication that the major,   more diversified institutions are facing any funding pressure  In fact, some of them report what we   classically see in a context like this, which is that money is flowing to them  That, of course, could   change quickly  But apart from those that are more narrowly in the mortgage market that can’t   basically sell any non-agency products, I don’t think we’re seeing any sense of funding pressure     Richard, we’ve been talking to these people several   times a day, and we’ll do so again today  But I guess I don’t feel that at this point we can do   anything appropriate that is more powerful than this statement, and I’m not sure that it makes any   sense for us to try to persuade these people to lend to a bunch of institutions that they’re not   comfortable lending to now  I don’t really feel as though there’s an effective way for us to   condition this  You know, we have no indication that people are going to come to the window on   August 10, 2007 7 of 12    any significant scale  If we think that there’s a liquidity problem that could be effectively relaxed   by encouraging people to come to the window and that would make them more likely to help meet   that constraint, then we can get to that point  But at this stage I don’t think it’s helpful or necessary   for us to try to induce these people to on-lend what they may come to us later in the day for at the   window  We may get to that point, but I don’t think that makes sense now     I don’t agree with that  I don’t think that’s the way to   think about it  This is a general signal that we’re prepared to relax or to provide liquidity to help   make sure markets come back in some more orderly functioning  You can’t condition that   statement without undermining its basic power in some sense      We don’t have any direct information     Well, you’ve already seen one significant intervention by   the German authorities last week to guarantee the liabilities of a relatively small institution with   some mortgage exposure, and the liquidity pressures that the ECB responded to yesterday indicate   that there are broader concerns about exposure to losses into those institutions because of their   subprime exposure  You’re just seeing that in commercial paper now, rather than elsewhere  So we   have no indications from our supervisory counterparts that any major institution in Europe is facing   August 10, 2007 10 of 12    a significant solvency problem now, but that doesn’t mean there isn’t one  We just haven’t heard   that from them yet  I think there is a general sense that a lot of this subprime stuff ended up, as it   has in the past, in institutions in Europe  So I assume that we have the risk that, as the tide recedes   further, you will see more distress there  But, again, we have no indication from any of our   counterparts yet that any major institutions face a significant funding or solvency issue     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Just to start a little further   back, since the operations and the statement by the Board last week, we have—as you have, I’m   sure—received a lot of questions from a range of market participants about what the Desk can take   and what it’s not able to take, what is the law, what is discretion, and a whole range of questions   around the discount window, too  Those questions reflected a range of interests from a bunch of   institutions in thinking whether there are ways in which, if somehow the stigma were reduced for   coming to the window, they might be able to take advantage of that source of liquidity and act so   that the help might relax some of the constraints in other markets  They have informed us that they   are contemplating making an announcement tomorrow—in fact, I think they were prepared to do it   earlier  They are thinking about coming in and announcing that they would consider buying   August 16, 2007 13 of 37    substantial amounts of specific types of highly rated asset-backed paper  Although they had lots of   clarification about what is permitted now under current policies at the discount window, they   obviously don’t have any idea that we’re contemplating a change in policy or what might be   possible and what we might say or not say going forward  They obviously can’t and understand that   they can’t say anything about us  They might say that they’re prepared to take advantage or make   appropriate use of their access to the discount window in this context  I think that they’re searching   for something that, again, would help reduce the risk by that act—which, of course, they can do   now or could have done over the past ten days or so—and that will reduce the stigma associated   with it  I have been interested in hearing from them whether doing so would, in effect, change their   behavior in a way that might be helpful to confidence in markets now  That’s the extent of what I   think is relevant from those conversations       Yes     Well, I cannot speak for Ken Lewis, but I think they   have sought to see whether they could understand a little more clearly the scope of their rights and   our current policy with respect to the window  The only thing I’ve done is to try to help them   August 16, 2007 14 of 37    understand—and I’m sure that’s been true across the System—what the scope of that is because   these people generally don’t use the window and they don’t really understand in some sense what   it’s about     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Of course, I support these   proposals as drafted, and I think everything everybody has said about the risks and the uncertainty is   right  The balance is very delicate, but the combination of them is a very forceful statement  I don’t   believe that adding another 25 to the drop in the spread on the discount rate would make it   August 16, 2007 33 of 37    substantially more powerful  If this does not have a desired effect, it will not be because we didn’t   do another 25  It will be because we’re at the point where we’re going to have to think about the fed   funds rate  So I don’t think it is right, if we need to go beyond this in some sense, to think that we   will do it by just deciding we will revisit that spread  We will have to think about more-dramatic   actions in that context     Mr Chairman, I have just a clarifying question  In the   past when the FOMC has issued a statement without an action, between meetings or at a meeting,   have we ever voted on it before?     Mr Chairman     Just to reinforce what Bill said—of course, we spent a lot   of time thinking through exactly the risks that you are worried about in this context, and we’ll have   a lot to reflect on in terms of the nature of the regime and what the legislative authority gives us   going forward  But I think that Bill and his people really had just a simple choice, which was—  particularly at that point late in August and early in September—whether they should have acted in   a way that raised the possibility of having fed funds trade significantly above target over this period    If you look at the experience of the other central banks managing this situation in the past six weeks   or so and what happened when they prematurely acted in a way that ended with having their rates   trade substantially firm to target and the effects of that on behavior and the market, I am completely   confident that our guys erred in the right direction  I also don’t believe, just to reinforce what Bill   said, that anybody serious in the markets viewed what the Desk was doing and the behavior   September 18, 2007 13 of 188    regarding where fed funds were traded as having a signaling effect or as constraining the flexibility   of the Committee  It is true that you had a bunch of people in mid-August talking about that   possibility and wondering whether they should read the very soft trading of fed funds as an   indication of the stance of monetary policy going forward, but I think that got sucked out of the   market relatively quickly   Again, I think you’re raising absolutely the right questions  We grapple with those   questions every day  We basically made the judgment that to adopt a much more aggressive stance   in being stingy with the reserves at various points in this period would have created too much risk of   fed funds trading firm relative to target at a moment when psychology and confidence were very,   very fragile  I really think the experience of other central banks was a good counter example of the   cost of the alternative strategy  Now, of course, we will have a chance over time to go back and do   a much more detailed review   Another thing I would say about coming in later in the day is that it’s very important to have   some stability in the basic framework with which the Desk operates, particularly after what we did   the week before August 17 and on August 17  To have a lot of changes at the same time in the   standard operating procedures of the Desk would have created more risk of uncertainty about what   we were doing  We were trying to find a balance between the imperatives of a relatively steady   hand and the risk that you are phrasing in absolutely legitimate questions  We’ll have a chance to   reflect on a lot of things after this period, but my own view is that they made exactly the right   judgment     But, Mr Chairman, if I’m not mistaken, I think that the   term market for interbank liquidity is largely offshore in Europe, not in fed funds onshore  I’m not   sure that helps when we get into this context     Our research people have tried to figure out whether they   could infer or take from Fedwire data other indications of who’s lending at what maturities and   who’s borrowing at what maturities and what the balance is  My own sense from looking at this,   and maybe I just haven’t figured it out yet, is that it doesn’t give you the kind of clarity that you   were looking for     Thank you, Mr Chairman  In my view, the balance of   risks has changed significantly over the past several weeks  Although outside of housing we   don’t see much evidence nationally of a significant softening of growth, growth is likely to be   somewhat softer than we had expected, and the downside risks to that lower path have increased   substantially  I think inflation risks have diminished somewhat, but we have to remain attentive   to the familiar sources of continued upward pressure  Financial conditions have tightened since   the August meeting, even with the increase in the amount of easing priced into markets, and   September 18, 2007 71 of 188    despite the moderation in the LIBOR term spread to fed funds over the past few days, conditions   in credit and funding markets remain very fragile  Even under relatively optimistic assumptions   about how these developments in markets will unfold, the process of adjustment will take some   time to work through the financial system, and very protracted impairment to market functioning   would raise, of course, the possibility of even more-adverse outcomes on the real side of the   economy   These changes, in my view, justify a reduction in the fed funds rate at this meeting    Monetary policy has an important role to play in reducing the width of the adverse tail of the   range of potential outcomes for real activity  By reducing the probability of an extremely bad   outcome on the real side, monetary policy can help mitigate some of the coordination problems   that are hampering financial market functioning and delaying the necessary repricing of risk that   needs to take place, particularly in markets for term funding, the interbank market, and for   mortgage-related products  The difficult and consequential judgment we face is about the   appropriate size of the monetary policy response to these changes in risks to the outlook  I   believe the arguments work in favor of doing more now rather than less  Policy needs to provide   a convincing degree of insurance against a more adverse outcome     Of course, there are risks of erring on the side of doing too much now, and let me just   address three of those risks  First, a large move could add to concerns about the downside risks   to growth and about financial fragility rather than mitigating those concerns  My view, however,   is that doing too little now would risk exacerbating uncertainty about the macroeconomic   outlook, and a gradualist, tentative response would be more disconcerting than encouraging  The   risk of underdoing it now is that we will ultimately be forced to do more  A second risk is that a   large move now could add to uncertainty about future inflation outcomes  This is true    September 18, 2007 72 of 188    However, I think various measures of changes to the inflation outlook suggest that risks to   inflation have moderated a bit, and the markets are displaying a fair amount of confidence in   both our will and our ability to keep future inflation stable at reasonably low levels  Acting in a   way that suggests that we believe our credibility is more fragile would be more disconcerting   than encouraging to the markets  The third risk is that a large move could reinforce concerns that   we are adding to the moral hazard in the financial system  This is, I think, an inevitable,   necessary consequence of acting to provide insurance against an extremely negative outcome,   but it’s not a good argument against doing what we think is justified by the balance of risks to   the outlook  In this context, it is important to be careful in the way we talk publicly about moral   hazard regarding this balance  In our financial system there is a substantial amount of leverage   in institutions and vehicles that are subject to very acute liquidity risk, and part of what you are   now seeing in Europe, in the United Kingdom in particular, are the effects on confidence of   finding the wrong balance, frankly, between concerns about moral hazard and the appropriate   role of the central bank in situations like this  I think the framework that the Chairman laid out   in Jackson Hole explains exactly the right balance between what we cannot or should not try to   do and what is important to do with monetary policy   The process of adjustment and deleveraging that is under way in markets, in asset prices   and risk premiums, is necessary, and we should not direct policy at interrupting or arresting that   process or at insulating investors or institutions from the consequences of the decisions that got   us to this point  Our objective should be to help facilitate that process but to do so in a way that   reduces the chance that it will cause too much damage to the functioning of the core of the   financial system and to confidence, because of the consequence of such a scenario for the real   economy  To get through this process, bank balance sheets need to expand substantially, and   September 18, 2007 73 of 188    we’re fortunate that they can expand and are now expanding very substantially  A range of   nonbank financial institutions and financing vehicles will have to be unwound and restructured    Asset prices and risk premiums may have to move further as more deleveraging takes place and   assets are liquidated  Some of the inevitable increase in macroeconomic uncertainty is priced   into expectations  Investors will have to get more comfortable that they can make judgments   about how to value mortgage-related and other asset-backed securities, despite the loss of faith in   ratings  The process of differentiation among strong and weak institutions, conduits, financing   vehicles, et cetera, also has to continue  But as many of you said, this process could take quite   some time, and it will leave us with the risk of a fair amount of fragility in markets in the interim   Let me end just by reminding you of what I’ll call the “Bernanke Doctrine of Credibility”   that the Chairman laid out at one of our previous meetings  Credibility for a central banker is not   just about the confidence that we instill in markets that we will act to keep inflation stable and   low  It is also a function of our capacity to demonstrate that we have a sufficient feel for the   evolution of the economy and about confidence and that we will meet those inflation objectives   without excessive cost to real activity and confidence  Part of that credibility is a feel for what is   happening in markets and a capacity to look forward and anticipate the potential implications   that those developments may have for the outlook  Thank you     I support, Mr Chairman, cutting the fed funds rate   50 basis points today and the language in alternative B, and I cede the rest of my time to you     I feel generally comfortable with the trajectory you’re   on and with the evolving shape of this thing  There is one issue still where it seems to me we   don’t quite have it right, which is that the narrative description does not, because it really cannot,   describe the story that is reflected in the central tendency of the forecast  So the narrative is   really more a repetition of the numbers and of what is in the tables around dispersion, and that is   probably because we haven’t given the staff a way to talk about or let us talk about the story that   underpins it in some sense  Since a central value in this innovation to the communication regime   is to give a bit more texture to the story that underpins the central tendency, it would be worth   exploring whether we could figure out a way to design our discussion so that the staff could   write a narrative in a way that does a better job of allowing that  With that exception, that   qualification, it seems as though what you laid out, Don, makes sense    September 18, 2007 125 of 188      I didn’t mean to suggest not having anything that   reflects the dispersion of views or the uncertainty around those views  But right now it’s so   skeletal that it doesn’t add much value to the tables, and it gives in some ways less texture than   what is in the minutes, frankly, about the outlook over time  If the central purpose of this is to   animate the set of judgments about the evolution, we could do it a little better that way  This is   complicated because we have all sorts of different conditioning assumptions that underpin our   forecasts  When those conditioning assumptions vary, you can’t really tell much from what the   variance in the forecast is  We don’t ask people to give a modal and an expected forecast and the   difference between the two, even though we ask them about the balance of uncertainty in that   sense  So it is hard in some sense, Mr Chairman, but I didn’t mean to suggest you would want   to do that because you want to try to force a consensus view     Could I ask a question?      What does a closed meeting mean, Scott?  Does it   mean there’s a transcript, with a normal release, or there’s no transcript?      But the minutes of the FOMC meeting will be released   in two weeks?    September 18, 2007 129 of 188      Explore the range of options to address     But I think it’s clear in the documentation that to be   eligible to bid you have to be eligible to borrow at the primary credit facility      To be eligible to bid in the auction, as it’s designed,   you have to be eligible to borrow from a Federal Reserve Bank at the primary credit facility    Now, if you are an institution that is migrating across states of the world and ratings in the midst   of this four-week program, then we’d face some awkward decision in that context  But I think   that Karen’s response is right, which is that in general, in the world today, we have a lot of large   institutions that are essentially dollar based, that live with a big mismatch between the access to   liquidity in the currency where they may need it and the liquidity that the home country central   bank is willing to provide  In that context, being open to respond to requests for a swap is a way   to help limit the risk you referred to, which is that we don’t want to live in a system where, if   there’s substantial dollar-based liquidity needed at a non-US institution, if the only option that   exists is for us to be the ones providing liquidity, then that would not be a terrific situation for us   or for the home country central bank and its supervisor, probably because they will be better at   making the liquidity-solvency judgment in some sense  You would want them to have the means   to actually respond to that need, if they think it’s appropriate, without having the entire burden   for that come on us  On the other hand, they exist here in the United States as depository   institutions  They have a set of not rights but expectations about what they can borrow and what   kind of liquidity insurance they can get from us, and we can’t change those in the middle of the   game     You are capping the amount in a way that you could   not reasonably decide you’re going to cap total access to the discount window     Just a few quick things  First, I should say that the   concerns and questions you all put on the table are the right set of concerns and questions  Some of   them can be resolved by tweaking the design of things, but some of them we will not be able to   resolve with changes in design, and we’ll have to decide whether or not we want to live with those   things  I think it’s important to recognize that, even though we’ve had ten days of pretty steady   improvement in the willingness and ability of financers to differentiate across different sets of   institutions and different sets of instruments, et cetera, and the process is encouraging, we should   not take too much comfort from that yet  This process could go on for some time, we are still in a   quite fragile situation, and the situation could get more fragile again easily and quite quickly  We   may need at that point to escalate in terms of the range of things that we’re prepared to do in that   context  We need to be very open to thinking about practical, creative ways to address some of the   limitations not just in our tools and the relative stigma attached to them but in the tools of the other   central banks in the major financial centers  We now exist with a very complicated set of   limitations and asymmetries in those limitations, and I think that mix together does not leave us   optimally positioned or with the flexibility to deal with the kinds of things we’re facing in these   markets  So it’s going to require that we be open, practical, and creative in thinking through the   September 18, 2007 166 of 188    optimal way to navigate through those kinds of things  It would be very hard to know outside the   circumstance what hierarchy of choices is going to look most appealing to us—whether in the event   the swap alone would be ideal or feasible, whether something at the discount window alone would   be ideal or feasible, or some other things would be  It’s just hard to know   But I think you have to recognize that we’re all going to be in a world of second, third, or   fourth best just because nothing looks terrific now relative to those problems  We are not going to   be able to clarify for ourselves fully what the effect might be and whether we can manage some of   the risk of unintended consequences, not just in terms of future incentives but also in terms of   signaling effect  I’m sure we all know that  But some of the things that you raise today we would   face in the moment and would not be able to resolve definitively  It is also true that we may need to   move very quickly  We may not have a lot of time, and we may need to do something multilateral   just because, even though this has a lot of manifestations in dollar funding markets, it’s not solely a   dollar issue and it’s obviously not solely and maybe not even principally a funding issue around   US financial institutions  So we may need to be open to doing something together  That will, of   course, mean we may need to compromise in terms of what may be optimal for our optics or for our   design of the economics of the thing  So I think those of you who welcomed the fact that you   would have more time to think through this shouldn’t take too much time  This may be a situation   in which you will have to resolve your ambivalence quickly  You may not be able to resolve it     Dave, this is about the Greenbook forecast—I was   going to say existentialism, but I am not sure that is quite right  [Laughter]  Dave, is the   Greenbook forecast something we should view as a modal forecast, as I think you implied, or the   expected value of the range of plausible scenarios that might have—     Is the monetary policy path that you reveal in the   Greenbook based on the modal forecast?     Thank you  If I could ask one more question  In the   Greenbook, you reveal the usual assumptions for what you anticipate for total credit growth, and   you show it decelerating significantly over this period  How does the deceleration you are   anticipating look compared with a range of previous periods in which the US economy was   October 30-31, 2007 16 of 162    slowing significantly or periods following substantial financial distress?  For example, if you   compare it with 2001-02 or 1990-91, is it a modest deceleration in credit growth, or does it look   large compared with that?      Are we permitted to question?     Richard, you described vividly the bunch of forces   working on headline inflation  But since you identified yourself as a negative outlier on the   inflation forecast, it seems to me your headline forecast is still for significant moderation in   headline inflation in ’08  Am I wrong in that?  At least I infer from this that you’re not showing   an acceleration in core PCE inflation      I just want to start by saying in defense of the Empire   State that there is no way—the only way that Richmond could be bigger than New York and   Philadelphia is if you don’t count the substantial business we have in the manufacturing of financial   products     As the Chairman said at the Economic Club of New   York, it is likely to emerge stronger  I think the outlook looks about the way it did in September    Just a few quick points  Financial market conditions are substantially better than during the peak of   the panic in mid-August; but the improvement, as many of you said, is still quite limited and   October 30-31, 2007 53 of 162    uneven  Sentiment is still quite fragile, and I think we still seem likely to face a protracted period of   adjustment ahead as the markets work through the substantial array of challenges remaining   Growth in the United States and in the world economy in my view seems likely to slow—  more here, of course, than elsewhere  Here, even though the nonhousing, non-auto parts of the US   economy don’t yet show significant evidence of a considerable slowdown of actual or expected   demand, I think that still seems likely  In our central scenario, though, housing construction   weakens further  Housing demand slows further because of the tightening of credit conditions    Prices fall further  Consumer spending slows a bit, and businesses react by scaling back growth in   hiring and investment, and this produces several quarters of growth modestly below trend  I think   that growth outside the United States is likely to slow a bit  It will slow toward potential, if not all   the way to potential, in those economies that have been growing above potential  Although the   world is larger in relative terms and somewhat less vulnerable to a US slowdown than it once was,   it seems to me very unlikely that domestic demand in the rest of the world will accelerate as   domestic demand slows in the United States  So the risks to this outlook for US growth still seem   to lie to the downside  The magnitude of the downside risks may be slightly less than in September,   but they remain substantial  I think the main source of this downside risk to growth is the   interaction between expectations of recession probability and the credit market dynamics  Each   feeds the other  As the outlook for housing deteriorates and the recession probability stays elevated,   financial institutions and investors stay cautious  That caution, in turn, slows the pace of recovery in   markets—in asset-backed, securitization, and structured-credit markets—and in credit growth more   broadly  As expectations adjust to anticipate a longer, more-substantial period of impairment in   markets, then recession probability at least potentially increases   October 30-31, 2007 54 of 162    I think that the underlying inflation numbers and the measures we use to capture underlying   inflation do not suggest any meaningful acceleration in underlying inflation, and we still expect the   core PCE to run at a rate below 2 percent over the forecast period  In some ways, though, the   inflation outlook now feels a bit worse  It feels worse because of the modest rise in breakevens that   we saw following our last meeting and because of sentiment in markets around gold, commodity   and energy prices, and the dollar  The fact that breakevens at long horizons have risen or failed to   fall as monetary policy expectations have shifted down is not the most comforting pattern out there    So I think we need to be very careful not to encourage any sense in markets that we’re indifferent to   those potential risks  Having said that, I think the risks to that inflation forecast are roughly   balanced   The range of tools we have for measuring equilibrium combined with what you see in   financial market expectations suggests that monetary policy, to assess the real short-term interest   rate, is at or above most estimates of neutral and, therefore, is still exerting some modest restraint on   growth  The expectations now built into markets imply too much easing over the next eighteen   months, more than I think we’re likely to have to do  But I think the appropriate path of monetary   policy lies under the Greenbook’s assumption  Thank you     I think this emphasizes the importance of the point   that Brian made about the opportunity everybody has to revisit their submissions, particularly in   terms of how they think about the risks to the forecast in the wake of a possible move in   monetary policy  We haven’t talked about this in much detail before, but if the expected path of   monetary policy in the near term changes between when you submit and when we clarify, then   that might change a bit and, I would think, would affect what those histograms might look like in   terms of the balance  It won’t affect them dramatically, but it will affect them a little  I’m not   sure it will make them converge fully to the way alternative A, section 4, is written now       I think your point about the awkwardness is right    October 30-31, 2007 88 of 162      That would be intrepid of you     How is that going?       Mr Chairman?     Let the record show I am asking this with a smile    President Plosser, you are not really suggesting that your colleagues, if they have evolved in their   view, are undisciplined, unsystematic, or capricious in their rationale for that evolution, are you?     Just to clarify about the submission you presented—  you have, as I think you said yesterday, a 25 basis point cut early in the year, in the first quarter?     Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I think the economy is   slowing  Even the nonhousing part of the economy is slowing a bit  Housing prices are still   obviously sliding down  We don’t really claim to know much about where they’re going to end up   or where we are in that process, but it seems that they are falling and probably at an accelerating   rate  Our modal forecast—“our” meaning from the submissions—is for an economy that slows   further and runs below trend over several quarters  But if you just look at the size of the bars on the   submissions, the size of that bar about downside risk to growth is very high, much higher than the   bar about upside risk to inflation  There is a huge amount of uncertainty about what equilibrium is   and where short-term interest rates should be over time  But I think it is fair to say that we are now   at the high end of, if not slightly above, most of those estimates of where equilibrium is  Therefore,   October 30-31, 2007 122 of 162    it seems to me sensible that most of our submissions had a downward slope to the path of the fed   funds rate going forward over this period   The question then is not principally whether to move but when and what signal of a change   or no change should come  I think it is a very close call, and everything that I say I say with a lot of   unease and discomfort  If the choice is to stay firm but to signal more explicitly than we did in   September that we’re likely to move further, that seems to me just a bad choice  I think it is likely   to amplify many of the risks that you are all worried about and it probably would make people more   tentative about coming in and doing what they’re going to do to let this thing work through the   markets because they will be living with our acknowledgement of substantial downside risk without   action and uncertainty about whether we’re going to move  I think you might argue that a decision   not to move with an explicit asymmetry in the balance of risks to growth would lower the path   going forward and add to that uncertainty in some sense   I do not think that the markets are so fragile now that they could not take an adverse surprise   of this magnitude, even though it is a very, very large adverse surprise relative to recent history  I   don’t think that’s a good argument for moving  I think the best argument is that we’re still in the   midst of what is a very delicate and consequential asset-price adjustment in the US economy with   a fairly dense, thick, adverse tail on the potential implications about the evolution in housing  The   Chairman spoke eloquently early in the year—I think it was early in the year, but maybe it was late   last year—about the pattern of history and the acknowledgement that weakness tends to cumulate,   and you don’t really have a lot of experience with sustained periods of below-trend growth without   falling into a more substantial rise in unemployment rates  Those risks have to be substantially   greater when you have an economy going through this kind of asset-price adjustment   October 30-31, 2007 123 of 162    I found these charts discouraging, not reassuring, in the sense that we’re anticipating a   slowdown in the rate of growth of credit for the economy as a whole that’s comparable to ’01  I   think the pressure on bank balance sheets is probably—it’s hard to make these statements with any   certainty—greater than it was in ’01  At least a reasonable expectation is that it’s going to be bigger   than it was in hindsight in ’01, and I think you have a much more substantial impairment to the   functioning of what Kevin calls debt capital markets—the industry around the design of   securitization and structured finance, et cetera, which has been so important to the way credit gets   originated and moved  That disruption could take a long time to resolve, and I think that just has to   amplify the density of the adverse tail and the growth outcome, certainly with more uncertainty at   this time     I think that it is hard, but the better course of valor is to move today, and I like the language   in alternative A  Let me just go quickly through the arguments against it that I find most   compelling  The best argument against is the fear that many of us spoke about—that even though   the inflation numbers have been reasonably reassuring and we haven’t seen substantial erosion in   inflation expectations that we can measure, there is a bit of deterioration in the feel, in the   psychology  We have to be very careful that we don’t add to that through our actions or people’s   expectations about how we’re going to behave going forward  But we should take some comfort   from the fact that the market is pricing in more than 100 basis points of easing over the next two   years  You have to believe that a fair amount of that is already reflected in breakevens, reflected in   what people are willing to pay for insurance against adverse inflation outcomes, and reflected in the   dollar  It doesn’t mean that if we validate part of those expectations you won’t see erosion, but we   should take some comfort from that   October 30-31, 2007 124 of 162    Just one more thing  We have been through three years of very substantial relative price   shocks in energy prices, commodity prices, and some other things  Those hit an economy that was   growing over the period above most estimates of potential, and we have had pretty good   performance of underlying inflation and inflation expectations in that context  So even though we   look forward and we see what’s happening in commodity prices, energy prices, and the dollar as   posing some potential risk of upside pressure on input costs, that is hitting the economy in a very   different state  The experience of those last couple of years should give us a fair amount of   confidence in the judgments we bring as to how we think about inflation going forward  I think we   have less uncertainty around an inflation forecast than we would have had two or three years ago   and still substantial uncertainty around the growth forecast inevitably given what the economy is   going through  The balances suggest that it is better to move today because of that  As I said, I’m   comfortable with the language in alternative A  I would be comfortable with Governor Mishkin’s   amendment to A—I think that helps a bit  I have a lot of sympathy for all the arguments against the   first sentence in alternative A in any form, but on balance, I would say that we just don’t want to   take the risk that, by omitting some statement like it, we cause people to price in a steeper slope to   that path going forward  It is something that we should try to avoid, and the best way to achieve   that is the language in A  Thank you      With the Mishkin amendment or without?   October 30-31, 2007 127 of 162      I think the problem with that is that developments of   financial markets on balance since the last meeting have been reassuring  The panic has receded    The disruptions are more contained, and so I don’t think that works     Mr Chairman     I want to come back to President Poole’s question    President Poole, you said a fraction of a standard error  How large a fraction of a standard error   would you want to use as a basis?  Really, I’m not sure what the standard error is in this context    But just in terms of how you think about this, how large a fraction of the standard error?     Mr Chairman, maybe we should clarify just this one   point  Did you leave the question about—I don’t know what this chart is called; it is not going to   be in the addendum to the minutes—what those bars show about the balance of risk?  Is it about   just the probability of the outcome or about the probability of outcome and the costs or   consequences of the outcome?     Sorry, Mr Chairman, two points  One is a concern to   which I have no solution  The chart that is now called chart 1, which has evolved over time, has   a slight disadvantage, because it doesn’t have fans around it because we all didn’t like the fans,   of having the sense of a pretty narrow range of likely outcomes for the future  I just wonder   whether anybody is uneasy, given the relatively low probability that we are going to end up   within those over time  I don’t have a solution to this  I was wondering whether, if you changed   the scale—[laughter]  This is a concern with no real suggested solution—I apologize  My   second point is more significant  Bill, I think you asked a good question  Mr Chairman, another   question that is interesting is, when asked whether the world should interpret the central   tendency of the Committee at a three-year horizon for PCE inflation as the rate that is consistent   with the Committee’s long-run view of price stability, how will you answer it?     No  I think that is consistent with how it is described   and what is discussed, but it just goes to the point that, Bill, you raise, which is for some of you   your optimal horizon is always going to be two years or three years  But you said all that could   be said, I think, about that      Tom, if you took a view about what appropriate policy   was last Friday and you have a chance now to assess, in light of what the Committee did, what   appropriate policy is going forward, whether that has changed, and what implications that change   has for your forecast—isn’t that the way to say it?     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Let me just make a few   quick points  I think what’s happening in markets now is very serious and really potentially very   December 6, 2007 33 of 51    dangerous  Its fundamental cause, as many of you have said, is this interaction between macro   uncertainty and fear about the likely bout ahead for housing and the US economy and the   attendant losses for financial institutions  That set of concerns is inducing a lot of behavior by   institutions in financial markets that is manifest in the really acute pressures outlined in Bill’s   charts  I think monetary policy is going to have to bear most of the burden for both responding   to the risks to the economy presented by this dynamic and arresting some of the behavioral   dynamic that we see manifest in markets today  But it is important that we try to see whether we   can help mitigate some of the liquidity problems that are here  I think it is worth the attempt    What we’re really trying to do is to figure out a way to change the composition of our balance   sheet in terms of both the range of collateral we take and the amount we do at term, in a way to   be more responsive and more effective in mitigating these kinds of pressures   We do have two examples in the experience of other central banks about the capacity to   use that greater flexibility and its impact on, for example, term premiums in the interbank   market  Although what President Lacker said is right—that the spreads in the euro unsecured   interbank market at term are also quite elevated—they are now 25 to 30 basis points below ours,   and you have to think about the FHLB borrowing, too, in the context of how our markets work    But if you look at Australia, too, and what they’ve done in the past three months, you have   another example of a central bank that has changed the composition of its balance sheet quite   significantly and, in effect, broadened the range of collateral and of counterparties it deals with    They have had a more substantial effect in mitigating these kinds of pressures in their markets    Now, they don’t prove the proposition about how much impact we could have in this context  In   some sense, I think the only effect it might have is just to buy some protection, some insurance,   against the risk that this deteriorates much further from present conditions, complicates further   December 6, 2007 34 of 51    the way monetary policy will work going forward, and undermines further the effectiveness of   other monetary policy actions we take   It’s really important to recognize that, although much of what you’re seeing in markets is   just a normalization of risk premiums to what is likely to be more appropriate given the increased   macro uncertainty, I think it really is extreme  The financial system—because of the shortening   maturity, because of the great uncertainty banks face in what they’re going to have to fund in   terms of contingent commitments they made, because of the much more limited ability they have   to finance or to liquefy parts of their balance sheets—is operating with a thinner margin  There’s   more uncertainty for all financial market participants now about how they might deal with some   adverse shock to funding, and that means we are all living with a greater risk that this would   deteriorate much more sharply and force us to do much more dramatic actions to arrest the   potential damage     I think that many of us felt that the simpler, neater, more conservative, traditional, and   easier-to-explain option would be to narrow the spread further between the primary discount rate   and the fed funds rate  But as the Chairman said—I think correctly—that is actually the less   conservative option in many ways because it’s possible that with a modest or substantial   reduction we would face an avalanche of demand for borrowing from that change  The effect on   confidence of that revealed demand for liquidity could itself be damaging to confidence, apart   from the complications it would present to the Desk in managing  So as the Chairman said,   unless you ration significantly what people could take at the discount window in that option, you   have, in fact, what I think is the less conservative option and an option that makes it much harder   for us to manage the potential negative concerns that come with this   December 6, 2007 35 of 51    Is it possible that the markets would work through this fine on their own without our   having to live with excessive risks?  It certainly is possible, but I would not minimize the extent   of the pressures revealed in these risk premiums today, the implications they pose for the   functioning of the financial system, and the potential damage they might do to our capacity to   use monetary policy to affect the fundamental risks driving this behavior  So I, of course,   support both of these options  I think it’s appropriate that we not have too high expectations   about what effects they might have  The effects may not be visible for some time  They may, in   fact, at best provide only a bit of comfort that we might not see further erosion from current   levels  But I think still there’s value in the insurance they might provide against the risk of   substantial further deterioration     With a reservation price is our understanding     Thank you  My first question is an extension of   President Evans’s question  Dave, there are two things to your monetary policy assumption in the   Greenbook  One is that you lowered the path 50 basis points over the forecast period, but the way   you did it was sort of interesting  You did 25 now, and you did the rest just at the point where I   think in your forecast the economy is coming back up toward trend growth  Can you say a little   about the shape of that path?     May I ask one follow-up question?  In the note for the   Board that you circulated on Monday, Dave, you said that the magnitude of the credit crunch you’re   contemplating is roughly comparable to the unusual weakness of private spending seen during the   headwinds episode of the early 1990s  So I was curious  It is sort of interesting because you think   that capital at banks going into this period is much stronger than going into the 1990–91 period    Corporate balance sheets, based just on the crude leverage ratios, are much healthier today than they   were then  On the other hand, banks are a smaller share of the financial system, and you could say   that the nonbank part looks kind of weak  The FHLB is growing very dramatically, taking up a fair   amount of the room left by the shrinking of the nonbank sector  I don’t know  GSEs have less   room to grow  It’s sort of mixed  It’s complicated  I was curious about how you thought about the   comparison  You didn’t seem to like the comparison     Oh, it’s just the alternative scenario  I misunderstood    I’m sorry     Thank you  The outlook for real activity has deteriorated   somewhat since our last meeting  In our modal forecast we now expect several quarters of growth   below potential with real GDP for ’08 a bit above 2 percent  The sources of the deterioration in the   outlook for us are pretty much as outlined in the Greenbook  What separates us from the   Greenbook still is about 40 or 50 basis points of different views on what potential growth is  Our   view of the likely path of the output gap is similar  So as in the Greenbook, we expect a deeper   contraction in housing activity and prices  We expect nominal and real income growth to slow   more than we expected and consumer spending also to moderate more than we had anticipated  Part   of that lower path of real spending is, of course, due to energy prices  We also expect the rate of   growth in business fixed investment to slow a bit more than we had previously thought, and these   changes are in part, but not solely, due to the expected effects of tighter financial conditions  For a   given path of the nominal fed funds rate, they are tighter now than they otherwise would have been   because of the fall in the estimated neutral rate  In our view, growth in the rest of the world will   slow a bit, but along with the effects of the decline in the dollar, it will still provide enough pull for   net exports to contribute positively to growth, offsetting part of, but just part of, the deceleration in   domestic demand growth  Our forecast for core inflation is little changed  We expect the core PCE   deflator to rise at a rate just under 2 percent over the forecast period   Like many of you, we see considerable downside risks to the forecast for growth, and they   have intensified since our last meeting  The Greenbook alternative scenarios on housing and the   December 11, 2007 65 of 138    credit crunch seem plausible, perhaps more likely to happen together than to happen independently,   and I think reality is likely to fall somewhere between the baseline Greenbook scenario and these   two darker alternatives  The risk to the inflation forecast still seems closer to balance in the forecast   period  The higher forward curve of energy prices and the lower path of the dollar will raise   headline inflation a bit and, in the near term, the core inflation path  But these pressures should be   offset by the fall in anticipated pressure on resource utilization, not just here but also globally where   the economies that have been growing above potential are likely to slow as monetary policy   tightens   I think it’s important to recognize that breakevens in inflation at longer horizons have stayed   relatively stable in the context of the fairly substantial move in the dollar, the fairly substantial move   in actual and expected energy and commodity prices, and the very dramatic change in expectations   of how the Fed is likely to respond to the change in the balance of risks to growth  In light of these   changes to the outlook and the risks to the outlook, we’ve lowered our expected path for the fed   funds rate  We now think it’s likely that the Committee will reduce the target rate to 375 percent   over the next few quarters, and this puts our real and our nominal fed funds rate assumption for ’08   a bit under the new path in the Greenbook  We’d raise it back in ’09  But our fed funds rate path is   significantly above the market’s estimate  As you’ve all recognized, conditions in markets have   deteriorated substantially since our last meeting, but the basic dynamic is still the same  Actual and   anticipated losses to financial institutions have risen as the prices of a large range of assets have   fallen  Uncertainty over the path of housing prices in the real economy and complexity in valuing   assets and structured financial instruments that are most exposed to those risks make it very hard for   markets to know with confidence the likely dimension of total losses and who is most exposed to   them   December 11, 2007 66 of 138    Financial institutions have seen a sharp increase in their cost of funds, a substantial   shortening in maturities at which they borrow, and a significant reduction in their ability to liquidate   or borrow against their assets  Most banks have seen a very large and unanticipated expansion of   their balance sheets as they’ve been forced or have chosen to provide funding in various forms  As   banks and other financial institutions have moved to position themselves to deal with a more   adverse economic and financial environment, they have become much more selective in how they   use their liquidity and capital  The consequence of those actions is evident in the sharp increase in   the cost of unsecured borrowing and the spreads on secured financing   Now, it’s important to recognize that, although a source of this pressure is concern about   macroeconomic risk and its consequence for credit loss and asset values, the consequences of the   adjustment by institutions to this new reality are very severe liquidity pressures in markets  These   are particularly acute in Europe, and they are—at least in the market’s expectations—likely to   persist well beyond year-end  These pressures are the symptom of the underlying problem, as fever   is the sign of the immune system’s response to an infection  But just as high fevers can cause organ   failure before the infection kills the body, illiquidity itself can threaten market functioning and the   economy  The longer we live with these conditions—large spikes in demand for liquid risk-free   assets, a general shortening of funding maturities, a limited amount of available financing even   against high-quality collateral, the risk of substantial liquidation of financial assets, and the chances   of runs on individual institutions’ funds—the more we are vulnerable to a self-reinforcing adverse   spiral that leads to a greater retrenchment in credit supply than fundamentals might otherwise   suggest and with a greater effect on growth   I don’t think the past four to six months have been kind to those who have argued that this   was just a mild and transitory bump  As in August, I think we have to be willing to treat both the   December 11, 2007 67 of 138    fever and the infection and, if you step back a second, the appropriate policy response to this set of   challenges will entail a mix of measures  Monetary policy will probably have to be eased further to   contain the risk of a more substantial and prolonged contraction in demand growth  I think we will   probably need to continue to adjust our various liquidity instruments  We may need to encourage   some institutions to raise more equity sooner than they otherwise might choose to do  We need to   be very careful to avoid making both types of the classic errors in supervision in financial crises    These are, on the one hand, actions that would amplify the credit crunch by forcing banks to protect   their ratios by selling more assets à la New England or, on the other hand, the commission of what   you might call irresponsible forbearance à la Japan in the hopes of masking weakness and stretching   out the pain  We also need to be careful to keep thinking through more adverse scenarios for the   economy and the financial system and the policy responses that may be appropriate if they   materialize   The United States is, I think, a remarkably resilient economy still  Outside of housing, we   don’t have the same imbalance in inventories with the same degree of overinvestment in other parts   of the economy that we have had going into past downturns  Corporate balance sheets still seem   relatively healthy  The world economy is no doubt stronger  Current account imbalance is coming   down  Our core institutions entered this adjustment period with a fair amount of capital  It is very   encouraging to see so many of them start to raise capital so early  The financial infrastructure is   more robust  Inflation expectations imply a fair degree of confidence in our ability to keep inflation   low over time  The speed and the extent of the adjustment that we’ve seen in housing and by   financial institutions to this new reality are really signs of health, of how well our system works    But we need to be cognizant that the market is torn between two quite plausible scenarios  In one,   we just grow below potential for a given period of time as credit conditions adjust to this new   December 11, 2007 68 of 138    equilibrium; in the other, we have a deep and protracted recession driven as much by financial   headwinds as by other fundamentals  There are good arguments for the former, the more benign   scenario, but we need to set policy in a way that reduces the probability of the latter, the more   adverse scenario  Thank you     I support the reduction in the fed funds rate of 25 basis   points and the language in alternative B for almost all the reasons that were raised around the   table  I just want to say two quick things  One is that, if we start acting as though we are   constrained by the political calendar of this country and choose to shade our judgments one way   or the other because of knowledge of that calendar, I think it would be a dark day for the future   of the central bank  I also think that many of you are being a little unfair to the history of the   Committee  I am not sure you can look at the evidence of monetary policy responses over the   last two decades and say that there is systematic evidence of a Committee that is quick to lurch   down and slow and reluctant to tighten  If that were the case, you would have had a level of   GDP volatility and a level of inflation expectations and a volatility of inflation expectations that   are substantially higher than they have been relative to central banks that operate with a different   kind of regime  I wasn’t here for that period, but I am a little surprised by the strength of the   conviction many of you have expressed that we have been systematically vulnerable as a   Committee to that basic bias  But, Mr Chairman, I like this option and the language in it  I   think the choices ahead of us are going to be harder than this one  We may have some 50 basis   point moves ahead of us, but I think at the moment this is the best of the alternatives     Mr Chairman, may I make one point about January,   which, as you are all aware, is that I don’t think any of us—and it is really not the staff—will be   in a position in January to provide a definitive set of convictions about really what worked, what   didn’t work, what really contributed to it, and what we did to the incentives that financial market   participants face  Just to make sure that we don’t raise expectations too much for the Committee,   I think that it will be at best an initial, tentative diagnosis with some initial, tentative sense of the   things we want to look at and that it will probably be the end of the beginning, not the beginning   of the end, of that process  [Laughter]  Is that okay, Mr Chairman?       One clarifying thing, and just a question for Scott  Is   it okay from your perspective if the recommendations come from boards of directors after the   announcement, so long as they come before the first auction?  So Thursday would be fine?     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Let me just say briefly that   I completely support the basic framework that you laid out at the beginning, and I think you gave   an excellent description of the risks that are ahead for us, the challenges we face, and the basic   strategy we have to adopt  The dominant imperative for monetary policy now is to get rates   January 9, 2008 46 of 60    down to the point at which we are providing a substantial degree of insurance against the risk of   a very adverse growth outcome and a more damaging financial crisis  This is going to require   substantial further policy action, and we are better off getting there sooner  I think there is more   risk to us now in gradualism than in force  Of course, inflation has accelerated, but I think it is   very important that inflation expectations have moved down since December, despite the move   in headline and core and despite a very substantial downward move in the expected path of the   fed funds rate  Other than that, I would just reinforce the basic framework you presented  I   would take a fair amount of comfort from the fact that I hear a lot of agreement around the room   both on your diagnosis of what is happening and in a general recognition of the extent of   deterioration in the outlook and the extent of the increase in terms of the risks to the outlook    That gives us a better basis for a pretty solid consensus in the Committee on the outlook ahead    Thanks     Mr Chairman, of course, I support your   recommendation  I think it is the right thing to do  Even with this move, I think we are likely to   have to move significantly further  It is hard to know how much more and what the optimal   January 21, 2008 13 of 32    timing of further actions is going to be  It is very important, in the context of a move, that we   signal—as your statement does—that we will do what is necessary to provide a meaningful   degree of accommodation, a meaningful degree of insurance against a more adverse set of   financial and economic outcomes  If we were to wait until the meeting, we would be taking just   too much risk  I think it would be irresponsible to take the risk that we would see a substantial   further deterioration in confidence and in market prices, which would do substantially more   damage to market functioning than we have witnessed so far   I think you said on January 9, Mr Chairman, that the risk we have to worry about is not   so much that we have simply a mild, short, and shallow recession but that we face a much deeper   and more protracted economic downturn with much more damage to the financial system that   would ultimately require, if it were to happen, much more action in terms of monetary policy   with perhaps more-adverse consequences for future incentives and for the economy as a whole  I   think that that is a risk we have to worry about  It is very hard to judge what the probability of   that risk is  None of us can know for sure what the next nine days would be like if we did not   act  None of us can know the probability that the market will work through this stuff on its own    It is a matter of judgment, and I think your judgment on this is right  I strongly support it  I just   would say again, although I don’t think any of us can support this with hard, quantifiable   evidence, that conditions are so fragile and so tenuous now that by not acting tomorrow morning   we would be taking an irresponsible risk that we would see substantial further erosion in   confidence  That would put us in a much weaker position to mitigate these risks going forward     Mr Chairman     We have not been in touch with them directly to get a   sense about their risk profile and so forth  We have had extensive conversations with the New York   State Insurance Commissioner, who is the lead supervisor of many of them, but not all of them  It   turns out that office also has very little information, particularly on the stuff that is on the leading   edge of concern, which is to whom they sold credit protection and on what  But it is in the process   January 29–30, 2008 17 of 249    of trying to remedy that, and we have been giving them a little help in trying to figure out what they   need to ask for     We have better information on the protection that banks   purchased from the monolines—by monoline and by underlying asset—and it is important, of   course, to have that     Mr Chairman     I think it’s clear in Bill’s presentation that there’s a very   strong case that the TAF, the associated measures by other central banks, and, as important, the   commitment and the signal that we would continue the TAF longer than was necessary have been   very important to the improvement of market functioning and very important to the improvement   and confidence in liquidity and markets going forward  It is very hard to know how important it has   been to that, but I think it has absolutely been very important, and I think it is very important for us   to continue it until we can comfortably say it is no longer necessary in this context  I think we are   far from the point that we can claim that  It was 24 basis points in October, President Lacker, and   January 29–30, 2008 19 of 249    there are a lot of reasons that we should be expecting to be living with a long period of fragility in   markets going forward  We all debated the merits of this going forward  There’s a set of good,   principled objections to this kind of stuff, and I didn’t expect that those objections would change on   the basis of the experience with this thing, and I don’t think we’ve learned anything new about the   merits of those objections, except that there’s a very good basis of evidence for suggesting it has   been important to the improvement in confidence and market functioning  One of our jobs is—and   I think we’ve been pretty successful in doing it—trying to give some confidence to people that we   as the central bank have provided a quality of liquidity insurance more powerful than we can   through our classic instruments  I think it has been very successful in this context  To take it back   prematurely would be damaging to the improvements we’ve achieved     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Nellie, I have two   questions for you  One is on exhibit 9, where you forecast in the middle right panel the rate of   increase in defaults on subprime ARMs  If you compare that with your reset rate estimate and   your house-price assumption or the house-price assumption in the market, I wonder whether that   January 29–30, 2008 40 of 249    looks a little optimistic  Can you just say a little more about why, under the baseline scenario,   given what has happened to house prices already and what is ahead, you wouldn’t think that   would be substantially greater?     Thank you  My second question is about your   projected credit loss, and I apologize if you said this in your introduction  Are these losses   across all holders of that credit risk?   January 29–30, 2008 41 of 249      We, being the Fed, know a fair amount about what   banks hold  Do you have a crude estimate of what share of this banks hold, or what share of this   would end up being eaten by banks?     For all the credit?     I am just trying to get at how you interpret this  So   20 percent of the additional $600 billion relative to normal or relative to bank capital cushions   now, is what?  Is it a lot or not so much?     We have had some bad points in history  I am not   trying to force you to give a prediction, but were you reassured by this or troubled by it,   fundamentally, in terms of the capacity of the financial system to absorb it?   January 29–30, 2008 42 of 249      Yes, I would agree with that     Excuse me  Could I ask—     President Yellen, I think you answered this, but could   you say a bit more about your monetary policy assumption in your forecast  How did you get to   an additional 75?     Fifty plus 25       I mean the “why,” not the “what”  Sorry     Yes  Why that much rather than—     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Let me just start by saying   it’s not all dark  [Laughter]       I’m going to end dark, but it’s not all dark  The world   still seems likely to be a source of strength  You know, we have the implausible kind of Goldilocks   view of the world, which is it’s going to be a little slower, taking some of the edge off inflation risk,   without being so slow that it’s going to amplify downside risks to growth in the United States  That   may be too optimistic, but the world still is looking pretty good  Central banks in a lot of places are   starting to soften their link to the dollar so that they can get more freedom to direct monetary policy   to respond to inflation pressure  That’s a good thing  US external imbalances are adjusting at a   pace well ahead of expectations  That’s all good, I think  As many people pointed out, the fact that   we don’t have a lot of imbalances outside of housing coming into this slowdown is helpful  There’s   a little sign of incipient optimism on the productivity outlook or maybe a little less pessimism that   we’re in a much slower structural productivity growth outlook than before  The market is building   an expectation for housing prices that is very, very steep  That could be a source of darkness or   strength, but some people are starting to call the bottom ahead, and that’s the first time  It has been   a long time since we’ve seen any sense that maybe the turn is ahead  It seems unlikely, but maybe   they’re right   In the financial markets, I think it is true that there is some sign that the process of repair is   starting  We have seen very, very substantial adjustment by the major financial institutions; very,   January 29–30, 2008 80 of 249    very substantial de-leveraging ahead as the institutions adjust to this much, much greater increase in   macroeconomic uncertainty and downside risk; very, very substantial early equity raising by major   firms; pretty substantial improvement in market functioning; and easing of liquidity pressure    Those are useful, encouraging things  There is a huge amount of uncertainty about the size and the   location of remaining credit losses across the system  But based on what we know, I think it’s still   true that the capital positions of the major US institutions coming into this look pretty good relative   to how they did in the early 1990s  Of course, as many people have said many times, there’s a fair   amount of money in the world willing and able to come in when investors see prices at sufficiently   distressed levels  One more encouraging sign, of course, is that the timing, content, and design of   the stimulus package look as though the package will be a modest positive  It could have been a   worse balance of lateness and poor design, but I think it looks to be above expectations on both   timing and design, and it will help a little on the downside and take out some of the downside risk   Having said that, though, I think it is quite dark still out there    Like everyone else, we have   revised down our growth forecast  We expect very little growth, if any, in the first half of the year   before policy starts to bring growth back up to potential  The main risk, as has been true since   August, is the dangerous self-reinforcing cycle, in which tighter financial conditions hurt confidence   and raise recession probability, causing people to behave on the expectation that recession probably   is higher, reinforcing the financial headwinds, et cetera  The dominant challenge to policy is still to   arrest that dynamic and reduce the probability of the very adverse outcome on the growth side  Of   course, we have to do that without risking too much damage to our inflation credibility and too   much damage to future incentives and future resource allocation   Like many of you, I think the inflation outlook for the reasons laid out in the Greenbook is   better than it was  It’s not terrific, but it’s better  The risks are probably balanced around the   January 29–30, 2008 81 of 249    inflation outlook  Our inflation forecast still has core PCE coming down below 2 percent over the   forecast period  There’s obviously a lot of uncertainty around that, but I really think that you can   look at inflation expectations in the markets as somewhat reassuring on the credibility front to date    So again, I think the key question for policy is how low we should get real short-term rates relative   to equilibrium, and our best judgment is that we’re going to have to get them lower even with   another 50 basis points tomorrow  We’re still going to need to try to reinforce the signal that we’re   going to provide an adequate degree of accommodation or insurance against this very dangerous   risk of a self-reinforcing cycle in which financial weakness headwinds reinforce the risk of a much   deeper and prolonged decline in economic activity     There is a “castle in the sand” quality in this   discussion  Let me make just three points on what I took from this and see if I got it right  One   is, in the staff’s judgment, at 3 percent—in that view of the world, which is not way off from   where the discussion was yesterday—policy is not providing any degree of insurance or   accommodation against the adverse outcomes that may be ahead     The second thing I took away is that this framework seems like a good way of thinking   about how you think about moving lower, how you think about what mistake we’re going to   make or we want to make  We are going to make a mistake, but it is good to think about what   January 29–30, 2008 112 of 249    mistake is more costly and what mistake is easier to correct  It seems to me it tells us almost   nothing, frankly, about when we are going to be in a position where we are going to want to start   to take it back  It also probably tells us very little about how quickly we are going to want to   take it back  I would have thought that the most remarkable thing in these paths is how little   difference the variance is in the outcomes a year out  I mean, they must be so far within the   range of uncertainty in this context, and for us to start thinking now about how to design the   optimal exit and communicate it, not just for President Evans’s reasons but many others, just   basic humility, it seems to me kind of premature  I have a lot of sympathy for the fact that we   will want to make sure that we are choosing which error we are going to make  I have a lot of   sympathy for thinking through how we correct for that error  But for us to assert, because we are   worried about the implications of that, that we are going to start focusing now on the design of   the exit, sounds to me a bit like a statement of the obvious  Of course we are going to move with   alacrity to take back and make sure those inflation expectations stay anchored at a reasonable   level  Of course we are  To suggest otherwise and to assert it would look kind of insecure—a   lack of confidence in what we are here to do     The third thing I took away from it is that it seems to say that, if you make policy in a   way consistent with the response of this Committee over the past decade and a half or so, you   have pretty good outcomes in the strategy in which you take out enough risk against the   downside error  Now, life could be uncertain  Maybe that is too charitable to the past, but it   seems to be kind of reassuring in that way     May I answer that?     I will follow Don       I really couldn’t tell, President Lacker, what inference   you were going to draw from that  But I would just reinforce the point that, if you are more   worried and uncertain now about the magnitude of the headwinds and the duration, I think it has   to mean that you err on the side of going lower sooner  But the main point is that we just don’t   know much about it, and I think it is worth a lot of humility  I mean, think how surprised we   have been by so much over this period, even with all our thinking through three years ago about   alternative paths for housing  So I would just vote for humility  But the basic point is that we   have to err on the side of being worried about reducing the risk that you end up with 75 mile an   hour headwinds rather than 25 for a long period of time     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Let me just say that I am   completely comfortable with the way you just framed the case, not just for thinking about and   talking about strategies for how we take this back at the appropriate point, but I also don’t have any   problem with the way you talked about how you’d frame it in public  I thought that was fine    When I talked about the need for humility, it was just in our capacity to design optimal strategies for   the timing and the slope of the path to reversal at this stage  I think it’s going to require more time   A few things about the policy action and the statement  Obviously I support 50, and I   support the language in alternative B, paragraph 4, as written  The Chairman laid out in public   earlier this month a basic strategy that said that policy would be directed at providing an adequate   degree of insurance against the downside risks, given the nature of those risks  It was said with   more nuance and eloquence, but basically that was the thrust of the strategy  I think that the balance   of evidence we have—even with all the uncertainty about what equilibrium is, what the appropriate   level of the real rate is, and what it actually is—suggests that we have not gotten policy to that point    Therefore, getting that strategy in place is likely to require further action  It’s very hard to know   when or how much  It’s very hard to know what should frame that choice now for us, I think  As   January 29–30, 2008 151 of 249    many of you said, markets have to go through a further set of adjustments, and I think that has to   work through the system  Our job, again, is not to artificially interfere with that process or to   substitute our judgment for what the new equilibrium should be in that context  Our job should be   to make sure that adjustment happens without taking too much risk that it tips the financial system   and the economy into a much more perilous state that would be harder for us to correct and require   much more policy response  There’s a big difference between a world in which housing prices fall   20 percent and one in which they fall 40  If everybody thinks they have to prepare for a world in   which they fall 40, we’re going to take much greater risk that we have a scale of financial trauma   and credit crunch that would produce the odds of a deeper recession   What we face now is not the choice, as I think President Poole said, between a mild   recession now and higher-than-expected inflation over time  The risk we face, as the Chairman said   several times, is the choice between a mild, short recession and a deeper, more protracted outcome    The scale of financial market fragility we now face, you could even say solvency in parts of the   financial system, is a function of the confidence we create in our willingness to get policy to a point   that provides meaningful protection against an adverse outcome  I think the experience of the past   five or six meetings suggests that we cannot carefully enough design a message that can lean against   expectations in the market about the likely path of policy that we judge to be excessive and that   makes us uncomfortable without taking too much risk that it will just undermine confidence in our   willingness to get policy right  We just don’t have that capability  We thought about it and tried it   in lots of different ways, but everything we experienced over the past four months justifies the   judgment that we can’t lean against those expectations without taking too much risk that we   undermine confidence in our capacity to get policy to the point at which we’re giving some   insurance   January 29–30, 2008 152 of 249    It would be a mistake to try to recalibrate expectations now relative to the stance of policy as   stated in the Chairman’s statement and our statement last week  It would be a mistake to recalibrate   back to a point that looks more like October  Everything we know suggests that it’s probable that   the data will get still worse from here and that the financial markets will be in a state of considerable   fragility and tenuousness for some time  To sort of zig at this meeting, to recalibrate more toward a   sense of balance in the face of that reality, just means that we’re likely to have to zag back again  I   just think that would risk our looking as though we’re ambivalent and have to correct again because   of that  That would just be uncomfortable  It’s hard to know—I think Governor Kroszner said it   right in many, many meetings—whether we face the risk of a grinding, downward, self-reinforcing   set of pressures on balance sheets that raises the risk of deeper trough in housing and creates more   caution and deleveraging and the economy moves slowly down or whether we face the risk of much   more acute cliffs in asset prices with much greater consequences for confidence and the fragility of   the financial system  It is hard to know, but I think both would be very uncomfortable for us   Again, I strongly support the language in B as it is  Even though I understand the rationale,   I’d be very uncomfortable with dialing back that statement as it now exists to something that   suggests we’re closer to balance     Thank you  I agree with President Poole and President   Yellen about the need to focus on compensation structures and incentives, but just two observations    One is that, if you look at compensation practices among the guys who actually look as though they   did pretty well against those who didn’t do so well—I’m not talking about in a mortgage-origination   sense but in the major global financial institutions—the structure of compensation doesn’t vary that   much  What varies a lot is how well people control for the inherent problems in the basic   compensation structures  Remember Raghu’s presentation was mostly about hedge fund   compensation, and I think he is mostly wrong when you think about that and the incentive structure    The difference really is how you design your limits to make sure that your traders’ incentives are   more aligned with the incentives of the firm as a whole  The biggest errors and differences are in   the design of the process of the checks and balances to compensate for the inherent problems in the   compensation structure  That’s important to know because a lot of these things, if you look at the   formal attributes of the risk-management governance structure across these firms, don’t look that   different  What distinguishes how well the guys did is much more subtle around culture,   January 29–30, 2008 165 of 249    independence, and the quality of judgment exercised at the senior level, and this is important   because, when you think about what you can do through supervision and regulation, to affect that   stuff is hard   I have a question for Pat  Pat, not to overdo this, but where do you put in your diagnosis of   contributing factors the constellation of financial conditions that prevailed during the boom and   what those did to housing prices?  You know, there’s a tendency for everybody to look at regulation   and supervision and the incentives that they have created or failed to mitigate, but there is a   reasonable view of the world that you wouldn’t have had the pattern of underwriting standards of   mortgages without the trajectory of house prices that occurred  Sure, maybe what happened in the   late stage of the mortgage-origination process contributed to the upside, but if you look at a chart,   the rate of house-price appreciation started to decelerate about the time you had the worst erosion in   underwriting practices  Anyway, my basic question is, Where do you put the constellation of   financial conditions, not so much just what the Fed was doing but what was happening globally that   affected long rates, expectations of future rates, et cetera?     Be careful what you wish for       Just very quickly, you did a terrific job  I think it’s   important, though, to recognize that this isn’t done yet, and we’re not going to know fundamentally   how we feel about the relative strengths and weaknesses in the system until we see how this plays   out  Don’t let these initial presumptions—either the diagnosis or the prescription, particularly your   list of prescriptions—harden too much because there are some judgments that we’re just not going   to be able to make until the dust settles and we have a little time for reflection in that context  I   think a lot of damage has been done to the credibility of our financial system  It’s not clear how   much damage because we don’t know how this is going to play out  But damage has been done,   and we are going to bear a lot of the burden of figuring out how to craft a compelling policy   January 29–30, 2008 193 of 249    response, recognizing of course that regulation may be part of the problem and won’t necessarily be   part of the solution  Anyway, mostly I just meant to compliment you  You did a great job, and I   think it’s helpful really to have this much work done early on in getting us to the point where we   know what we’re going to do to the system to make it less vulnerable to this in the future  Even as   we manage the crisis, I think it’s good to have made that investment and a good tribute to the   strength of the system that we were able to devote these quality resources even though we’ve all   been busy managing the storm     Mr Chairman, maybe I could say something in   response to this  I agree with the concerns expressed about giving access to liquidity when we   haven’t done it before without a full capacity to affect the supervisory constraints these guys   operate under  We are not doing this for them, though  We are doing it because we think it is   necessary to help improve market functioning more generally  We do not have the capacity in   these circumstances to redesign the regulatory framework to give us, as a condition of access to   something that we are doing for market functioning, the ability to affect and constrain the risk-  taking behavior of those institutions  All primary dealers, except for one, I believe, are subject to   consolidated supervision in some form  Those primary supervisors, with which we have a very   close-running relationship, often subject those institutions to a set of constraints, including in the   investment banks a consolidated capital regime and a set of other constraints on liquidity   We will, of course, be in very close contact, as we have been with those primary   supervisors, about the evolving financial conditions of those institutions  If we have evidence,   directly or through the supervisors, of some material erosion in the financial business of those   institutions from a solvency perspective, that will cause us to reflect on what we do with those   institutions going forward  I wish it were the case that we could condition this step on a change   in the regulatory regime that would give us that capacity  But we just don’t have that ability   now  Are we protecting ourselves carefully against that risk?  We are protecting ourselves   carefully, but not perfectly, against that risk   One last comment  The Desk has a lot of experience in affecting the incentive that   primary dealers have—how much they can actually bid for, particularly in circumstances where   the condition of the primary dealer is eroding quickly  That is not perfect, but it gives us some   experience and some chance to make sure that we don’t put ourselves in a position where we   March 10, 2008 17 of 39    allow an institution that is deteriorating rapidly to take a progressively larger amount of a   particular auction in that context  So although I agree with the concerns and I really am   sympathetic to the objective, the reality today is that we can’t remake this messy system we have   in this context to give us that additional comfort     I agree that we face that risk  As many of us have   learned over the past six to nine months, even the primary supervisors of these institutions have   limits around their capacity to understand in real time what is actually happening  So we face   that vulnerability—I agree with you—and that will limit, realistically, how much protection we   are going to be able to take for ourselves in this context  I think that is a necessary and   uncomfortable risk in taking this next step  I am not sure it is dramatically different from the risk   we face with the discount window generally and with the TAF  It is different, of course, because   of our limited supervisory reach over at least five of the institutions  But I think that you stated   the risk well and that it is important to recognize that risk     But this is voluntary like the TAF  In that sense, it is   equivalent  But you are right; it would be a consequential act for us to say to a primary dealer,   “We are going to restrict you to X” or “We are not going to consider you eligible any more to   bid”  It would not be, we would hope, a visible act  But, of course, in taking the action we   would be responsible, in some sense, for contributing to the failure of that institution     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Just a few final things  I   support both of these steps, of course  I think monetary policy can’t bear the full burden of dealing   with these kinds of pressures, dangerous dynamics, in markets that Bill and Don described so well    This proposal is the best of a bunch of bad options  It is very hard to know how much effect it is   going to have  It is very possible it will get overwhelmed by the sheer magnitude of the selling   pressure, risk reduction, and forced deleveraging still under way  It is very hard for us to know now   how much of that is necessarily ahead of us, even in a world where there is less uncertainty about   the macro outlook  I think all of you who said this are right  There’s some risk in doing this that   we’ll just face much more pressure to do more  But I think that pressure will be with us anyway,   and it would intensify even without action in this context  The important thing is that the Congress   gave us the authority, although they may not fully have envisioned the world we live in today, to do   a range of things to address these kinds of pressures  Not to use that authority in carefully designed,   responsible ways because of the fear that we could not resist pressure to expand is not, in my view,   March 10, 2008 32 of 39    a good argument not to do things that we think would be sensible in mitigating these pressures  I   think we are a stronger institution than we were  Jeff, you invoked the 1970s  We’re a substantially   stronger institution than then, and we have the ability to decide what we think is enough and what   line we’re not prepared to cross, and we should be confident that we’re willing to draw that line and   that we can sustain it   Where do we go from here?  If only we knew  I would like nothing more than to be able to   sit here today and say, “If X, then it’s obvious we would do Y, and if we do Y, then we could be   confident we could contain it”  But I don’t think anybody can sit here and say that today  I think   none of the options out there beyond this look good  The other options are much worse than this,   and if we do not escalate now in this context, I think then we face much more risk that will get to   much more uncomfortable options with much worse moral hazard concerns for us and the system as   a whole   So let me just say that I completely agree with the concerns expressed about this  They were   eloquently stated by all of you, but I think it’s very important that we continue to demonstrate   through what we say and what we do that we are willing to do practical things that we think have   some prospect of alleviating these pressures on market liquidity  So just to repeat, I support both the   swap expansion and reauthorization and this new securities lending facility  Thank you, Mr   Chairman     May I say just one thing, Mr Chairman?  I want to point   out that not only has Bill, along with a whole range of people in New York and on the Board staff,   been working 24 hours a day for about five days, not only did he write a terrific statement for the   FOMC just now, despite all of those other preoccupations, but he sat with his wife through major   surgery on Thursday and Friday and with her as she recovered  Just a remarkable, terrific   performance  I compliment him and just note that the burden he has been carrying is considerable   even in comparison with the burden of so many others     Mr Chairman, could I just add one thing on this?  I think   the delicacy of the whole tri-party repo thing is hard to overstate  For better or worse, mostly for   worse, the full tri-party repo market generally has spread over the last few years well beyond Fed-  eligible securities, and until we get to the other side of this, there is a lot of risk in that stuff on repo   that goes further out the eligible collateral quality spectrum  Even in a world where confidence   comes back around the primary dealers as counterparties, the thing is there’s just some natural risk   that that stuff is going to have to be financed in some other form   The hardest thing in this balance now is to try to do something that doesn’t increase the   incentives so that we become the counterparty to everybody  We’re trying to make sure that it’s a   backstop, but not a backstop that’s so attractive that they come, and that’s going to be a very hard   line to walk  I say that, Bill, because, just to lower expectations, the necessary cost of the choice   we’ve made is that we’re going to take the risk that we end up funding a bunch of stuff like that, and   the commitment to do that is the only way this helps  It is very hard to know  Again, even if   confidence holds, there is a reasonable probability that some of that stuff is just going to have to   move into different forms and other hands, and that could be a delicate transition, particularly if   people read into that a broader loss of confidence in this stuff   The other thing that’s important to point out is that it is just not realistic to expect, even with   the force of the things that we announced on Sunday night, that we don’t still have a wave of   deleveraging ahead of us  There is still just a huge part of the world that knows they are really long   March 18, 2008 10 of 127    on risk in a fragile environment and have not yet gotten to that point  With everything that’s   happened in markets, their leverage is going up as the world goes against them, and they’re going to   want to keep bringing it down  That really is going to work against the effect of all the things we’re   doing  So just be prepared under the best of circumstances for a sustained period of substantial   fragility  But to underscore your point, Jeff, we agree with your point and had been discussing in   what we thought was a slightly calmer world over the past two weeks exactly that mix of things,   and we’ll be on it together and consulting     Don’t say IOU  [Laughter]     Mr Chairman, may I ask one clarifying question?     President Fisher, did you just say the efficacy of “any”   cut in the fed funds rate?     I completely agree with that  But just to make sure   that I didn’t misinterpret you, did you say the efficacy of “any” further cut?     No further cuts     I wasn’t debating  It was just a clarifying question     Mr Chairman, I’m going to cede all of my time to you,   except to acknowledge and to point out that there’s much I agree with that has been said around the   table, particularly with how people characterize the growth outlook and the risks and what’s   happening in financial markets and to the outlook  I can’t say that stuff better than it has been said    But there’s much I disagree with in what’s been said, particularly on the inflation side, about the   lack of credibility   I just want very quickly to say a couple of things about how we talk about this stuff based on   what’s been said  First, some of you at this table may believe that we are losing credibility, and you   may be losing confidence in the capacity of this Committee to mitigate the risk to our long-term   inflation objectives  If you say that in public, you will magnify that problem, and just because you   believe it does not make it true  I believe that you should have more confidence in the commitment   of this Committee to do what is necessary to keep those expectations stable over time  Second, the   stuff about capital and the financial system is very, very important  It is very hard to make the   March 18, 2008 74 of 127    judgment now that the financial system as a whole or the banking system as a whole is   undercapitalized  Some people out there are saying that  In some states of the world, particularly if   there is no liquidity, then any financial system will be systematically insolvent  But based on   everything we know today, if you look at very pessimistic estimates of the scale of losses across the   financial system, on average relative to capital, they do not justify that concern  It is very important   to make distinctions in what we say about that  It is very different to say that their distribution is   uneven and to say that for some institutions those losses may be large relative to capital  That is   obviously the case; we have already seen that to be the case  It is important to make the distinction   between the average and the distribution  Although the average losses look relatively manageable   relative to capital, the system is short of capital relative to what would be ideal, given that we’ve   had the collapse of a very large part of the nonbank financial system  Banks as a whole are not   large enough now, even with their capital cushions, to compensate for the scale of disintermediation   of that type of nonbank finance  Those are very important distinctions to make in this case     There is nothing more dangerous in what we’re facing now than for people who are   knowledgeable about this stuff to feed these broad concerns about our credibility and about the   basic core strength of the financial system  So I just want to underscore the importance of   exceptional care in how we talk about those things, even in private  A lot of people out there who   should know better—none of us is guilty of this—are casting broad aspersions about solvency that   are very dangerous in this context  May we get to the point where those concerns are justified?  Of   course we may get to that point  If we systematically mismanage policy, we may get to that point    But please be careful in that context   I’m sorry, Mr Chairman  I meant to cede all my time to you  [Laughter]  Finally, I have to   state for the record that I did submit our forecast  To state the obvious, it’s close enough to the   March 18, 2008 75 of 127    Greenbook on most things, and, given the range of uncertainty, there’s no material between our   view and the Greenbook’s     Mr Chairman, it is kind of awkward to ask this in the   midst of a meeting, but I think it is important  I think there was a pretty big change this morning at   least in risk perceptions today across a bunch of markets  Can you tell what the fed funds curve has   done this morning?     Financial credit default swaps this morning are much,   much narrower  May I raise a conceptual question around this, though?  Maybe this is really for   you, Mr Chairman  How should we think about the tradeoff between what we do with the fed   funds rate and whatever effect we have on liquidity and credit spreads, which are obviously in some   ways working against the reduction of the fed funds rate?  It doesn’t seem to me quite right to say   that they are perfect tradeoffs     I guess my question is, Don’t they have independent   effects?  I mean, they are separate and somewhat different in terms of how we think about   mitigating the risk to the overall economy     So maybe to echo the dialogue that you had with   Governor Mishkin, if we were to be successful through taking out some of the liquidity risk of   markets more generally and we got those spreads maybe back down to—I don’t know—50, in a   crude proxy sense, that would be good and powerful but we would still be left with exceptionally   tight financial conditions relative to the given target fed funds rate  Is that fair?  I mangled that     I guess another way to frame the question is, If we are   reasonably successful in mitigating this adverse feedback dynamic in markets and the effects that   has on financial conditions, would we still need to lower the nominal fed funds rate further to   achieve the forecast laid out in the Board staff’s Greenbook?     Let me just begin with a question because I think it is   really central  It goes to the issue of how accommodative policy is now  Fundamentally that   must be critical to the magnitude of the risks we are taking that we are going to get it wrong and   inflation in the future is going to be too high  Now, I am not really part of your profession, but I   have always found this chart to be the most discouraging prism on the choices we face     This is the Bluebook equilibrium real funds rate chart    But any way you look at it, the real fed funds rate is closer to best estimates of equilibrium than   during any downturn of the past two decades or similar periods of time  There is no gap between   the estimated real rate today and the center of the estimate of where equilibrium is  If you look   back to what that gap was in 1992, in 2001-02, or in 2003, there was a substantial gap, as most   judgments about policy would suggest was necessary  I understand that there is a huge amount   of uncertainty about estimates of equilibrium, but we can’t be facing both the most serious risk   of a financial crisis and of a deep, prolonged recession in 50, 30, or 20 years and at the same time   the risk of having a very substantial rise in underlying inflation over the medium term  It seems   to me that we are going to have one or the other  The choice we face, of course, is which risk we   are prepared to take  Which mistake is the easier to correct for?  It is a very hard judgment to   make   But I think we have to be confident that, if we end up being successful in averting the risk   of a very, very dangerous, damaging spiral in the financial markets with the consequences of a   very deep recession or a deeper recession than in the early 1990s, then we will be able to deal   with the likely consequences that we will have more inflation and less moderation than we now   anticipate  I guess I don’t understand why we would not be confident in that  So let me just say   March 18, 2008 107 of 127    that I don’t think this is easy  Like many of you, I think that it would be great if we got away   with 50, but I think that is not tenable—not even close in this context   Even though it would be nice if we had a consensus in the United States about a set of   fiscal measures that we think would be good on the merits, we can’t make monetary policy in a   framework where we condition our actions on actions by the Congress  In an environment like   this, it is not possible  If we do the right thing, does that mean it takes the pressure off them?    Maybe, but probably not so much  But it can’t constrain us from doing what is appropriate now   Just one final thing  People who know this stuff quite well, who are reasonably calm   people, say, “This is possibly the worst financial crisis in 50 years, and the most challenging set   of pressures facing the central bank in 20 or 30 years”  Think about that in this context  Okay?    It is no surprise that we disagree; it is no surprise that the range of agreement about what we see   and what we should do is going to be wide in that context  But just think very carefully about   the signal it sends to the world at this moment to be explicit in public about the degree of   dispersion about our views  Just think carefully about it because this is a special moment     I fully support the language and the action in alternative A  President Fisher, I would not   amend the last sentence to say “without sacrificing” partly because I think we need to project   confidence in our capacity to manage long-term inflation outcomes  I am ambivalent, as you   know, Mr Chairman, about that clause that President Fisher suggested we delete about reflecting   a projected leveling out  The virtue is that it explains and underpins, therefore, the basis for a   medium-term forecast  The vice in it is that, as the Chairman himself said, the first part may   seem like a thin reed on which to base our forecast, given what has been happening  I actually   think, Governor Mishkin, that acknowledging some indicators of inflation expectations—it is   really about uncertainty having increased—is helpful to our credibility  At the margin, it helps,   March 18, 2008 108 of 127    even though, sure, you can say that we really can’t know what they are telling us about the   market     Somewhat     Let me say for the record that I agree with everything   you just said  My only point is that there is no surprise that we disagree or that it is complicated   and we have a different view of the balance  If anything, what this chart shows is how broad the   range of uncertainty is around this  That was part of my point in saying it  But I do think that   the value of the public display of dispersion is different when you have this degree of a   confidence problem in markets generally  That is the only thing I was suggesting  I completely   agree about the value of diversity of view in this context  It is no surprise that we disagree in this   period  My only suggestion is in terms of how we think about talking about it publicly, given   that we are at such a delicate moment     I want to say just one thing in this context  The   Chairman alluded to this, too  I think there is some value in taking this opportunity now to try to   get a better balance in the relative attractiveness across these facilities  So in the scheme of   things, it is better for us for the auction type of facilities to be relatively attractive compared with   April 29–30, 2008 14 of 266    the open facilities for which demand is unknown and we can’t calibrate it—those are much   bigger reserve-management things  I think our exit strategy from these things is easier if we   evolve in that direction  One virtue of the package that the Chairman presented is that it is worth   taking another shot at trying to get those interbank term premiums down in dollars because—to   use a technical term—they are screwing up the transmission mechanism of US monetary policy   now  We are not quite sure how much effect we can have  There is a plausible case that   increasing the size of the swaps will help on that front  It is worth doing now  Second, the   broader package will buy a little more insurance against the risk that these liquidity pressures   reignite and we have another wave of the adverse dynamic margin-spiral-downward-self-feeding   thing  It is better to do that when other things are improving rather than wait until we are again   at the edge of the abyss, although that is a tactical judgment  It is hard to know for sure     I think that Bill is absolutely right  It is not clear how much incremental benefit the   expanded collateral in the TSLF will offer  We can’t be sure  But, Jeff, it won’t come because   we are increasing the size of the TSLF  That would increase the amount of Treasuries we are   putting in, and we are not increasing the size  It would come only through what effect it might   have on the broader range of asset-backed securities we have there  Remember, at the beginning   we framed this as an effort to address some unique constraints operating on securitization   markets, particularly in ABS  So there is a possibility of some additional benefit in those   markets—some greater insurance against another downward spiral in that case—but not that   high  It is hard to judge the merits of that against the appearance risk you presented, but I think   this is designed pretty carefully to be robust to that perception problem  Our job is to do what   makes sense and what we can defend as sensible in this context, and we have to be prepared to   April 29–30, 2008 15 of 266    do that even if people have made it awkward for us to do the right thing because of the   perception problem     Thank you, Mr Chairman  In terms of markets, Fed   credibility, and negative surprises on the data relative to our forecasts, I think this has been the   best intermeeting period in a long time  The markets reflect increased confidence that policy will   be effective in mitigating the risks both of a systemic financial crisis and of a very deep,   protracted recession  We have seen a substantial upward movement in the expected path of the   fed funds rate and in real forward rates, significant diminution in the negative skewness in fed   funds rate expectations, and a significant move down in a range of different measures of credit   risk premiums, and markets have been pretty robust despite bad news over the past few weeks or   so  Medium- and long-term expectations in TIPS have moved down, and we have had a very   important and substantial additional wave of inflow of equity into the financial system   Our forecast, though, is roughly the same as it was in March, and it is broadly similar to   the path outlined in the Greenbook  We expect economic activity to follow a path somewhere   April 29–30, 2008 70 of 266    between the last downturn—a relatively mild downturn—and that of 1990  We expect   underlying inflation to moderate somewhat over the forecast period to something below   2 percent  We see the risks to the growth forecast still skewed to the downside, though   somewhat less so than in March, and we see the risks to the inflation outlook as broadly   balanced  Uncertainty around both paths, though, is unusually high   I want to make four points  First, on economic growth, again, I still think we face   substantial risk in this adverse self-reinforcing interaction among falling house prices, slower   spending, and financial headwinds  Even with the very substantial adjustment in housing   construction that has already occurred and even if demand for housing stays stable at these   levels, we still have several quarters ahead of us before the decline in housing prices starts to   moderate  A further falloff in aggregate demand during this period would raise the prospect of a   much larger peak-to-trough decline in housing prices, with higher risk of larger collateral   damage to confidence, spending, credit supply, et cetera  Weakness, as the Chairman has   reminded us several times over the past few years, tends to cumulate and spread in these   conditions, and weakness may only just be beginning outside of housing  The saving rate here   may have to rise substantially further  The world is behind us in this cycle, and it is likely to   slow further, diminishing potential help from net exports going forward     Second, financial conditions are, I think, still very fragile  The financial system as a   whole still looks as though it is short of the capital necessary to support growth in lending to   creditworthy households and borrowers  Parts of the system still need to bring leverage down   significantly  Liquidity conditions in some markets are still impaired; securitization markets are   still essentially shut  I think the markets now reflect too much confidence in our willingness and   ability to prevent large and small financial failures  We are going to disappoint them on the   April 29–30, 2008 71 of 266    small ones, which may increase the probability they attach to the large  At least I hope we   disappoint them on the small ones     Third, I think the inflation outlook, as many of you have said, still has this very   uncomfortable feel to it—very high headline inflation, very high readings on the Michigan   survey, and the dollar occasionally showing the spiral of feeding energy and commodity prices   and vice versa  I sat next to Paul Volcker when he gave his speech in New York the other day,   and he said that the world today feels as it did in the 1970s  I was alive in the 1970s, but only   just  [Laughter]  But I think it is better than that  It has to be better than that  Core has come in   below expectations  David is not going to explain all of that away by these temporary, reversible   factors  You have all acknowledged that there is somewhat of an improvement in inflation   expectations at medium-term horizon  It is very important that you have not seen any material   pressure in broad measures of labor compensation  Profit margins are coming down, but they are   still unusually high  The path of output relative to potential, both here and around the rest of the   world, is going to significantly diminish pressure on resource utilization going forward even if   you have other forces that push up demand for energy and food secularly  I think it is worth   remembering that we had a very, very large sustained relative price shock in the years preceding   this downturn, with very little pass-through to core inflation  In fact, in many ways, core   inflation moderated over that period with output to potential much tighter   Fourth, on monetary policy, it seems to me that we are very close to a level that should   put us in a good position to navigate these conflicting pressures ahead  What matters for the   outlook is the relationship between the real fed funds rate and our estimates of equilibrium    Although we can’t measure the latter with any precision, those estimates of equilibrium have to   be substantially lower than normal because of what is happening in financial markets  The   April 29–30, 2008 72 of 266    Greenbook and Bluebook presentations suggest that the real fed funds rate now is about at   equilibrium  You can look at it through a number of prisms and see some accommodation—see   the real fed funds rate somewhat below equilibrium now  We won’t know the answer until this   is long over  I think that we are probably now within the zone where we are providing some   insurance against the risk of a very bad macroeconomic financial outcome without creating too   much risk of an inflation spiral  We should try for an outcome tomorrow in our action and in our   statement that is pretty close to market neutral   One final point about the future  What strikes me as most implausible in our forecast in   New York, and I think in the average of our submissions, is the speed with which we expect to   return to growth rates that are close to estimates of long-term potential  A more prudent   assumption might be for a more protracted period of below-trend growth for a bunch of familiar   reasons  I don’t know if that is the most likely outcome, but it is a plausible and realistic   outcome  I don’t think we should be directing policy at trying to induce an unrealistically quick   return to what might be considered more-normal growth rates over time  Thank you     Mr Chairman, I was wondering if Brian or Bill   wanted to talk President Plosser out of his concern about MZM at some point     Definitely March  January was minimalist     This speculation is perilous     But I think it goes exactly to what both Bills just said,   in that it depends fundamentally on whether the disappointment is reassuring or troubling  We   have had two examples of disappointment that have been troubling, and we have had one   example of disappointment being reassuring—the most recent one being the latter  So I think   what matters most is what happens to the expected path of the fed funds rate going forward, and   that is how you would know  If you disappoint significantly and the markets lower the expected   path going forward, as they did in October and December, you could have the dollar weaken as a   result just as easily as strengthen  We are not very good at speculating about the effect on the fed   funds rate expectations of our statements, and it is much harder to speculate about the effect on   April 29–30, 2008 99 of 266    the dollar in this context  You can tell a compelling story on both sides  It sort of depends how   plausible it is, particularly if you have language saying that downside risks to growth remain   even without moving, that we are signaling greater confidence in the strength of the economy   going forward with an action that implies not moving       Thank you, Mr Chairman  The transcript says,   “Mishkin says canary wheezing but hasn’t keeled over”  [Laughter]  I support alternative B  I think   you could frame this as a modest recalibration of policy with a hawkish soft pause     I don’t think the canary is wheezing  Look, I think there   are lots of good arguments on both sides of this  I think all the good ones have been made  The   markets have been giving us a pretty good test against the concern, which I think we all share, that if   we move today we risk some significant erosion of our inflation credibility or inflation expectations   feeding through the dollar into a commodity price spiral  We have had a pretty good test of it  Over   the past several weeks, there has been a very substantial shift in expectations for the path of the fed   funds rate, which embody substantial expectations around a near-term cut and very little beyond that   and some modest retracing as we go forward  Expectations have come down despite what has   happened to oil prices  Inflation has come down  The dollar is stronger on net over that period    This is pretty good validation that the path that is represented in alternative B does not come with   excessive risk that we will be eroding our credibility  We can’t know for sure  It’s good to be   worried about that risk, but the protection against that risk is fairly good   What strikes me about this discussion is the extent of the gap in this Committee in how we   think about the way to measure the stance of monetary policy  What we could do is use a seminar   and a bit of history on this  It would be nice to run monetary policy back over the past four decades   to see, if it had been set with a basic policy regime in which we looked only at the real fed funds rate   deflated by headline inflation today, what the outcomes would have been for the economy at that   time  That’s essentially what you guys are saying  It seems to me that you are basically saying that   equilibrium doesn’t vary and that deflating the nominal fed funds rate with some mix of headline   and core today is the best way to judge the stance of policy  But I think it’s worth having a little   exercise in it  It is hard to look back     Okay, but it is a surprising gap  So I think it would be   worth some time to think through that  Obviously we also disagree about how inflation works in the   United States, how relative price shocks take effect, and what we should respond to in that sense    That would be worth a little time, too  Again, it is a surprise to me  We sit here to make monetary   policy, and we haven’t talked much about this basic core question  How should we judge the stance   of policy?  It would be worth some attention   I just want to end by saying something about the dollar  My basic sense about the dollar—  and I’m very worried about this dynamic now—is that it has been trading more on concern about   tail risk in the economy and in the financial system than anything else  As I said yesterday, if you   look back to when there has been an increase in perceived tail risk, however you want to measure   it—credit default swaps on financials or something like that—and the two-year has fallen sharply or   we have had a big flight to quality, those have been the periods that have been most adverse to the   dollar  Now, it is not a consistent pattern, but I think it’s basically right; and I think it gives an   important illustration that what goes into a judgment about whether people hold dollars and US   financial assets has to do with a lot of things  It has a lot to do with confidence that this Committee   will reduce the tail risk in the financial system and the economy to tolerable levels  It also has a lot   to do with confidence in our willingness to keep inflation stable over a long period, but it’s not only   that  Again, we have had a pretty good experiment in that proposition over the past year or so   My sense is that the biggest risk to the dollar, since I’m pretty confident that this Committee   is going to make good judgments about inflation going forward, is in the monetary policy of other   countries  The real problem for us now is that we have a large part of the world economy—in non-  China, non-Japan Asia and the major energy exporters—still running a monetary policy that is   based on the dollar as nominal anchor  That has left them with remarkably easy monetary policy   April 29–30, 2008 135 of 266    and a pretty significant rise in asset-price inflation  The transition ahead for them as they try to get   more independence for monetary policy and soften the link to the dollar is going to carry a lot of   risk for us because the market is going to infer from that a big shift in preferences for the currencies   that both governments and private actors in those countries hold  As that evolution takes place in   their exchange rate and monetary policy regimes the risk for us is that the market expects a   destabilizing shift in portfolio preferences, which people might infer is also a loss of confidence in   US financial assets  I think that’s a big problem for us  It’s not clear to me that it means that we   should run a tighter monetary policy against that risk than would otherwise be appropriate because I   don’t think it buys much protection against that risk  I just want to associate myself with all the   concerns said about the dollar in this context  The judgment that goes into confidence and people’s   willingness to hold US financial assets is deeply textured and complex, and it has a lot to do with   confidence in this Committee’s capacity to navigate the perilous path between getting and keeping   down that tail risk and preserving the confidence that inflation expectations over time will stay   stable  So I support alternative B and its language     Just to clarify, what are the implications for scoring?     Just to make this clear, Spence, is it the number of banks   that make that information more accessible in Canada, or is it something else?  Is it fundamentally   that they have just five banks?     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I don’t have a conviction   yet on the options, but I agree that we should narrow our focus to options 2 and 4-5  I think we   should design a process that tries to force us to get conviction more quickly on which option we   would prefer  I think it is possible  You have made a huge investment already  You know the   alternatives  I think it is worth, again, a goal that gets us conviction more quickly, in part   because we do have a brief window now in which we might be able to get the Congress to   accelerate and we could implement more quickly  I would get the Congress to accelerate if I   could be totally confident that it would be free, that we would pay no price, and that there would   be no risk that anything else would be on the table or that it would compromise any other   objective  It is very hard to have confidence on that  But if you get confidence on that, then I   would go do it  But I would certainly run a process by which we get conviction early   I would want us to have conviction before we go out for public comment  The general   rule is to figure out what you want to do and design a process that maximizes the chance that you   get there quickly  It also strikes me that a process this drawn out will take much more staff time    April 29–30, 2008 188 of 266    You guys are busy  We don’t have a lot of time  We don’t have a lot of excess capital in the   Federal Reserve System now relative to the challenges we face  The longer it is drawn out,   maybe the smaller the tax day by day, week by week, but it is just a huge tax  I would not want   to go out for public comment on a white paper in this time frame until I knew two things  One   is, Are we going to get the Congress to accelerate?  If so, on what?  What is the probability?  Are   we going to ask for it?  The other is I wouldn’t do it until I knew that we were closer to saying,   “If we got it, we would do this in this time frame”   Finally, I think it is hard to have this discussion in public with the Congress now without   an answer to what they will perceive to be the larger questions  What are the larger questions?  I   think that you can reduce some of the larger questions simply to, What are we going to do with   our role as lender of last resort going forward?  This is a version of President Plosser’s and   Governor Warsh’s questions—what the future of our facilities is, in some sense  The staff has   assured me that these options all preserve optionality on any future facility framework  They   don’t prejudice those options, which is very important  But I think there is a demand now and   interest in what our answer is to those broader questions  It is hard to see the architecture of our   role as lender of last resort without having the answer to what the framework will be for   restraints on risk-taking by institutions that have access in normal times and in extremis to those   lender of last resort facilities     We can’t get conviction on that in the same time frame that we need to accelerate   legislation on this stuff, but—and probably because—I think those things are fundamentally   more important than whether we end up with 2 or 45 or 5 on the way to 45  I would try to   shorten the amount of time and effort we put into this, and I would increase the amount of time   and effort we put into that broader set of policy questions, which are going to be essentially   April 29–30, 2008 189 of 266    about the intersection among the lender of last resort role, our monetary policy regime, the moral   hazard consequences of all the stuff we have done, and how we deal with those in the future  I   think that is going to take a lot of time, effort, and care   I don’t know how to reconcile all of what I just said in the context of a practical path   forward, except just to repeat it  Why not try to run a process in which you get conviction more   quickly on this relatively small set of adjustments as to how we operate?  Try to get a judgment   quickly about whether we can get the Congress to accelerate without any meaningful political   cost, then design a process whereby we put ourselves in the position to implement early next   year, if the Congress were to accelerate  And try to have the resources saved by attenuating that   process devoted to these deeper questions about our future facilities and the associated   constraints we are going to have to put on a broader set of institutions     Mr Chairman?  President Stern, I have just one thing   to add  For the first time with the three investment banks that reported for the quarter that ended   in May, the SEC allowed them to disclose their risk-weighted ratio on the SEC’s version of   Basel II  That’s the ratio for which your question is more germane in some sense because it   shows a pretty significant cushion of capital against risk-weighted assets  The question is, How   good are those measures of risk-weighted assets?  This is a subject for discussion tomorrow, but   June 24–25, 2008 10 of 253    part of our problem is that we have much less confidence in judging the integrity of what goes   into those measures of risk—not to mention whether the risk weights are any good, which is a   harder thing for the market to judge  But for the first time the market can see what their risk-  weighted measures are, at least on an SEC basis, which is pretty close to Basel II, and those   ratios were, if I recall correctly, north of 10, tier 1, for the three that reported—significantly   higher than they were on March 1, by their own measures     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I think we face an extended   period of relatively weak economic growth, quite weak domestic demand growth, and overall   growth significantly below trend  I think this is both likely and necessary  It’s likely because we   have more weakness ahead as the housing drag continues, financial headwinds remain acute, the   economy adjusts to the very large and sustained energy price shock, the saving rate increases, and   global demand moderates  It’s necessary to achieve a reasonable inflation outcome over the   forecast period     Our central projection has the US economy growing, though at a rate significantly below   potential, and then recovering gradually toward trend over the next year  This is our modal forecast;   and in this forecast, the economy just skirts a recession  The output gap begins to narrow over the   forecast period  Housing prices begin to stabilize only late in ’09, after a cumulative peak-to-trough   drop of roughly 12 percent, using the OFHEO repeat sales purchase-only index  Net exports   provide a significant, though fading, boost to GDP growth this year and next  We project a very   gradual, very modest moderation in core inflation over the forecast period  Of course, this forecast   depends on a lot of things happening  It depends on expectations remaining reasonably well   contained, energy and commodity prices following the futures curve, the dollar only modestly   weaker, somewhat diminished pressure on resource utilization here and around the world, and   continued moderate growth in compensation and unit labor costs  Our policy assumption builds in   significant tightening—a significant move up in the fed funds rate over the forecast period—though   not as soon as the market now expects   The uncertainty around and risks to this central projection are substantial  On the growth   front, although we believe the risks of a very deep, prolonged economic downturn have   diminished—not on their own but because of the force of the policy response so far—we still think   June 24–25, 2008 70 of 253    the risks are weighted significantly to the downside  The main risks remain  the ongoing stress on   financial markets; the risk that this further restricts the supply of credit, exacerbates financial   conditions, pushes home prices and other equity prices down more further tightening credit   conditions, et cetera; a steeper-than-expected rise in the saving rate; and the adjustment to the   ongoing drag from energy prices   On the inflation front, we—I think like the rest of you—see the risks ahead tilted somewhat   to the upside for many obvious reasons  I think it’s true that, looked at together, the mix of   measures of inflation expectations suggests that private agents may have less confidence in the   FOMC’s commitment to price stability than they did in previous periods when total inflation was   running significantly above core  So this is going to be a very challenging period for policy  It’s   not all terrible  Productivity growth is a little higher than we thought  Underlying inflation and   long-term inflation expectations certainly could already have been showing signs of a more   compelling, immediate danger  Spending has been somewhat stronger than confidence measures   would have suggested  The current account balance has narrowed significantly  We are seeing very   substantial changes in behavior across the US economy in the consumption of energy  So there are   good things to point to  But in the two dangerous areas—in the financial sector and in the global   inflation environment—I think things are materially worse than at our last meeting   Again, the risk of inflation is readily apparent  Apart from the numbers, I agree with many   of you who said that the alarm and concern is materially higher and materially different today across   a broad range of firms in different industries than it was even as recently as two months ago  We   have to be worried about intensified pressure on compensation growth even with the degree of slack   that we now see in the labor market  Although firms are absorbing in margins a significant part of   the increase in unit costs—and a lot of the complaining that we hear is about margins that are   June 24–25, 2008 71 of 253    coming down and those that are expected to come down—I do think that firms are demonstrably   able to pass on more than they would have been before  Of course, what makes it very hard for us is   that the pressure on resources is coming largely from outside the United States and the other major   economies, from countries that are growing significantly above trend with central banks that are not   independent and are running very expansionary monetary policies  I think we are really seeing an   alarming acceleration in inflation rates in large parts of the world for the first time in a couple of   decades  If these countries do not tighten monetary policy sufficiently and reduce energy price   subsidies materially, then we will have to be tighter than we otherwise would have to be   In the financial world, although I think it’s true that the market believes there has been some   significant reduction in the risk of an acute systemic financial crisis, I think we have a long period of   acute fragility ahead  We’re in the midst right now of more material erosion in sentiment, spreads,   asset prices, balance sheet pressures, and liquidity in some markets  Overall financial conditions are   probably somewhat tighter than when we last met  The financial headwinds have intensified again,   and they are likely to remain intense for some time   Again, I think this is going to be a very challenging road ahead  It is important to recognize   that the current stance of policy embodies not just the fed funds rate today, relative to our best   measure of equilibrium, but also the expectations about policy that are now built into the Treasury   curve  That policy today does not look that accommodative  If you look at the Bluebook charts and   at a range of measures of real fed funds rates today relative to different measures of equilibrium,   policy is less accommodative just on that simple measure than it was at the most accommodative   point of the last two downturns  That said, we’re going to have to tighten monetary policy, and the   question is when  My sense is soon but not yet  Right now we still face a very delicate, very fine   balance and have to be careful not to declare victory prematurely on the growth front or on the   June 24–25, 2008 72 of 253    financial front  I think it’s going to be hard for us to do that until we see that we are closer to the   point at which we can confidently say that we start to see the bottom in housing prices  Also, we   have to be careful not to raise expectations too much that we’re on the verge of an imminent,   significant tightening in policy  It is a difficult balance  We should take some comfort from the fact   that the market believes we will do enough soon enough to keep those expectations down    On the projections front, I have a complicated view, Mr Chairman  I apologize  If we are   going to change, we should focus on stuff that will change things significantly  I don’t see huge   gains from the changes in these options to our current communication regime  If we’re going to   change, a trial run in the fall is fine  But I think the fall is too soon to change  We need to get   through this thing  We have a very challenging period with a lot of stuff going on, and I think we   need to use every molecule of oxygen in the System to get through this mess  I don’t think this   projections change materially helps the communication challenge in getting through this mess and   may complicate it in some ways   If we are going to do something beyond our current regime, I would favor doing something   slightly different from this  I would favor at least considering publishing the average of our   individual views on what the desirable long-run rate of inflation is, an average of our judgments of   what trend growth is today, and maybe what the natural rate of unemployment is today  We know   very little about what those latter variables—trend growth and the natural rate of unemployment—  are five to ten years ahead  It is very hard for us individually to put much confidence on whatever   the path is toward that point  Our current regime for aggregating our forecasts the way we do,   tossing out the individuals, makes our basic forecast not particularly useful as a prism  So I would   focus on doing something slightly different to change the regime, and I wouldn’t do it this soon  If   we’re going to change, let’s debate the big things and not spend too much time on things at the   June 24–25, 2008 73 of 253    margin, which fundamentally aren’t going to offer too much promise relative to the level of   ignorance we have or relative to the complexity that people face in reading any particular   meaningful value in the aggregation of our forecasts the way we now do them     May I?     Brian, it might be helpful if you would circulate your   remarks about the new exhibit 3 and its implications after the meeting  That was very helpful  But I   just want to clarify one thing  Could you just repeat what you said—looking forward under any of   these basic measures, where do you expect the real fed funds rate to be in relation to r*?     This is like pro wrestling  [Laughter]   June 24–25, 2008 118 of 253      Thank you, Mr Chairman  I just want to say at the   beginning that I think the way you framed your remarks yesterday had perfect pitch and balance,   and it is really important that we not get ahead of ourselves in taking too much comfort from the   June 24–25, 2008 131 of 253    fact that the first half was not as bad as we thought and think that the risks on the growth front   are definitively behind us  The improvement in financial markets that many of you spoke of is   not as significant as we think or hope; we have had a lot of false dawns over this period  A lot of   what you see as improvement is the simple result of the existence of our facilities in the implied   sense that people infer from our actions that we are going to protect people from a level of   distress that we probably have no desire, will, or ability to actually do  It is sort of like waking   up in the hospital and having them say, “You are not dead yet, but we are not sure you’re going   to live”  It is not as good an improvement, and there has been a material erosion over the past   four weeks  It is very unlikely that you will have a substantial improvement in overall   confidence in markets, a durable improvement in market functioning, and a substantial reduction   in those spreads until there is more clarity about the likely path of the economy going forward,   house prices in particular, and therefore the cash flows associated with the huge amount of credit   that was extended over the past five years     Again, it is going to be very hard for us to have a better feel for the balance of risks on   growth front and the financial sector until we think we see signs ahead of some significant   deceleration in the rate of decline of housing prices, if not some actual bottom  On the basis of   everything we know, that is still several quarters ahead  Maybe it is going to surprise us on the   upside and maybe we are going to see a big improvement in housing demand, but I think that the   sense of a bottom looks to be several quarters ahead of us still   I would say that the risks are still acute  Sure, the markets are a little more confident that   we are going to successfully avoid a systemic financial crisis, but I wouldn’t take too much   comfort from that  I think it is also plausible that oil will be at $150 or $200 over the next six   months or so  There is some material probability that the set of challenges on that front is going   June 24–25, 2008 132 of 253    to get worse  So all that is just in favor of a fair amount of care and caution now, given the scale   of the uncertainty out there and how fat the tail risks are on both sides of our mandate going   forward   I like, and fully support, the language in alternative B  I would not—as you might sense   from my comments—take out the word “considerable” from the characterization of stress  I am   pretty comfortable with the framework laid out here, and, more important, Mr Chairman, with   the broad balance and strategy that you outlined yesterday     If we look back and try to recalibrate at each meeting   whether things are getting better or things are getting worse, we would regret each zig and each   zag  So I would just say that we have a suite of facilities in place  They are in place today    They are exceptionally significant in terms of a change in policy  They are there because we   think they are playing an important role in helping facilitate the necessary process of repairing   markets et cetera  If we were going to take them back tomorrow or dial them back substantially,   then I would be willing to rationalize and explain that part of the judgment is that we think things   are improving materially  I just feel as though the risk is too high     No  May I?  You know, we think that the money funds   finance about a quarter or a third of the stuff in tri-party  Money funds have a unique type of   liquidity risk  So it is possible, if the same set of assets were financed by banks, that because banks   have a different liquidity risk the system would be more stable  So you can maybe say, even with   the same balance sheets as investment banks and the same mix of illiquid stuff financed through that   mechanism, if the banks were the dominant providers of liquidity or it was provided through banks,   that the system would be more stable, and the broader protections that we designed over the last   June 24–25, 2008 150 of 253    century to limit the risk of runs on banks because of the risk to the system might have more power,   insulating us from a system where nonbanks are large  I think that’s the argument     It would be interesting to know a bit about the politics on the Hill of thinking about that   legislative change  It would probably look a little like the Middle East, I suspect  [Laughter]  That   would be a huge change in the relative return on different types of financial businesses that now   would come with that  But it would be worth knowing a bit about the history of that debate in the   past and what the probability is that we could get something like that through     Mr Chairman, may I—not to preempt Art and Scott—in   this case?  I completely agree  It is very important not to undermine the value of these liquidity   backstops by introducing stigma in their use until we get to the point at which we want to dial   people back  But the decisions or the actions we took in the context of Cantor and Countrywide had   a very compelling rationale  It would have been irresponsible for us, given the facts that over   Cantor we have no comparable framework of supervision and that their exposure was very large   relative to capital  In that context, we could do it without any risk that we were going to stigmatize   June 24–25, 2008 151 of 253    the use of the PDCF because it’s a unique thing  Countrywide, as you know, had a slightly different   but similar rationale  It would have been imprudent for us to have had a substantial amount of   securities outstanding, insufficiently collateralized, in the event that the deal didn’t go through,   because they were not viable on their own without Bank of America’s buying them  That was a   necessary and prudent thing to do  I think also that the risk was very limited that we introduced   stigma to the facilities  The Barclays thing was more delicate  We would not say to them, “You   can’t use the facility”  We just asked some careful questions about what they were doing and why,   because their pattern of use was so different from everybody else’s in that context  But I completely   agree with your concern about that stuff  I think we must be very careful going forward that we   don’t do things that will alter this balance     But these are very different  I’m sorry—     I was just going to say that it’s a very delicate balance    We want this set of firms to get themselves to the point where, in the eyes of the market, they have a   more conservative mix of leverage (appropriately measured) and funding risk so that they are less   likely, even in a pretty adverse shock, to need to finance illiquid stuff with their central bank as a   defense against that liquidity pressure  We’re trying to do that without forcing a level of   deleveraging that would be adverse to our broader objectives of trying to get markets back to some   point where they’re functioning more normally  We’re not going to get that perfect  By definition,   our facilities by design should allow them to run with a mix of leverage and liquidity risk that is   above what the market probably now would permit  In the absence of our facilities, leverage and   June 24–25, 2008 153 of 253    liquidity risk, if you measured it on a scale, would have to be lower in some sense  But that’s the   purpose and the necessary complement of the facility, and it is a delicate balance   But just to come back to President Plosser’s point, I don’t think that the stigma is the result   of how we’re applying the discretion we preserved for ourselves around use  It is really the result of   the fact that, particularly if you’re at a point when you perceive escalating concern about your   viability, people don’t want to risk that their pattern of use, if disclosed, would magnify the concern    That’s really what accounts for the care in use, particularly as concern about viability has been   intensified these last few weeks or so     Just to make sure—it isn’t quite as awkward as it sounds    I mean, it’s not clear  The test for us about whether or not these make sense is not fundamentally   about whether the PDCF would save Lehman from itself  I would just make the observation that we   thought originally that you could look at the bid to cover and at the clearing price in the auction   facilities as a measure of stress in markets, and they would be a test by which you could see   conditions  I think it’s important to recognize that that’s not itself a particularly useful prism on   stress today  Independent of the specific circumstance around Lehman, the people who are funding   tri-party balance sheets, for better or worse, tell anybody who listens that they’re doing so   significantly because of the existence of this facility as a backstop  So the use is not a very good   measure of stress probably because of the stigma around it and because we’re affecting prices   anyway by the existence of these facilities   We’re doing as much as we can to improve the odds that these firms get to the point at   which, in the eyes of their short-term secured or unsecured creditors, they look as though they can   withstand a pretty large shock in the future without recourse to our facilities  But I don’t think   we’re at the point yet where we can say that confidently, not because they haven’t deleveraged   sufficiently or bought enough liquidity—though there’s a bit of that still left—but because there’s so   much uncertainty left still about the scale of pressure on balance sheets, what that might do to the   losses, what that might do to asset prices going forward or to behavior  So this is just one man’s   view, but I think a very good, substantive case based on what you can observe and what people say   about behavior suggests that circumstances are still so fragile that we could justify the provision of   these facilities as a responsible, sensible act given our broader objectives   June 24–25, 2008 156 of 253      May I make a suggestion?     Yes  You know, these are deep, consequential questions   we face  This is a question on the economy, and we’re not going to resolve it today  I think it’s   important that we recognize that we’re going to have to build some time into our agenda—later this   year probably, certainly early next year—and get deeper into the basic question about what we are   for in the future  What amendments to the Federal Reserve Act, if any, would we support?  What   would we resist?  What mix of these things?  That’s important because we’re not going to do an   adequate job of getting ourselves on the table on those actions today  We are going to need to be   very careful that the stuff we’re doing in the here and now doesn’t prejudice those decisions long   term  Again, I think the package that the Chairman laid out and the strategy we have are pretty   carefully designed to mitigate that risk  We’re trying to be very careful that we’re preserving full   optionality, once we get through this particular period, to go on any of the paths that are ahead in   this context  Of course, this short-term stuff is vulnerable to the risk  It looks as though we’re   prejudicing some of those choices, but I think we’re trying to be careful not to do that  I just wanted   to make the point that we’re all going to need a little time to think through this stuff, and we’re   going to need some time to come back and talk about the deeper policy questions that we face in   June 24–25, 2008 171 of 253    this because they are very consequential  I have a lot of sympathy for all the concerns that are on   the other side of where we are today     I obviously support the strategy laid out  I just want to   underscore, particularly in response to Governor Warsh’s comments, that this is in effect a   conditional extension, in the sense that we are being careful to get ourselves more comfortable   with where these four firms in particular are on capital and liquidity before we announce an   extension  We are trying to get clarity on the ongoing supervisory relationship with the SEC   before we announce an extension  We have already gotten the 18 major dealers in the world to   commit themselves to a path to improve the capacity of the OTC derivatives infrastructure to   withstand failure before announcing  We have already begun to get the resources held against   default risk in the existing central counterparties higher, in satisfaction of President Stern’s   general admonition that we want the system better able to withstand failure  I think we are just   beginning the delicate process of taking some of the air out of the vulnerable tri-party repos   before the extension is announced  So, in that sense, we have left ourselves in this strategy that   the Chairman laid out with a little less vulnerability to the possible impression that we would just   willy-nilly extend with no effort to make the system safer  We are not going to get far enough    We are not going to know what’s far enough  But I think we have a credible plan to say, “We   took the initiative, even in a moment of incredible delicacy for dealing with the system, to try to   get these institutions and the system in a better capacity to withstand the possibility of failure”    In that sense it’s a defensible and sensible strategy   I really don’t know what the right mix of boundaries is on access to liquidity in normal   times and in extremis and what mix of supervisory authority conditions with what type of   resolution regime is optimal  I just don’t have a sense  I feel as though I know the broad   tradeoffs in it, but I don’t know what really looks ideal in terms of the mix of those things  You   can make a pretty reasonable case for a whole bunch of variance in that mix of things  The   June 24–25, 2008 191 of 253    complication for us is that we won’t be able to fully control the outcome because it is going to   require legislation  Part of the consequence of the system that we live with and part of the reason   that we live with the system we have today is that policymakers and regulators don’t fully   control the outcome in terms of the incentives created in the legislation for these kinds of things    So it will be difficult for us, but all we can do is focus on the merits, think through those ahead of   everybody else, and try to have the best package of suggestions that we can     But just to come back to what we spent most of the last two days talking about, let’s not   lose sight of the fact that we are in the middle of this still  It likely has a long way to go  It is   very hard for us to know now what we are going to decide at the end was the most critical source   of vulnerability and, therefore, what to do to fix it  We don’t know what the market is going to   think the new equilibrium should be in terms of the return on equity across different types of   financial institutions and models  Another reason to be careful as we try to contain the risks in   this crisis and make the system stronger in the near term is so that we don’t prejudge some of   those longer-term questions  Thank you     First, I completely agree that, once we get to the point   at which we believe the best policy is to dial this stuff back and transition to a world in which   they don’t exist, we are going to want to look at a whole bunch of things—changing terms,   changing the relative attractiveness across the auction facilities, thinking about size, and thinking   about price  I think that will be very important to do  It is very unlikely that the optimal path is   going to be that there is a cliff—one day they are there, and the next day they aren’t  So I   completely agree with that   My own judgment is—but it may not be right, and it could change over time—that for the   moment we want to have a clean, crisp signal  Better to say that we are going to extend in the   context of these broader initiatives to strengthen the system and not at the same moment alter   their terms and relative attractiveness  But we are going to have to think very carefully over the   fall, conditions permitting, and well ahead of whatever the new date is, what the desirable exit   strategy is in changing incentives around use   However, my basic sense is not now, not yet, partly because of the complexity of the   signal you are sending and the difficulty of how it will be interpreted  We have done all this   stuff in part because we are trying to address a complicated mix of things around incentives,   stigma, and that kind of thing  It is hard for us to predict what the effect would be  Its purpose is   to wean, but to do it now would make the message a bit more complicated  If the world is strong   enough that you can wean them now, why are you extending?  So my basic sense is, absolutely,   we are going to have to figure it out by the transition, not quite yet but well ahead of February 15   or whenever it is going to be     There are many things that I would love to do  I   would like to make them pay for it and say that we are not going to extend it unless they pay for   it  I would like to say that we are not going to extend it unless they pre-fund some liquidation   facility for one of their little counterparties  There are a million things that I think would be   good to do from an incentive angle—but not at the same time that we are trying to maximize the   chance that we get through this and have the flexibility to let monetary policy adjust to the   changing amounts of risk on the other side of the tail  So there are a million things I think it   would be cool to do, and we will have to do them  We will design them really in a clever way   June 24–25, 2008 194 of 253    once we are at the point where that is optimal, but I just don’t think that’s now  The risk is that it   will undermine what we are trying to achieve with a fleeting “make us feel better” benefit     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Let me make just a few   quick points  There is no way you can state these things with perfect clarity and conviction, but my   sense is that we are in a period in which the sets of basic pressures we’ve been living with now for   12 months are intensifying again and that the scale of the balance-sheet pressures is in some ways   greater now than it has ever been  That poses to us the same set of risks that we have been facing   and debating but, in some sense, with greater consequence  I just want to underscore that, because I   do not believe it is right to look at the constellation of things that we can observe and the use of our   facilities and conclude that we are now at a point where we can start to say that we have materially   reduced the scale of risks to the financial system and what those risks pose to the economy and our   objectives  That is my judgment  I can’t prove that, but I think it’s important for you to hear that   from me   Second, as Bill said and the Chairman said, I think these proposals together offer only   modest benefits relative to the risks  They slightly change the mix of forms of assurance that we’re   offering  It is very hard to know whether that balance would be more compelling on net than what   we have today, but these alternatives would not be before you today if there had not been a fair   amount of thought put into that basic judgment  Neither the Chairman nor Bill Dudley oversold or   overclaimed what these would produce   I do not agree with the concern, although I understand it, that any refinements to our existing   tools, themselves, increase the expected duration of our commitment to these exceptional things  In   fact, I would take the opposite view  If we have things we could do that would materially reduce   July 24, 2008 35 of 50    the risk that intensification of these dynamics would make our problems worse, we’re more likely to   be able to exit earlier and more likely to get out of this without having to do other things that we   think will be much more consequential and worse from a broad moral hazard and risk perspective    Now, I do not think that anybody could look at this mix of things—what we have done to date or   what we propose to do—without deep reservations  The basic business we are in entails risk; and if   we are not prepared to take any risk, then we are going to be limiting our ability to mitigate   materially the range of basic things that we exist to help mitigate  I agree with you about the   reservations, and I worry about all the things you guys raised and don’t feel that comfortable about   them, but I think it is worth recognizing again that there is risk in everything we are doing     I am very, very worried about the concerns that Janet raised and those echoed by your   colleagues  I do not believe at this point that we have a viable framework of interaction with other   primary supervisors that leaves us in a comfortable position with our existing 28-day facilities  If   we are not prepared individually to deny access to 28-day loans for institutions at the margin, to   scale back access, to scale back the maturity of those things, or to call those loans, then we have a   big problem, and we have to figure out how to fix that problem  If we fix the 28-day problem, we   will fix the 84-day problem, although at the margin it does add a bit to that stuff, but that can be   mitigated with other things  But if we don’t fix it for 28 days to our basic mutual comfort, we have   a real problem   I was going to make one process suggestion, Mr Chairman, because we cannot resolve   those things today  I think that Tom Hoenig, as chair of the Committee on Regulations and Bank   Supervision; Governor Kroszner; and I—I will nominate myself since I’m chairman of the Credit   and Risk Management Committee—should get on the phone together and enter into a conversation   and see if we can come up with a better set of choices and principles for how we individually deal   July 24, 2008 36 of 50    with a question that is going to get much worse for us, which is marginal institutions slipping   toward the point of nonviability, where ratings lag and so ratings just have no value in making these   judgments   I also agree with and want to echo the point that Jim Bullard made before he left, which is   that we do need to talk more about our balance-sheet-sterilization, reserve-management kinds of   options because none of us should be fully comfortable that we now have an adequate set of   contingency planning measures in the context of potentially huge increases in demand at open   facilities  But the Chairman, of course, recognizes this better than anybody else, and it is very   important for us to walk everyone through the range of choices and their limits  I just want to end   by saying, Mr Chairman, that I think we have to defer to you on this  It’s worth reflecting on   whether we think we have the balance right in this context, but this is going to be a matter of   judgment, and it is going to be hard to give anyone a high degree of reassurance that we know   exactly how this will be received and whether, as I said at the beginning, we are right in suggesting   that the benefits are modest but significant relative to the risks  The basic choice we face, of course,   is whether it’s better to take advantage of those benefits now or to withhold them knowing that we   may face a point down the road when things get materially worse  We may face worse choices then   that would raise even deeper reservations for all of us     I am comfortable supporting the 84-day extension, and I   would be supportive of splitting it  But I’d like to think a little more about both operational issues   and how that would work  In principle, since I would be comfortable with 84, I would be   comfortable with two tranches or two windows     Just to underscore, Mr Chairman, what I said, I think   President Evans is right—I would not be prepared to make a recommendation today on 28 alongside   84  I think it just needs a little more time, not a lot more time, but we have to think through it to   make sure we can do it  We have to come back to you and explain how we think we would manage   through those issues, if we think they’re manageable  One thing we might do is use the SCRM   process that exists to expose them in a little more depth to whatever our thinking collectively here is   on the operational issues and the signal issues, and we can probably do something quickly on that   tomorrow  But I think we need to reflect a bit and come back to you     I have a question similar to President Plosser’s  Both the   financial shock—the housing adjustment—and the big relative price shock you could say all in   different forms could hurt the rate of growth of the economy’s productive potential  You could say   that they all might, in some dimension, reduce the near-term expected path of potential growth  I   guess my question is that you have this “costly sectoral reallocation” alternative scenario—do you   attribute any effect on potential growth over the forecast period in your baseline to the combined   effect of the housing adjustment and the big relative price shock from energy?      I was just going to say that I thought the interesting thing   about that scenario was that it doesn’t really change your view about the appropriate path of   monetary policy going forward  It’s basically at the baseline  So even if you were to build in a   material change in potential growth, because of the effects on demand going forward it doesn’t   affect your view about the appropriate path of policy     Yes  It means that it’s another way of saying that you   wouldn’t expect the estimates of the now-prevailing equilibrium real fed funds rate to be higher    Not to stretch this too far, but another way of saying why the likely expected path or the appropriate   path of policy doesn’t change in terms of the nominal fed funds rate is that we have these offsetting   effects on demand     I was just going to say this  I think that you can do crude   estimates of likely total losses across the US economy and credit markets in a scenario like the   baseline scenario in the Greenbook, and if you use Nellie Liang’s study or the stuff done in New   York, there’s a huge amount ahead still  Even though financial market prices now reflect an   expectation for house-price declines that are not significantly more optimistic than David’s baseline   scenario, I don’t think you can say with confidence now that financial institutions have already   provisioned for or written down losses to accommodate that  Because the trajectory of house prices   will depend in part on financial behavior—the availability of credit—as financial institutions catch   up and adjust to that and adjust capital and asset growth, et cetera, there is some risk that you’ll push   that expected path of house prices down further from where it is  So if institutions have to prepare   for the possibility that you’re going to have a much weaker economic outcome because there’s   August 5, 2008 31 of 145    some probability around that, then there’s a risk that they will produce that outcome through the   combined effects of their behavior, which is why we’re living with such a delicate balance     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Like the Greenbook, our   modal forecast shows weaker real activity and slightly higher core inflation over the forecast period    Downside risks to growth remain substantial, in my view, and have probably increased relative to   what we thought in June  Risks on the inflation front remain weighted to the upside, perhaps   somewhat less than in June, but this is hard to know with confidence  The adverse growth risks are   worse for several reasons  The labor market and labor income are weakening more quickly than   expected  Although there were some tentative signs of stabilization of housing demand in the   spring, demand seems to have fallen further since  Credit conditions are tighter and are expected to   be tighter longer, and this seems likely to produce a further deterioration in overall demand—note,   of course, the reduction in credit for autos, the rise in mortgage rates, and the more conservative   lending standards for consumer and corporate credit  Growth outside the United States seems likely   to slow further  Of course, fundamental to this dynamic, as has been true for 12 months, each shift   in perceptions that the bottom in overall economic growth is further away produces additional stress   for financial institutions and markets, adding to the intensity of prospective financial headwinds and   to concerns about downside risks to growth   Now, the adverse tail on the inflation front remains significant  Many measures of   underlying inflation suggest a broad-based, if limited to date, acceleration in the rate of underlying   inflation  Market- and survey-based measures of long-term expectations are high  Surveys suggest   that firms are able to pass on some part of the acceleration in energy and materials costs  On the   August 5, 2008 74 of 145    more positive side, energy, commodity, and materials prices have declined significantly, principally   it seems because of expectations of slower growth in global demand  Growth is moderating   significantly around the world, and it’s going to have to moderate further in the most populous parts   of the world as central banks there get monetary policy tighter   The growth of unit labor costs has been and is expected to be very moderate here  Profit   margins still show plenty of room to absorb cost increases, and as David reminded us, you can have   a relatively benign outlook for the path of core inflation without margins narrowing very   dramatically  Inflation expectations have not deteriorated meaningfully here, even with the flatter   expected path of monetary policy in the United States  Of course, it’s very important that inflation   expectations and pricing power moderate from current levels  If some of the downside risks to   growth materialize, this will happen, and inflation risks will moderate  If, however, the economy   continues to prove to be resilient to these downside risks, then we will face higher inflation  On   balance, the rate of growth in underlying inflation suggests that growth in demand in the United   States will have to be below potential for a longer period of time if inflation expectations are to   come down sufficiently  This means that we will have to tighten monetary policy relatively soon   compared with our previous behavior in recoveries—perhaps before we see the actual bottom in   house prices and the actual peak in unemployment   However, at this point, the risks to real growth remain critical  In my view, we need to have   more confidence that we have substantially reduced the risks of a much sharper, more protracted   decline in growth before we begin to tighten  I think it is unlikely that we will be able or will need   to move before early next year  Short-term market expectations for monetary policy in the United   States seem about right at present  I don’t see a strong case for trying to alter those expectations in   either direction at this point  To try to pull forward the expected tightening would risk adding to the   August 5, 2008 75 of 145    downside risk to growth and magnifying the risk of a much more severe financial crisis  On the   other hand, if we avoid some of these downside risks to growth, then policy will need to tighten   more quickly, perhaps, than the expected path now priced in the markets   The evolution of monetary policy expectations and of inflation expectations since May   illustrates how uncertain the markets are about what path of policy will be appropriate  But the   pattern of changes in both of these measures of expectations suggests that the markets believe we   will get this balance right—that we will do enough soon enough to keep underlying inflation   expectations from eroding materially  Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support alternative B for   the reasons that you and many others have already stated     Mr Chairman, could I just add one thing?  Maybe Eric   could speak to this  I think the only other thing at the moment that deserves some quick reflection is   whether the Federal Reserve should be modifying the facilities it put in place for money market   funds last week  A team of people across the System is looking at a range of options there and is   likely to give a recommendation to the Chairman sometime later today  My own sense is that it is   the only area in which there is an immediate, compelling need and there’s active exploration of   some escalation options     It is obviously not my decision, but they are looking at   options that go in the direction of expanding the liquidity support provided both to the agent banks   and perhaps directly to the funds themselves     Eric may be a little closer to this than I am at the   moment  Again, they’re looking at it broadly, conceptually  The options fall into expanding the   scope of the types of funds covered by the—what’s it called, Eric?—the AMLF     Second would be some expanded section 23A approvals   to facilitate what the clearing banks need to do to provide liquidity  Another option would be to   expand the scope of instruments that might be supported through that program  Another option   might be to lend directly to money funds against a broader class of assets, and of course, it’s   possible that the Treasury may rejigger, change, expand, or add to their guaranty     Could I just add something, Mr Chairman, to what Bill   said?     I’m not sure this is the right way to think about it, but   you could think about the use of our balance sheet as a necessary but not sufficient condition to   October 7, 2008 11 of 30    achieve Charlie’s objective, which is to help stabilize the financial system and make sure that   intermediation begins again and that people are willing to start lending again on a scale necessary to   support some reasonable outcome for the economy going forward  Our basic judgment—and I   think everybody’s judgment—is that it is going to require capital from the government in some mix   of forms for that to happen  I don’t think that any of us believes that the expansion of our balance   sheet alone is going to be sufficient to achieve that outcome  That’s why—and I think you all know   this—the Chairman has been working so closely with the Secretary of the Treasury to make sure   that the authority that the Congress passes is used in a way that has the maximum possible benefit in   things that are about capital so that the probability of default of the financial system goes down and   people feel more comfortable lending at term to financials     I just wanted to point out that I have assembled a historic   coalition in New York of hawks on both sides of me today in support of your proposal  They have   agreed to join me here in New York as a gesture of support for your proposal     Mr Chairman, I support your recommendation and the   statement as drafted and commend you for taking this initiative and bringing together the central   banks of the major economies at this time  I would just say that there is substantial risk that this will   get substantially worse before it gets better, and we may have to do further escalation on a range of   fronts  I’m not saying monetary policy necessarily, but it’s good to prepare for that possibility     A clarifying question, Mr Chairman  Nathan, on page   4 of the memo, at the last bullet, you say, “FRBNY would have broad ‘set-off rights’”     Let me just state my understanding of this so that I can   be corrected by Nathan or by Bill  These countries hold substantial amounts of their reserves in   dollars  They hold a substantial fraction of those dollars in accounts at the New York Fed  If   they defaulted on their piece of the swap and the falling value of their currency left us with some   exposure, we would have the ability to take assets from their accounts to cover any loss  So it’s   better than the fact that this is a sovereign credit and it is better than the fact that we have an   asset on the other side of the swap, because they hold substantial foreign exchange reserves with   us  The way to think about this is just as a mechanism to help them transform the composition of   their dollar reserves in a way that might be more effective in responding to lender-of-last-resort   needs in dollars, rather than having to sell Treasuries or agencies into the market in a period of   panic or distress to meet that cash need  I meant it as a confirming question     I have never stood in their shoes, so I’m not sure I   fully understand it  You are right that the world is a little short of the risk-free asset now, and so   a greater supply would be terrific in some sense  But they have a general view, which I think our   people share, that to meet the kind of lumpy, unpredictable, potentially large needs for lender-of-  last-resort purposes you may face in our currency, you have to manage reserves in a way that you   can meet those needs without selling Treasuries or agencies  It would not be so terrific for the   world  I have never stood on the other side, but that’s my basic sense  Another way to think   about this is that the privilege of being the reserve currency of the world comes with some   burdens  Not that we have an obligation in this sense, but we have an interest in helping these   guys mitigate the problems they face in dealing with currency mismatches in their financial   systems  We have an interest in helping them meet that in some sense  It’s not our obligation    We have the same basic interest that led us to be responsive to the European need in some cases    These guys are different in that they actually have managed the countries’ balance sheets better   because they at least have a huge amount of their assets in dollars  That should make us in some   ways as comfortable as—maybe more comfortable than—doing it with the Europeans because   they ran a banking system that was allowed to get very, very big relative to GDP with huge   currency mismatches and with no plans to meet the liquidity needs of their banks in dollars in the   event that we face a storm like this     I think effectively we have done that by the way in   which the thing is structured       Do you mean that you want to put a reserve floor on   them, too?     Well, lots of things are possible  I think this is a pretty   good conservative balance     Mr Chairman, may I make an amendment to Eric’s   question or suggestion?  I think that, when we have a chance to breathe and we feel as though we   have achieved some durable stability in the panic, then we will want to reassess not just the basic   complement of our facilities and how we think about the future but the relative economics of   what we’ve done with the dollar swaps and our existing open-end auction facilities for   institutions  Ideally, we want a situation in which it is more attractive for them to borrow from   their foreign central banks—the dollars we provided through the swaps—than to come to us in   our auctions and other areas through their US affiliates   October 28–29, 2008 26 of 206    I am a bit less troubled by the point you made than I am by the fact that we have set up a   regime in which the incentives for them to come to our facilities are still substantial when they   have now the ability they didn’t have before to go to their foreign central banks for dollars in   large scale  As we think about consolidation and not just exit—about how we prepare the   ground for a shift over time—I think we want to come back to looking at the relative economics   between our dollar facilities for US banks and US affiliates of foreign banks and what is open   to them from their home country central banks now  As part of that, we could think about size,   reserve price, and price in our auction     I’m not sure that this is helpful, but maybe I can give a   slightly different example from another perspective  We have a bunch of US affiliates of some of   the weakest European institutions that have faced very substantial dollar funding needs and have   come to us and asked for substantial ongoing access to liquidity  When they have a substantial   amount of lendable collateral, collateral with substantial market value relative to the needs, we have   been comfortable meeting those needs  When their needs have substantially exceeded or might   potentially exceed the market value of their eligible collateral, then we have talked to the home   central bank  We have said that, in effect, if you want us to be able to meet those needs and they   October 28–29, 2008 31 of 206    have collateral in your market that is substantial relative to those needs, then the better way for us to   do this is for the home country central bank to meet their dollar liquidity needs against the collateral   there or meet the liquidity needs and we provide the dollar’s worth of guarantees from the central   bank     So this home–host thing is a delicate balance, and as Nathan said, it shouldn’t all fall on the   host central bank  The best thing possible is for the home country central bank to take most of the   responsibility for meeting the liquidity needs and for us to help them facilitate that where necessary    But when those needs exceed what we would normally give in terms of access, then you have to   have a conversation with the foreign central bank  So, for example, if a weak US institution in   Mexico faces substantial needs in Mexico well in excess of their eligible collateral in Mexico, I   suspect they would call us and say, “We want you to meet those needs”  We would have to   consider at that point where they are in the liquidity-solvency spectrum and how comfortable we are   in meeting those needs     Well, I just want to point out that I think these are   absolutely the right kinds of questions about this  But I think these concerns are substantially   mitigated by the fact that the IMF is putting in place a facility at basically the same time, which will   be there with relatively little stigma for a range of other countries that need it  There will be a   universe of other countries that would not meet the test for eligibility for this swap type of facility,   October 28–29, 2008 34 of 206    for the IMF or us, that will have to go through a program with conditionality and a bunch of   adjustments such as Iceland is going through or Hungary will go through   So it is right to raise these questions  But the boundary problems around our swap lines are   substantially mitigated by the fact that there is a new facility coming out that’s going to the same   place  Raising the question of why we need to do our swaps is good, too, but you’ve heard lots of   good arguments for that, and I think that realistically there’s a natural division of labor between   what central banks have classically done with each other in the swap context and what the IMF   does  What we’re doing is a natural extension of what central banks do  The IMF is moving a little   further in from where they are in this case, and I think that will mitigate some of the signaling   problems and uncertainty created by having this evolution in the scope of swap lines     I’m in favor  On the basic question of how you would   deal with other requests beyond the four, Nathan gave two options  One is that you delegate to the   subcommittee discretion to make those judgments  The second option was to say, “No, not without   coming back to the Committee”  I do think it makes sense to see how the IMF thing works and how   it is received, how much participation they get, and how these boundary problems and the signaling   problem play out, and it is probably a good idea for the Committee to have at least a briefing about   how that is playing out so that there is some context going forward  I would be in favor of your   delegating that authority to the subcommittee, as you would expect me to be, just because   sometimes these judgments need to be made quickly  But I certainly understand why people would   want to have a better sense of how this is unfolding and how we deal with it  The boundary   problems are going to get worse if we have to go broader than this     Chile, Mexico—    October 28–29, 2008 46 of 206      Thank you, Mr Chairman  We expect a recession at   least as bad as the 1990–91 recession, with a significant risk of a deeper, more protracted downturn   worse than the ’80s, and a very substantial rise in the unemployment rate  Inflation is decelerating   quickly, and deflationary forces are ascendant around the globe  The huge decline in energy and   commodity prices will add to a very substantial downward pressure on core inflation from increased   economic slack around the world  We could see an abrupt change in inflation expectations into   deflationary territory   We’ve seen a lot of policy action over the past few weeks  One question is whether   policymakers should wait to measure the effects of these measures before going further, and I want   to talk a little about that question  My view is that I don’t think so  The outlook has been   deteriorating ahead of the policy response  This is true both here and around the world  The   magnitude and speed of the tightening financial conditions, the erosion in business and consumer   confidence, the fall in actual spending, and the shift in inflation risk together present very grave   risks to growth and to the financial system  Mitigating these risks is going to require more monetary   policy here but even more so in the other major economies  But in addition to the very substantial   easing in the global stance of monetary policy ahead, the substantial damage that has already   happened to financial intermediation globally suggests that a broad-based and quite large fiscal   stimulus will be critical to prevent an excessive fall in aggregate demand   How quickly and how far should we reduce the federal funds rate in the United States?  The   Greenbook and the Bluebook present a very strong case for moving down another 100 basis points   quickly  In fact, if I read the pictures in the Bluebook correctly, they might imply a need to get real   October 28–29, 2008 94 of 206    rates to the negative 3 to negative 5 percent territory relatively quickly, if we could do that  If we   don’t move another 50 today, we’ll be behind again  Monetary policy has effectively tightened   substantially since the summer, of course, because of the intensification of financial pressures and   because of the rise in forward real interest rates that have come with the rapid deceleration in   expected future inflation  Beyond this meeting and this choice, our choices are harder  I think we   need to get real rates lower and, to make sure we get them there, we need to keep them low enough   long enough  This requires that we get the nominal fed funds rate as low as possible as soon as   possible  I don’t see a good case for monetary policy gradualism in the current context  The risks   are too great  If we’re too tentative, the damage to the financial system and to the real economy   could be much greater and much harder to correct  If we end up doing too much, we can always   adjust  That’s an easier problem to solve  It just requires will  With global financial markets   placing progressively more weight on a very severe global recession, the “keep our powder dry” and   “reserve our remaining ammunition” arguments don’t seem that compelling to me  We don’t have   much ammunition left in the fed funds rate anyway  If we hold that back, it will likely be less   effective when we ultimately use it  The more powerful escalation options we have left will   probably involve communications, such as continued commitments to keep rates low enough long   enough that we avert creeping expectations of deflation and can be confident that inflation will   come in around our target level over the forecast period   I don’t have a strong view now about how low we can go with the nominal fed funds rate   without causing too much risk of damage to the functioning of financial systems  We need to look   at all possible options, though  I think the principal focus of our staff’s work in the coming weeks   will be to put together a set of alternative policy options going forward along with the analysis of   their benefits and risks so that we’re in a position to act quickly enough to be effective  Just a few   October 28–29, 2008 95 of 206    final points  I think this basic risk-management choice really involves three dimensions of   judgment  One is about the relative probability of alternative outcomes  The second is about the   relative consequences of or the damage caused by those alternative scenarios  Importantly, it also   involves a judgment about the ease of correcting, adjusting, or mitigating the consequences of being   wrong     This is just a stylized presentation, but in the staff notes yesterday, there was a nice way to   think about those choices  I just wanted to point out one thing about this stylized framework of   those choices, which is the consequence  If you look at exhibit 5, the bottom left panel, which   shows the inflation outcome associated with the “more rapid recovery” scenario, in this presentation   you don’t have much risk of a very bad inflation outcome in the event that we end up doing too   much with too much policy and have to take that back  Again, it’s important to recognize that it’s   not just about the probability that we attach to the alternative scenarios  It’s not just about the   relative impact of the consequences of those scenarios  It’s about the ease with which we can   correct for a judgment that was wrong—in this case, a judgment that we did too much  This may   understate the complications in correcting for that error and may make it look easier than it may   ultimately be, but I think it’s a nice framework   Finally, I just want to point out, just to underscore the basic point  This is not going to be   principally about monetary policy going forward  If you look at the broad framework of policies   that are now in place, both here and globally, and the instruments we have to play with, along with   the fiscal authorities we have monetary policy; we have the liquidity arrangements and what we do   with our balance sheet over time; we, the collectively integrated government, have the broad fiscal   policy questions and the scope for either a broad-based substantial fiscal package or more-targeted   fiscal measures, as the Chairman suggested, to focus on the credit markets; and we have the   October 28–29, 2008 96 of 206    capacity to alter the framework of capital and guarantees that is now in place  Beyond that, the   government here also has the ability to change what the GSEs, the FHA, and the FHLB can do  So   when we think about escalating going forward, to go to President Fisher’s question from yesterday,   we have the ability on all these fronts to do more if that’s necessary and prudent  But I think the   mix has already changed substantially  It was probably mostly fiscal nine months ago  It is   certainly mostly fiscal now in a broader sense, except that many of the major economies going   forward will have to move monetary policy very substantially  Thank you     Mr Chairman, I support alternative A, both the action   and the language for the reasons I said earlier  I just want to make a couple of other points  I think   the only way to be predictable in a crisis like this is to be predictably inert or to be late  I don’t   understand the basic argument that you add to confidence by being inert or by being late or, as the   Chairman said, by being passive despite overwhelming evidence about changes in the outlook and   risks to financial stability  The argument that makes me most uncomfortable here around the table   today is the suggestion several of you have made—I’m not sure you meant it this way—which is   that the actions by this Committee contributed to the erosion of confidence—a deeply unfair   suggestion     Now, a lot of things happened over the last three months and the last year, and a lot of things   happened in terms of policy over the last six weeks  There is no doubt that communication about   October 28–29, 2008 144 of 206    policy by all the arms of the US government and the uncertainty created by the actions by all the   arms of the US government contributed in ways to uncertainty about the policy response going   forward  There is also no doubt that inevitably in a crisis like this, when policy moves forcefully, it   is scary because a lot of people are not yet at the point of assessing or understanding the forces   driving our decisions  But I think it’s just unfair to suggest that the actions by the Chairman and this   Committee were a substantial contributor to the erosion in confidence and to uncertainty about   further policy actions, even though it’s true that when we move with force and drama it has the risk   of adding to uncertainty     I’d be very careful to look more broadly at the full range of other things that happened in   that period of time, including, for example, the confusion established by the range of different   choices for interventions in Lehman, AIG, the GSEs, WaMu in particular, and Wachovia and what   that meant  Look particularly at the damage to confidence created by the Congress’s actions in the   weeks after the legislation was first proposed  Compare that, for example, with the announcement   effect of the initial thing  Look also at the uncertainty created around what the package was   designed to do and how it was designed  But please be very careful, certainly outside this room,   about adding to the perception that the actions by this body were a substantial contributor to the   erosion in confidence  I think that Don Kohn said it best  The whole framing, which seems to have   hardened now, that the world ended with the Lehman bankruptcy is just deeply unfair to the basic   truth  Independent of whether there was an option available at the time, the erosion in underlying   economic conditions and in confidence in the future outlook was powerful and substantial going   into August and early September  So I just offer that   You know, everyone wants to quote FDR  FDR said at one point, “If I judge the mood of   the country right, what this calls for is bold experimentation”  I do not believe that this Chairman   October 28–29, 2008 145 of 206    and this Committee have been irresponsibly experimenting at the cost of predictability and   confidence going forward  What we have done is a relatively well designed series of escalations in   monetary policy and liquidity intended to be preemptive against what we knew was substantial risk   of a very adverse economic and financial outcome  The risks were not broadly shared, not just in   this room but outside  But I think the judgments by the Chairman were largely correct in weighing   those risks appropriately at that time, and I think we all owe him a substantial amount of deference   for the judgments he made and his wisdom  Both here in this room and in the effect he had on the   policy choices that the fiscal authorities also ultimately made look very good now and will look   even better over time as people understand how grave and substantial the risks were that we were   facing in the economy and the financial system     One last point to President Fisher’s question  President Fisher asked the obvious question,   which is, What next?  I think a very good approach to decisionmaking is to say, “I don’t want to   know so much about this  I want to know about the next three things”  I know the Chairman is   going to give a nice, thoughtful, and complete answer to this  But I would just say the following    We don’t need to know today what is next on the monetary policy front  We know there may be   some arguments for going lower than 1 percent  We have to think through very carefully the   collateral damage consequence in terms of what that does to market functioning and behavior  We   have to look at the alternatives to that, including in communication  A range of other policy options   are within our capacity to influence and effect that will give us the ability to minimize downside risk   going forward  But I don’t think that we need to know—and we cannot know with precision—what   the optimal mix of those things is now before deciding what to do, although I’m very sympathetic to   the basic judgment  The question really is, In moving today, are we going to do more harm than   good to our ultimate objective?  It’s very hard to make the case that we do damage to any of our   October 28–29, 2008 146 of 206    basic fundamental objectives and mandate  I can see a much stronger case that we do a lot of   damage to those if we don’t act today, even though we all recognize that ultimately this is going to   require more than monetary policy to address the risk here     Mr Chairman   October 28–29, 2008 156 of 206      I also think it would be helpful, as the staff looks at the   policy options going forward, that they do other parts of the communication options, too—not just   those but also other ways to think about how to make policy for looking at and communicating a   path that are different from what we did in 2003  It would be good to look at options for how we   talk about policy going forward in that context along with just the operational choices and the policy   choices     The expected duration of the next part of our meeting is   four hours, three hours?  [Laughter]     The nonmeeting part of the meeting?     That’s a long way away  [Laughter]   October 28–29, 2008 158 of 206
