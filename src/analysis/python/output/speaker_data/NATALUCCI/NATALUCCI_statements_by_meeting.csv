9202,2011-04-26,"4  I will be referring to the package labeled “Material for  Briefing on FOMC Participants’ Economic Projections”  Exhibit 1 depicts the broad  contours of your current projections for 2011 through 2013 and over the longer run   As shown, you continue to expect a gradual economic recovery over the next three  years, with GDP growth—the top panel—picking up modestly for this year as a  whole and accelerating further in 2012 and a bit more in 2013, while the  unemployment rate—the second panel—slowly trends lower  With regard to  inflation—the bottom two panels—although you anticipate that total PCE inflation  will move up this year, you project this increase to be temporary, with headline  inflation moving back in line with core inflation in 2012 and 2013  However, you  generally see core inflation gradually edging higher over the next two years   Exhibit 2 reports the central tendencies and ranges of your projections for 2011  through 2013 and over the longer run; the corresponding information about your  January projections is indicated in italics, and the current and January Tealbook  projections are included as memo items  On balance, your forecasts for this meeting  point to somewhat lower GDP growth and slightly higher inflation over the forecast  period than you projected at the time of the January meeting  In your forecast  narratives, almost all of you indicated that these changes were the result of weaker- than-expected incoming data and higher commodity prices  A number of you also  pointed to greater odds of a tighter stance of fiscal policy during the forecast period   All of you marked down your projections for real GDP growth this year, with the  central tendency of your estimates, shown in the top panel, noticeably lower than in  January  Most of you now anticipate that real GDP will increase about 3 to                                                     4 The materials used by Mr Natalucci are appended to this transcript (appendix 4)   April 26–27, 2011 98 of 244              3¼ percent in 2011, versus nearly 3½ to 4 percent in the previous forecast  By  contrast, the revisions to your growth forecasts for 2012 and 2013 were modest  You  continue to see the recovery strengthening, with the pace of real GDP growth  stepping up to about 3½ to 4¼ percent in 2012 and remaining near those rates in  2013  This general pattern of revisions is similar to that reflected in the updates to the  Tealbook forecast since January   Your unemployment rate projections are summarized in the second panel   Reflecting the decline in the unemployment rate in recent months, nearly all of you  lowered your forecast for the average unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of this  year, with the central tendency of your projections for 2011 at roughly 8½ to  8¾ percent, versus about 8¾ to 9 percent in the previous SEP  Your projections for  2012 and 2013 continue to trace a gradual downward path that is little changed from  the projections submitted in January  Consistent with your expectations of a  relatively moderate economic recovery, most of you project that the unemployment  rate will be about 6¾ to 7¼ percent even in late 2013—still well above the about  5¼ to 5½ percent central tendency of your estimates of the unemployment rate that  would prevail over the longer run in the absence of further shocks (shown in the  right-hand column)  This general pattern of revisions is broadly similar to the updates  in the Tealbook forecast since January   Turning to inflation—the bottom two panels—all of you raised your forecast for  total PCE inflation this year, with the central tendency of your estimates significantly  higher and the dispersion of your projections noticeably wider than in January  Most  of you now anticipate that headline inflation will run about 2 to 2¾ percent this year,  versus about 1¼ to 1¾ percent in your January projections  However, most of you  expect the increase in headline inflation to be temporary, with the central tendency of  your estimates moving down to about 1¼ to 2 percent next year and running about  1½ to 2 percent in 2013, at or below the about 1¾ to 2 percent central tendency of  your estimates of the “mandate consistent” inflation rate shown in the right-hand  column  The central tendencies of your projections for core PCE inflation for 2011  and 2012 have shifted up a bit and now run about 1¼ to 1½ percent this year and  1¼ to 1¾ percent next year before rising to nearly 1½ to 2 percent in 2013  The  Tealbook forecasts for both total and core inflation in 2012 and 2013 are in the lower  part of the central tendency ranges of your projections   Your longer-run projections—detailed in the column to the right—anticipate that  over time the annual rate of increase in real GDP will converge to about 2½ to  2¾ percent, with an unemployment rate of about 5¼ to 5½ percent and total PCE  inflation between about 1¾ and 2 percent  Of note, the central tendency for your  projections of the unemployment rate in the longer run is now somewhat narrower  than the 5 to 6 percent interval reported in January   Your final exhibit summarizes your assessments of the uncertainty and risks that  you attach to your projections  As indicated in the two panels on the left-hand side, a  sizable majority of you continue to judge that the levels of uncertainty associated with  your projections for both real GDP and inflation—as well as for the unemployment   April 26–27, 2011 99 of 244              rate (not shown)—are greater than the average levels that have prevailed over the past  20 years   As shown in the upper-right panel, about half of you continue to view the risks to  output growth as balanced, although a number of you now judge that those risks have  become tilted to the downside  The most frequently mentioned downside risks to  GDP growth included further increases in commodity prices, a tighter-than- anticipated stance of fiscal policy, and an even-weaker-than-expected housing sector   Your assessments of the risks attending your inflation projection—shown in the  bottom-right panel—have shifted noticeably to the upside, reflecting concerns about  further increases in commodity prices, a potential rise in inflation expectations, and  the possibility that the current highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will  be maintained for too long  These concerns, along with the upward revisions to your  projections for inflation that I noted earlier, help explain why many of you believe  that the Committee should begin to remove monetary policy accommodation earlier  than is assumed in the Tealbook  This concludes my prepared remarks  "
