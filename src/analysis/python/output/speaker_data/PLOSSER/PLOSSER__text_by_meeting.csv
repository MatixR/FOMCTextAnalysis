7987,2006-08-08,PLOSSER," Thank you very much   Good morning Thank you, Mr Chairman  It’s a pleasure to be here   today at my first meeting  Many people around the table I’ve known for many, many years    Others I don’t know so well, but I’m looking forward to getting to know you better  I realize that   as the new kid on the block, so to speak, I have a lot to learn  I’ve been on the job one week   today, and that realization has been driven home to me in the past week quite amply by the fact   that I’ve struggled to prepare for this meeting  I have to confess that it did occur to me at a   August 8, 2006 46 of 158                            couple of points that maybe my start date should have been moved to August 15  [Laughter]   Maybe that was a failure of rational expectations or maybe just a simple forecast error—I’m not   sure yet Nonetheless, I really am honored to be here and to be a part of this group, and I’m   looking forward to working with all of you   Economic activity in the Third District continues to expand at a moderate pace, albeit   somewhat more slowly than earlier in the year  Of course, this was in line with expectations in   previous reports by Bill Stone to you  Regional manufacturing activity expanded in July  Our   business outlook survey’s index of general activity fell to 6 in July, down from 13 in June, and   the indexes of new orders and shipments also softened  But the levels of these indicators   continue to point to expansion in terms of manufacturing in the region and manufacturers’   expectations of future activity   Conditions in our construction sector are similar to what other people have been   reporting Nonresidential construction continues to strengthen in our District  Bankers are   reporting increased strength in commercial real estate lending  Office vacancy rates have been   edging down, and rents have been moving up Our business contacts expect those trends to   continue In contrast, as in much of the nation, residential construction and home sales are down    Residential mortgage lending has slowed considerably, although home equity lending has been   quite strong Realtors report that the inventory of homes for sale is at the highest level they’ve   seen in a number of years; they also report that prices are higher than they were last year, but the   rate of appreciation tends to be softening Thus far the slowing in the region’s residential   housing sector seems to have been an orderly one   Retailers report a firming of sales in general merchandise in June and July, with sales at   stores specializing in high-end merchandise being stronger than those at the lower end    August 8, 2006 47 of 158                         Manufacturers’ incentives have helped boost auto sales in July in the region, but dealers tell us   that inventories remain above their desired levels   Payroll employment in our three states has been expanding at a somewhat slower pace   than in the nation as a whole, but that’s not atypical of the region  The unemployment rate has   edged down In June, it was 47 percent In most of the District’s labor markets, unemployment   is lower now than it was a year ago  Our business contacts continue to report difficulty in filling   positions  There has been some relief this summer with the influx of college students, but that   cushion is about to end It has been particularly hard in the District for firms to fill professional   and managerial positions  Firms have received a good number of applications, but many of the   applicants are unqualified Consequently, salaries for these positions have risen more than   others Our manufacturers report that recent wage increases in the region are higher than they   were last year This is consistent with the employment cost index, which shows stronger   compensation growth in the Northeast than in other parts of the nation  On balance, the regional   conditions and outlook continue to be positive  The rate of expansion in the second half of the   year is likely to be somewhat slower than in the first half; but, again, that was expected     I’m more concerned about signs of continued and growing price pressures in the District    Consumer prices appear to be rising at a faster pace in the Philadelphia region than in the nation   as a whole One factor contributing to the faster pace has been the increase in housing costs in   metropolitan Philadelphia, but that may prove to be temporary as housing prices stabilize    Nonetheless, broad-based cost pressures persist in most sectors of the region  The indexes of   both prices paid and prices received in our manufacturing survey have increased in July, and   both are at very high levels Business contacts say that price pressures continue to be one of   their major concerns   August 8, 2006 48 of 158                      I would characterize the national economy in a somewhat similar way  That is, right now   I tend to be more concerned about inflation than I am about growth  I don’t view the   second-quarter slowdown as necessarily a precursor to a significant weakening of the economy   going forward The below-trend growth in the second quarter was widely anticipated, and   averaging over the first two quarters, as several people have done, output still grew at over   4 percent in the first two quarters  The slowdown in residential investment was expected, and   much of the slowdown in consumer spending was due to auto sales, which are volatile and which   had grown very strongly in the first quarter and considerably less in the second   One surprise, however, did occur in the second-quarter numbers  We expected business   investment in equipment and software to slow last quarter from its very robust pace in the first   quarter, but we didn’t expect an outright decline  About half that swing, it turns out, reflects the   timing of business purchases, particularly of transportation and autos, so the weakness in   investment may be more about timing than it is about trend  Indeed, as has been pointed out,   corporate profits remain high, and capacity utilization rates remain high, and these data continue   to point to the underlying strength in business investment   The July employment numbers released on Friday did little to change my view of the   economy  Employment continues to grow at a reasonable pace, although somewhat slower than   earlier in the year In July, employment in the private sector expanded at its fastest pace since   March Although the number was not large, the trend was at least mildly encouraging    Employment based on the household survey fell  The unemployment rate increased 02 percent,   but household employment has been volatile  The decline of 34,000 jobs in July followed a gain   of 387,000 jobs in the household survey in June  If we abstract from the month-to-month   August 8, 2006 49 of 158                         volatility in these numbers, the unemployment rate remains low for the first half of the year at   about 47 percent   At this point, I believe the economic indicators are consistent with sustained real growth   near trend, as many people have suggested  The benchmark GDP revisions suggest that trend   might be a tad lower than we thought, but nonetheless I think the risks to growth seem at least   roughly balanced   The inflation picture, however, has not improved  Despite a slowing economy, price   increases have been accelerating The increases have been broadly based, as has been pointed   out by Bill Poole and others  They are no longer confined to energy and other commodities    Indeed, in June the CPI rose less than did the CPI excluding energy  Core inflation is above the   range I consider to be consistent with price stability, and to my mind, inflation risks remain tilted   to the upside The Greenbook’s baseline forecast has core inflation decelerating over the next   year, but the staff has been marking up its forecasted path of inflation over time as the   acceleration in inflation has persisted  Even with the projected deceleration, the baseline forecast   has core PCE inflation remaining above 2 percent through 2007     Given this persistence in inflation, unacceptably high inflation seems likely to be around   for a while A year ago I wouldn’t have said that  In fact, I was in the camp that thought it was   mostly a relative price phenomenon, but that position has become less compelling to me over the   past year The benchmark revisions to the GDP report show that both compensation per hour   and unit labor costs have been trending up, not down as earlier data suggested  Energy-price   increases have not abated, suggesting that we are likely to see continued pass-through to core   inflation, perhaps for some time  Although the Committee has brought the fed funds rate up   appreciably from historically low levels, real interest rates to my mind are not high  I don’t view   August 8, 2006 50 of 158                monetary policy as particularly restrictive at this point  Thus, I have to put some weight on the   Greenbook’s alternative scenario of persistently high inflation, and that leads to particularly poor   outcomes  Even if I accept the baseline forecast as my point forecast, the fact that inflation   remains at a level above the range consistent with price stability for a considerable period is   troubling   I am comforted by the fact that medium- and longer-term inflation expectations have   remained relatively stable despite the acceleration in inflation  That’s a testament to the   credibility of the Fed in the marketplace—that it will keep inflation low But how reasonable is   it to think that inflation expectations will remain unchanged?  By allowing inflation to remain at   a high level for a time—we are, after all, as several people have pointed out, in the third year of   core inflation running above 2 percent—do we risk sending the message that we are willing to   tolerate higher inflation?  If so, will expectations adjust accordingly?  As the model simulations   of optimal policy paths and outcomes in chart 7 of the Bluebook indicate, it’s very costly to get   inflation back down once it has been above our objective, particularly if expectations are allowed   to increase I believe that monetary policy has an important role to play in ensuring that the   recent high inflation readings do not raise longer-term inflation expectations  Thank you    Gee, what can I say?  [Laughter] It’s a very difficult call, and indeed, I   consider myself really fortunate that I happen to be in on this discussion in my first time  Maybe   there are some advantages and disadvantages to that  Maybe I don’t carry some of the baggage of   what I’ve said in past meetings because I haven’t said anything in past meetings   I certainly understand and respect the view expressed by those who think we should pause    I think that most people around this table recognize that reasonable people at this stage doing sound   economic analysis could come down one way or the other on this  But at this point, my inclination   is to favor a 25 basis point increase  Economic growth has slowed from the rapid pace that we’ve   all been talking about  This was expected  I see little reason to think, at least based on what I’ve   August 8, 2006 88 of 158                                       heard around the table today, that growth will be considerably below trend in the second half of this   year or into ’07   I don’t think that holding rates steady at this time will add much to real growth in the near   term, nor do I think it’s really buying us much insurance against possible future weakness  By the   same token, I don’t think raising rates 25 basis points is going to have a significant effect on the real   economy in the near term either, but it can help reinforce the public’s perception of our commitment   to price stability I believe that the Committee has done an outstanding job in maintaining   credibility thus far, as evidenced by the fact that we’ve all noted that longer-term inflationary   expectations seem to be well anchored  But longer-term expectations remain contained because the   markets and people expect the FOMC to contain actual inflation  Thus, we have to be very careful   not to presume that expectations will remain stable independent of our actions today or in   subsequent meetings   If the Committee chooses not to raise rates, does it risk sending the message that we are   willing to tolerate inflation above an acceptable level for a significant period of time?  If we take the   Greenbook’s forecast as our point forecast, as has been repeatedly said, it will basically say that   we’re prepared to tolerate PCE core inflation in excess of 2 percent for four years or perhaps more    Sending that message may generate increased uncertainty about our commitment to low inflation;   and if inflation expectations become unhinged as a result, that would lead to some very bad   outcomes given the costs imposed on the economy as we strive to regain our credibility  I recognize   that a rate increase may come as a surprise to the markets, but I’m less sure that, over a slightly   longer period, it won’t indeed be good news for the markets and for the economy as a whole   Thus, as I see it, the argument for favoring another move today is based on a comparison of   the potential costs and benefits  Pausing is not free  In my view, pausing today would do little for   August 8, 2006 89 of 158                                                  growth in the near term, nor does it help us on our credibility side  I believe the potential costs of   tightening a bit more in terms of bad outcomes for growth and employment are outweighed by the   potential costs of not doing so, given where inflation is and where we think it’s going  If the   economy’s growth prospects deteriorate significantly in the coming weeks and months, we clearly   have the opportunity to pause or even reduce rates if we think doing so is necessary   In contrast, I ask myself, “How difficult will it be, if we pause today, to resume rate   increases if we need to do so?”  This question leads to thinking about the language of the statement    If we choose to pause today, it’s important that we send a clear and very strong signal with our   statement language that we are committed to price stability  Pointing out that inflation pressures are   likely to moderate over time is important if we believe that to be the case because we need to   explain why, despite inflation above our comfort zone, we aren’t acting  Pointing out that some   inflation risks remain would help convey the idea that we may need to act in the future to bring   inflation down if our forecasts turn out to be wrong   So I’d like to close by suggesting that each of us needs to ask ourselves the following   questions What information are we likely to see in the next six weeks that would cause us, if we   pause today, to initiate another rate increase in September?  What might cause us to cut rates in   September?  And in the event that data on the real economy are once again a bit muddled, as they   were in the past six weeks, and inflation continues unabated, will we find ourselves in the position   of inertia that would lead us to continue pausing and then would possibly put us further behind the   curve? Thank you, Mr Chairman   I’m new to these language nuances about housing  It occurs to me,   however, that one question you ought to ask is whether by including housing or continuing to   include housing the Committee is putting itself in a position where it can’t raise rates until   housing comes back  Are we unfairly locking ourselves in, or at least are the markets going to   interpret it that way?  That’s just another question to think about in deciding how to include it    Thank you, Mr Chairman  The goals are pretty clearly stated, and I have   no real problems with them  I agree that communication and transparency are really a key part of   maintaining and enhancing our own credibility  I also understand, as I listen to people around the   table and other conversations, that some of these issues have no easy or clear answers to them, and I   should note in advance that my own views are evolving as I think about and understand the nuances   of the issues  I agree with President Yellen  I’d like to applaud the Committee because in the past   ten years there have really been great strides in both transparency and communication   Part of the challenge, it seems to me, is how we meet these goals  I think it’s true that   putting some limits on what information is released is probably necessary over certain periods of   time  For example, I wouldn’t advocate opening the FOMC meetings to the public; I think that   would not be terribly useful  On the other hand, Governor Warsh was just talking about perhaps   August 8, 2006 139 of 158                                    releasing minutes earlier or faster or some version of them, maybe with incomplete detail, but   including the tone and nature of the discussion  I think it could be fairly useful and informative,   particularly if it noted disagreements or discussions in terms of where the tension happened to be   within the meeting I spent several months at the Bank of England a couple of years ago and   watched the give and take among committee members at the MPC and also watched them go out in   public and discuss their different views and why they disagreed with each other  That was very   instructive to me because they did it without apparently adding to volatility in the marketplace  The   market had come to accept the notion that these people disagreed on some things   The information released might differ depending on the type of monetary regime we think   we’re in—whether in a regime of inflation targeting or one of full discretion  However, regardless   of the regime, the need for policymakers to clearly communicate what their goals are, their   understanding of the economy’s current economic conditions and expected future conditions, and   then the reasons for their decisions is an important part of communication   As to the quantity of information, quantity and quality to me are intertwined, so I’m going to   talk about both of them together  Again, I applaud the expedited release of the minutes  Instituting   that was a tremendous step forward, and I think it’s a very good idea  However, I would favor the   Committee’s releasing some additional pieces of information  I obviously favor stating an explicit   definition of price stability because doing so would help clarify our goals  The current practice of   citing the range and central tendency of members’ forecasts is fine, but I would favor our releasing   more information, perhaps in a quarterly forecast or in something like an inflation report, to help   convey to the marketplace and the public what our range of views is and where the Committee   stands on the state of the economy   August 8, 2006 140 of 158                                           It might help the public’s assessment of our views if we based our forecasts on some   underlying policy assumptions rather than on what one might call appropriate policy, which might   differ from member to member obviously and would likely not be well understood by the public   anyway One suggestion that has already been mentioned is conditioning the forecasts on the   market’s expected funds rate path, for example  But in some way stating our assumptions or   projections about potential GDP would be important as well because that information, again, will   help the markets and market participants understand where the Committee is coming from   In regard to forward-looking information, I think there are a number of things that the   FOMC could and should communicate, but its current expectation about the future path of the fed   funds rate is not one of them  I don’t think that’s a very good practice in general  However, I do   think that what we need to do is talk more about what our goals are, what our forecasts of those   goals are, and even more in a qualitative sense the process by which we think we’re going to get   there  That is to say, talking about how monetary policy will respond to various events—I hesitate   to use the phrase “decision rule”—wouldn’t necessarily say anything about the future path of the fed   funds rate, but it would be very informative     It’s critical, as has already been mentioned, that the FOMC members agree on what the   goals are  The members don’t need to agree on the model of the economy or the channel by which   they think monetary policy actually operates  Indeed, given the state of economic science, the   differences in models and channels can aid in policy formation  Similarly, since dissents at this   meeting are public, dissenters should feel free to explain the reasons for their dissent  We shouldn’t   discourage presidents and other members from expressing their views about the state of the   economy and the process  Committee members should be free to indicate how their views on the   August 8, 2006 141 of 158                                                economy are evolving  In fact, I think that doing so supports our goal of helping the public form   sound expectations of what policy is actually going to be   "
8011,2006-09-20,PLOSSER," Thank you, Chairman Bernanke  Overall, economic activity continues   to expand in the Third District  The consensus in the regional business community is for   moderate growth in the months ahead, but some sentiment has turned more cautious in the   intermeeting period    We have seen a slowdown in regional manufacturing activity over the past month  Our   business outlook survey, which remains confidential until noon tomorrow, weakened somewhat   in September with general activity falling just barely into the negative area, at -04, from an   185 number in August  This is the first negative reading we’ve seen since April 2003  The   diffusion indexes for shipments, new orders, and unfilled orders also turned slightly negative  I   don’t want to read too much into one survey  The April 2003 dip was very short-lived, and we   saw a similar pattern in our survey in the mid-1990s, when growth slowed but then picked back   up again fairly quickly   Part of the slowdown in manufacturing is at firms that supply the housing industry,   reflecting a slowdown in residential real estate, which has become more pronounced in our   District since our last meeting Building permits and home sales were down in July and August    Inventories of homes on the markets, like much of the nation, continue to increase  House-price   appreciation has slowed, but we have not yet seen outright declines  Despite an increase in   cancelled sales of new homes, builders generally indicate that their backlogs will keep them   relatively busy through the rest of the year However, some real estate contractors have begun to   lay off employees in anticipation of slower activity   September 20, 2006 51 of 132                     A pickup in activity in nonresidential real estate markets has been helping to offset the   decline in residential construction  Office vacancy rates continue to edge down, and net   absorption of office space continues to be positive However, over the next year, some   moderation in nonresidential building construction in our three states is expected  In response to   a special question in our manufacturing survey this month, about one-third of the firms report   that they plan to lower their expenditures on new structures next year compared with this year    Only one-tenth of our firms expect to raise spending on structures  When we asked a similar   question a year ago, about half the firms expected to raise their expenditures on structures in   2006, and, in fact, we did see that this year For other categories of capital spending, however,   firms by a large margin anticipate expenditures in ’07 to be the same as or higher than those in   ’06 At some small banks in our District there has been a recent pickup in nonperforming loans,   which is concentrated in their commercial real estate portfolios   Conditions in other sectors of our region are little changed since our last meeting  Retail   sales of general merchandise edged up, but sales of back-to-school merchandise, especially fall   apparel, did not seem to meet manufacturers’ expectations  Payroll employment continues to   expand in our three states at a somewhat slower pace than in the nation as a whole, which is   typical of the region The unemployment rate, which had edged down slightly in June, edged   back up in July but remains below 5 percent  While many employers continue to report   difficulties in filling positions, the Philadelphia staff’s forecast is for employment in our region   to grow at a pace of about 1 percent over the next year, slightly lower than this year    Unemployment rates in the region are expected to increase modestly maybe over the next year   Growth continues at a moderate pace, but we see little indication of receding price   pressures in the District The index of prices received in our manufacturing survey edged up in   September 20, 2006 52 of 132                  September  There was some minor moderation in prices paid, but that index remains at an   extremely high level  Employers in a number of industries in the region report that wage and   salary levels have been moving up at a somewhat faster pace than they did a year ago   Turning to the national economy, my view is not much different than it was at our last   meeting  My main concern remains the outlook for inflation and the risk it poses for our   credibility In my view, the Fed’s most important contribution to a healthy economy is achieving   and maintaining price stability  As expected, incoming data continue to indicate a moderation in   growth to potential or somewhat below potential  On the negative side, housing has weakened   more sharply than many expected, and auto production seems to be turning down for the rest of   the year On the positive side, as has already been mentioned by a number of others, business   investment and corporate profits remain firm  Employment continues to rise at a moderate pace    The revised wage and salary data are now more consistent with the strength in consumer   spending that we’ve seen, and continued growth in income and perhaps lower gas prices will   help offset the possible negative effect that we may see from a deceleration in housing prices    On balance, I am somewhat more optimistic than the Greenbook about the growth side of the   economy  I, too, see growth somewhat below potential over the next four quarters, but that’s   driven predominantly by a slowdown in the near term—that is, in 2006  Then I see a return to   potential more or less in 2007, although my estimate of potential is probably slightly higher than   the Greenbook’s estimate   Now, given the level of precision of our output measurements and forecast of potential   GDP growth, I’m really not overly concerned about the forecast at this point  The adjustment in   the housing sector to more-sustainable levels is forecast to occur without triggering a recession   and without triggering much of an increase in unemployment  I believe we should not attempt to   September 20, 2006 53 of 132                stand in the way of that happening  It’s a mistake to think that the forecasted moderation in   growth will bring inflation back to a level consistent with price stability  Indeed, the   Greenbook’s baseline forecast of core PCE inflation remains above 2 percent through the end of   2008 Even in the alternative Greenbook simulation of a slump in housing, in which aggregate   demand weakens and real GDP growth slows to just 06 percent in 2006 and barely above 1   percent in the first half of 2007, core inflation hardly changes and remains above 2 percent in   2008 Thus, it seems to me that language from us in the press that indicates that moderating   growth will help to restrain inflation is not really consistent with our forecast  I think it imputes   a degree of precision to an estimated Phillips curve that we just don’t have   Over the intermeeting period, we have had some hopeful news on the inflation front    Core CPI inflation has not accelerated further in the past two months, and oil prices seem to be   down Thus, headline inflation, as I pointed out, is likely to be way down in September, and we   will seem quite omniscient  The measure of expected inflation over the ten-year period in our   Survey of Professional Forecasters has not changed—it remains at 2½ percent  The August rise   in the Michigan survey of one-year-ahead inflation expectations seems to have been reversed in   the preliminary September numbers, largely because of the decline in oil prices  However, both   compensation per hour and unit labor costs have been trending up, not down as the earlier data   suggested, although I will note that the usefulness of the compensation numbers in predicting   inflation is quite weak Although core inflation has stabilized, its level is still above our   so-called comfort zone   To my mind, the inflation outlook is quite uncertain  We do not yet know if the positive   developments in oil prices will stick or not  I hope they will, but certainly we’ve seen energy   prices retreat only to move back up again, and the hurricane season isn’t over yet  Thus, we   September 20, 2006 54 of 132                     should not become too sanguine about inflation from one or two data points  Moreover, we do   not know if the upward revision to labor compensation will pass through to core inflation, as   built into the Greenbook baseline, or if measures of medium-term inflation expectations will   continue to decrease What we do know is that core inflation has been above 2 percent for two   and a half years and is expected to be there, according to the forecast, for another two years  Put   another way, there is little evidence in the forecast that policy actions to date will bring core   inflation back below 2 percent before sometime in 2009  I think that should concern us   I see two inflation scenarios as being plausible, and I struggle with which one I believe to   be the correct one  In the first scenario, core inflation is elevated primarily because of transitory   factors, like the pass-through of higher oil prices, and reflects an adjustment to these changes in   relative prices  As oil prices stabilize, assuming that they do, we’d expect to see core inflation   presumably fall and fall faster than indicated in the baseline Greenbook forecast  The   Greenbook forecast appears to me to incorporate an assumption of relative price stickiness that is   inconsistent with some recent studies on microdata  Thus, in this scenario, I see inflation falling,   perhaps more in line with the Greenbook’s alternative scenario of less persistent inflation  This   story is appealing and plausible to me, but it rests on the transitory nature of the current measures   of inflation Even in this most desirable of scenarios—seeing inflation fall back to 2 percent or   slightly less in 2007—we have to recognize that we will have essentially ratified a higher price   level driven by oil price increases, and we should ask ourselves whether or not we are   comfortable with that   In the other scenario, stimulative monetary policy during the past five years has been a   major contributor to the rise in core inflation  In this case, we wouldn’t expect to see a   deceleration of core inflation until monetary policy has firmed enough to take out the cumulative   September 20, 2006 55 of 132                     effects of that accommodation  The Committee has now moved rates up considerably from   historical levels If potential growth is now lower, as the staff indicates, the equilibrium real rate   may be slightly lower, suggesting that monetary policy may be slightly firmer now than   previously thought Even so, it has only recently reached that level  But given the imprecision   with which we estimate potential output or equilibrium real rates, I really don’t take much   comfort from such measurements  Thus, to my mind, there is a significant risk that policy is not   yet firm enough to achieve the desired outcome   Regardless of which of these two scenarios you think more likely, I think we must be   concerned that our credibility and the consequences of allowing inflation to remain above our   comfort zone for so long are at question If scenario 1 comes to pass and inflation falls faster   than suggested by the Greenbook baseline, then we would all breathe easier  But that scenario   seems largely a bet on oil prices and on the presumption that past accommodative policy is not   playing any role, and that makes me nervous  I would much prefer to believe that scenario 1 is   the operational one However, again, I find it hard to believe that a four-year to five-year period   is transitory, so I have to consider the alternative  If the first scenario is wrong and inflation   evolves as in scenario 2, then our credibility is seriously at risk if we fail to take further steps to   curtail price increases We might be lucky  But we might risk finding ourselves in a situation in   which inflation expectations become unhinged, making it more costly to bring inflation back   down As has been mentioned, in the Greenbook alternative forecast in which inflation   expectations become unanchored, inflation remains near 3 percent with only a slight decline in   2008, and growth slows below 1¾ percent next year and remains well below trend through the   forecast period To me, 3 percent inflation and 1½ percent real growth is not a comfortable place   to be and would make restraining inflation in the future even harder for us   September 20, 2006 56 of 132                  I’d like to conclude my remarks by thanking the Board staff for their research on inflation   dynamics and the possible reduction in the level of persistence in recent years  I think this is an   important area for research, but I encourage the staff to continue its work to try to identify   structural models of these dynamics in addition to reduced-form models  I agree with the staff   that the monetary policy implications of the reduced-form findings presented in the memo   depend on how one chooses to interpret them  The results presented by the staff and others   suggest that, since 1990, inflation has become less persistent and appears to be less related to   other macro variables as well  We do not know whether these changes are due to a more   aggressive stance of monetary policy against inflation and to our credibility or to fundamental   changes in the domestic or world economy  If we suppose that lower inflation persistence is due   to enhanced policy credibility, then it is incumbent upon this Committee to maintain that   credibility That is, we should not expect inflation persistence to remain low if the Fed acts in a   manner that is inconsistent with its commitment to price stability or risks its credibility by   neglecting to take actions that return the economy to price stability in a reasonable period of   time  We shouldn’t ignore the fact that the longer we allow deviations from price stability to   persist, the higher is the risk to our credibility and the higher is the risk that recent high inflation   readings will raise longer-term expectations, thereby putting us in a very awkward position a   year from now  Thank you   Thank you, Mr Chairman  At our last meeting, my inclination was to   favor an additional 25 basis point increase in the fed funds rate  In my view, there has been very   little change in the economic case for some additional policy firming  The incoming data have not   persuaded me to think that growth would be considerably below trend in ’07, although I do think   that there will be moderation over the next couple of quarters  I do not think that a 25 basis point   September 20, 2006 102 of 132                               change in interest rates one way or the other will have much effect on the housing market at this   point, and I do not believe that we should stand in the way of the adjustment to the housing sector to   move to a more sustainable level of activity   Thus far the Committee has maintained its credibility, and long-run inflation expectations   have been stable  That is very good  My concern, however, is that the longer we tolerate inflation   above our comfort zone, the more risk we have that those expectations will become unhinged    Their becoming unhinged, as I noted in my earlier comments, could lead to some very unpleasant   outcomes, and we would find regaining our credibility very difficult  Because of the weakness in   residential investment, a rise in the fed funds rate could be viewed as potentially costly; but that   potential cost increases the value of the actions as a signal of the Fed’s commitment and its   effectiveness in keeping inflation expectations firmly in check   As the discussions around this table in August and today show, reasonable people doing   sound economic analysis can have different views about whether further policy firming will be   needed  I understand and respect both sides of that argument  My goal at this point is to stress, as   many people have stressed, that we shouldn’t lose sight of the importance of our credibility and to   state that I am unhappy with the level of core inflation and with the pace at which it seems to be   declining, at least in the staff’s forecast  Credibility is difficult to acquire and easy to lose  If we   convince ourselves at each juncture of the decisionmaking process that at the margin we can risk   sacrificing a little credibility to achieve some other loosely defined and perhaps illusive objective,   we may find our capital significantly depleted  Once that is obvious in the data, it is too late   The decision to pause in August was a close call, but the pause cannot be ignored, I think, in   deciding the appropriate action for today  While I believe the language we used in our August   statement gives us the flexibility to raise rates, I think doing so today would pose a very different   September 20, 2006 103 of 132                          and difficult communication challenge  I argued last time that, if the data for August and September   continued to evolve as they had in June and July, it would be hard to change our policy stance if we   paused in August That seems to be exactly where we are  I might argue that another six weeks of   inflation above our comfort zone has increased the risk to our credibility, but I think that initiating a   rate increase so soon after pausing, given the data we have received, could be misinterpreted and   pose its own risk to our credibility for sound monetary policymaking   Thus, I come down on the side that it would be better to remain on hold for this meeting but   to have strong enough language in today’s statement to enable us to initiate rate increases in the near   future unless the incoming data are significantly different from what we’ve expected  The language   in alternative B+ comes close to doing that  It is important that we continue to say, as in section 4,   that inflation risks remain  I would not like to cite factors restraining aggregate demand in the list of   things that would potentially help moderate inflation  I do not think we can measure the tradeoffs   between growth and inflation precisely enough to depend on a moderate deceleration to bring   inflation down over the forecast period  Moreover, and even more important to me, such language   fosters a belief among the public and others that we have a desire and an ability to engage in fairly   precise fine-tuning     I am opposed to alternative A language  First, I do not think that we can say with any great   confidence that inflation risks appear to have diminished  Second, I do not think that saying   “downside risks to growth have become more significant” is helpful at this point  Saying that is   likely to lower the expected path of future interest rates, as has been pointed out, and to reinforce the   idea that interest rates are likely to come down sooner than is built into our forecast  To the extent   that the assessment-of-risk language is supposed to help with the public’s understanding of the   September 20, 2006 104 of 132                              monetary policy process over the coming months, I think the language in alternative A would be   counterproductive   Finally, I would like to reiterate a point that has been made around the table several times   When we look at the longer-term survey data and at what the markets are saying, they seem to be   reading the fact that we do not actually have a target zone of 1 to 2 percent  The target zone is really   maybe 1 to 3 percent or 2 to 3 percent  If in fact our comfort zone is 2 to 3 percent, then we should   communicate that fairly directly rather than speaking one way and acting another way  Of course,   as Governor Kohn and several others mentioned, that point brings us right back to the   communication issue, which I think will be a very important agenda item in the coming meeting    Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
8035,2006-10-24,PLOSSER,"  Thank you  As you suggested, labor force participation plays an important   role going forward in how you think about your forecast of the longer-term growth rate and how it   evolves  So I have two questions about labor force participation in trying to understand where it   comes from and what’s going on  One is the distinction between what’s going on cyclically versus   what’s going on in your trend demographics of the labor force participation rate  That distinction is   part of it, as is whether the way you estimate the cyclical component of employment and so forth   affects the forecast and whether it adjusts very quickly or very slowly in shaping the picture going   forward, particularly into 2007 and 2008   The second question has to do with the secular decline in general that you’re predicting from   demographics  Is there any mechanism in the way you come up with those forecasts that has   feedback from the economy?  For example, through a certain period, labor participation rates for the   60-year-old cohort were falling rapidly  From more-recent data, that cohort appears to be back in   October 24-25, 2006 19 of 203    the labor force more aggressively than it was  I’m not exactly sure why that is  Maybe it’s   uncertainties about pensions, Social Security, and what have you and whether real wages and   adjustments in the labor market affect the secular decline  So I’d like a little discussion about   what’s going on in the model that might help me understand where those pieces fit    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Our regional economic story is similar to   that of the national economy  Regional activity has slowed in the third quarter, mainly because   of the housing sector  In general, our business contacts expect the regional economy to continue   to expand, albeit at a modest pace  Price pressures remain elevated in the Third District but have   not strengthened over the intermeeting period   Turning to the individual sectors, manufacturing activity in our region has softened over   the past two months  The index of general economic activity in our business outlook survey,   which turned slightly negative last month, remains slightly negative this month, indicating   basically not much change since September  However, there were some positives in the October   survey that were not in the September report  In particular, there was a rebound in the indexes of   new orders and shipments, suggesting slightly positive growth in our respondents’ firms  Also,   manufacturing executives were much more optimistic this month about future activity, with most   indicators rebounding from their September low readings  This optimism is consistent with   President Moskow’s comment about the optimism of some executives that he has observed    Now, consistent with the slowdown in activity, payroll employment growth in our three states   October 24-25, 2006 29 of 203    slowed in the third quarter to an annual rate of about 07 percent, compared with 11 percent in   the nation  The unemployment rate, which had been running under the national rate for the past   three years, has now moved up to that rate  Still, our business contacts as well as respondents to   our manufacturing survey continue to cite difficulty in finding qualified workers as one of their   major business concerns   As in the nation, the housing sector in our region continues to decline  We’ve seen some   slowing in the value of nonresidential contracts as well over the past three months  But these   data are quite noisy, and I think it’s too early to read much of a turning point into the   nonresidential construction sector for our region at this point  Office vacancy rates continue to   edge down, and the net absorption of office space continues to be positive     Consumer spending continues to hold up well in our region  We saw a pickup in retail   sales in September, except for autos  Area retailers told us that their sales had increased in recent   weeks, and their back-to-school sales exceeded their expectations  Their view is that continued   growth at that pace depended on consumer confidence, which for the mid-Atlantic region   increased in September, no doubt because of the decline in oil prices   The Fed’s current economic activity indexes indicate a slowing in activity in our region   over the past three months, especially in New Jersey, which has shown the sharpest deceleration    As of August, year-to-date average growth in these indexes (weighted by gross state product) for   our three states has been about 18 percent, compared with 3 percent for the United States  Over   the past three months, regional growth has slowed to about 06 percent  The leading indicators   for our three states also have moved down this year, suggesting only modest growth over the   coming six to nine months   October 24-25, 2006 30 of 203    On the inflation front, consumer prices in the Philadelphia region continue to rise at a   pace faster than that of the nation  The faster pace is due mainly to the larger increases in shelter   prices in the Philadelphia metro area compared with those in the United States  On a more   positive note, while area manufacturers continue to report higher production costs, these cost   increases have been less widespread in recent surveys than earlier in the year  The index of   prices paid in our manufacturing survey has declined for the past three months, and the index of   prices received was down significantly in October  So while the levels of these indexes remain   high, indicating continued inflationary pressures, some solace may be found in the less elevated   levels of these indicators, at least in recent months   For the national economy, my outlook is not much different from what it was at the last   meeting  Real GDP growth in the second quarter was revised down to 26 percent, as has been   noted, and the data received to date suggest that growth in the third quarter was even weaker,   perhaps 1 to 1½ percent  I expect some rebound in the fourth quarter and, like President   Minehan, was pleased to see the upward revision in the fourth-quarter forecast in the Greenbook    The main source of the slowdown, of course, is the fall in the demand for housing    Manufacturing also softened in the third quarter compared with its robust pace earlier in the year    About half of that slowdown was due to autos, and I expect some rebound there, too, in the   fourth quarter  Trade subtracted from growth in the third quarter relative to the second quarter,   but again, as has been pointed out, I expect that to be less of a drag in the fourth quarter than it   was in the third   So aside from housing, most other sectors of the economy, including consumer spending   and business investment, are holding up, even in the Philadelphia region in the Third District    They aren’t growing as rapidly as they were in the first part of this year, but they are growing   October 24-25, 2006 31 of 203    somewhat below trend, and they continue to expand  If the slowdown in housing continues to be   an orderly one, without large spillovers as has been frequently mentioned, I would not   characterize that correction as unwelcome  Housing activity has been at an unsustainably high   pace in recent years  Of course, at this point we cannot rule out the possibility that the correction   in housing from the unsustainably high pace of activity that we’ve seen over the past few years   will derail the expansion  But so far, we have not seen spillovers of housing into other sectors    In particular, we have not seen any retrenchment by the consumer for the most part  The   moderation we’ve seen in consumer spending after the strong first quarter is largely in line with   expectations  Real disposable income growth remains healthy, and we have been lucky with two   positives—the decline in gasoline prices and the rise in the stock market    We’ve had some hopeful news on the inflation front over the intermeeting period, but the   level of inflation continues to concern me  As we anticipated at the time of our last meeting, the   drop in energy prices led to a significant deceleration in headline inflation for September    Although the twelve-month change in core CPI actually edged up to 29 percent, a rate that I   consider well above price stability, it may be beginning to stabilize  But, frankly, a lot of   uncertainty remains, and it is dangerous, to my mind, to rely too heavily on one month’s   numbers  Some of the acceleration of core inflation over the past year was likely due to the   pass-through from energy prices, as we discussed before  So if oil prices fall or continue to   stabilize, then acceleration of core inflation from this source will likely dissipate  However,   we’ve seen energy prices retreat only to move back up again, so I don’t think we should become   too sanguine  Indeed, the inflation picture remains uncertain  I’ll be more comfortable when we   begin to see twelve-month core inflation begin to decelerate  To the extent that some of the   acceleration in inflation was fueled by very accommodative monetary policy over the past five   October 24-25, 2006 32 of 203    years, we still need to consider whether monetary policy has firmed enough to remove the   cumulative effects of the past policy accommodation to get inflation back down to a level   consistent with price stability in a reasonable time so that our credibility is not at risk  The   longer we allow that deviation from price stability to persist, the higher the risk to our credibility   and the higher the risk that recent high inflation readings will raise longer-term inflationary   expectations  So far, long-run expectations have been stable, and shorter-run expectations have   fallen with oil prices  Nevertheless, I think the Fed’s commitment to price stability deserves our   protection  One thing to note going forward, though, is that if economic growth remains below   trend for a while, then there’s an implicit firming of monetary policy, even without changing the   nominal interest rate  Given our economic outlook and the risks to that outlook, at this point that   may be actually the most desirable path  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  There has been a lot of interesting   discussion so far in this go-round, and I find my own views refining a bit as we go along  The   bottom line today is that certainly I agree with everyone who has spoken so far that to maintain   the funds rate at 5¼ percent is the appropriate action  The incoming data we have received over   the period have not really changed my outlook very much for the economy  Of course, I was a   little more optimistic than some of the people last time, and so I’m glad to see everybody has   come around to my point of view  [Laughter]    That’s right  [Laughter]  Well, you’ve got to take it when you can,   right?  Inflation continues to be higher than I’d like to see, and I still believe there are larger risks   on the inflation side than on the growth side  Growth will be slower in the third quarter—we   have all acknowledged that  But we also discussed around this table the fact that even the   Greenbook is now predicting a somewhat larger bounceback in the fourth quarter; indeed, I   remain optimistic that in general the bounceback is going to be somewhat quicker than the   Greenbook’s forecast  We’ve had some good news on inflation  It seems to have stabilized   October 24-25, 2006 101 of 203    somewhat  But given our earlier pause, extending the pause seems the prudent thing to do from   my perspective  If growth as forecast by the Greenbook into the next several quarters remains   significantly below trend, actually holding rates steady for a while would be an implicit firming   of policy, which may have the desirable effects on inflation that we might need to have in order   to bring down inflation  However, if growth bounces back more strongly than the Greenbook   forecasts, which I believe is a likely outcome, we may have to consider additional increases in   the fed funds rate going forward  Thus, from that standpoint, I really don’t view the prospective   policy path as particularly symmetric  I believe that the path more likely would be to hold it   fixed and allow a weakening economy to somewhat firm policy and do our inflation work that   way; or if growth responds more quickly, we may, in fact, have to engage in more firming   policy   As regards the language, I’m a little torn  I’m a bit with President Minehan  I kind of   like B, I kind of like B+, but I also worry a bit about the language and the implications it has for   the market  I actually find myself in agreement with Governor Kohn on many of his points  I   like his prospective change to section 2, getting away from what we think are somewhat unusual   factors in the third quarter and not emphasizing that quarter too much  Of course, you might do   that by just leaving section 2 almost as it was last time  The only difference is that you’re   making a statement that going forward the economy seems likely to expand at a moderate pace    The first sentence in section 2 of our last statement, or the only sentence in section 2, really   conveys almost the same thing that I think Governor Kohn was trying to achieve, but I’m   certainly happy with section 2 as suggested by Governor Kohn   I believe it’s clearly premature to send any signal whatsoever that a rate cut is being   contemplated in the near term, which I think is how the language of alternative A, section 4,   October 24-25, 2006 102 of 203    would be read  I think that any change in the risk assessment language that would lead market   participants to lower their expected path of the fed funds rate would in my opinion be   counterproductive  I also think that mentioning the possibility that the slowdown in economic   growth will become more pronounced, again as section 2 of alternative A seems to suggest,   would be very misleading and would be inconsistent, as has been noted, with some of the   optimism expressed around the table yesterday  Thus Friday, when the advance estimate of the   third quarter is released, language A would be read as our expecting growth to be less than   1 percent going forward, and I think that’s really not what any of our forecasts are suggesting  I   believe there is a greater likelihood that growth will be higher rather than lower in the coming   months than the Greenbook shows; and unless we see evidence that economic growth is   weakening significantly compared with our forecast, lowering the fed funds rate just will not be a   very likely outcome  I think we should be reluctant to suggest in our statement that we are now   more inclined to lower rates  For those reasons, I really don’t favor the language in alternative   A  Relative to alternative B, the language in B+, as I have suggested, accurately reflects the   view that many of us around the table have—that the data we have seen actually have truncated   some of the tail on the downside and that the risk of a really bad outcome has somewhat   diminished over the past few weeks  But I’m afraid that trying to use B+ to fine-tune   expectations too precisely may create more problems than it solves  So I tend to favor keeping   the language as constant as we can  Thank you, Mr Chairman     There’s more discussion about the word “moderate”  It occurs to me this   arises also in other contexts  Do we really have to speak in code words?  If what we mean by   “moderate” is that we believe growth will be near trend or near potential going forward, why don’t   we just say that?  It’s just a suggestion   October 24-25, 2006 109 of 203     I’m a bit of a slow learner, but I’ll catch on    It probably comes as no surprise to most of you that I share a lot of the   views expressed by Jeff, Bill, and Rick, and so I’ll try to reinforce some and maybe fine-tune a   couple about which I might have some additional thoughts  I do applaud the changes that the   FOMC has made—over the past decade, in particular  It has enhanced its credibility  It has   improved its communication and its transparency about the policymaking process, and I think that   has been a great step forward  In principle, I view the announcement of a long-term numerical   definition of price stability or long-term inflation target, however you want to think about it, as   another important step in that direction, and in that sense, the announcement is going to be   evolutionary rather than revolutionary  I also believe that it will fundamentally improve the   policymaking process without unduly restricting our flexibility to respond to crises   October 24-25, 2006 145 of 203    I think it is often important to remind the public and others that we—the Federal Reserve,   the central bank—have the unique responsibility to maintain price stability  No other agency of the   government is charged with maintaining price stability, and nobody else can do it for us  So in   some sense, when you think about mandates and what our responsibilities are, we are the only   vehicle for achieving that   Specifying our long-term price stability objective numerically would help coordinate   expectations by reducing the public’s uncertainty about our goal  Long-run expectations would   become less responsive to short-term inflation, therefore probably less persistent  This should   enhance monetary policy flexibility in many ways  Thus, rather than being unduly constraining, it   could add to our flexibility  But that’s not to say that a numerical definition would not influence our   policymaking; indeed, there would be little point in specifying a target if we thought that it   wouldn’t  The numerical goal would be a long-run anchor—the nominal anchor to our monetary   policy  It would help coordinate our own discussions of appropriate policy and serve as the   guidepost for our policy deliberations   At times a policymaker would like to deviate from the commitment to long-term price   stability, the so-called time consistency problem  A precise definition of what we mean by price   stability, however, would make it harder to succumb to the temptation to deviate and thereby would   improve policy outcomes  What we know in the context of most policies is that welfare under   forms of full commitment generally exceeds welfare under forms of discretion  Now, that does not   mean that there will not be exceptional unforeseen events or events with such low probabilities of   occurring that reactions to them would not have been pre-specified but would require deviations   from policy as usual  But these special circumstances are easily recognized  In such instances, such   as 9/11 and other crises, the FOMC will be able to react appropriately   October 24-25, 2006 146 of 203    We are fortunate, as Rick pointed out, that a number of other central banks in the developed   world have set numerical inflation objectives and inflation targets  Numerical specification has   been viewed quite favorably by those banks, and it seems to produce a moderate improvement in   monetary policy  There is evidence that inflation expectations have become better anchored in these   countries and that inflation outcomes have improved without any negative consequences for output   growth   It can be reasonably argued that the FOMC has implicitly targeted inflation over the past ten   years  Twelve-month averages of core CPI inflation have remained inside a band of 1 to 3 percent    I believe, given the shocks that have hit the economy over this period, that has not been just good   luck  Rather, it has been good policy  Thus, an explicit setting of a numerical objective would be   evolutionary and not revolutionary for the Fed   Now, I have not come to firm conclusions about the precise formulation of the price stability   objective  We’ll need to consider—as has been alluded to—which index, what period over which to   define the goal, and whether we should choose a range or a point for the definition  The choices, to   me, are interrelated  For example, a long horizon would mean a tighter range and perhaps even a   point  A long horizon makes the choice between headline and core inflation less important  Any   proposal will have its pros and cons  For example, specifying a range may be preferred if it   communicates explicit upper and lower bounds, presumably above or below which we would say   we are definitely away from price stability  Of course, because of inflation dynamics, to maintain   inflation in that range, policymakers would have to take action before inflation moved above or   below those bounds  On the other hand, a range might induce some complacency on the part of   policymakers so that they would not feel any urgency to take action until inflation moved outside   the range, at which point it might be too late or at least more costly to restore price stability and   October 24-25, 2006 147 of 203    reestablish our credibility  If so, a point estimate actually may be best because it would force the   policy to be more explicit about why or why not any deviation should be tolerated and for how long    As I said, I’ve not really come to a firm conclusion about a particular formulation in that regard    Presumably, deciding on a definition of price stability would entail estimating measurement bias in   particular indexes  Robert Gordon in recent work estimated that the bias in the headline CPI is   about 08 percent per year   There are likely different estimates of the bias  Presumably having   ranges will help us determine what those definitions might be  If we decided and agreed upon a   bias, let’s say it was 08, should that be our target?  Yes, if price stability is our goal  However, in   this regard, I agree with Bill, Jeff, and Rick that having a unique number may, in fact, be more   important than what that number is, so long as it is within a fairly narrow range   I think that this problem is a little more complex because we also have to consider the view   of models in which there is actual optimal inflation  Many models of optimal monetary policy   suggest, depending on the exact formulation of the model, that the optimal rate of inflation falls in a   range of slightly negative to slightly positive  Thus, price stability may be desirable, but it may not   be optimal in some circumstances   Finally, monetary policy is a Committee decision  We may differ on our forecasts, our   models, and our understanding of the channels through which monetary policy affects the economy,   but it seems to me that the Committee must agree on its inflation objective  I don’t see, as has been   discussed, how we can formulate coherent policy if we disagree on the numerical long-run goal we   are trying to achieve  In helping communication and the public’s understanding of policy,   individual definitions would create much too much confusion  This problem is evident today  For   example, there seems to be a disconnect between the market’s view of long-run inflation, which   according to surveys and financial markets seems to remain around 2½ percent, and the statements   October 24-25, 2006 148 of 203    made by many of us on this Committee who seem to be comfortable with 1 to 2 percent  Do the   markets not believe that we are seriously committed to that goal?  Are we really committed to the   goal of 2 percent or below?  By publicly committing to a specific target, we might, I hope, obtain   greater congruence of our goals and the market’s expectations  Of course, we have to remember   that we will not succeed at all unless our actions are consistent with our stated objective   Let me make two really quick points about communications  First, as I said earlier,   sometimes when I’ve read past FOMC statements I’ve said, “Well, why don’t you just say what you   mean?”  I agree with Rick  I don’t really like “potential output” either  I think it’s important that   we strive toward achieving a communication strategy in which we are not trying either to confuse   the market or to send signals but are basically stating what our forecasts are, what our policy   objectives are, and how we propose to get to them  Second, I’d like to reinforce the idea—and Rick   spent a good deal of time talking about this so I won’t elaborate on it—of a document like an   inflation report—call it a monetary policy report  Part of our communication strategy would be   greatly enhanced by our ability to communicate on a more regular basis what our views about the   economy are and where we think it is going  As a way of communicating, such a report would be   very valuable  It would be tricky because it needs to be a report of this Committee and not   necessarily of the staff  How we mesh what the staff does with what the Committee thinks can be a   very tricky process  So I recognize that getting to that report entails some discussion about how to   proceed, what constitutes the report, and how we communicate the Committee’s views   independently or how we aggregate them  Thus, I appreciate Rick’s argument that maybe we could   have some dry runs in thinking about how we aggregate our views  What variables we need to put   in the report, which are the critical ones, and what policy assumptions underlie some of those   forecasts are all very subtle and complex issues   October 24-25, 2006 149 of 203    I taught in a business school for most of my career—thirty years of teaching business   students  One thing I said to students was that the tough part of management often wasn’t figuring   out where you wanted to go; the tough part often was figuring out how you get there from where   you are  Indeed, in running an organization, in many cases that is where you run into most of your   problems and where you step into the biggest potholes  Therefore, I’m very sensitive that, if we   agree that we want to get to some goal, the trick is figuring out how we get there from where we are    That is critical   The last thing I’d like to comment on relates to the so-called dual objective and Rick’s   comment about the importance of the central bank’s concern for output and employment, the “dirty   little secret” as you referred to it—that we don’t have to worry about it because the public knows   that we are concerned about it  But I think we have to be very careful in our communications   because I worry sometimes that the public’s view of monetary policy is often that we can do   anything, and at the slightest deviation or problem, we sometimes step into the hole of leading them   to believe that we can either fine-tune or achieve objectives that we really can’t achieve  So in the   context of this discussion, we need to try to communicate to the public that, although we may have a   dual mandate in some respects, our ability to achieve certain objectives is very, very limited  We’ve   come dangerously close in this period to going from a position in which monetary policy was never   considered to matter for anything to one in which it’s all that matters  Our communications can   play a role in which we are a bit more humble and admit what we can do and what we cannot do    We should be very careful not to lead the public along a path that suggests we can actually   accomplish things that most of us around the table don’t believe we really can  Thank you, Mr   Chairman  "
8059,2006-12-12,PLOSSER,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I have two questions that are sort of related    The first question has to do with the acceleration in core PCE prices that we saw earlier this year   and were all obviously very concerned about  One rationale we’ve offered in trying to understand   that acceleration was the pass-through effects from the previous year’s rise in energy prices from   about $50 a barrel to something like $75 a barrel  Given that energy prices have now fallen and it   looks as though they’re stabilizing around $60 a barrel at least for now, how do you measure the   effect on the pass-through into core PCE prices from that roughly 20 percent drop in oil prices?  I   can see the measurement going on in the headline; but as I look at your forecasts of core, they   haven’t responded to that same effect  Is there much pass-through in the model to core PCE prices   from energy prices, or is there not?  I’m trying to understand how you guys think about that   The second question is related to inflation as well  In trying to understand this automobile   thing—which I clearly do not entirely understand at this point—I saw your suggestion that an   apparently anomalous large drop occurred in the PPI for trucks or something like that  Was that real   or accurate?  Are there any ramifications from that anomalous drop in the PPI?  Does that   measurement problem carry over to other price indexes—for example, the CPI?  If it does carry   over, does that mean that our estimates of the CPI are perhaps understated in the near term because   of the same measurement problem?  I don’t know whether or not there’s any relation between those   two  Those are my two questions   December 12, 2006 19 of 134          That was really my question—whether it contaminated anything else    That doesn’t show up in your forecast    I was looking at the change from the August forecast of core inflation,   which was before we had the big decline, and it really hasn’t changed much  That’s why I couldn’t   see why it hadn’t had that much of an effect    Thank you, Mr Chairman  The economic picture in our region has   changed little since our last meeting  The coincident indicators in our Business Outlook Survey   suggested that economic activity continues to expand at a moderate pace in each of our three states,   and the business contacts expect that pace to continue  I’m beginning to feel as though I’m reading   the same chapter of the book again  It’s like Yogi Berra—it’s déjà vu all over again    The weakest sector in our region, as in the nation, is of course housing, which continues to   decline  Sales and permits continue on a downward trend, and cancellations rose significantly in   November; but builders have been able to resell, albeit at lower prices, homes whose initial   purchasers have reneged  However, our survey of smaller homebuilders suggests that conditions on   average in the housing market in our District seem somewhat better than in the nation as a whole    None of the builders we polled reported low inventories of unsold homes  Interestingly enough,   86 percent of them said their inventories were about right; only 14 percent said inventories were   high; and no one reported that they were extremely high  In comparison, across the nation,   51 percent of builders reported that inventories were either low or about right, and 49 percent   reported either high or extremely high inventories  Certainly some areas in our District have had a   sharp drop in housing activity  The most notable is the Jersey Shore  But generally, based on what   I’m hearing from firms in our District, I would continue to characterize the decline in housing in our   region as an orderly one   Commercial real estate continues to perform very well  We’ve had some downturn in the   value of nonresidential building contracts in the last month, but these data are very volatile, and the   revisions tend to be upward as new contracts are reported over time  Our contacts in that sector   continue to be among the most optimistic in our region  Office vacancy rates continued to decline   in the past few months both in Center City Philadelphia and in the suburbs, and the net absorption of   December 12, 2006 45 of 134         office space continues to be positive  Rents have risen, and the increase in occupancy has led to a   scarcity of large blocks of available space, which bodes well for construction   Manufacturing activity in our region has been softening this fall, and we haven’t seen much   of an increase since then  After two negative readings in September and October, the general index   of economic activity in our business outlook survey turned positive in November, but its level of   slightly above 5 suggests that that’s really not much change in the outlook  New orders and   shipments were modestly weak  Shipments were actually strong  Orders were a little weaker, but   the recent weakness is consistent with softness in national manufacturing and, as we’ve seen, in the   purchasing managers’ index  Optimism for future capital spending actually rebounded last month—  so the picture there is very mixed  Consumer spending continues to hold up well  Auto dealers and   retailers reported strong sales in November and are optimistic about the holiday season   Labor market conditions in the District have changed little  Payroll employment growth in   our three states is up at an annual rate of about 07 percent, which is slower than the national rate,   but that’s just a fact of the population growth in our District  Unemployment rates remain low, near   or below the national rates  Business contacts continue to cite difficulty in finding qualified   workers, especially for skilled and professional positions  Area employers indicate that, over the   past few months, wages have been steadily rising at a pace higher than earlier this year   I also want to mention some anecdotal information that I find interesting  Last week I met   with a number of mostly manufacturing CEOs from my District  An observation that one of them   made, which many agreed with, was that from their perspective money was almost free  This   observation is consistent with what some others have been saying around the table  They thought   that there was plenty of liquidity and that interest rates were not limiting them particularly in any   way  This observation is also consistent with the views that mortgages rates are still relatively low   December 12, 2006 46 of 134         and that credit spreads show less stress on businesses at this point  I take these observations to   indicate that monetary policy is not particularly restrictive at this point   Also on the anecdotal side, the several manufacturers who participate as suppliers to both   homebuilding and commercial real estate lamented their housing-related business, whether   plumbing, cabinetry, or flooring, which were the three industries represented  On the residential   side, the markets were terrible  Business was very bad  However, they all said that the commercial   side was booming so much that it more than made up for their weakness on the residential side so   that business tended to still be pretty good    In contrast to President Poole’s comment about trucking, I had one trucking CEO who said   actually that business was good  It was weak in the Northeast—shipments were down there—but in   the South and West their business was picking up and doing pretty well  He also made an   interesting comment that I had not really thought about  He said that part of the change in trucking   is that, while volumes may be down and they are having trouble finding drivers, there has also been   a revolution in packaging  In fact, even though trucking volumes are down, the value of products   and goods being shipped is actually up  As an example, they used to ship the big boom boxes that   people listened to music on; now they’re shipping iPods  So as packaging has become more   efficient and more protective, the truck volume is less, but the value is actually higher  He said that   this was an ongoing trend in the trucking industry and that one had to be careful about interpreting   volumes   On the inflation front, manufacturers continue to report higher production costs, but these   cost increases have been less widespread than recent surveys indicated  Indexes of prices paid and   prices received have continued to climb, and they’re still above where we’d like to see them   December 12, 2006 47 of 134         On the national side, my outlook has changed very little since our last meeting  Compared   with earlier this year, growth has weakened, as we all know and have discussed  Housing slowed a   little faster than perhaps we anticipated but—I agree with President Lacker—the prospects of   spillovers remain relatively low  Again, as Bill applauded Janet’s wonderful one-handed/two-  handed presentation, the labor markets are sending a completely different signal  As I said earlier,   manufacturers and employers in our region continue to find scarcity in the labor market, both skilled   and unskilled  If we thought that the economy were weakening and we expected growth to remain   appreciably below potential and weak for a number of additional quarters, it might be important to   allow short-term interest rates to move down—but not because I think the Fed can do much to prop   up growth in those circumstances, that is, to ride some kind of Phillips curve  After all, businesses   say there’s ample liquidity, and mortgage rates remain relatively low  But because equilibrium   market rates may be lower over a sustained period, we might want to see a fed funds rate that’s   consistent with that  This would be particularly relevant if we were sanguine about inflation    However, in my view, we’re not in that situation yet   As has been alluded to, many market commentators have pointed to the inversion of the   yield curve as an indicator that recession is probable, but as suggested by the Chairman and the   research that has been done, some of it by the Board staff, the predictive power of changes in the   slope of the yield curve depends on why the slope of the yield curve changes  The change in the   slope of the yield curve suggested by the research that was alluded to earlier has been about 100   basis points, but about half of that has been in the risk premium associated with long-term rates  At   the same time, the predictive content of that risk premium change for recession or GDP growth is   much less than absolute changes in real rates  So I take that research to say that the inversion of the   yield curve may be forecasting slower growth but not a recession to date   December 12, 2006 48 of 134         Thus, inflation remains a significant concern to me  Recent readings on headline inflation   have shown some encouraging downward movement, and inflation expectations have remained   stable  But the level of core inflation continues to be higher than what I consider to be consistent   with price stability  Moreover, the forecast does not show us reestablishing price stability in the   near future  That’s a reasonable, although unwelcome, forecast to the extent that very   accommodative monetary policy over the past five years helped fuel the acceleration of inflation   and that monetary policy and financial markets have not tightened much and aren’t expected to   tighten much over the coming period  The Bluebook indicates that the current real fed funds rate is   within the range of model-based estimates of the equilibrium rate—that is, policy is not terribly   tight—and, as I suggested earlier, long rates including mortgage rates are at relatively low levels,   suggesting ample liquidity in the market   I’m not convinced that price stability will be achieved without further action on the part of   the Fed, and I’d feel more comfortable after seeing a few more months or even another quarter or   two of deceleration  The slight deceleration in core inflation that we have seen, coupled with the   slower economic growth, has meant that implicit firming of policy even without a change in the   nominal funds rate might be in the cards, and that would be a welcome change  I’m not convinced   that the recent decline in energy prices will provide the relief we would like to see in core inflation    As suggested by Jeff and my question earlier, I’m concerned that, if oil prices stabilize around $60 a   barrel, we will see core inflation begin to creep back up once the temporary benefits of the decline   have disappeared  Indeed, gasoline prices have already risen somewhat in the past few weeks from   the lows that we saw in late September and early October  As has been mentioned, the sharpest   increases in the components of inflation that we’ve looked at over the past few months seem to be in   those elements that are least likely to be influenced by energy prices  In addition, as Jeff said, I’m   December 12, 2006 49 of 134         very dubious that the gap measures that we allude to periodically are going to act as much of a   constraint on price increases going forward  The bottom line is that I’m not hopeful that energy   prices or the output gap will provide us with much of the inflationary relief that we’re looking for    Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I, too, favor maintaining the federal funds rate   at its current level at this point  As many people have said, the incoming data have been   voluminous but not very informative  However, inflation continues to be higher than I’d like to see   it and is forecast to remain so for longer than I’d like to see, thus putting our credibility at risk  I am   more optimistic than the Greenbook about the possibility for a quicker rebound to potential  But   even if you take the staff’s Greenbook forecast, with growth expected to be below trend for at least   several more quarters before returning to trend, I’m comfortable with maintaining the current   federal funds rate and the implicit firming that doing so would imply as the economy slows down    December 12, 2006 105 of 134         Although I don’t think we should raise the fed funds rate today, I do want to put on the table   and reemphasize, as several people have, that we need to acknowledge that if real growth rebounds   quicker toward trend than is currently forecast, whether in the fourth quarter of this year or the first   quarter of next year, then we must be in a position to raise the fed funds rate at that time  I happen   to put more probability on that being the case than perhaps some do  A failure to do that or to signal   that we will do that would put considerable upward pressure on the inflation outlook and on the   public’s perception of our commitment to price stability  Of course, if we begin to see much larger   spillovers from housing corrections or from other sectors, which I don’t think we will, we may want   to allow the nominal funds rate to decline as the equilibrium market rates decline—again, not to   exploit a Phillips curve type of tradeoff but to drive the real rate down at the appropriate time  But   that would also be signaling that we are content with the current level of inflation, and I don’t think   we are at this point  So I don’t think that’s really in the cards  Given the outlook, I see not much to   be gained and much to be lost from lowering the fed funds rate, as many people have indicated   In regard to the language, I lean toward alternative B, but I must confess I’m still a novice at   the nuance of some of this language stuff, and I go back and forth  I am sympathetic to the view   expressed by President Minehan and to Bill Poole’s comments about the words “than anticipated,”   but I am concerned about section 2, and I have some mixed emotions about it  It seems to me that   the way section 2 is currently being construed is a bit asymmetric  President Yellen was making   this point  We talk about the weakness that we’ve seen, and then we make a comment that says,   “But we expect growth to be moderate”  That seems to me to be an asymmetric treatment of what   we’ve really been talking about  If we’re going to be explicit about where we’ve seen weakness,   then we also ought to be explicit about why we still see growth as being moderate because   otherwise you see only one side of the coin  Whether we talk about strength in the labor markets or   December 12, 2006 106 of 134         strength in consumer spending, it seems to me that we need to balance the statement; otherwise the   section doesn’t make a lot of sense to me    Now, as I think through that, I become more and more attracted to President Hoenig’s view   that maybe the less we say the better because saying more requires more explanation  In general, I   have somewhat mixed feelings about the language issue  I tend to think that we ought to change the   language of the statement more often rather than less often because putting in a new word is always   excruciatingly painful and understanding the nuances of what we’re trying to convey to the market   is very difficult  One alternative is to be much more eclectic about what we say and either use the   minutes to explain it further or not  I don’t know that I would necessarily advocate doing that, but I   think that we need to think about using the language in the statement in ways that perhaps don’t   lock us into things in the way the language currently does  That’s my observation  Thank you, Mr   Chairman    I’d just like to echo both of those points, which makes this issue in some   ways much more subtle and difficult to pull off  I agree with Rick 100 percent  Part of our job here   is education  We have to walk the line between talking about the subtleties of monetary policy and   issues that confront us and educating the public, because the last thing we want to do is to clam up   about monetary policy to such an extent that the public doesn’t get educated and doesn’t understand   what we’re doing and why  So it is important that we bring them along with us to some degree as   we talk about it  The other point that I would reinforce is what Bill said  Many of us are on record   as having points of view on some of these issues, and we can’t just deny that those exist  "
8086,2007-01-30,PLOSSER,"  Thank you  I have a question that is related to this issue, but it comes out   of the Bluebook  I think I understand how this model is working, but then I get a surprise, and I   realize I really don’t understand how it works  I noticed in the Bluebook that there was a jump of   50 basis points in the Greenbook-consistent estimate of the real funds rate  At the same time in the   model and the simulations, you keep the fed funds rate constant, which would be slightly below   January 30-31, 2007 32 of 255    what that Greenbook real rate might suggest  The unemployment rate remains somewhat below   your NAIRU estimate, and yet you still have inflation modestly declining  I’m trying to figure out   how that works  Is there something that I’m not understanding, or can you clarify the mechanism   by which those things fit together?    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Conditions in the Third District have   continued to evolve much as they have for most of the past several months  Economic activity is   still expanding  I think I can use the word “moderate”—I don’t think anybody else has used that   yet, and our contacts expect the pace to be maintained in the coming months  There has been little   change in the pattern of activity over the sectors  Retailers in our region indicated that their holiday   sales were about as they expected or somewhat better  Housing continues to weaken at a somewhat   orderly pace, but there are signs of stabilization of demand  Inventory has remained elevated, and   construction continues to decline  However, the weakness in residential construction is being offset   by continued strength in nonresidential construction  Office vacancy rates continue to decline in   Philadelphia and in the near suburbs as well  The net absorption of office space has increased for   the past twelve quarters  Manufacturing activity in the region hit a soft spot in the fall, as I indicated   in previous meetings, but our most recent Business Outlook Survey, in January, presented   somewhat positive but also somewhat mixed signals  The general activity index returned to positive   territory with a reading of plus 8, indicating a slight increase in manufacturing activity, and there   was a significant rebound in shipments  New orders, however, remained close to zero  That’s   somewhat of an aberration because new orders and shipments tend to move very much together, and   so there are some inconsistencies there, which is why I said the situation is a bit mixed  According   to our survey, however, the firms expect a rebound of general manufacturing activity and orders   January 30-31, 2007 56 of 255    over the coming six months  Indeed, most of our business contacts see moderate growth in the   region continuing for the foreseeable future  Their positive attitudes are consistent with the recent   positive news we’ve had about conditions in the nation  Firms remain concerned about their ability   to hire both skilled and unskilled labor  Labor markets are tight for many of the reasons that   President Minehan described in New England; we have some of the same things going on in the   Third District   Regarding national conditions, the unusually warm weather in December may have   temporarily buoyed some of our numbers; but based on incoming information, I’ve become   increasingly confident that the national economy has a positive underlying momentum  At the time   of our last meeting, there was a contrast between the mixed data on consumption and production   and the relatively strong indications from the labor market  The picture that appears to be emerging   from the latest economic information is one of stronger underlying growth that has been temporarily   weakened by housing and autos  There is little, if any, evidence that the housing and auto   corrections are spilling over into the other sectors of the economy  We’ve been looking for those   spillovers for the past six months and have yet to see any significant evidence that they are   occurring or are about to occur  Of course, spillovers may yet materialize with a long lag, but that   likelihood to my mind is diminishing as we have begun to see some hopeful signs of stabilization in   housing  Labor market conditions remain firm, and manufacturing indicators improved in   December as did capital goods orders  Although I didn’t talk to the chairman of Disney, I did talk   to a small manufacturing firm with total revenues that come to $2 million  He has been very   positive about the outlook  His sales depend a lot on construction, and he said that, after the most   miserable August and September he had ever seen in his twenty years of running the business, the   pickup began in late November, continued through December, and has continued into January as   January 30-31, 2007 57 of 255    well  Other contacts from banks, particularly credit card issuers to whom I’ve talked, suggest that   banks are seeing numbers coming across their books on credit card purchases continuing to be   strong even after Christmas  So that also is good news   All of this suggests that the downside risks to growth have receded since our last meeting  I   believe this is the market’s assessment as well, as expectations of future policy firm  My outlook is   that the economy will return to trend growth, which I put at about 3 percent this year, and will   continue at that pace into 2008  Of course, as everybody has indicated, that’s a little stronger than   the Greenbook’s outlook, and it is, again, based on my view that potential growth or trend growth is   somewhat higher than the Greenbook has stated  I expect the unemployment rate to rise slightly,   maybe to 48 percent by the fourth quarter of this year, and then to stabilize into next year  I think   this is going to be accompanied by employment growth of nearly 1 percent, and again, that’s what   accounts for the difference in the trend growth   I anticipate a decline in core PCE inflation of about 04 percent by 2008  I would like to   underscore that this forecast is not driven by a lower pass-through of oil prices, which have   declined  My reading of the empirical evidence, including work done by some people on the   Philadelphia staff, is that it’s very difficult to attribute movements in core inflation of six months to   twelve months or longer periods to changes in oil prices  In fact, there’s growing empirical   evidence that neither movements in oil prices nor Phillips curve type factors significantly improve   our root mean square error forecasts of core inflation two or more quarters ahead  I note that this   refers to forecasts of six months or longer and not to short-run high-frequency movements  This   suggests that we should be careful in the language we use describing the reasons for our projections   of future inflation to avoid perpetuating views of inflation processes that we can’t empirically   substantiate   January 30-31, 2007 58 of 255    In my view, core inflation will not come back down until monetary conditions, which I   believe have been very accommodative over the past few years, have tightened sufficiently  The   Greenbook forecast has a slightly smaller decline in core PCE inflation to about 2 percent in 2008,   but incorporates a less restrictive monetary policy than I believe is likely to be appropriate given my   view of the strength of the underlying economy and of the fundamentals that we are seeing  Indeed,   over the past two meetings, my feeling was that the slowdown in economic activity that we might   be seeing, combined with a constant fed funds rate, might have been enough to bring inflation back   to a more acceptable level  Now I’m less convinced that price stability will be achieved without   further action on our part some time later this year  But I will leave that discussion to the policy go-  round  Thank you    That’s right, somewhat tighter, somewhat more aggressive than what’s in   the Greenbook    The path I was thinking about as I was doing the forecast and trying to   determine the appropriate policy here—my desire is to get inflation down lower, and that’s reflected   in my forecast—is one in which the fed funds rate goes up somewhat from where it is today,   January 30-31, 2007 59 of 255    perhaps to 5½ or 5¾ percent  But then by the end of ’07 and into ’08, it’s coming back down again   to more of a steady-state level, and then we can talk about what the real neutral rate is    Well, there’s some uncertainty about that  I think it would get to between   15 and 2 percent    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll start off by saying that today I favor   maintaining the federal funds rate at 5¼ percent  As we discussed yesterday and we learned this   morning, the picture that seems to be emerging from the latest economic information is one of   reasonably strong underlying growth, which has been temporarily weakened by housing and   autos  Given that temporary weakness, I think it would be premature to raise rates today; but I   am not confident that core inflation will continue to decelerate in the coming quarters, and that   could risk our credibility  The level of inflation continues to be higher than I’d like to see, and in   my forecast we may not see a return to price stability unless monetary conditions are tightened   further  Although I don’t think today is the day to do it, I do want us to consider tightening if we   see growth accelerating back to trend more quickly than in the Greenbook  I say this not because   I think that growth will put upward pressure on inflation but because the associated equilibrium   January 30-31, 2007 97 of 255    real rates that are implied by that higher growth, which we are beginning to see in the   marketplace, will eventually force our hand  As I mentioned in my remarks on the economy at   the past two meetings, I have been of the mind that a somewhat slower economy, combined with   a constant funds rate, might be sufficient to ensure a decline in core inflation  As the economy   strengthens, that scenario becomes a little less likely  If the economy continues to strengthen, a   failure to act not only puts our price stability goal at risk but also risks our credibility with the   public    Thus it would be ill-advised to suggest in our statement that we are finished acting for a   while, and therefore I would not favor the language that Bill Poole circulated last week  My   preference is for the language describing the rationale given in alternative C in table 1 of the   Bluebook  The rationale in alternative C, including both sections 2 and 3, is really not more   hawkish than the language of alternative B, yet it’s more concise and comes closer to my views   on the current state of the economy  Indeed, since under alternative B, section 3, or alternative   C, section 3, we would be making sizable changes in the language from our last statement, I also   think that it’s appropriate at this time to purge the language about the high level of resource   utilization having the potential to sustain inflation pressures or lower oil prices to mitigate core   inflation  All the recent work on the forecasting of medium-term and longer-term inflation that I   have seen says that these Phillips-type models don’t help us forecast core inflation very well    The FRB/US model of the Greenbook looks as though it has very flat tradeoffs, certainly in the   near term anyway; so I think it would be useful to change our language at this point  I have not   been a fan of that language, but in the past I was persuaded that we should leave it so as to avoid   unnecessary changes that might confuse the public  But since we are considering changes at this   time, I would favor going with alternative C, which gets rid of this language  I’m happy to   January 30-31, 2007 98 of 255    continue with the risk assessment that we had last time, eliminating the word “nonetheless,”   although frankly I would not greatly resist actually going with the assessment of risk in   alternative C  Thank you, Mr Chairman     I advocate leaving the federal funds rate section as is but using sections   2 and 3 from alternative C as our rationale     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I will try to be brief  I was impressed with   President Yellen’s excellent presentation and the thoughtfulness and scope of what she talked   about, and I agree almost 100 percent with everything she said  But I want to mention a few   things that I think are important  There’s an old forecasting adage, if you’ve ever been in the   forecasting business  If you can’t forecast well, forecast often  [Laughter]  Now, that suggests   to me that, if this exercise were only about the forecast, it might not be so important to do   frequently  But the purpose of publishing this information on a more regular basis is not so   much about the forecast as it is about communicating policy and the views of the Committee to a   broader audience  Our forecast is almost a byproduct, but it provides, in my view, both the   foundation and the context for our current thinking about current policy and future policy    That’s really the value of it to me  Providing a forecast and a narrative would provide a richer   context  It would allow us to be perhaps a little more expansive about things in the narrative    I’ll come back to that in a second  We spend so much time around this table parsing words in   our statements each time, and having a richer description of the context in which policy is being   made and the views that are being expressed would allow us to get away somewhat from our   focus on the language in the statement itself  It would provide us with some more flexibility, and   we wouldn’t have to worry quite as much about every word being parsed for some new meaning    The purposes go beyond just the forecast and its part in this communication  Indeed, a broader   principle is the transparency of the policymaking process  So let me go through the questions   and provide for each of them a quick answer and perhaps a little nuance    I certainly agree with most people around this table that we need to have individual   forecasts  I strongly believe in the “independent” approach  There is huge value to the diversity   January 30-31, 2007 191 of 255    sitting around this table  I don’t think we want to put that at risk, so I’m very supportive of that    In terms of common assumptions, in particular on the conditioning variables, I don’t think there   ought to be common assumptions  We ought to use appropriate policy  I have a little   uncertainty in my own mind about whether that ought to be an explicit part of the forecast in   terms of what we publish  I am of two minds on that issue  On the one hand, I’m sympathetic to   the notion that you want to be very careful about imprinting in the minds of the public that the   forecast is some kind of guarantee or commitment  I think that’s not a big problem; it can be   overcome with some discussion and fan charts and other things  On the other hand, publishing it   has some value  I think about the times this fall when we were sitting around this table talking   about the weakness in the economy and housing and what we thought our outlook was  At the   time, the markets were projecting that we were going to drop the fed funds rate to something like   4¼ by this spring, but I didn’t sense at the time that this group would have put as much   probability on that occurring as perhaps the market was  If we were in the business of generating   these forecasts, that disconnect wouldn’t have happened, or it would have been much milder, I   suspect  There would not have been as much uncertainty nor as much movement in those   interest rates had we been more forthright about what our thinking was going forward  So I think   there are some benefits to reporting out the range of what people think is appropriate policy   going forward, but I acknowledge it also has some risk    The narrative is terribly important for making this work  Indeed, that is where you are   providing the richness  I think it ought to be a minutes-style narrative  I’m a bit torn as to   whether or not individual Committee participants should have the opportunity to write a side bar   if they are really uncomfortable with something  Certainly, if we allowed that, it should be done   without attribution  But I believe that the issue here is more about timeliness and whether we   January 30-31, 2007 192 of 255    can do this in a timely way to make it work, which is speaking to Rick’s concern  We just have   to struggle with that a little and figure out what might work best    How frequently should the forecast be made?  I lean toward four times a year  I think   that’s a good frequency and puts the forecast roughly at every other meeting  At first, this will   be very difficult to do, but if we get into a production cycle, I think it is certainly feasible  As to   the issue of how many years the forecast should cover, I think that it should go a little longer   than what we currently have  I lean toward three years  As we go out, all we have to do is just   say something about what we believe the long-term trends are or, in some cases perhaps, what   our objectives may be  Perhaps we want to get far enough out so that the long-term trend is   revealed      This gets back to what issues and what variables we report  I never have liked the phrase   “potential GDP” because I have never really understood what it meant or how to measure it  But   I do use the word “trend” a lot  I’m not sure it’s a bad idea when you’re collecting the forecasts   from the members, much as Vice Chairman Geithner did, to report what your view of trend is    We may or may not choose to publish that for some of the reasons that Rick perhaps suggested—  although I’m less concerned about his concerns, I certainly understand them  But it would be   terribly useful to gather that information and to share it—maybe only internally so that we have   an idea of where people think the economy is in a long-run sense  The variables we ought to   publish would obviously be real GDP, unemployment, and a measure of inflation (whichever one   we decide seems most appropriate)  I’d be okay with a trend estimate, although I don’t feel   strongly one way or another  Producing a fan chart or some information about the range of what   the Committee thinks is appropriate policy would be informative  In particular, I like Janet’s   pictures because, as you notice, it has no line in it  There is no point forecast  As we convey   January 30-31, 2007 193 of 255    uncertainty about the forecast, we want to do everything we can to steer people away from the   notion of a point forecast on anything because they’ll latch onto that point forecast and   disabusing them of that will be very difficult  Steering them away from a point forecast also   helps stress the importance of uncertainty in our forecast going forward, and I think we need to   convey uncertainty  I’d even be inclined to report, as these charts do, just central tendencies and   not any medians or point estimates for any of the variables  I think that’s a terrific idea    Finally, I’d like to make a suggestion  It will be very difficult to design the details   around this with the whole Committee  I think Governor Kohn alluded to this consideration in   the beginning  So I would strongly support a motion that either the communications   subcommittee or a subcommittee that they delegate to would come back to this group rather   quickly with one or two well-thought-out, concrete proposals that we can discuss in detail and   begin thinking about how we might produce one or two dry runs to work out the kinks  I think   we’ll make much more and faster progress in getting an outcome that we are comfortable with if   we have something concrete in terms of a proposal to talk about  That’s all I have  Thank you,   Mr Chairman   "
8111,2007-03-20,PLOSSER,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  The economic picture in our region has   changed little since our last meeting  It seems as though I’ve used that phrase almost every   March 20-21, 2007 29 of 196    meeting for the past three meetings  Economic activity is expanding at a moderate pace in our   District  Business contacts expect that pace to continue in the coming months  According to our   March survey, manufacturing activity in our region remained flat, and we’ve seen little change in   this activity in the last six months  The general activity index actually fell from 06 in February   to 02 in March, which are both essentially the same and very close to zero  But there were some   positives to be read from the survey  First, both the new orders and shipment indexes improved   this month  Second, the diffusion index of capital expenditures, which reflects firms’ planned   spending six months from now, moved up to 25 percent—a level that is considerably above the   average level of 18 seen over the past two expansions  Third, other indexes of future activity   remain relatively strong  Finally, in response to a special survey question and ignoring merely   seasonal changes in activity, twice as many of our firms said that they expect their own   production to accelerate rather than to decelerate in the second quarter compared with the first   quarter—46 percent, compared with 23 percent  I take these as signs that our manufacturers see   the soft patch as temporary rather than more prolonged, and this is consistent with the anecdotal   evidence gathered in talking to the business contacts in our region  Thus, business sentiment   among our manufacturing firms appears to have changed little since our last meeting     There has been little change not only in overall activity but also in the pattern across   sectors  Housing continues to weaken  Area homebuilders that we surveyed in February   indicate that sales continue to decline, and high inventories continue to hold back construction   activity  Nonresidential real estate markets in the region remain firm, but construction has not   gained any appreciable strength  One of my contacts in a major bank sees continued strong loan   demand, however  Businesses that come to him for loans have strong balance sheets, their   profits remain good, and from his perspective that is supportive of continued business investment   March 20-21, 2007 30 of 196    going forward  This may be suggesting that business investment, which—as many of us have   been concerned about—has been weak in the past several months, may be on the verge of   rebounding  Labor markets in the region remain tight  Employment in my three states has   grown at a pace of 13 percent over the past three months ending in January, an acceleration from   the 08 percent pace over the past twelve months  The unemployment rate has held steady, and   employers continue to complain of difficulty finding both skilled and unskilled labor     On the inflation front, prices for industrial goods continue to move up, but retail price   increases have not been widespread  However, there are signs of increased pressures on wages   and salaries  Wages in low-skilled jobs in New Jersey and Pennsylvania have certainly increased   because of increases in state minimum wages, yet the acceleration in wages appears to be more   widespread  Employers in a number of industries have said they had to raise salaries much more   this year than they did last year in order to hire and retain workers in certain professional and   managerial occupations as well as high-skilled workers in a variety of jobs   In summary, business activity in the region continues to advance at a moderate pace—  I’m looking for other words to substitute for “moderate,” which gets old after a while  Our   business contacts expect this moderate pace to be maintained in coming months   Turning to the national economy, at the time of our last meeting, the data on real activity   had come in stronger than expected, and inflation, while still elevated, had moved down a bit    Since then, the data suggest perhaps a somewhat weaker near-term growth outlook and a   backsliding in my view in the progress on inflation  If these recent data are indicative of the   future, then we are in a much less comfortable position than we thought we were a few weeks   ago  I think there is still good reason to believe that the weakness we are seeing on the real side   of the economy remains confined to the effects of the housing correction and to a lesser extent of   March 20-21, 2007 31 of 196    the auto correction, which should moderate over the year, and that the fundamentals underlying   the economy remain somewhat strong  I think that labor markets will be considerably firmer   than in the Greenbook forecast and that the consumer sector will also hold up in part because of   that   It’s particularly difficult to infer trends from the data from this past January and   February  A sizable swing in temperatures from one of the warmest Januarys on record to one of   the coldest Februarys has led to large swings in both seasonal factors and the economic data   more broadly  So I think that we need to be a little more cautious than usual in trying to interpret   these volatile month-to-month numbers  That said, I must admit that the uncertainty surrounding   my own forecast that growth will soon return to trend has increased since our last meeting  The   recent decline in new orders over the past several months suggests that the weakness we’ve seen   in business investment in the fourth quarter may linger a little longer than expected, despite   healthy business balance sheets and positive investment and business sentiment  Although in my   view the reassessment of risk in the subprime mortgage market suggests that this market is   working as it should, the overall weakening in credit conditions in the mortgage market increases   uncertainty as to whether the housing correction will be contained or whether it will spill over   into other sectors of the economy  Thus, although I’m not really ready to abandon my forecast, I   do think my uncertainty of that forecast has increased somewhat   At the same time, I’m less convinced that inflation is moderating and that we’re making   sufficient progress toward price stability  Perhaps I really should say that I am more concerned   that we are not  The twelve-month change in the core CPI was 27 percent, and the three-month   change has reaccelerated  I find the upward trend in core inflation over the past year, from 2 to   2¾ percent, troubling  I take some comfort in the fact that inflation expectations have moved   March 20-21, 2007 32 of 196    down somewhat  Even ten-year expected inflation in our first-quarter Survey of Professional   Forecasters moved down to 235 percent from 25 percent  That’s a seismic event, [laughter]   given the stability of that number over the past eight years  However, these expectations   continue to lag, not lead, inflation  So I remain concerned with the inflation numbers that we are   in fact seeing  Thus, I find myself back to where I was this fall  A slowdown in real economic   activity, if sustained, would suggest a lower equilibrium real rate, but inflation remains elevated    At this point, I would allow for some implicit policy firming implied by a constant fed funds rate   unless we see stronger evidence of a declining economy  Thank you    I liked his red vest better    Thank you, Mr Chairman  As has already been suggested, I, too, favor   maintaining the fed funds rate today at 5¼ percent  As I said in the first go-round, the data we   have received since the last meeting have certainly increased my uncertainty about the forecast    But I think that the fundamentals haven’t changed that much  Besides, as we discussed   yesterday, the earlier signs of moderating inflation seem to have ebbed somewhat, and inflation   still seems to be higher than I’d like to see  So I am still concerned about the upside risk to   inflation  Although my uncertainty about real growth has grown somewhat, it does not   overcome my concern about inflation at this point  Thus, until I see more-convincing evidence   that the economic weakness we see cropping up here and there will be deeper and longer lived, I   would favor maintaining the current fed funds rate  The combination of temporarily slower   growth with a constant fed funds rate, in my view, does represent a modest firming of policy,   which I think will have desirable effects both on inflation and on our credibility  Cutting rates at   this time, it seems to me, is inappropriate as it’s unlikely to have a significant effect on the   weakness in real output or investment in the short run in that the absolute levels of long-term real   rates remain relatively low  Moreover, a cut in the rates is likely to signal to the markets that we   are much less concerned about inflation than we previously indicated and that we are willing to   forgo our inflation objective in search of modest increases in real growth  I simply don’t believe   that we can fine-tune with such precision, and we shouldn’t encourage the markets to believe that   we can do so  Such a move might also have undesirable consequences for our reputation and   March 20-21, 2007 85 of 196    credibility  It also might put us on a downward path that we may find hard to resist and thus put   our inflation objectives at risk  In other words, before we take a step to cut rates, we need to   have a much clearer picture of where we’re going, and I think we don’t have that yet  However,   if the data evolve so as to suggest that the slowdown is going to worsen, the FOMC clearly   would need to allow the fed funds rate to fall with equilibrium real rates but only to a level and at   a pace that are consistent with making progress on our goal of price stability  Nevertheless, now   is not the time for that   Turning to language, regarding the new alternative B that you gave us yesterday, I’m   actually pretty happy with most of that language  I think section 2 does a very good job, and I’m   fairly comfortable with the language in section 3  As I’ve said before, although I am skeptical   about inflation pressures moderating on their own, I cannot bring myself to endorse the language   of potential, of capacity utilization  My reading of empirical evidence is that it casts serious   doubt on the usefulness of such measures to forecast inflation  I don’t like the idea of   perpetuating in the marketplace a belief that it might be useful because in the long run it can   damage our own credibility  But you’ve heard me say that before, and I won’t belabor that point   any further  The final section on the balance of risks is the most significant part of this   statement, and I have a couple of points to make there  Frankly, I’m pretty happy with the way   the new version reads  I think it represents a slight recognition that the economy has weakened,   without being very explicit about it; it’s more of an implicit acknowledgement  So I could live   with the language as it is proposed     President Hoenig suggested that he would like “firming”  I guess I’m a little torn  I’m   sympathetic with that point of view; but as I suggested, if in fact the real rate is falling, by our   holding the rate constant we are actually making a slight firming of policy  I’m not sure the   March 20-21, 2007 86 of 196    markets fully understand that subtlety—of either that language or that view of policy—but I   think it might be helpful to communicate it at some point, which is back to the communication   issue  So, frankly, I’m pretty happy with leaving the fed funds rate as it is, and I could live with   the language in alternative B as it is    Just a moment  I think I’m fine with that  I like your suggestion for   changing it that way  This speaks volumes about our next topic of discussion of communications   and how we convey more about what we think rather than being confined to the structure of this   statement  I’d also like to pick up on another comment that you made  I spoke before President   Stern, but I think that President Stern’s suggestion to replace sentence 2 in section 3 with sentence 2   in section 3 of alternative C would be a big improvement  Since you alluded to that suggestion and   said that nobody came to support it, I just want to add my support to that suggestion    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’d also like to lend my voice to the vote of   thanks to the staff on what I thought was an excellent set of memos  I think the staff did an   outstanding job in summarizing a lot of the nuances and the details that are involved   Perhaps it comes as no surprise that I’m in favor of defining the Committee’s price   objective numerically and announcing that goal to the public  I believe that specifying our long-  run price stability objective numerically would focus our policy discussions and help anchor   expectations  By reducing the public’s uncertainty about our goal, long-run expectations would   become less responsive to changes in short-run inflation  This should help enhance monetary   policy’s flexibility to respond to economic shocks as we may deem appropriate  Thus, rather   than being unduly constraining, I believe it would actually add to our flexibility  In this way, it’s   March 20-21, 2007 133 of 196    consistent with the other goals of monetary policy and increases monetary policy effectiveness    It would also increase social welfare to the extent that it helps us avoid time-inconsistent policy,   since we know welfare under commitment generally exceeds welfare under discretion when   agents are forward looking  Thus, I believe a numerical goal would be a long-run anchor to our   monetary policy and help coordinate our own discussions of what appropriate policy might be   Now, as Vince laid out the questions, we have to make a number of decisions in making   that numerical goal operational  I feel more strongly about some aspects of the design than about   others, and many of the choices are interrelated  For example, a long horizon should mean a   tighter control range  A long horizon makes the choice between headline and core less   important  A long horizon makes the choice of core in fact less compelling  I think that any   proposals will have their pros and cons  As I said, I’m not necessarily wedded to all of the   particulars, but I will make a proposal  But let me emphatically stress that what is more   important than the specifics is that we agree on a numerical objective and a horizon for its   achievement   Regarding which price index, I prefer the headline CPI even though it’s likely to be   harder to control and forecast in the short run than the core  Many foreign central banks with   experience have tended to move toward the headline CPI number, indicating that it can in fact   work  The headline CPI is a measure that’s more understood by the public, so the   communication arguments are important here  Unlike the PCE, as has been mentioned a couple   of times, or the GDP deflator, the CPI is not revised, which helps us in assessing our   accountability in reaching our goal  I also prefer headline to core for our goal because I don’t   want to convey the idea that we are insensitive to the wider array of prices that influence   behavior—particularly because, as Governor Mishkin indicated, the stochastic processes or   March 20-21, 2007 134 of 196    properties of individual elements of the CPI may change over time  If we started defining a   subset of prices, we could find ourselves in trouble  I think we would also have the opportunity   to use the core in our communications when explaining why we might or might not react with   policy to a temporary blip in headline inflation  I view focusing on headline and using the core   for other purposes as a means of enhancing our communication efforts  Again, this practice is   similar to the practices of other central banks that announce their inflation goals  Of course, I   think it’s going to be terribly important for us to consider how we will respond to and   communicate about the inevitable misses from our target     Regarding a point goal or range, I strongly favor announcing a point goal  In reality,   there is a range around this point that reflects the precision with which we policymakers think we   can control inflation, and this control range will differ depending on the inflation measure used   and the time horizon selected  However, I’m reluctant to announce a range as part of our   inflation goal because I think it would be very difficult to ensure that the public would not   interpret it as a range over which we are indifferent  So for the headline CPI, I would specify   and announce a target of 1 percent  That’s consistent with our goal of price stability and the   estimated measurement bias of the CPI of being something slightly less than 1 percent  I picked   1 percent because I take seriously our mandate for price stability  Since I do not believe that   there is any long-run tradeoff between inflation and employment, we have no reason not to seek   and meet that goal over a reasonable period  I recognize that some may feel that a 1 percent   target is too low as the risk of deflation or zero bound restrictions on nominal interest rates might   call for a greater cushion  I understand those arguments, and they are certainly plausible  But   for various reasons, some articulated by people around this table, I’m less concerned about our   March 20-21, 2007 135 of 196    ability or the economy’s ability to deal with those issues, both of deflation and zero bounds  But   I accept that some people may have more concern about it than I do   Regarding time horizons, I feel strongly that we should specify a time horizon by which   we think we can achieve our target so that we can be held accountable for meeting or missing a   goal  Since I favor using the headline CPI, which is a little more difficult to control, more   volatile, than a core measure, I think a two-year horizon would be appropriate and, indeed,   achievable given the typical shocks that hit the economy and the volatility of the CPI  For   example, for the past ten years, the standard deviation of the monthly twenty-four-month CPI   headline inflation rate has been about 05 percent  I could also make the case that initially we   may want to consider a slightly longer horizon, especially if we choose a number like 1 percent   and given that we are currently well above 2 percent  Specifying a longer horizon at first may   provide markets with more opportunity to adjust to the new regime and mitigate some of the   transition costs  As we converge to our target, we might be able to shorten the horizon  I much   prefer that idea to adjusting the goal  I think the goal ought to be the goal, and we use the   horizon to give us some flexibility, depending not only on initial conditions but also perhaps in   future discussions on the nature of the shocks that may cause us to do that  I don’t like the idea   of not picking an optimal target simply because we’re not there yet  I think that’s not the right   strategy     There remains the issue of how we treat deviations from our goal—that is, whether we let   bygones be bygones or whether, for example, when inflation has been above our target for a   year, we must get it below our target for a year  Our chosen inflation goal will imply a price-  level path with that goal  We need to decide whether or not we will permit permanent deviations   from that price-level path  Deviations from the price-level path occur when inflation deviates   March 20-21, 2007 136 of 196    from our goal  If inflation increases above our goal for a time, then we would need to bring   inflation below our goal to return to the price-level path that was consistent with our initially   announced inflation goal  Similarly, if inflation moved below our goal, we would need to have a   period of above-target inflation to return to the price path  Alternatively, the Committee might   decide to accept permanent deviations from the price path and choose to implement policy only   to return to the inflation level  I would prefer the former as a price-level path because it prevents   base drift, and I suspect that we will, on average, more likely be above the target than below, and   the ensuing gradual erosion of purchasing power will be higher than we might have anticipated    In either case, I think it’s important, regardless of which way we decide, that we make that   choice consciously and weigh the costs and benefits of it and decide which regime we want to be   in   I do think it’s critical that the FOMC members reach a consensus, or at least a decision,   on the goals and the definition of price stability and essentially not dispute those in public  I   don’t think members need to agree on the model of the economy or the channel through which   monetary policy affects the economy  Indeed, given the state of economic science, the   differences in the models and the channels can actually aid in policy formation  However, the   point of announcing a numerical definition of price stability is to anchor expectations and   improve our accountability  Without agreement on that definition, the benefits of such an   announcement would be critically diminished  The Committee may want to periodically review   the definition of particulars such as the horizon as it gains experience operating under this   structure, but I think it’s very important that we reach a consensus on our announced goal    While I have offered my own choices on the particulars, I believe that they really are of   secondary importance to our public commitment to an objective     March 20-21, 2007 137 of 196    As far as the trial run is concerned, I strongly favor having a trial run for producing a   forecast narrative in May, and I agree with the discussion last time in that I like the idea of doing   it four times a year  I also like the idea of incorporating a forecast narrative into the minutes,   which gives participants the opportunity to comment on the draft narrative  This is not the only   way to proceed, but I think that it is a good first step and that refinements can follow  As I   mentioned earlier, our discussion this morning highlighted the real need for us to have a way of   communicating our policy views more effectively and outside the narrow confines of the policy   statements as they are currently constructed     Regarding the narrative itself, I have two comments  First, I suggest adding the assumed   policy path as a variable in the forecast  Participants are asked to assume appropriate monetary   policy, and conditioning on policy paths that can differ across participants embeds differences in   participants’ preferences over outcomes as well as differences across their models  If we are   thinking about the forecast as a communication device that enhances the transparency of our   policymaking process, then we want to convey something about the reaction function that is   likely to arise out of our Committee’s decisionmaking process  Aggregated information, such as   the range and central tendency of the fed funds rate in the fourth quarter of each of the three   years of the forecast, as we do with the unemployment rate, might be useful without holding the   Committee to any particular path  I think the idea of conveying information regarding the   uncertainty of the forecast is also important so that the public does not place too much emphasis   on point forecasts or narrow ranges  Moreover, uncertainty is clearly larger than the range of the   point forecasts of the Committee, and yet I’m not sure, as has been mentioned already, that using   the forecast standard errors out of the FRB/US model is the best solution since they are not   consistent with the forecast that was generated by the Committee  We might, for example, even   March 20-21, 2007 138 of 196    consider asking Committee members when they submit their forecasts to submit their own range   of uncertainty at the four-quarter horizons and then use those estimates to create something like a   fan chart  In any case, I’m looking forward to a trial run in May  Thank you, Mr Chairman   "
8133,2007-05-09,PLOSSER,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I just want to follow up a bit on the tail end of   the conversation with President Poole about residential investment  One of the big changes in your   forecast was the additional markdown of pushing the recovery in residential investment out further   and sustaining a more negative effect on your forecast  My sense is that had a fairly significant   impact going forward  I am curious as to what extent that outcome was really model driven in that   your actual estimation of the fundamentals changed, or was it more judgmental?  If it resulted from   the fundamentals that were predicted by the model, what were the pieces of evidence that were   May 9, 2007 17 of 130    driving that change, or was it just a judgmental thing that is saying it will take longer?  Can you   elaborate a little on where that came from?    Is the overhang measured as the absolute number of unsold homes or the   ratio of unsold homes to current monthly sales?      Then what drives the demand for new homes?  If it is an inventory-sales   ratio, you were also making some implicit statement about the forecast of demand    Thank you, Mr Chairman  The near-term outlook for the Third District   is moderate growth going forward  The major source of the strength in the District continues to   be employment growth, and nonresidential construction is fairly stable and modestly healthy    However, manufacturing continues to be sluggish and residential construction weak   Job growth has picked up considerably in our District, having grown at 09 percent at an   annual rate in the past few months  Unemployment rates have fallen in the region, and the labor   market in Pennsylvania in particular has been especially strong  To get a better handle on labor   market conditions, in our last business outlook survey we asked a panel of firms whether they   had experienced problems filling jobs in the past three months because applicants didn’t have   sufficient qualifications  Remarkably, more than two-thirds of our firms said that they had   trouble with this and that the percentage has been growing since we first started asking the   question three years ago   The strength in the regional labor markets is reflected in the rebound in our staff’s   indexes of leading indicators of economic activity in the three states in our District, especially in   Pennsylvania, where the index is predicting stronger growth over the remaining three quarters of   the year  An area of stability in our region’s economy has been the ongoing modest strength in   nonresidential construction  The growth in this sector has recently been largely in   noncommercial construction—hospitals, education buildings, and so forth  However, general   commercial vacancy rates in Philadelphia have been falling steadily, and the absorption rate in   Center City is nearly at a record high  With regard to manufacturing, growth is stalled    May 9, 2007 42 of 130    According to our April manufacturing survey, our general activity index is close to zero, or just   mildly positive, as it has been since late last year  Both new orders and shipments are close to   zero, as they were  Further, in April the index of future capital expenditures was down   somewhat and below the averages that we have been seeing in most expansions  The only bright   spot was the significant bump-up in our future activity index, which signaled that more-robust   activity is anticipated by our survey participants  It also comes as no surprise that residential   construction remains weak in the District, and housing permits have continued to decline as the   value of residential construction contracts has as well  Also, there seems to be little or no   appreciation in house prices  On the inflation front in the District, prices paid and prices   received by manufacturers have moderated a bit  Further, retailers are reporting very little   change in prices over the past few months  In summary, the Third District is growing slowly,   and our staff projection is for modest growth going forward  Labor market fundamentals appear   strong, but we have yet to see any sign of the pickup in manufacturing that some of the national   numbers indicate   On the national level, since the last meeting I have actually become a bit more   comfortable with the economic situation  While I say that I am more comfortable, that’s a   relative not an absolute statement  The most recent month’s readings on core inflation were   welcome, but I think that caution and vigilance are still the order of the day  Indeed, the   Greenbook authors, as we’ve noted, seem to have been revising their forecast of core inflation   upward slightly over the past several months rather than downward, and that to me is a bit   disturbing, even if the numbers don’t change a whole lot     News that has made me more comfortable with the projection of a somewhat quicker   return to something closer to trend growth in the second half of the year is the recent strength in   May 9, 2007 43 of 130    durable goods orders and the ISM numbers, which are indicating that manufacturing has picked   up  Further, recent strength in manufacturing was broadly based, and the output of business   equipment was strong  Along this dimension, I am in agreement with the latest forecast of the   Board staff  However, these reports represent only one month of data, as people have said, and   although they are consistent with a modest bounceback in the second quarter, there is still   substantial uncertainty  I hope that, in the coming months, those data will be reinforced as new   data come in; but, again, at this point that is only wishful thinking  I would add, though, that my   business contacts, particularly in the financial sector, continue to report to me that business loans   are strong, C&I loans are strong, demand is strong for loans, and balance sheets and firms still   look good  So they see things as looking good from their perspective, but that positive news is   not really showing up in some of these other numbers, at least as yet  So I’m a bit puzzled by   that  Furthermore, job growth and personal income growth appear to be on solid footing, and I   find myself increasingly puzzled by the weakness in the labor market as portrayed by the   Greenbook forecast  The strength in personal income, along with a rebound in asset markets,   leads me to view consumption as somewhat healthier going forward than the Greenbook sees it    Those circumstances, coupled with the more positive news on investment to which I just alluded,   lead me to view closer-to-trend growth as the best forecast and, therefore, to have a little more   optimism in my outlook for the second half of the year and into ’08  That is reflected in the   forecast that I submitted   That said, I realize there are significant risks to this return to trend growth  The biggest   risk remains housing  The extreme fluctuations in weather over the past four to five months have   made discerning trends a lot more difficult, and I’m not sure exactly how much seasonal   adjustment factors are bouncing the numbers around and making it harder to disentangle effects    May 9, 2007 44 of 130    Inventories of housing, as we have talked about, remain extremely high, and there is very little   signal of a pickup in demand, at least as yet  However, I’m a little skeptical that this sector will   continue to subtract a full percentage point of real growth from the forecast, as the Greenbook   suggests  I’m a little more optimistic than that  I remain optimistic in part because I think real   mortgage rates remain relatively low  I see strong income growth continuing, and I am   increasingly less concerned, actually, about the spillover from subprime markets  So I can   envision housing demand strengthening a bit more than is implied in the Greenbook, and that   leads to less of a subtraction going forward   On the inflation front, I’m a bit less worried than last time but far from sanguine  The   last core PCE inflation number was obviously very encouraging at something close to zero, but,   again, we have to be very careful in extrapolating out one month’s data  As I said before, the   Greenbook authors seem to be inching up their forecast of core inflation or at least pushing the   decline out further into the future, and that concerns me a bit  I believe inflation is still too high    Inflation expectations are stable, but they are too high as well, and we need to bring that rate   down  Thus, we need to be vigilant here and continue with a somewhat restrictive policy   In regard to my forecast, I’m not going to say much  I just assure you that, without   collusion, President Lacker’s view of the forecast and how it evolves is very similar to mine  So   rather than repeat what he said, I will just let his comments largely speak for mine  I have a   slightly faster return to trend growth, partly because my productivity estimates are somewhat   higher  I thought Janet Yellen’s comments about her productivity analysis were quite thoughtful,   and I appreciate them  The optimal monetary policy, or at least my preferred path for monetary   policy, might include some tightening if trend growth returns more quickly than we had   May 9, 2007 45 of 130    indicated  But, indeed, my forecast for core PCE was actually down to 17 percent by 2009  I’ll   stop there  Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  As I listen to the comments around the table, I   am of two minds  One, and I have said this before, maybe we ought to be in the business of   changing the statement a lot more frequently to get out of some of our traps of time-series language    Two, having said that, though, I think, as I indicated earlier, that alternative B is the correct one    We ought to hold the fed funds rate where it is  We are about in the right place for now  There is   some question mark going forward in terms of how things evolve and where we want to be, but for   now I am certainly comfortable where we are  If growth returns to trend more rapidly than the   Greenbook projects, then we might ask ourselves other questions; but I don’t think we’re there yet    Acknowledging Governor Kohn’s comments, I have to confess that I think that Bill’s comments—  indeed, taken off Vince’s—are appropriate  We need to align ourselves here better in terms of   May 9, 2007 91 of 130    where we’re going and what we’re doing  As we get closer, articulating more precisely where we   are, at least among ourselves, becomes even more critical  Aligning our objectives with market   expectations and figuring out how we get those things into alignment is a critical task that we face,   and I just would like to reinforce that   In terms of wording, I could live perfectly well with alternative B as written  I have a lot of   sympathy for President Stern’s statements  I would like to simplify our statements about inflation    In fact, if people are troubled by the notion of uncertainty, I would go so far as to stop after   “inflation pressure seemed likely to moderate over time”  I recognize that is probably not the   consensus view  As for the rest, I kind of liked the Chairman’s suggestion—I think it was his—on   some of the language in section 2  In some ways, if we don’t want to convey much to the markets   at this point, changing as little as possible seems to make sense, and I would be supportive of that    In fact, we could take the March statement in section 2 and leave it exactly as it is except to take out   “to continue”  But the Chairman’s suggestion about mixed signals would be fine with me, too  So   I’m pretty flexible at this point  The real nut to crack will be coming up over the next quarter or   two, when we will face some more difficult choices, I believe  So I’ll end with that    I understand the concern about the fed funds rate assumption, how we   interpret that, and what we ought to do  I have two suggestions  One, I still believe that it ought   to be part of the practice  I’ve expressed that view before  Two, at least for internal purposes,   for this next dry run it would be helpful to get that information on funds rate assumptions back in   the write-up so that, as we think about how this works, we will have those data to look at and to   discuss at least in the context of what it looks like and how it might shape what we’re doing  I   know that Vince gave us some indication of what people actually used when they submitted it    I’d just make a suggestion that in the next go-round the information be included for internal   purposes just to see how it shapes our discussion     Fine  "
8156,2007-06-27,PLOSSER,"  I wasn’t sure I heard correctly  What was the average ratio of   wealth to disposable income over the ’90s roughly?      Thank you, Mr Chairman  Since our last meeting, the news in the   Third District economy has been mixed but, on balance, slightly more positive than the   previous report  The District continues to grow at a moderate pace, and we expect that pace   to continue  The bright spot since our last meeting is a rebound in regional manufacturing   activity, which had been flat for the past six months  In June, the Philadelphia Business   Outlook Survey index of current activity rose sharply—18 percentage points—from a level   of 42  This is the highest level it has obtained since April 2005  The index of new orders   also showed a sizable jump, and capital spending plans firmed in the survey  Respondents   also expected further improvement in manufacturing activity over the coming months   Job growth in the region, however, was somewhat slower over the past two months   compared with earlier in the year, but we really didn’t expect much since payrolls seemed to   rise much more rapidly than expected during the first quarter  Year-to-date payroll growth   June 27-28, 2007 64 of 261    is running about 06 percent at an annual rate  That rate is slower than the national average   but is fairly typical of our region, where population growth is rather flat  Labor force   participation is rather flat as well  Unemployment rates, however, remain low in our three   states, and firms still report having difficulty finding both skilled and unskilled workers   It is no surprise, as everyone has said, that residential construction in our region   continues to decline and remains weak  The value of contracts for residential buildings has   fallen more than 30 percent in the region during the first five months of this year compared   with last year at this time—but that, we have to remember, was near the peak  Real estate   agents and homebuilders generally report slowing of sales in May  While the number of   existing homes for sale on the market has increased, average selling prices have not changed   much  I would characterize the nonresidential real estate market in the region as fairly firm,   although construction is not as strong as last year  Office vacancy rates continue to fall, and   in Center City Philadelphia, they dropped to 10 percent  They were about 17 percent just   around eighteen months ago  Real estate firms report that overall demand for industrial   space continues to be robust and that vacancy rates for this type of space are near record   lows in some markets  Rental rates continue to rise, particularly for warehouse space, and   rents are at a record high in those areas  I take these reports as indications of continued   expansion in economic activity going forward   Interestingly enough regarding building, I had two observations from CEOs  One is   CEO of a building supply company that manufactures throughout the United States and has   sales of almost $10 billion  He said that, remarkably, even with what is going on with   homebuilding, his sales are holding up very, very strongly and they are doing very, very   well this year  Another CEO, whose company produces products mostly for residential   June 27-28, 2007 65 of 261    cabinetry and other types of things, one of the largest in the country, says that, while new   home sales for his work are way down, they have largely been offset by remodeling   activity—people have substituted remodeling for buying a new home   As long as I’m reporting anecdotes here, I will pass on one other anecdote, for what   it is worth, about trucking  I listened to President Fisher and President Poole talk about   volumes in trucking  Just as an observation, an executive who runs a trucking company   throughout the country told me that one thing that has happened in trucking is that, rather   than shipping boom boxes, they are shipping iPods  [Laughter]  That is true of a lot of   consumer goods  Instead of shipping large CRT screens, they now ship flat panel displays    So even while the volume of goods is being reduced, gasoline prices are high, and they are   laying off truckers and downsizing the volume, the value of what they are shipping has been   maintained pretty well  So he was noting a dynamic of value versus volume here, which I   thought was very interesting   On the inflation front in the District, prices for industrial goods continue to increase,   but retail price increases have not been widespread  However, many of our business   contacts continue to express concern over rising energy costs and food prices and the effect   on their businesses and the consumers  I interpret this to mean that they continue to be   puzzled by our focus on core inflation when they see that overall inflation is what affects the   consumer and their businesses, and they seem to doubt core inflation’s value as a policy   objective or a measure of underlying inflation  They may be wrong in that, but it tells me   that, if they continue to be confused by how we view core inflation and what we use it for,   we might need to improve our communication to the public about how we think about it and   why we focus on it   June 27-28, 2007 66 of 261    On the national level, I have become more comfortable with the economic situation   as the year has progressed  At our meeting in May, we were beginning to see some positive   signs regarding both real economic activity and inflation  Durable good orders were up,   allaying some concerns about the first quarter’s weakness in business investment  Improved   ISM numbers were signaling that the slowdown in manufacturing might be ending; and   although housing markets remained weak, there were limited signs of any significant   spillovers to other sectors  Labor markets remained firm  At that time there were signs that   core inflation might be moderating  As a consequence, I expressed hope that in the coming   months those data would be reinforced   Fortunately, from my perspective, those hopes have been largely realized  Coming   into this meeting, we have received more positive news on the economy, and I have become   somewhat more confident that the economy is on track to return to near-trend growth later   this year as the effect of the housing correction moderates, albeit very slowly  Indeed, data   received to date suggest that we will see a substantial rebound in real GDP growth this   quarter, as the Greenbook has noted  After several months of stagnation, manufacturing   activity seems to have picked up, and business fixed investment is moderately strengthened    Labor markets remain firm, and yet in recent quarters we have noted a seeming disconnect   between strong labor markets and weaker GDP growth  However, we now may be getting   some hints that this puzzle is more apparent than real, and I want to reinforce the point that   President Yellen made earlier in that I think two factors suggest this  First, from December   to May the household survey showed almost no employment growth whatsoever, whereas   the establishment survey showed 12 percent annual growth during that period  Second—  and again as President Yellen noted—the Business Employment Dynamics report came out    June 27-28, 2007 67 of 261    It was only for the third quarter of last year, but it showed about 155,000 fewer jobs created   in the third quarter than we thought  What is important about that report is that it arguably   does a better job of tracking the birth and death of firms in the data, and so there is some   reason to believe that, while this is suggestive, the payroll employment that we have been   seeing may not be as strong as perhaps we thought, and that may make some of this puzzle   less of a concern  Moreover, as President Yellen pointed out, it is also relevant for the   longer term because, if employment wasn’t as strong as we thought, productivity is going to   end up being higher than we thought, and it will help resolve some of that slowdown in   productivity  So I think there are various hints that that may be the direction that we are   headed   In my own forecast, I see slightly more underlying strength and so a somewhat faster   return to trend growth than the Greenbook does  The current stance of monetary policy is   maintained  I see strength in personal income, a strong balance sheet (as we saw earlier   today), strong equity markets, and a resiliency already shown by consumers despite the   lower home equity values and higher gasoline prices, suggesting that there is probably   slightly more momentum in consumer spending than suggested in the Greenbook  I am   modestly more optimistic about the labor market than the Greenbook—modestly, as I   anticipate less of a downturn in labor force participation rates than is built into that forecast    The rise in long-term interest rates reflects the market’s upgrading of its assessment of the   economy’s strength going forward  Indeed, as has been noted a couple of times, that uptick   in long-term interest rates has been, I won’t say a worldwide phenomenon, but certainly   widely spread in many countries around the world, which may be saying that global growth   is more stable, predictable, and positive than perhaps we thought     June 27-28, 2007 68 of 261    Now, this is not to say that I do not see risks around this growth forecast  Of course,   as everyone else does, I see housing as the biggest downside risk that we face  There is still   considerable uncertainty out there, and I do not want to underestimate the risk  Housing   inventories remain high, and I do not see any strong evidence of pickup in demand  Despite   the problems in subprime lending markets, however, I think the financial sector remains   healthy—healthier now than it was perhaps in the early ’90s with the previous housing   boom  I am more comfortable with the notion that there will be no spillovers into other   parts of the economy, and thus I have become more comfortable with forecasts of return-to-  trend growth in the second half of this year and into ’08   On the inflation front, higher energy prices have led to an acceleration of headline   inflation, but there has been some improvement in core inflation measures in recent months    The three-month growth rates in the core CPI and the core PCE have been decelerating   since February  Although these developments in inflation are encouraging, I remain   cautious about extrapolating too much from recent data  During this cycle we have seen   periods of deceleration reversed a couple of months later  Indeed, the Greenbook expects   that much of the favorable readings on core PCE inflation will prove transitory  So I remain   concerned that our core inflation rates may not continue their recent drift down  I would   also caution that headline inflation, as I noted earlier, has remained stubbornly high  Thus,   in approaching my forecast, I have assumed that the appropriate policy path was one that   would return the economy to steady-state growth and to my inflation target by the end of the   forecast period   Given my outlook on the underlying strength of the economy and an inflation goal   of 15 percent for the PCE, it should not be surprising that my forecast incorporates a   June 27-28, 2007 69 of 261    slightly tighter policy path than the Greenbook does  In particular, in my forecast the federal   funds rate rises 50 basis points, to 575 percent, by early ’08  As progress is made on   bringing down inflation starting in the second half of ’08, the fed funds rate moves down,   ending at about 5 percent by the end of 2009  This policy path reflects my view that, unless   we take further action by additional firming or an announcement or both that commits us to   an inflation goal that is lower than the market currently expects, which seems to be about   25 percent, I believe it will be difficult to sustain an inflation rate that is in keeping with my   view of price stability  I believe this can be accomplished with relatively little effect on real   growth in 2008  My assumption in the model with which I’m working is that, once we   begin to raise rates, the markets will quickly recognize our commitment to lower inflation   and expectations will move down accordingly, mitigating the real output effects of this   modest tightening  The movement down in expectations could be expedited by the   Committee’s explicitly announcing the target  This view of expectations formation is more   heavily weighted to forward-looking elements than to distributed-lag elements of past   inflation  By the way, I want to applaud the staff for their work on inflation dynamics  I   thought it was an excellent piece of work  I found the discussion very helpful and a step in   the right direction, both conceptually and empirically   In any event, the bottom line for my forecast is that I anticipate that the economy   will grow just below trend of 3 percent in 2008 and at trend of 3 percent in 2009, and we   achieve an inflation goal of 15 percent by the end of the period  Of course, this forecast is   based on my desired inflation objective, which may not be representative of other members   of the Committee  If there were a common objective that differed from my own view, then   my presumed appropriate policy path might be different  Given this observation and the   June 27-28, 2007 70 of 261    lack of an agreed-upon goal, I think we need to be concerned about how the public will   interpret these forecasts, but I will save my thoughts on that for the next go-round    Thank you, Mr Chairman  As people said before, I, too, am in   favor of keeping the fed funds rate at 5¼ percent  The economy does seem to be   rebounding in the second quarter  The lingering uncertainty over housing suggests that   now is not the right time to take more-aggressive action  I am in agreement with that    However, the most current readings on core inflation, while they have been good—just to   June 27-28, 2007 107 of 261    reiterate the point—I, too, believe there is a lot of evidence that it may be transitory, and   we have to be very careful about the fact that headline inflation has not been very   cooperative recently  Inflation expectations remain somewhat high from my perspective,   and based on our previous discussions, that is a worry for me  I do tend to favor our   announcing an inflation target  I am not yet convinced that we will see inflation   expectations where they need to be to achieve my goal by the end of 2009   If we look at the projection narratives prepared by the Committee members, we   see that a majority believe that the flat fed funds rate will get us to a PCE core inflation of   2 percent or slightly less by 2009  If my own goal were 2 percent, I might be more   comfortable with a flat fed funds rate going forward  In fact, even the Greenbook   suggests that there is a model where that could happen  The bottom line is that I think we   can’t avoid the elephant in the room  How can we sensibly talk about the forecast and   appropriate policy choices, either in real time, as we do today, or prospectively, when we   can’t articulate or agree upon what our objective is?  In the absence of agreeing on a   numerical long-run inflation objective, we, as individual members, face increasingly   difficult choices in arriving at an appropriate policy stance in any given meeting and even   greater difficulty conveying our Committee’s decision to the public in an informative and   transparent manner   Individuals could be advocating different policy paths either because they have   different models of the economy or different inflation goals or both  At a minimum, I   believe it would help our internal deliberations—and it would certainly help mine—if the   causes of these differences in our projections were more transparent  If we are thinking   about our forecast as a communication device, this would seem to even be more   June 27-28, 2007 108 of 261    imperative  That brings me to language  I think the language in the revised alternative B   is incredibly well crafted and it tries to get around the problem that we are facing in   dealing with what we meant by “elevated” and how we think about this going forward    Citing growth over the past two quarters as having been moderate is a step in the right   direction because it encourages the public and the markets to look through shorter-run,   transitory movements  Similarly, we need to be looking through transitory movements in   inflation as well  As several of you have pointed out in your comments on the proposed   statement language before the meeting and as Vince pointed out in our last FOMC   meeting, how we characterize the inflation outlook in our statements going forward is   becoming increasingly an issue since we have not agreed on what our objective is   I have two related concerns  The first is that, in eliminating “elevated,” we run   the risk of signaling to the market that we are satisfied with the current rate of inflation,   even though we haven’t communicated what that means  Are we looking forward twelve   months?  Two years?  Three years?  Are we looking backward at the past three months or   the past twelve months?  Are we basing our judgment on forecasts of the next twelve   months?  Are we concerned only about the core PCE, or are we concerned about headline   PCE or some version of the CPI that is relevant to our concept of inflation?  As I said   yesterday, my concern is that there is considerable confusion in the marketplace about   why we focus on core and what it means to us and how we communicate that  Internally,   we are not clear on these issues, so how do we expect the public to divine our meaning   when we are not willing to do it internally?  In essence, I think there will be a great deal   of speculation, even with this language, about what we mean  Will the market conclude   June 27-28, 2007 109 of 261    what we think it should, or will we just accept whatever the market divines our intentions   to be?   My second concern about changing the language dramatically is that it might   convey to the market the notion that we are satisfied with inflation at current levels  We   may reveal through our projections next month that we actually are forecasting inflation   to be lower than it is today on a twelve-month basis  This was the point that President   Yellen made in her memo  It creates somewhat of a contradiction in how we describe our   current views  If the market infers that we are satisfied with a year-over-year core at   2 percent and then our forecasts come in at 18 or whatever, I think that will send some   confusing messages  On the other hand, releasing the forecast later may clarify for the   market what we are expecting and that may be the interpretation  But there is no way for   us to know what the outcome of that is without being more specific about what our   objectives are  Why do we want to create that much confusion and speculation in the   marketplace about what we mean?  I understand the desire to extricate ourselves from the   language about core inflation, but I think we are being unnecessarily confusing and   cryptic in our choice of language, and it will be difficult for us to control those   expectations given the way we are trying to manage the language   I am not going to get engaged in all the details of the wording  There must be   people who are better at that than I am  But I would just like to conclude by noting that,   even if we are successful—and, indeed, we may be with the current language in   alternative B—in wordsmithing ourselves around this delicate problem, it is not going to   go away  We will continue to grapple with it in this environment—and we are going to   continue to be pushed by the markets, by commentators, to clarify what in fact we mean    June 27-28, 2007 110 of 261    So the problem isn’t going to go away even if we sort of finesse our way around it in the   short run  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Mr Chairman?    Just a clarification  On section 3, can somebody just read that   complete section as now amended?    This is just one observation  The second sentence of section 3,   where we talk about capacity utilization, seems to be redundant once you put “inflation   pressures” in the first sentence    June 27-28, 2007 123 of 261     Thank you, Mr Chairman  As some others have said, I want to   applaud your leadership in laying out a proposal for how we think about this  It’s important   to have a framework on the table for thinking about where we want to be  I would add that   generally I agree with almost everything you said  I think it’s a good way forward  I view   this as a step, not the end game  It’s part of a process in which we evaluate what we’re   doing and how we do it  While I share in principle President Lacker’s concern about the   potential risks associated with doing this without agreeing on explicit objectives, I’m willing   to bear those risks because, since most people around this table know where I’d like to be in   terms of that, I think the risks are acceptable in the short run as a means of getting us to that   ultimate objective  I think that this will help us as a Committee become more comfortable   with being more transparent and more communicative and that the process in itself will help   us get to where I think we ought to be  So from that standpoint I’m very supportive of this   direction  I support going through with it under the guidelines and broad outline that you   described   As to some of the specific things that Governor Kohn mentioned and we talked   about, as I said, I want to proceed  I think four times a year is right  The details of the   Monetary Policy Report to the Congress are just a detail  We can work them out    Somebody is better at figuring that out than I am  I think that shouldn’t be considered a   stumbling block  I support moving to total inflation  As I said both yesterday and earlier   today, I think that’s important  I’m marginally indifferent between total PCE and total CPI    June 27-28, 2007 160 of 261    Earlier I had advocated the CPI  I’m still perhaps at the margin, but to me that’s not a big   issue one way or the other  I agree on the timing—the forecast and the projections ought to   be based on information available at the meeting, not subsequent information  In fact, that’s   very important in what we’re trying to communicate about our decisionmaking process  I’m   fairly happy with the way the staff has crafted the language  I think they have done a pretty   good job of capturing the sense  I’m rather indifferent about whether we incorporate it into   the minutes directly or we make it an addendum  Again, I think the markets and this group   can live with it either way, and people who read the minutes will come to understand and   accept it one way or another   The two points with which I have some trouble or perhaps a little disagreement with   Governor Kohn’s comments concern the optimal policy and whether we reveal what’s   implicit in the fed funds rate forecast going forward  I think that revealing a dispersion or   the varying underlying policy assumptions that people are using going forward helps on the   issue of uncertainty—that the world is uncertain and that our understanding of the way the   macroeconomy works is uncertain  By revealing that some underlying sets of assumptions   that we on the Committee are making to get to this set of objectives are different could   actually be very helpful in reinforcing the view that the future is uncertain  Therefore, rather   than locking us into some path, it may end up, in fact, opening up options to us in a way that   we might not have had before  So I think there’s actually potential information there that   we’re providing to the marketplace that may be valuable  Giving this area a bit more   thought might be worthwhile   The second point is one that President Pianalto just mentioned, and it just occurred   to me after she mentioned it  I realized that, if we submit these forecasts anonymously and   June 27-28, 2007 161 of 261    if they’re reported anonymously, even though the dispersions and so forth are reported in the   minutes, we as presidents and as Board members are out giving speeches all the time about   our outlook for the economy  At the end of the day, we are unlikely to stop giving out   information about what our views are  It’s a little like hiding it over here, but everybody is   out talking about what their view is anyway  So I’m not sure we are buying anything real by   being anonymous about our forecasts  I guess I’m in favor of revealing more rather than   less—revealing more about our uncertainties or our assumptions underlying the future path   of the fed funds rate and having that information convey some uncertainty—and being more   transparent, because we are anyway, about what our individual forecasts may have been in   talking about that outlook  Thank you    Yes  I just want to make one comment about the issue of the fed   funds path  Both Vice Chairman Geithner and Governor Warsh made a comment about   the markets  When I hear you talk about the markets, I am struck that it is a very narrow   definition of what the markets care about  You are looking at it in the context of what the   June 27-28, 2007 186 of 261    financial markets care about is only what the funds rate is—what our path is going to be    I think that is much too narrow a way to think about what we are trying to do here  To   say that they don’t care about inflation and that they care only about the funds rate is a   slippery slope  Whether it is just a financial adviser who is worried about inflation   planning for his clients or people who are investing long term and trying to make   decisions about housing or other things, I think it does go back to inflation  It is not just   about what the markets think the fed funds rate is going to be  In that regard—I am going   to go out on a limb a bit here—to the extent that longer-term decisions or the prices of   longer-term assets, such as longer-term bonds, move frequently with short-run funds rate   decisions—sometimes more, sometimes less—that really tells us something about what   they are expecting the path to be in the future  They are trying to infer something about   our future path from one decision  To the extent that we can provide some more certainty   or shape to that path as it relates to our inflation objectives or our inflation ranges that we   want to talk about, we are going to change that dynamic between short and long rates in a   way that will remove some of that uncertainty and some of that speculation about what   the path is going to be, even though we can at the same time convey some uncertainty   about our individual perspectives about that  So I think we want to be careful not to   become too focused on what tomorrow’s market response will be and what they care   about because I think it goes beyond just that  I just wanted to share that with the group    Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I, too, am relatively new to this   process of watching the sausage being made  I have to confess up front that I’m a bit   schizophrenic about this because I’m really of two minds in terms of the direction I think   about, and I’m persuadable either way  Part of me, as Jeff said, has argued that maybe the   forecasting exercise is going to take some pressure off all the nuances and the time we spend   on the statement  As Governor Kroszner mentioned, no matter how soon we get the minutes   June 27-28, 2007 215 of 261    out, it’s going to be tough to do that  So I’m sympathetic to that argument  My view is that   the minutes really provide the nuance of what goes on in the Committee, and I think that’s   incredibly important  The only thing I worry about in terms of the statement is that it can’t   provide that nuance and it gets so much attention in the marketplace so immediately so that   part of me says either we want to enrich the statement and get rid of some of the inertia   that’s in it, and make it longer or just make it shorter  So a part of me says that maybe what   we really ought to say in the statement is just section 1 and section 4 and let the nuance of   how we got there and what our views are be elaborated in the minutes  So a part of me says   that it would be a simplification that tells the markets what we did and how we view the   assessment of risk as we look at the economy, but it doesn’t try to tell them all of the details   of what went on  We let the minutes do that  I can live with the statement with way it is,   but I think there might be some advantages in simplifying it so that we don’t spend so much   time arguing over the nuances of the rationales and other things  Besides that, we’d get   capacity utilization out of there if possible and just go with the overall assessment of the   risk, and then let the minutes speak for themselves in terms of the nuances of the discussion   On the governance question, I agree with everybody else  I think that it has been   implicitly a statement of the Committee  The Committee ought to vote on it  If you took   sections 2 and 3 out, there would be a lot less wordsmithing and a lot less worrying about   whether the words were exactly right and what each of us might have meant or preferred to   say  So it might even make it easier to have a Committee vote on that, and they’d have to   worry about fewer things  Those are just some thoughts  "
8180,2007-08-07,PLOSSER,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Since our last meeting, the news in the Third   District has been generally positive  Economic activity continues to expand in the tri-state area but   at a less rapid pace than at our previous meeting  Our Business Outlook Survey indicates that the   District’s manufacturing output continued to expand in July, although at a somewhat slower pace   than in June  The June measure, you may recall, was more than 18 in our Business Outlook Survey,   the highest level that it had been since April 2005  In July the index dropped to a little over 9,   although it was still significantly positive  Shipments of new orders increased in July, and the   outlook for manufacturers’ own capital spending plans remains positive and is at a level typical of   an expansion  Firms in our survey generally see improvements in their businesses coming in the   second half of the year  Residential construction, however, continues to be very weak in the region,   but we have not seen, at least according to OFHEO indexes, any absolute price declines in our area    This is confirmed by our business contacts, who report that they have not seen steep or broad-based   declines in house prices, except for properties along the Jersey shore, where the boom was most   prevalent  At our last meeting I characterized the nonresidential investment market as firm, and that   characterization continues today  Office vacancy rates in the Philadelphia region remain very low   and declining, and rents in office and warehouse spaces remain at a record high  Although reports   on retail sales in our region have been mixed, sales appear to have improved somewhat in late June   and early July, especially at higher-end retail establishments     August 7, 2007 43 of 136     Bank lending has continued to advance but at a more moderate pace than at the time of our   last meeting  Our banking and other business contacts indicate that banks have money to lend to   customers with good credit ratings, and so I don’t get the sense that area businesses are facing a   credit crunch of the normal type  Banks are comfortable with their lending standards and do not   expect to make any big changes along this dimension in the foreseeable future  For the most part   our banks were not in the subprime business and obviously don’t intend to start now, [laughter] and   thus they have not seen an appreciable deterioration in their balance sheets or in those of the   businesses to which they lend—their customers  Clearly, there is nervousness, but as yet there seem   to be few consequences for the real economy   June employment growth in the region was below trend, but the region’s unemployment rate   remains relatively low  Our staff expects employment to continue to grow at a moderate pace going   forward and expects the region’s unemployment rate perhaps to rise modestly by the second quarter   of next year  Yet businesses continue to report tight labor markets  One very large builder, who is   headquartered in our area and who builds mostly high-end homes, has actually reported that he   cannot finish a number of homes that he has under contract and that buyers are waiting to move   into  He cannot find labor  Because of the crackdown on illegal immigrants, who do a lot of the   landscaping, a lot of roofing work, and all the labor that goes into finishing these homes, he cannot   hire these workers, and so he actually has to put off closing deals because he cannot find workers to   complete the homes   On the inflation front in the District, employment costs in the Northeast are increasing at   about the same pace as in the nation  Area manufacturers continue to report higher production   costs, but there is relatively little evidence of pass-through of those higher costs to customers as they   see it  Consumer prices are growing more slowly in the region than in the nation  So in summary,   August 7, 2007 44 of 136    the Third District economy continues to expand at a moderate pace  While there is nervousness   caused by the recent volatility in the financial markets, businesses do not yet see that affecting their   current growth or prospects for future growth  Business contacts as well as the Philadelphia staff   expect this moderate pace of expansion to be continued in the coming months   At the national level, the news has been mixed  On the positive side, employment and   income growth remain solid  Manufacturing output continues to improve, and core inflation and   inflation expectations remain contained, although both remain higher than I would like to see in the   long run  On the negative side, news on business fixed investment and housing has been   disappointing  After encouraging signs of stabilization early in the year, the sales of both new and   existing homes have continued to decline  Sales of homes declined 66 percent in June and almost 8   percent in the second quarter  At the time of our last meeting, I expressed the view that I was   getting hopeful that economy was on track to return to near-trend growth later this year  Setting   aside the issue that our perception of long-term trend growth in real GDP may need reassessment in   light of the benchmark revisions, as we’ve been discussing—and I’ll return to this point in a   moment—the recent data on housing are suggestive of a weaker third quarter and perhaps fourth   quarter as well  Though I think the underlying steady-state demand for housing is lower than the   pace of housing demand before we saw the downturn begin, which implies that much of the   adjustment in housing supply is part of a healthy adjustment to a new equilibrium, the stock of   unsold homes continues to cause a drag on residential investment  I also think that there is some   risk of temporary weakness in business fixed investment going forward simply because of increased   uncertainty  So the return to trend growth, which I think will happen within the forecast period,   may be delayed by a few quarters and may not get under way solidly until late in the first half of   next year  You know the old saying  “If you can’t forecast well, forecast often”  [Laughter]   August 7, 2007 45 of 136    The biggest economic news headlines since our last meeting have focused on the volatility   of the financial markets and the repricing of risk  I am inclined to put minimal weight on the current   financial conditions for a slowdown in the pace of economic activity going forward  Although risk   spreads have widened in the past three weeks or so, the cost of capital for high quality borrowers   has hardly changed and remains relatively low by historical standards  This suggests to me that   what we are seeing in the marketplace—at least right now but which could change, as we’ve all   noted—is a change in the relative price of various measures of types of risk  The cost of capital for   some borrowers is increased, but demand for business investments that originate from large   corporations with good credit ratings has not changed and is not likely to be adversely affected very   much in the repricing of risk, if that’s what this represents  This news was reinforced to me by my   conversations with area bankers, as I mentioned earlier, who say that they have plenty of money to   lend to good credit risks  There is no evidence of a general credit crunch from their point of view    My general view regarding the limited nature of the credit repricing is reinforced by the fact that   default rates on auto loans, credit cards, and other types of consumer debt instruments have not   changed much, suggesting that the spillover effects, at least to date, have not been very measurable    Thus, I think that the decline in the subprime market is primarily a result of lax underwriting  Those   lenders are now paying the price, but we must be very careful not to act or appear to act in a way   that supports bad bets or lax underwriting standards without more widespread evidence of systemic   problems affecting the real economy   Let me now turn to what I think is a more fundamental factor for gauging the strength of the   economy going forward and, therefore, the appropriate stance for monetary policy  In the most   recent Greenbook, the Board staff revised down the rate of growth of structural productivity more or   less in line with the reduction in real GDP growth, as we have been discussing  It is certainly   August 7, 2007 46 of 136    reasonable to think that this new information about the pace of real GDP growth during the past   three years contains information about the rate of growth of structural productivity going forward    But that is not an infallible signal  In my thinking about how monetary policy needs to be set,   distinguishing temporary decreases in the rate of growth of productivity from permanent decreases   is a critical piece of the puzzle  A transitory decrease would not affect the steady-state equilibrium   real rate to my mind  But a permanent decrease would imply a lower steady-state equilibrium real   rate and, thus, a lower natural rate for the federal funds rate  If the equilibrium real rate is lower,   holding the fed funds rate constant, of course, would imply an implicit tightening of monetary   policy     I am still grappling with the implications of these benchmark revisions for future   productivity growth  At this point in my forecast, I’m assuming that the revisions imply a   rebenchmarking of the growth rate of structural productivity, but that rebenchmarking or that   lowering of the trend rate of growth of real GDP is not enough so that core inflation can decelerate   toward price stability in the next two or three years or so under a constant fed funds rate  But the   reduction in the growth rate of structural productivity does feed through to a somewhat looser   required path of the fed funds rate through 2008 to 2009  In my forecast, appropriate policy has the   fed funds rate rising to 5½ percent in the first quarter of ’08, holding steady there for two or three   quarters, and then gradually drifting down toward a more neutral rate consistent with lower inflation   expectations and lower trend output growth  With this path of the fed funds rate, I expect the   economy to return to near potential real GDP growth in the first or the second quarter of 2008  I   expect the housing correction to continue through the first half of 2008, but the drag lessens over the   year  I expect the core inflation rate to be somewhat higher in the second half of the year than in the   first half, but I expect the economy by 2009 to grow near its potential growth rate, which I now   August 7, 2007 47 of 136    assume to be 28 percent, about 02 percent lower than I had last time, with the unemployment rate   close to its natural rate of 5 percent and core inflation at about 15 percent   I have two other brief comments I’d like to make about our forecasting exercise and some   information I think is relevant  We continue to focus on the PCE price index, and I have some   objections to that  I continue to believe that the CPI is a better measure, if for no other reasons than   that it is more familiar to the public and that it is not revised  We were lucky this time in the GDP   revisions that the PCE price index was not revised very much, and I think we run the risk that   focusing too heavily on a measure that does get revised can cause us some difficulty  I also have   some concern about the empirical ability of core PCE to actually be a very good predictor of   headline PCE inflation at the end of the day  So I am still struggling with our choice of the index   there  The other item that I would like to emphasize—and it was driven home to me in a meeting   with some reporters in the not-too-distant past—is that I do believe that moving toward measures of   uncertainty that include some fan charts would be useful  I was hesitant at first about that in part   because getting appropriate measures of uncertainty that are internally consistent across all our   forecasts and all our models would be very difficult  Yet some, what I would view as very   sophisticated, journalists continue to confuse the issue of the range of our forecasts and our central   tendencies with the issue of uncertainty or certainty  They do not understand that our central   tendency is an agreement about what our point forecast is but that it may reveal very little or nothing   about the degree of uncertainty in our forecasts  So I think it is very important that we quantify that   in some way to be clearer and to eliminate some of that confusion  I’ll stop there  Thank you, Mr   Chairman     Right    Well, I am encouraged that that is going to be the case      That is fine  This point was driven home to me by somebody who I   thought was fairly sophisticated  He saw the central tendency narrow and thought that therefore we   were more certain about what our forecasts were    No, they are not    They could be negatively correlated actually  Just because our point   forecasts converge does not mean that our uncertainty about that forecast is decreased    It just means that there is more agreement    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I am certainly comfortable with maintaining   the fed funds rate where it is, so I’m supportive of that  I think the real key here is language    What are we trying to convey to the markets?  How far can we go, acknowledging what many   people share—a sense of some increased risk—without creating another set of concerns in the   marketplace?  So the language is the tricky piece here  I’ve waffled a bit in my feelings about   this  I’m inclined to be about where I think Bill Poole and Janet Yellen are—moving the   downside risks into paragraph 2 as opposed to putting them in the assessment of risk  I would be   supportive of that tone  Also, in response to some of Jeff’s comments in his earlier memo on   this, I actually prefer the language of repricing of risk rather than of tightening credit conditions   simply because it emphasizes that this is partly a relative price adjustment that is going on  But I   don’t want to take a strong stand on that   Only one other word concerns me, and I’d like to raise the issue here  In paragraph 3,   which nobody has talked about yet, in the first sentence, “readings on core inflation have been   relatively subdued in recent months” is a change in the language from our previous statement,   which says, “improved modestly recent months”  I worry a little about the word “subdued”   because I think it becomes very close to making some kind of normative judgment about the   level of inflation that we are happy with  I’m uncomfortable about that particular change in the   language because it, again, might imply some normative statement without the Committee’s   agreeing on what we view as being subdued or not  So I’d like to suggest that we change that   back to what it was before because, if we want to convey stability and some continuity here,   there are places to change, there are places not to change, and I would rather change fewer words   August 7, 2007 97 of 136    than more words going forward  That would be the only additional suggestion I would make    Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
8198,2007-08-10,PLOSSER,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I have a question  Bill suggested that, at some   point—perhaps during the day, maybe tomorrow, or sometime—as we continue to introduce   liquidity, the funds rate actually may fall quite precipitously to 1 or 2 percent for a short period  I’m   fully supportive of the statement, and like President Lacker, I like the fact that the stress in the   statement is that our goal is to keep the fed funds rate near its target and that we haven’t changed the   target  But I do have a question about the unwinding of this  That is, what are the criteria for when   we stop introducing liquidity?  How do we decide when to do that, and is there any thought as to   how we unwind the liquidity that we may have injected during the process?  What is the idea about   the process of how that unwinding might occur?  Thank you   August 10, 2007 9 of 12     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I just would ask that you read the statement   one more time for us before we close  "
8213,2007-08-16,PLOSSER,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I have two questions  First, in regard to   Governor Kohn’s and Vice Chairman Geithner’s comments about making this liquidity available to   these banks at a lower price, it’s still a bit of a crap shoot as to what they will end up using these   funds for  We have no particular control over that, and whether they will use those funds to help   stabilize those securities about which we are most concerned will be up to them  So it seems to me   it’s a bit of wishing and hoping  It may work  It may work through the signaling device, if nothing   else, to signal our commitment  That brings me to the second question I have, which is how the   markets will respond to this  Will they respond in a way that basically says that we will end up   August 16, 2007 16 of 37    having to lower the fed funds rate at our next meeting or at some point?  To what degree are we now   or might we be locked into a fed funds rate decision?  I’d like somebody’s observations on how the   market might react to that  Thank you, Mr Chairman    I have no way to receive a secure copy    Thank you  "
8235,2007-09-18,PLOSSER,"  I appreciate your comments on this last point, but I think that the fact that   the fed funds rate has been trading so low for so long is problematic  Certainly around August 9,   when we started the interventions, that’s all understandable  But the Committee made it very clear   at that time that it wasn’t changing the targeted funds rate, and yet for the past month it has been   essentially below  So in my mind that has raised three questions  One is a technical question about   our ability to actually target the fed funds rate using the procedures that we have in place  We   continue to quote a price target and try to control it using quantities  I still believe it would be a lot   easier just to set the price target and buy and sell  That’s an operational question that I think is on   the table for another day  It also raised the question to me as I watched it going on why the Desk   did not choose to intervene more frequently during the day to be more aggressive when they saw   that their forecast for the day’s balances was not accurate  There is nothing that says you can’t go   back in during the day to help rectify some of that, and I’d like some explanation as to why we   didn’t do that or whether that’s an option  The third question is actually a more serious one because   September 18, 2007 8 of 188    it combines a technical issue and a philosophical one  I think allowing the fed funds rate to trade so   low for so long away from our target really creates a credibility problem for this Committee  It puts   us in an awkward position now because, in effect, it hasn’t gone unnoticed by the investment   community  Some have called it a “stealth” rate cut that is already in effect  Some have said that   the Fed has already cut the fed funds rate, and it puts the Committee’s decision today in a somewhat   awkward position because people look back and say, “Well, they have already done it”  So I think   it is important that we think about mechanisms and ways to ensure—at least going forward—that, if   the Committee has a target, we can be successful in achieving it  So I’d just like some further   enlightenment there, if I could    But you see the rate    Thank you, Mr Chairman  My first question was very much related to   what Charlie just asked  First let me say that I appreciate the tour of the sausage factory  It was   a little bloody, but I want to commend you in that I think it was a fairly balanced way of looking   at what the risks are in various places  But I want to come back to my interpretation of what you   just said  Your answer to President Evans sounded to me as though a significant part of your   downward revision, particularly to consumption, was the factor of consumer sentiment, which is   looming rather large in this forecast  While you’ve revised down some other things, it sounded   as though you were saying that consumer sentiment is a particularly sensitive and difficult thing   to forecast  We know it is very volatile; it can change rapidly  But I heard you say that in the   forecast you have implicitly reduced consumer spending and held it low for a period of time into   the forecast  Am I misinterpreting your answer there?    That would be a significant change from the standpoint of how you are   viewing the forecast    My impression from studies and empirical work is that consumer   sentiment usually is a much bigger coincident indicator than it is a forecasting tool    Yes  That’s really my point    I appreciate that clarification  The other question I had has more to do   with the NAIRU and employment issues  I wish you could clarify a bit for me—the downward   shift in employment numbers for the past three months is for me significant  At the same time, I   say to myself, “Well, you know, now it is about at the level that the Board has been forecasting   all along”  In your previous discussions you have talked about participation rates and other   things, and now the level seems to be about where you had been predicting it all along  Yet you   still interpret that as bad news from the economy point of view  So I would like a little   September 18, 2007 29 of 188    discussion of that  The second thing is that, at the same time, you have lowered the NAIRU  I   am a bit puzzled and would like a little discussion about the interaction between those two   things  Finally—and you may have said this, but I may have missed it—if you had not changed   the NAIRU, would inflation have been 01 or 02 percentage point higher over the forecast   period?  Or what would it have been?  I just need a little clarification    Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  On balance, the data and the anecdotal   evidence in our District say that the economy continues to expand and advance moderately, but the   pace may have slowed somewhat since June  Readings of our Business Outlook Survey of regional   manufacturing have been very volatile this summer  You may recall that in June, our activity index   rose to 18, which was its highest value since April 2005  The index fell to 9 in July and to 0 in   August  The September survey, conducted during the first two weeks of September, remains   confidential and will not be announced to the public until this Thursday at noon—so these are really   new data  In fact, we finalized it only yesterday  It indicates some recovery in general activity, new   September 18, 2007 44 of 188    orders, and shipments  The general activity index rose from 0 to 109  New orders and shipments   indexes also improved  Another piece of good news from the manufacturers’ capital spending plans   is that they remain positive, with the index at a level typically seen during expansions  Plans to   increase capital spending were common among nearly all the major manufacturing sectors covered   by our survey  Consistent with this, our respondents generally see improvements in their business   activity coming over the next six months  In September we asked a special question about whether   the recent changes in the construction and financial sectors had any adverse effects on their business   or their business plans  About two-thirds of the respondents said there was no impact on their   orders or shipments  About 11 percent reported a substantial decline  Most of these firms were   housing-related industries  One was in auto parts, and one was in apparel  Similarly, three-quarters   of the respondents had no change in their capital spending plans, and only about 9 percent expected   to cut back substantially on their capital spending relative to plan over the rest of the year  My   reading of this is that the manufacturing sector in the region is holding up pretty well   In contrast, residential construction activity in the region continues to deteriorate, and we are   expecting to see declines in house prices  Earlier these declines were seen only at the Jersey Shore,   but now they seem to have spread a little more widely in the District  Interestingly enough,   homebuilders reported reducing prices to stimulate sales but with relatively little success  Several   contacts told us that they were more concerned about the negative effects on buyer psychology of   recent financial market developments than they were about the availability of mortgage financing    That our region has been largely less dependent on subprime lending than some other areas may be   part of the reason for that  Nevertheless, none of our contacts in the real estate industry were willing   to forecast when the demand for housing was going to pick up  Nonresidential construction has also   softened somewhat in our region, as indicated by the value of contracts, but that’s a very volatile   September 18, 2007 45 of 188    number  These data tend to be revised up; but the decline still is quite pronounced, and it bears   watching  At the same time, vacancy rates remain very low in the Philadelphia area, and so the   demand seems to be there, but the contracts are down for the moment   Employment growth over the three-state region ending in July remains below trend in New   Jersey and Delaware and kind of flat in Pennsylvania  Some firms continue to support what has   already been said—difficulty in finding qualified workers  One of our board members runs a   temporary employment agency that goes through tens of thousands of people every month  She   said that there has been an uptick in walk-in traffic of people applying for employment, particularly   skilled workers, but in fact, there has been no falloff whatsoever in the demand from firms looking   for these people  So she has seen no decline in demand for these workers, but she has seen a little   uptick in the supply coming through their office  Our three-state unemployment rate remains   relatively low and below that of the nation  Nonetheless, July unemployment rates in our three   states were a little higher than we saw earlier in this year   The inflation picture for the District has changed little since our last meeting  Wage   increases have been moderate  Several firms report large increases in benefit costs but not an   acceleration of those benefit costs  The prices of industrial goods are increasing, but retail price   increases haven’t been as widespread as they were earlier  In summary, our region’s inflation has   not accelerated  It hasn’t decelerated either     Economic activity in the Third District continues to expand, but its pace has perhaps slowed   somewhat  Our business contacts generally expect activity to remain slow but on an upward trend   and are more uncertain about the outlook than they were, but their plans seem to be in place  One   board member spent a great deal of time talking to a number of CEOs and CFOs about capital   spending plans, and it was funny  He said that they said, well, everybody thought there was going   September 18, 2007 46 of 188    to be a capital spending program reduction  They weren’t planning a reduction, but they knew   somebody else who was  It was very hard to find the person who was actually doing it, but   everybody thought that someone else was doing it  So it was a little anecdotal   The national economy looks more vulnerable to me than it did six weeks ago, but it would   be a mistake—and I think Dave Stockton did an excellent job of reminding us—to count out the   resiliency of the US economy at this early stage  I think there can be a tendency in the midst of   financial disruptions, uncertainty, and volatility to overestimate the amount of spillover that they   will exert on the broader economy  For example, the rate cuts after the stock market crash in 1987   were reversed fairly quickly  Unfortunately, we have very little hard data as yet to help us gauge the   potential size or persistence of the impact on real activity of the August turmoil, and early signs may   be fraught with noise and overreaction to headlines  So I think we have to be very careful     Of course, it is possible that disruptions will further restrain the already weak housing   market by reducing the supply of mortgage credit  Nonconforming mortgage rates, even to prime   borrowers, remain elevated, but conforming rates to prime borrowers are actually lower right now    Reduced lending in the alt-A and subprime market is not a surprise  It has been difficult to obtain   those loans since the early part of this year, and I think that is not a big change  The biggest   surprise, at least for me, is that the impact on the obtainability of mortgages to homebuyers of the   recent disruptions has been in the area of nonconforming jumbo mortgages  Yet the availability of   these mortgages and their rates are likely to settle back down more quickly to normal levels since   most of the people borrowing at the jumbo rates tend to be closer to prime borrowers than to   subprime  However, as banks take some action to bring some of these risky assets back onto their   balance sheets, we may look forward to further restraints on credit because they don’t want to push   their capital ratios any harder than they have, and so that may have a diminishing effect  But putting   September 18, 2007 47 of 188    aside any financial market effects, signs of stabilization in the housing markets that we saw early   this year just have not been sustained, as we all know  Home prices have decelerated and have been   falling in certain localities, and that’s likely to continue  Incoming data suggest that the downturn in   housing may be both more prolonged and somewhat deeper than certainly I had earlier anticipated    The question has been whether this decrease in housing wealth would spill over into consumer   spending, regardless of the source of the decrease in housing wealth  The argument has been that   the strength in the labor markets and the stock market gains would continue, and continued personal   income growth would buoy the consumer and mitigate those declines  I remind everybody that,   even though the market is down heavily in August, it is still up roughly 5 percent for the year  So it   wouldn’t be a tank unless something further happened   August nonfarm payroll surprisingly fell by 4,000 jobs in August, as we know  I wouldn’t   be too surprised to see this number revised up  Loss of government jobs concentrated in local   education took a very big hit, and this might be overstating the seasonal adjustment factors that are   going into this in the timing of the starts of the school year  Still, there was weaker private payroll   growth  There’s no question about that, and the revisions done in June and July were down   substantially  Thus, nonfarm payroll gains have averaged about 44,000 over the past three months,   whereas private payrolls have been a little more than 70,000 for the past three months, and that’s   weaker than we’ve seen during the rest of the year  There’s no question about that     On the positive side, business spending remains fairly solid, but our hard data are somewhat   stale and may be a little sketchy  Although not in the data yet, there’s some risk of temporary   weaknesses in business fixed investment going forward simply because of the increased uncertainty   inherent in financial market disruptions  So far most of the firms we’ve talked to, as I said earlier,   say that their capital spending plans remain in place, and only a few nonmanufacturing firms have   September 18, 2007 48 of 188    mentioned not canceling but just delaying them until the market has settled down  Risk premiums   have increased from abnormally low levels, which is probably beneficial  This has raised the cost   of capital for some firms; but for most firms, financing for capital spending remains available    Many banks say that they have lending available and that they will lend to good customers  There’s   not a problem  Indeed, most capital expenditures by businesses, in fact, are internally financed, and   so the turmoil in the credit markets may not have as much spillover on capital spending as we might   otherwise expect  So unless there’s a sharp decline in business sentiment, which could occur if the   financial market turbulence worsens, I don’t expect to see that much of a pullback in business   investment spending, except possibly in the very, very near term   On balance, I believe that within the forecast period we can see a return to trend growth,   which I still estimate at about 2¾ percent, somewhat higher than the Greenbook  I still think that’s   the most likely outcome, but I now expect that return to be delayed by a couple of quarters given   housing, and it won’t be under way until certainly late in 2008  I admit there’s still considerable   uncertainty surrounding that forecast, and I certainly see that there’s a possibility of particularly bad   outcomes, some of which the Greenbook scenarios have laid out  I also expect that some of the   indicators we receive over the next few months are likely to be weak, but not necessarily weaker   than many of us have already built into our new forecasts  Indeed, because of the financial markets   disruptions, the August data won’t be particularly helpful or useful in reading the trends in the   economy     I think it’s going to be crucially important for us to convey to the public that we are forward   looking, that we expect to see somewhat weaker data coming in, but that they may not necessitate a   further change either in our forecast or in our policy  Only when we accumulate sufficient new   information that causes our forecast to deviate from our already lowered projections do we want to   September 18, 2007 49 of 188    revise our forecast and perhaps our policy  I think this is a point that we need to make very clearly   to the public, if not in our statement, which we should try, then in the minutes and in our speeches   as we go out  I think it would be detrimental to our cause and to good policy if the public expected   us to react to each piece of incoming data   On the inflation side, I see that recent readings on core inflation have moderated  Headline   inflation remains quite elevated  I don’t think that we can afford to be sanguine  I continue to see   underlying inflation pressures, as has already been articulated  Long-range inflation expectations   have been stable, but I’m concerned as we go forward with potential rate cuts  I’m concerned about   their remaining stable, particularly when we may be lowering rates without being clear about what   our inflation goals are  Indeed, I think the current situation clearly shows the benefit of having an   explicit inflation goal  By anchoring those expectations, an explicit goal would mean less of a   tradeoff between our two goals and so might make this policy decision easier and even perhaps   more effective  Thus, while my forecast has built in some near-term policy easing partly to offset   the anticipation of tighter credit conditions, I believe that we might find ourselves in a position   sometime during ’08 in response to rising inflation of having to raise the fed funds rate back up  We   need to be particularly careful now with our communications regarding any policy action we take,   but I’ll save that discussion for the policy go-round  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  As many of you might imagine, I’ve struggled   mightily with this particular decision  My outlook for the economy has changed sufficiently for me   to support a cut in the fed funds rate at this meeting  My reasoning may be a little different from   that of some of you; nonetheless it leads to the same outcome  My view is in many ways similar to   that of President Evans—that economic growth has slowed, and it is likely to be somewhat slower   into 2008  Thus my view that the equilibrium real rate has declined and its forecast has declined   somewhat leads to my view that the funds rate needs to follow that real rate down  Also, given the   current behavior of inflation, I am more comfortable moving toward what I would consider to be a   more neutral rate   September 18, 2007 99 of 188    If we do cut the funds rate today, however, I believe that how we communicate that is far   more important than anything that we may do in a long time  This is particularly true since we have   not been particularly clear about our inflation goals  As I mentioned in my earlier comments, I’d be   much more comfortable with this if we had a numerical target, which would help anchor   expectations  I think we need to convey the idea that our policy, as many have said, is based on our   forecast for growth and inflation and that it is forward looking  That forecast has changed, and we   have lowered interest rates consistent with that revision  With that change in policy, we need to   have a balance-of-risks statement that is much more balanced in its assessment; moreover, we need   to convey to the market that we expect to see some weak data in future months but that those data to   a large degree are already built into our forecast  The weaker-than-expected data in the coming   months will not necessarily result in a new forecast  For example, I won’t be revising my forecast   just because the September employment report comes in weak  It’s only when we accumulate   sufficient evidence that the economy is veering from our new projected path that we would want to   revise our forecast and perhaps our policy, although I do want to remind everyone that revisions can   go both ways  We might be revising our growth forecast up if the evidence suggests that we’ve   been too pessimistic about housing or about bank credit availability or, as Dave Stockton   mentioned, about consumer sentiment  Similarly, we might find that we’ve been too optimistic   about inflation if inflation expectations rise  I think it is crucial that we try to convey these ideas to   the public, if not in the statement then at least in the minutes and our speeches going forward  Let   me note that our decision to produce our forecasts on a more frequent basis will be a major step   forward in actually trying to convey this type of information   I think it would be a mistake, as President Hoenig suggests, to set up expectations with our   language that the rate cut today is necessarily or even likely the start of a series of rate cuts  This   September 18, 2007 100 of 188    expectation could even undermine our action to the extent that it causes consumers and businesses   to postpone spending until they think we’re done and could give the impression that, with each new   piece of weak data, we’ll be lowering the funds rate further even though we have already   incorporated that into our forecast  This reasoning leads me to think that, if we’re going to cut rates   today, I would prefer to do 50 basis points, provided—and it’s a big proviso—that we work hard in   our statement to convey the idea that the action we are taking is based on something like balanced   risks  We have brought the rate to a level that we think is consistent with our new forecast and   consistent with our goals of inflation and output growth  In fact, we may even be on hold for a   while after this if things pan out according to what the Greenbook suggests  I think a 25 basis point   cut would risk setting up expectations for further cuts, which perhaps would be read as taking the   same strategy to lower rates as we took to raise them  I want to avoid that  I do realize there’s some   risk that a more aggressive action could actually reignite inflation expectations  Vice Chairman   Geithner made three good points about what the risks of a more aggressive action are  expectations   of inflation, fear in the marketplace that we see something they don’t and that the economy is   actually worse than they’re predicting, and the potential for fueling those people who think we are   bailing people out and thereby creating moral hazard  Those are risks  I don’t deny that  But I   think they are manageable, particularly if we mitigate them through our statement by saying that we   now think risks are balanced and conveying the forward-looking impressions that I have given   This brings me to language  Of the three alternatives in the Bluebook, obviously in terms of   rate cuts, alternative B is probably where I’d start, although I’m more inclined to have a more   balanced approach to risk in paragraph 4  In fact, something more like paragraph 4 in alternative D   would suit me better, but perhaps a simpler way would be to rewrite paragraph 4 as follows  This is   just a suggestion—it’s a little shorter  “With this action, the Committee judges that the downside   September 18, 2007 101 of 188    risks to economic growth are now roughly balanced by the upside risks to inflation  The Committee   will continue to monitor incoming economic information relative to the outlook and act as needed to   foster price stability and sustainable economic growth”  That is a little shorter and conveys the kind   of balance that I think is important  In some versions of the statement, we have had a little too much   of a temptation to promote the idea that we can fine-tune the economy, and I think that’s a   dangerous and slippery slope  With regard to the rationale, I’m happy with paragraph 3 on inflation    Indeed, I noticed that there was no capacity utilization in that statement, which pleases me no end    [Laughter]  You know, we have to take small victories when we can     I would like to see some changes to paragraph 2  In particular, I’d like us to say a little less   about the disruptions in the financial markets  I think this has the potential to confuse people—that   our move is being taken as a desire to bail out bad actors—and that could feed into moral hazard    We are moving because our outlook for the broader economy is weakening  The tightening of   credit conditions may have the potential to affect the real economy, and that’s why we are acting   preemptively  So I would again try to simplify paragraph 2, and I suggest the following language    “Economic growth was moderate during the first half of the year; but labor market strength has   moderated, and the housing correction appears to have intensified and may be exacerbated by the   tightening of credit conditions  Today’s action is intended to help forestall some of the potential   adverse effects of those events on the broader economy and to promote moderate growth over   time”  Finally, as I said earlier, I believe it will be very important to communicate, in the minutes   and perhaps our speeches going forward, that our forecast incorporates weak data in the near term   and, although we may individually have different views as to what that near term might look like,   that forecast has been incorporated in our funds rate assessment and we intend to alter our bias or   September 18, 2007 102 of 188    our policy only if our forecast changes appreciably in the months to come  Thank you, Mr   Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Actually, I do have some sympathy for this   proposal  I think it is very creative  But there are a lot more people around this table who know a   lot more details about this market, how it works, and how treasurers work than I do, and I will   September 18, 2007 157 of 188    certainly defer to their judgment  But I have a couple of points that I’d like to make  President   Hoenig made the point that really gives me a little pause as I absorb this  What I’m really worried   about is the law of unintended consequences, and I don’t know what they are right now  Many of   you around the table have raised some possibilities that this could exacerbate  I think President   Poole’s suggestion about creating a tension between large and small banks about who has access to   this could prove to be a problem  I also agree that it might be unusual, but it would be troubling if,   in fact, we ended up lending money in this facility going below the targeted funds rate, which would   be maybe unlikely but would complicate our lives in other dimensions as well   I also worry a bit as I look at the market—and this probably has more generally to do with   provisions of liquidity—that part of the problem here is price discovery  Who has the risk?  Where   are the risks, how much are they, and how do we price them?  I worry a bit, too, about the degree to   which providing liquidity shuts down or slows down the price-discovery process, which is   something that we really want to get done  I don’t know how to answer that question, but it’s one   that I just sort of struggle with in trying to think about whether we are hampering the process of   price discovery, by slowing it down and making it easier for people, or are we moving it along at a   faster rate  I don’t know the answer to that   The last point, I think, is more of a policy question  Again, President Hoenig, I think, made   it  If we view this as a temporary tool, which I think is fine, it is important that we lay out in our   own minds under what circumstances in the future we would decide whether or not to implement   this tool and how we decide  What criteria do we have?  We need something a little more objective   than just whenever we want to  I worry a bit that by failing to do so we will abandon some   expectations about how the market will react to this and when they might expect us to use it or not   September 18, 2007 158 of 188    Do I know what the consequences of that will be?  I don’t know  I’m struggling with those   kinds of questions, so having a little more time to think through some of these things would be very   helpful  Those are my comments  Thank you  "
8257,2007-10-30,PLOSSER,"  Thank you  I have two brief questions  One, in business investment,   particularly equipment and software, you have somewhat of a rebound in the early half of ’08,   and then it falls off again in the latter half of ’08  I didn’t quite understand  Given the way you   have the recovery in housing coming in the middle of ’08 and presumably some of the credit-  tightening cycle gradually diminishing, why is business investment falling off again in the latter   half of ’08?  The second question, just to get them both out on the table, is that you are predicting   that a 25 basis point unexpected boost to the fed funds rate would result in a fall in equities of   October 30-31, 2007 17 of 162    about 2 percent  Now, the papers I have read randomly about that suggest that such an estimate   is probably a bit on the high side  I just wonder where that number came from    I thought that was 53 percent for 100 basis points, right, which would be a   decline of a little over 1 percent, not 2      Sorry  I just read the wrong one    And the investment piece?    Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  There has been little change in the District   economic conditions since our September meeting  Except for housing, activity is expanding at   a modest pace, somewhat below trend  Our business contacts are cautious, generally expecting   slow growth to continue over the next quarter, but they remain fairly optimistic for business   conditions six to twelve months out  Payroll employment continues to expand at a slow pace in   our three states, which partially reflects slow population growth, and so the unemployment rate   remains slightly below that of the nation  Retail sales have generally held up, but there are   divergent views among retailers regarding holiday sales  High-end stores expect a very strong   finish to the year; lower-end merchants are more cautious  Housing construction and sales   continue to decline, but the pace of that decline is in line with the expectations at our last   meeting  The value of nonresidential building contracts has declined more sharply in our region   than in the nation as a whole  Nevertheless, I would characterize nonresidential real estate   October 30-31, 2007 24 of 162    markets as firm  That office vacancy rates are declining and commercial rents are rising suggests   a positive outlook for commercial construction going forward   According to our business outlook survey, manufacturing activity in the District has been   increasing at a modest pace for the past several months  The general index of economic activity   moved down slightly, from 109 in September to 69  Shipments and new orders also weakened   slightly  Staff analysis suggests that our manufacturing index, which precedes the release of   national industrial production numbers, provides useful information in forecasting monthly   manufacturing IP and total IP  That forecasting model is predicting a rise in both manufacturing   IP and total IP in October  About two-thirds of the District manufacturers and service-sector   firms we have polled said that recent changes in financial conditions have not prompted any   change in their capital spending plans, and the other firms are about evenly split as expecting a   slight decrease or a slight increase over the next six to twelve months compared with the past six   to twelve months  However, in speaking with my business contacts, I do hear a sense of   continuing caution among businesses in their capital spending plans  The manufacturers seem to   be a bit stronger than the service firms, perhaps reflecting a more robust export market, which   many of them are participating in  District bankers, in general, continue to express concern over   housing and mortgage lending but see commercial and industrial lending as fairly stable and   proceeding about as they had expected   There has been little change in the District’s inflation picture since our last meeting    Firms continue to report higher benefit costs, but other wage pressures have moderated  Our   manufacturers reported having to pay higher prices for many inputs, particularly energy-related   inputs and petroleum-based products as well as agricultural commodities  They have passed on   October 30-31, 2007 25 of 162    many of those increases in terms of higher prices to their consumers  While retailers report only   modest price increases for many products, food prices are generally higher   In summary, since our last meeting, there has been little change in the economic   conditions in the District or in the outlook for the region  Overall, business activity in the region   is advancing at a fairly modest pace, and most of our contacts expect that pace to continue for the   next quarter or so  But in general, firms in the District remain optimistic about business six to   twelve months from now   Turning to the nation, the economy appears less vulnerable to me than it did at the time of   our last meeting  Financial markets have improved somewhat, as Bill Dudley was telling us    Conditions are not back to normal yet in all segments of the market, but the markets that are still   under stress are the same ones that were under stress last month  Subprime and jumbo   mortgages and asset-backed commercial paper are the ones that still are struggling  Price   discovery still plagues many of these markets, and I suspect it will take some time before the   markets can sort things out and trading returns to normal  That does not mean that the ultimate   agreed-upon market prices for some of these assets will bear any resemblance to what they   looked like before August  Indeed, they probably won’t, but that’s not necessarily a bad sign or   a cause for concern; it may even be a healthy development  We haven’t seen disruption spread   to other asset classes for the most part, and the level of stress in financial markets seems to have   fallen even as volatility remains high  The spread of jumbo over conventional mortgage rates   remains elevated, reflecting some concern, I think, about the risk that expensive homes may face   greater price declines than other homes, but the premium is less than it was in September   Both investment-grade and non-investment-grade corporate bond issues have increased    Financial institutions have begun to write off some of their investments and take the losses  This   October 30-31, 2007 26 of 162    has weighed heavily on equity markets, but I view the write-downs as a necessary part of the   process toward stabilization in the markets  Earnings reports from nonfinancial firms have   actually been pretty favorable  I’m not saying that we are out of the woods yet, but in my view   the risks for a serious meltdown in financial markets have lessened somewhat since our last   meeting   The news on general economic activity has improved somewhat since our last meeting as   well  Indeed, some of the data have come in better than expected  Employment was revised up,   and retail sales data suggest that consumer spending remains resilient, despite the downturn in   housing  Like the Greenbook, my outlook for the economy has changed little since our last   meeting, when we acted preemptively and lowered rates to “forestall some of the potential   adverse effects of financial market disruptions and the expected intensification of the housing   correction on the broader economy”  Housing investment and sales continue to decline but about   as expected in our forecast  After all, the rapid reduction in subprime lending is exacerbating the   decline in housing demand and thus home sales, contributing to the slower recovery of that   sector  Other sectors of the economy have performed about as I expected, with little evidence as   yet of any major spillovers from housing  Oil prices have moved higher than expected since our   last meeting, as has been discussed, but it is unclear to me yet how permanent that increase will   be or how much of a drag it might be on activity  The oil price rise is likely to show through to   headline inflation in the coming months  Although core inflation measures have improved since   the beginning of the year, the rise in energy prices has the potential to put upward pressure on   core inflation  Thus, while inflation and inflationary expectations have been stable to date, I   suspect that inflation risks are now more to the upside than they were in September   October 30-31, 2007 27 of 162    The forecast is an important context for our policy, in my view  We have stressed in the   past year that we are data driven and respond to the evolution of our forecast  In general, like the   Greenbook, as I said, my forecast of the economy going forward is little changed from my   September view  I see that growth returns to trend, which I estimate to be about 27—a little   higher than the Greenbook—late in 2008 as the housing correction runs its course and the   financial market turbulence unwinds  Core PCE inflation remains slightly below 2 percent next   year and moderates toward my goal of 1½ percent by 2010  I built in a 25 basis point easing   sometime in early 2008 to bring the funds rate back down to a more neutral level, and in my   baseline forecast I assume a constant funds rate thereafter  That forecast, however, is contingent   on inflation and inflationary expectations remaining well behaved  Having said that, I repeat my   caution that inflationary pressures are somewhat elevated at this point, and we run the risk that   inflationary expectations may become unhinged if the markets suspect that we have lessened our   commitment to keep inflation contained  Thus, I don’t rule out the possibility that we may have   to reverse course and tighten policy sometime in 2008 or 2009 in order to achieve consistency   between my target rate of inflation of 1½ and inflationary expectations  Thank you, Mr   Chairman    We can’t help it if you have no predictive content  [Laughter]    Thank you, Mr Chairman  The last time we sat around this table, I and   many of you argued for what the markets described as a surprisingly aggressive 50 basis point   rate cut  At that time, the baseline Greenbook forecast was for 25 basis points, 25 in subsequent   meetings, and then flat thereafter  Our rationale was that we were trying to act preemptively,   trying to get ahead of the curve, to limit some of the potential spillover effects from what we   then believed to be a weakening housing market, perhaps a somewhat softer labor market, and   October 30-31, 2007 98 of 162    the financial turmoil  We also argued that higher-than-normal tail risk loomed out there, that it   was associated with the financial market meltdown, and that it warranted aggressive action to   help forestall the possibility of that  In the forecast that we submitted in September, and we all   submitted a forecast, the appropriate policy varied  Nine of us submitted appropriate policy as   being consistent with the Greenbook, which was 25, 25, and then constant  Of the remaining   eight, seven of us had a 50 basis point cut in September, which we did  Many of those, including   myself, had some further cuts to the funds rate but further out in the economy, more like in ’08,   later in ’08, and ’09, as we move toward more-stable inflation, expectations coming down, a   recovered economy, and so forth  I was certainly in that camp as well, and in fact, most people   ended up with a funds rate forecasted at either 4¼ or 4½ percent—little differences but not   much  In September, only two of us anticipated appropriate policy as dropping 75 basis points   before the end of ’07     Of course, we all have the luxury, fortunately, of changing our minds in response to data   and other things, and certainly all of us are doing our best to read the tea leaves of the economy,   both aggregate and within our regions, and that influences the color and texture that we put   around our forecast  We all work very hard at that, and I respect those efforts  But I think it is   important that, as a Committee, we enforce discipline and systematic behavior on ourselves as   our views evolve, particularly as those views influence policy choices  Without that discipline,   without that systematic behavior, I find it very difficult to figure out how I am going to   communicate to the public about what monetary policy is doing and why  It makes both our   commitment and our credibility, either to inflation or to employment growth, more difficult to   substantiate  It makes transparency in general more difficult  All of those things—commitment,   credibility, and transparency—are important elements of what contributes to a stable economic   October 30-31, 2007 99 of 162    environment  Now I have tried to impose that discipline about policy on myself by focusing on   the incoming data, trying to focus on how those data cause me to revise my outlook for the real   economy, not for tomorrow or next month particularly but for the coming quarters  After all, the   monetary policies we have just been talking about operate with somewhat of a lag  In that sense,   I think there has been a lot of discussion by myself and others around the table that we are data-  driven, that we are forecast-based in how we think about our policy choices, and that we try to   take a somewhat longer run view  I think that view is important to communicate to the public   I suspect that at the end of our last meeting—certainly I can speak for myself—many, if   not most, of us probably would not have anticipated that we would cut again at this meeting    Perhaps some of you did  Certainly, your appropriate policy paths in our forecast at the last   meeting didn’t suggest that  But we wouldn’t have anticipated cutting unless we thought that the   outlook for the economy had noticeably deteriorated  So what has really happened since the last   meeting?  Well, the collective forecasts that we submitted—in terms of risk assessments, ranges,   medians, and however you want to look at them—hardly budged  The Greenbook forecast didn’t   change very much  The economy generally had better-than-expected news on many fronts—not   hugely better but certainly the surprises were on average to the upside for most of us given our   forecast from last time  I thought we generally agreed that the risk of serious financial   meltdown, while perhaps it hadn’t vanished, had mitigated at least somewhat  As a consequence,   neither the Greenbook nor our collective FOMC forecasts moved very much  To the extent that   they did, they actually moved up a little   Based on that forecast and on the data that came in, I’m in a very troubled position in   figuring out how to justify in my mind additional rate cuts at this meeting  Had this meeting   been held two weeks ago, as President Poole suggested, before the market’s reaction to the write-  October 30-31, 2007 100 of 162    downs in some of the financial institutions, before the fairly dramatic flip-flop in the fed funds   rate futures market about the assessment of a future rate cut, I certainly would not have been in   favor of a rate cut at that time, and I suggest that each of you should ask yourself the question   that Bill did  Would I have chosen to cut rates at that time?  I certainly would have also resisted   the temptation, arising from those data and what has happened over the past two weeks, to be in   any great rush to think we needed to call a special meeting of the FOMC to consider additional   rate cuts  My attitude would have been that these financial markets are volatile and they are   bouncing around an awful lot, we understand that there are risks, but let’s wait and get the data   on the real economy and see how it is evolving and make appropriate decisions at the time    What worries me is that we run the risk of being whipsawed here by market expectations or by   the financial markets that are moving around in a very volatile way  That leaves me with some   concern that we may be putting ourselves in a position of either responding too much to these   volatile markets or being accused by markets of being bullied by the financial markets   So at this point, my take is to say that we are going to get a lot of data between now and   December  We are going to get two more employment reports, as we have discussed  We are   going to get some more information about retail sales and consumption  I would prefer to keep   my own approach to discipline-based policymaking by looking at the forecast and waiting for the   data to tell me whether my forecast deteriorated significantly  If it has, I will be the first to argue   for an additional rate cut in December if I think it is called for     Right now we have a difficult time justifying a decision  On what grounds are we going   to justify it, particularly in a more systematic fashion?  I think that creates problems for us  As   we have already been discussing, it is creating somewhat of a problem in the language of the   statement, and I will come back to that in a minute  But I also think that, without a very   October 30-31, 2007 101 of 162    articulate rationale in the data and in reasoning that supports a systematic approach to policy, we   run the risk of being capricious or arbitrary  I think we are in a situation, as Kevin Warsh said   yesterday and Tom Hoenig spoke about, when many of us view inflation risks as more fragile   perhaps than they have been recently, particularly more fragile in an environment in which we   are cutting rates  I think that we run the risk, more so now perhaps than in other times, that   inflation expectations might be at risk  I don’t want to raise those inflation expectations  They   are much harder to get down  You can’t act nimbly to deal with movements in expected   inflation     I also think we have to ask ourselves the question—and this ties into the balance of risks   issue—if we choose to cut today when our forecast hasn’t declined and suppose the data between   now and December look as they have for the past six weeks—kind of in line with what we   expected, not much different one way or another with nothing really falling out of bed or   booming—on what basis in that meeting would we choose or not choose to cut again?  At this   meeting we have had a hard time grappling with the criteria that we are using  If we are not very   explicit about those criteria, we could find ourselves in the same boat next time  I think this is   related to Tom’s point that, once we start on the path of making explicit what our expectations   are or what the market is going to be expecting us to do without having a firm basis for saying   we are doing this because of X or Y, we are going to find ourselves in an awkward position in   December   So I share Brian’s concern about the assessment of risk language in alternative A being   balanced when it seems to be out of touch with the way the Committee has described things    Again, I think that puts us in an awkward position of trying to balance those two things  So with   that, I appreciate the time, Mr Chairman  On net, I am troubled by a cut today  I would much   October 30-31, 2007 102 of 162    prefer to wait until December and to assess the data that come in  If a 50 basis point cut in   December is required, so be it; but I feel as though we would have a firmer basis then for making   that decision  Thank you    No, I am just saying that the communication of that rationale is tricky,   and I did say that people are making their best efforts to make their forecast  I explained my   view of how I discipline my forecast and how I discipline my policymaking      First quarter perhaps, but that was conditioned on inflation and   inflationary expectations remaining well behaved    Your speech is November 14?    It’s not important  I don’t have any comments  I just wanted to say that   I think the staff has done a great job and the subcommittee has done a great job  This is a very   important step forward for us, and I am strongly supportive of it  I want to thank Governor   Kohn, Janet Yellen, and the other members of the subcommittee for getting us here and you for   taking this step forward  I believe that, as we go through this time after time, it will be refined    We will stumble over a few things and the language is going to be tricky, but I just want to   commend the Committee for taking this step    But the Greenbook won’t be changed  This confuses me a bit  I wasn’t   quite clear—I thought I was, but I guess I wasn’t   "
8282,2007-12-06,PLOSSER,"  I do now  Too many buttons  I have a couple of questions and a couple   of comments that I’d like to put on the table and see if I can get to a greater comfort level here  I   certainly have no problem with the swap arrangement  I think that’s pretty straightforward  I   actually was kind of in the same camp as President Pianalto in thinking that one of the   straightforward ways to deal with some of this was to go ahead and lower the penalty rate at the   discount window  I still think that’s probably a good idea  I’m not sure we’ll entirely eliminate   stigma, but price can do remarkable things to stigma at times  So I think that’s an appropriate   tool we have   I do have two reservations  My first is a question about the TAF  I’m not quite clear   why we can’t do what we have done in the past and solve some of this year-end phenomenon   with just term repurchase agreements through open market operations  We did some of that in   the past  If I look at chart 6 that Bill Dudley circulated, it certainly seems to me that the biggest   single hunk of this problem is a year-end phenomenon, if you look at the futures markets  So I   don’t know why we don’t do what we can through open market operations and have some more   December 6, 2007 29 of 51    term RPs to help deal with this, much as we did in Y2K or in other periods in the past  So I’d   like some distinction there     Both of those tools, whether it be reducing the penalty rate or using open market   operations of a term nature, are tools that we already have at our disposal, and we can use them   in different ways as we see fit  I don’t have a problem with the term facility in principle  I am   more troubled, I think, than the staff is about the reaction of the markets to our putting this out   there  I think it will be seen as an emergency step—a panic, if you will—on the part of central   banks to do something about something  I’m not sure it will be interpreted entirely positively  It   may even be interpreted as our flailing about trying to do something about a particular year-end   problem  It would be particularly troubling, it seems to me, since the timing of this is that, if the   biggest hunk of this problem is year-end, we have time to do only one auction between now and   year-end as I heard it described, and if that doesn’t work—I think, Mr Chairman, you said this—  we could go into the RP market and do more if we had to make up more  So I have some doubts   about how this will be interpreted—whether it will be interpreted as our being smart and crafty   or as our being panicky and flying off the handle in a panic mode  I’m not sure why we can’t use   term RPs to solve some of this problem over year-end  I would be happier, I think, cutting the   discount rate and then going ahead and maybe putting the TAF out for public comment now  So   we could put this facility on a more permanent basis and have it on the shelf—put it out for   public comment, let the markets know that we are considering it, go through the whole process,   and then institute it later if we choose to do so without doing it in such a panicky problem-  solving mode  Those are my observations  Thank you    No  I guess the answer I hear is that this really is not about a term  It’s   about the Fed taking on different assets and different types of collateral  "
8304,2007-12-11,PLOSSER,"  Just a quick comment  I have talked to one of the large mortgage   insurance companies in some detail, and their view is that their pricing power actually is   improving—that their own ability to work their way out of this thing is getting better all the time   right now  Even though they are taking some very large hits in the near term, their outlook   actually has improved in recent months, partly because of this  This was just to reinforce that   point    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I have sort of a longer-run question that I’d   like to pose  I was looking at the alternative scenarios in the Greenbook, and one of the things that I   was looking at was the funds rate path that was described as the market-based forecast for the funds   rate  It drops almost 150 basis points, or 100-plus basis points, between now and the middle or end   of next year  One consequence of that, though, seems pretty benign—that there’s not much change   in the inflation forecast at least through 2009; it changes only about 01 percentage point—and there   are some positive effects on output, particularly in ’09  It appears, at least within this period, that   100 basis point rate cuts seemed to be pretty much free  So I guess my question to the staff is, Is   there a price to be paid for that, and if I run the forecast out beyond 2009, will any of those prices or   those consequences appear in the forecast for inflation?  If so, how long would I have to look before   I saw them in the model?     I appreciate that  That would be very helpful to put in some perspective   what tradeoff in the costs we might see  Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  There has been little change in the economic   conditions in our District since the October meeting  Except for housing activity, manufacturing   and other businesses are expanding at a modest pace, somewhat below trend  Our business contacts   are a little less optimistic about growth in the near term than they were earlier in the fall primarily   because of uncertainty surrounding the outlook rather than any immediate change in their business   activity  I’ll begin by reporting on what our contacts say about credit conditions  Business contacts   as well as our board of directors have told me that credit activity has changed very little    Creditworthy borrowers, as far as they were concerned, have had no problem accessing credit    Banks have reported some tightening of lending standards, but mostly that has occurred for real   estate developers and in residential mortgages  Some loan demand has dropped because of   businesses’ uncertainty about the future, as I suggested earlier  That is, businesses seem to be a bit   more cautious  But banks do not appear to be conserving capital  In fact, they’re actively seeking   good credits  To quote one of my directors, “The crunch on Wall Street has not hit Main Street”  A   couple of bankers I spoke to, one representing a very large regional bank and another a very large   community bank, expressed the view that they were actively seeking to regain market share from   the larger banks because they did not engage in the same off-balance-sheet financing of riskier debt   that the large banks did and so they were not facing either capital or funding constraints  Some   December 11, 2007 52 of 138    bankers acknowledge that consumer credit quality seems to have deteriorated slightly, but they   reminded me that this was from very good levels  So the defaults and delinquencies remain well   within historical norms   Turning to the economy, payroll employment continues to expand at a somewhat slow pace   in our three states, yet the unemployment rate is still 04 percentage point below that of the nation    Retail sales picked up in November  Moreover, retailers generally said they met their expectations   for the Thanksgiving weekend  However, these sales seem to have been boosted by fairly heavy   discounting, according to them; and despite the reasonable showing to date, retailers are wary and   uncertain for the holiday season  Housing construction and sales continue to decline, but the pace of   that decline is in line with the expectations at the time of our last meeting  Nonresidential real estate   markets remain firm in our District  Office vacancy rates continue to decline, and commercial rents   are rising  New contracts for commercial real estate have declined, however; but with the decline in   vacancy rates and with rising rents, the outlook of many developers is not as negative as the current   level of spending would suggest  According to our Business Outlook Survey, manufacturing   activity in the District has been increasing at a modest pace for the past few months  The index of   general activity moved up slightly, to 82 in November from 68 in October  This is actually about   the same average level that the outlook survey has maintained over the past two years  Shipments   and new orders moved up slightly  However, optimism regarding the outlook over the next six   months declined  It’s a common theme of many of our business contacts that their businesses have   not changed much, but they seem to be reacting to the steady stream of negative news, and it is   affecting their outlook  Indeed, the CEOs of several very large industrial firms in our District report   business to be very strong both domestically and overseas, and the CEOs have seen little effect of   the turmoil on Wall Street on their ability to obtain credit   December 11, 2007 53 of 138    Now, last time I said that there had been little change in the District’s inflation picture    However, we have started to see evidence of increased price pressures  The Business Outlook   Survey’s prices-paid index has risen considerably since the beginning of the year and has doubled   since August  The index for prices received has also more than doubled since August, rising   sharply in both October and November  Also retailers have noted spreading price increases for   imported goods, and a wide range of industries are reporting increases in energy and transportation   costs  Firms continue to report higher health care costs, and at the same time, wages continue to be   moderate, they say   In summary, economic conditions have changed little since our last meeting  The business   activity in the region is advancing at a moderate pace  Credit constraints experienced by the large   money center banks have not appreciably affected the banks in our District or their lending   practices  In general, firms in the District remain cautiously optimistic about their businesses six   months from now but not so much as they were last month  Price pressures have increased on the   input side related to energy and commodity costs; more generally, many firms are now prepared to   raise their own prices and are looking to do so in the near future, and the financial conditions of our   banks remain good   Turning to the nation, financial market conditions, especially those associated with the big   money center banks, have clearly deteriorated in recent weeks  Until the end of October, spreads   were gradually declining  It seems that the potential for a serious meltdown was monotonically   declining  However, since early November, as we all pointed to, a number of financial institutions,   subprime mortgages, jumbo mortgages, asset-backed commercial paper, below-investment-grade   bonds, and LIBOR have experienced increased spreads  Volatility has risen as well  Clearly, risk   premiums have risen for certain classes of assets, and investors have fresh concerns about the way   December 11, 2007 54 of 138    credit market conditions are evolving  Overall, the recent financial developments suggest that it will   take longer before conditions are “back to normal” in all segments of the market  As I’ve said   before, I continue to believe that price discovery still plagues many of these markets  It now looks   as though it will take a little longer before these markets can sort things out and return to normal    Financial institutions continue to write off some of the investments and take losses  I view these   write-downs as a necessary and healthy part of the process toward stabilization  Infusions of capital   in some financial institutions, I think, are encouraging and helpful to the process  This does not   mean that the ultimate agreed-upon market prices for some of these assets will bear any   resemblance to what they did before August  Indeed, they probably won’t  But that’s not   necessarily a bad sign, nor is it a cause for concern  In general, it may be a very healthy   development   The news on economic activity has softened somewhat since our last meeting  Among the   negatives, of course, the housing market and residential investment continue to decline    Foreclosures have continued to grow at unprecedented rates  Firms have become a little more   cautious in their investment plans  Consumer spending has softened slightly, and real disposable   personal income declined in October  Oil prices have moved higher  On the brighter side so far,   there is some evidence of spillovers from the financial and housing markets to the broader economy,   but I believe it is limited  Net exports and business fixed investment have been surprises on the   upside  Finally, and most important, the labor market still looks pretty solid  Foreclosures and   consumer weaknesses appear to be heavily concentrated in those states where the housing boom and   thus the housing price declines have been most pronounced—especially California, Nevada, and   Florida—and in those states, such as Ohio and Michigan, that are feeling the effects of the decline in   automobile manufacturing  As President Poole indicated, credit card delinquencies were up but   December 11, 2007 55 of 138    highly concentrated in California, Nevada, and Florida  Thus, based on such observations and the   news that I hear from my District, I sense that the stresses in the economy vary significantly by   region, and we must be mindful that the weaknesses on Wall Street are in those states that have   exaggerated housing volatility and may not be representative of the rest of the economy  To be   sure, we must be wary of continued deterioration and spillovers, but at this point my assessment is   that they remain concentrated in a few regions and are not as widespread as some of the aggregate   data might suggest   It’s important to note that, for a good part of the forecast for the fourth-quarter GDP, it’s   payback for strong inventories and net export numbers in the third quarter  I note that, absent   payback and despite the worsening news, economic growth would be on the order of 2 percent   higher  To put this differently, the news since the last meeting has not altered the overall GDP   forecast for the second half of 2007  It’s about the same  The news has clearly altered the   Greenbook’s forecast for 2008, especially for the first half of the year but also extending into the   second half of 2008  The forecast calls for explicit spillovers from financial markets and the   housing sector to the broader economy, to consumption, to fixed investment, and so forth  I should   note, however, that most private sector forecasters are significantly less pessimistic than the   Greenbook  The Blue Chip survey, our just-released Livingston Survey, our Survey of Professional   Forecasters, and several of the major forecasting firms that have issued forecasts in the last couple   of weeks see weakness extending into the first and maybe the second quarter of 2008 but a much   more rapid bounceback in the second half of 2008 than is suggested in the Greenbook  These   private sector forecasts are more in line with my own view   While the news on growth is somewhat on the downside, the news on inflation is on the   upside  Readings on core inflation have been stable over the last few months, but headline inflation   December 11, 2007 56 of 138    rates have risen sharply, with increases in energy and commodity prices  The broader scope of   these commodity price increases and their breadth suggest that perhaps there are more-generalized   inflationary pressures out there rather than these isolated relative price shocks  I will note that the   core PCE inflation rate for March to June was 1½ percent; and in every three-month window   subsequently, the inflation rate has risen monotonically, now reaching 226 percent for the latest   three-month period from August to October  This comes after fairly steady declines in core rates   during the first half of the year  In my comments on the Third District, I noted the greater prospects   for price increases indicated by our manufacturing firms  I also am going to cite another statistic   from the same survey that President Evans referred to—Duke University’s CFO Magazine survey    The survey to which he referred was a survey conducted in late November and early December of   more than 600 CFOs  In the survey, the average price increase that these CFOs were estimating for   their own products in the coming year was 28 percent, and that was up from just 2 percent in the   previous quarter  Thus, it appears that firms are beginning to be more interested in increasing prices   and are more able to do so than they were just a few months ago, even though the same CFOs were   more pessimistic about the economy than they were in the last quarter   Another piece of news on inflation expectations comes from the Livingston Survey, which   was just released yesterday  There the forecast of the average annual change for the CPI for 2007 to   2008 moved up from 23 percent to 3 percent  This, of course, partially reflects the behavior of oil   prices during the past several months  The December-to-December forecast, on the other hand, also   rose, but only slightly   Thus, overall, the economy is weak but only slightly more so than I anticipated  Volatility   in the financial markets continues, and the repricing of risk has not progressed as smoothly as I   would like to see  Nevertheless, the spillovers from the financial turmoil seem geographically   December 11, 2007 57 of 138    concentrated, and broader spillovers appear limited to date  I view inflation expectations as fragile   and see evidence that price pressures are growing and that more and more firms feel that price   increases are coming and are supportable  I think we will have to be very careful not to presume   that just because price expectations and prices have remained contained that they will continue to be   so, independent of our actions  Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  In the last two meetings, the Committee cut   the funds rate 75 basis points  We did so because the outlook for the economy has clearly   deteriorated relative to our views in early August  We have argued that we have been acting   preemptively to help forestall and to mitigate potential fallout from the deteriorating housing   market and financial disruptions  How successful have those rate cuts been?  I think it is too   early to tell  It is still true that the effects of monetary policy on the broader economy—  especially on spending, output, and employment—operate with a considerable lag  It is my   guess that our previous cuts or anything we do today will not have measurable effects on the   broader economy in terms of spending and output until late in the first quarter of next year and   December 11, 2007 105 of 138    more likely in the second and third quarters  So I don’t think anything we do today will have an   appreciable effect, if any, on the economy’s first-quarter performance  Thus, one’s view about   the future path of the economy during the second half of ’08 depends critically on what you think   the effect of our decisions will be going forward  Now, contrary to what some may think, I am   not immune to the drum beat of downbeat news that we have heard  I am keenly aware of the   concerns expressed around this table and by others who are more concerned and anticipate a   much more prolonged period of reduced growth  I have marked down my forecast for the first   half of ’08, but my view of the second half has not changed very much  Thus, while I am okay   with the 25 basis point cut at this meeting, I would like to highlight that there are risks to that   decision  I would oppose a 50 basis point cut     As suggested in my earlier remarks, I do think that there are increasing underlying   inflation pressures, and although we have not seen inflationary expectations change very much in   the data, I do think they are fragile  Before I stop, I would just like to give one example of that   concern  In the last Philadelphia Fed Survey of Professional Forecasters, conducted in early   November, we asked a special question  We asked panelists whether they believe that the   FOMC has an inflation target  About half the survey respondents said that they believe the   FOMC has an inflation target, and of those, close to 90 percent responded that they thought our   target was for core PCE inflation  They also provided their views on what the target was  The   median estimate of that target was between 16 and 17 percent  Among these forecasters, almost   all those who thought that we had a target also indicated that their long-term—that is, their ten-  year—forecast of PCE core inflation was systematically 50 basis points, ½ percentage point,   higher than what they thought our target must be  We asked the forecasters, if their forecast was   different from the target, why it was  Almost all the forecasters presented a variation on a very   December 11, 2007 106 of 138    similar theme  Many of them said, “Well, the Fed really has goals other than inflation,” or “they   wouldn’t stick to it,” or “they would find it painful and, therefore, not commit to the goal,” or   “they lacked credibility”  Now, this is a small subsample of people  Nevertheless, I find it   interesting that these professional forecasters are really not terribly sure about our commitment   to price stability  The issue is not what they thought the target was per se but what the   differential between their forecast and the target was   Finally, just regarding language, I have been uncomfortable for some time with the   practice of summarizing the balance of risks, and I share President Lacker’s concern in that I   would like to get rid of it  So I would support alternative B with the language  I will also   reiterate the point that, while we may be making ourselves feel better, the fact is that we need to   be prepared to act quickly if things reverse themselves and we have to reverse the rate cuts  I   agree with that  On the other hand, I think the history of this institution is such that it is in fact   more difficult to do than it is to say, so I think we need to have some caution  So I favor   alternative B and the language as expressed  Thank you    Just to clarify what our boards have to approve, as I understand, it is the   willingness to accept the rate that comes out of the auction at the discount window    That is what I understood  Okay  "
8325,2008-01-09,PLOSSER,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I agree with a lot of what I’ve heard around   the table  I am certainly open to the idea that we will have to reduce rates at our next meeting at   the end of the month  I am not necessarily opposed to that  Even if I were certain of that,   though, I do agree with what a lot of people have said already—I don’t think an intermeeting cut   is either wise or appropriate at this point  As a general proposition, I oppose the idea of   intermeeting cuts unless a really immediate action is necessary to deal with some severe crisis   such as September 11 or something of the like  I am not going to reiterate all the concerns that   others have shared about the risk of an intermeeting cut; I don’t really want to belabor that  I do   January 9, 2008 29 of 60    think, though, that I would just add one point  Even if we were aggressive now, it is not going to   get us off the hook later  I am afraid that, if we took an aggressive cut today, an intermeeting   cut, the markets would respond by just wanting even more going further out  I’m not sure that   we want to put ourselves into that bind  Nor do I want us to be perceived as responding to near-  term numbers or other pressures from the market  So I am definitely open to further cuts at the   end of the month  I share your concern about the economy  It certainly has taken on a sour note   in recent data  But I also would note that we are going to get a lot more data between now and   the end of the month that will help us sort through perhaps the severity or the dimensions of the   slowdown  I would certainly like to have those in hand before I make a final decision   We are in a bind  I share the view, or at least I’m sympathetic to the view, that   aggressive cuts in the context of declining demand are supportive  But I also share the view of   President Lacker that, although we may want to take accommodation back quickly, the history of   this institution is that it doesn’t do that very well  Given the forecast that the staff has provided   us, I think that is going to be very difficult  I worry that, if such a scenario comes to pass and we   need to take it back, we will not act promptly enough  Certainly, we all can say that now, as we   are making the cuts and supplying the accommodation; but I worry that, when the time comes to   remove it, we will be reluctant to do so  Having said that, I am sympathetic about the concerns    My outlook is certainly weaker than it was a few weeks ago, but I would not like to see us do   something today  I will leave it at that  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
8344,2008-01-21,PLOSSER,"  Just as a point of clarification, I have not received the statement  I have   not had access to encrypted e-mail  May I ask that it just be read?   January 21, 2008 9 of 32     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I think we are in a very, very difficult   position  I don’t want to reiterate many of the points that have been already made  I certainly   appreciate and am sympathetic with the point of view that markets are fragile  Market   expectations, in terms of what they seem to be building into the path of the economy going   forward, seem to me extraordinarily volatile and pessimistic  I am very concerned about that    January 21, 2008 18 of 32    That bothers me  But at the same time I also am very concerned about the expectations this sets    While the US market was closed today, we have heard what has gone on in the foreign markets    I am very concerned that we are going to be interpreted as reacting to the stock market declines,   and I think my concern is that lowering the funds rate terribly rapidly with intermeeting moves is   going to set up a dynamic that is going to drive us into more and more of these and drive the   markets into expecting more and more from us  It is not clear to me that the fragility that exists   in the market in fact will be solved by rapid cuts in the funds rate  I share President Lacker’s   concern that it is not clear that lowering the funds rate is a solution to the problem of the   monoline insurance companies or others   Having said that, I nonetheless would certainly be supportive of a very dramatic action at   our regularly scheduled meeting  Frankly, I am very torn right now as to whether to support this   intermeeting cut  My gut instinct tells me “no,” but I also have to recognize the views shared by   a number of our colleagues who are concerned about the fragility of the markets and the signals   we are sending  If we decide to go through with this today, I think that we will find ourselves in   a very tough position at our next meeting as to how much more will be expected from us and at   what rate  President Poole or President Lacker pointed out that it was partly our aggressive rate-  cutting in some periods that helped foster some of this, and we may be setting ourselves up for   another fall  I share Governor Mishkin’s view that if, in fact, we are to get aggressive, we also   have to be willing to take it back when times change  I understand that view, and I can live with   it, except the history of this institution is that we haven’t been very aggressive in doing that or   demonstrating our ability to do that   So I have a lot of concern and caution about this move  I think it is going to affect   expectations of us as we move forward, and I think we need to be realistic about what it is we are   January 21, 2008 19 of 32    buying with this  I am not sure we are buying very much  Maybe we will calm some market   nerves  If so, that would be great, and it may be of short-run benefit, at least over the next nine   days  I worry what it is going to mean for us over the next nine months as we move forward  So   those are my views  I am not a voting member at this meeting, but I just wanted to share those   views  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
8372,2008-01-29,PLOSSER,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I have three questions  Let me go to Brian   first  This is more of a comment  In your description of the forecast, you referred several times   to the notion that there might be slack in the economy in 2010 based on these numbers  I guess   my reaction to that, while I was kind of skeptical, I am not sure exactly how you infer that from   what was reported  Certainly, that seems to be true in the Greenbook forecast, but trend growth   January 29–30, 2008 43 of 249    seems to be as good as or better than it was in the last projection  In 2010, inflation—true—is a   little higher  The unemployment rate may be a 01 or 02 percentage point higher  But unless   you infer something about what people thought the NAIRU might be, I don’t know how you   would necessarily infer that the reason inflation went up in these forecasts was that there was   slack in the economy in these projections  So I just wanted to caution about the language we use   in how we describe what we see here without necessarily inferring something about whether, in   any individual person’s forecast, there may or may not have been slack  In mine, there wasn’t in   2010, but I don’t see that necessarily follows from what these numbers look like  That was my   only observation here    I have two other questions that I would like to pose  One is the change   in the Greenbook’s assumption about the increase in potential GDP  In particular, I am curious   because what it essentially does, it seems, is to build in a significant amount of slack or output   gap in 2009 and 2010 that didn’t exist in the last Greenbook  I am inferring that part of the   reason the more-aggressive easing in the policy assumption does not have any effect on inflation   to speak of is that it is offset by the increased gap that you have built in  So I would like a little   more explanation about the justification for building in a greater gap or a higher potential  But I   am also curious to know, if you hadn’t done that, what your forecast for growth and inflation   January 29–30, 2008 44 of 249    would look like in, let’s say, 2009 and 2010  Could you give some guesstimate of how that   might have affected it?      So are you saying that your path of the gap would have been   unchanged?    Well, it does really change the character of the forecast substantially, I   think   January 29–30, 2008 46 of 249     My last question is also related to some adjustments that struck me in   the panel you talked about where you constructed the revised estimates of r*  The first item on   your list that you talk about was that the equity premium had gone up, and that was a big factor    So I have a couple of questions  That was an adjustment factor  Now, the way I would think   about the stock market declining would be primarily having a wealth effect that works its way   through consumption—that would be the normal channel  Yet the Greenbook and this   discussion seem to suggest that somehow there was an additional adjustment made because of   the rise in the equity premium  Is that correct or not, or is it just the wealth effect that you are   talking about?  Are these separate?    But is the mechanism through a wealth effect on consumption growth?    Well, what does that mean?      So are these “extra channels”— if you want to call them that—typically   part of the forecast change and how you evaluate?  That is to say, in the fall, when the stock   market booms 10 percent, are we going to get another kicker upward in r* due to these same   factors?    I am just reacting to this very large change in your estimate of r* and   attributing it to equity premiums, and I was just trying to figure out both    Well, I am just trying to sort out how much of this is really due to the   stock market moving around    I didn’t understand that this was just primarily the wealth effect or   whether you were referring to something different    Thank you, Mr Chairman  You know, listening to the staff discussion I   have certainly come to understand why everyone continues to believe that economics is a dismal   science  [Laughter]  It is quite a dismal picture  But more seriously, recent economic data have   certainly helped feed that view, and the Third District is no exception  Economic activity has   weakened in our District since December, and to double the fun, firms continue to face   increasing price pressures—not a very comfortable position for monetary policymakers  The   Philadelphia staff’s state coincident indicators indicate that overall economic activity has been   moderate in New Jersey, flat in Pennsylvania, and declining in Delaware over the past three   months  Our Business Outlook Survey of manufacturers fell sharply in January  The index fell   to minus 209 from minus 16 in December  Now, some of that we have to remember is   sentiment, in the sense that the question has to do with general activity and doesn’t necessarily   reflect just their firm  But it is a sentiment of pessimism that certainly is more prevalent than it   once was  A reading that low, of minus 20, indicates declining manufacturing activity in the   region and is usually associated with very low GDP growth or perhaps even negative GDP   growth at the national level  More related to the firms’ own performance, though, the survey’s   indexes of new orders and shipments also declined in January, and both are now in negative   territory, although much less so than the general activity index   On the other hand, while expectations of activity six months from now have moved down   somewhat this month, they remain firmly in positive territory, and firms’ capital spending plans   over the next six months remain relatively strong  District bankers are reporting weaker   consumer loan demand, but business lending continues to advance at a moderate pace from their   perspective  Loan quality has shown slight deterioration, mainly in residential real estate and   auto loans, to a lesser extent in credit cards, and to an even lesser extent on the business loan   January 29–30, 2008 60 of 249    side  This downtick in quality follows a period of extraordinarily low delinquencies and default   rates and thus is well within historical norms, so it has not greatly alarmed our banking   community  Thus far, our District banks apparently have largely escaped the credit problems   plaguing the larger money center banks and investment banks  While there has been some   tightening in credit conditions and standards around the District, most non-real-estate-related   firms I spoke with are not finding it difficult to obtain credit for any reasonable project they want   to do, and so they have not identified largely with the credit crunch scenario   Despite the softness in the activity, firms in our District report higher prices in their   inputs and outputs  As President Lacker said, inflation seems to be alive and well  The current   prices-paid and prices-received indexes in our Business Outlook Survey accelerated sharply in   January and are at very high levels, almost record levels, of the past twenty years  Firms also   expect prices to rise over the next six months  These forward-looking price indexes, too, are at   very elevated levels relative to their twenty-year history  I am hearing from business contacts   and from one of my directors, for example, that they are planning to implement price increases to   pass along costs they are experiencing  Thus, even though they are pessimistic about growth in   the future, they are not pessimistic about price increases  This adds to my skepticism about   arguments that link inflation too closely with resource utilization   The national near-term economic outlook is also deteriorating, as we have been hearing,   and I have revised down my growth forecast for 2008 compared with my October submission  It   is hard to find much positive news in the data released since our last meeting, and the Board staff   has summarized that quite eloquently, and so I won’t repeat them  Nevertheless, in general, my   forecast is probably slightly less pessimistic than the Board’s forecast  However, I must add that,   at the same time that growth has slowed, inflation has trended up  Both the core CPI and the   January 29–30, 2008 61 of 249    core PCE accelerated in the second half of ’07, compared with the first half  The core CPI   advanced at a 26 percent rate in the second half of ’07, compared with a 23 percent rate in the   first half, and the core PCE was up at a 24 percent rate in the second half compared with 19 in   the first half   As we know, the PCE price index gets revised  Recent research by Dean Croushore, one   of our visiting scholars, has shown that between 1995 and 2005 the average revision from initial   release until the August release the following year was positive on average for both the core PCE   and the total PCE  This suggests that inflation is likely to be even higher in the second half of   ’07 than the current estimates indicate  I am also concerned that, over the past 10 year period,   core and headline inflation for both the PCE and the CPI have diverged on average about   50 basis points  Headline rates have exceeded core rates in 8 of the last 10 years for the CPI and   9 out of the last 10 years for the PCE  While I would like to believe that these two rates should   be converging on average, I am concerned that core rates may not be as indicative of underlying   trend inflation as we might have thought  This line of thinking also leads me to question   estimates of ex post real funds rates calculated by the staff and presented in the Bluebook, which   are based on subtracting core PCE from the nominal funds rate  I am not convinced that the core   PCE is the right measure of inflation in this context  Even if you thought it was, then the   reported real rates are likely to be overstated for recent quarters given the apparent systematic   bias in the preliminary estimates of the PCE that I have noted before  Moreover, some measures   of inflation expectations are not encouraging  In particular, the Michigan survey one-year-ahead   measures and five-year-ahead measures are up  We have already discussed a bit the acceleration   in some of the TIPS measures  I will return to that in a minute  The Livingston survey   January 29–30, 2008 62 of 249    participants have also raised their forecast for CPI inflation in 2008 from 23 percent to 3   percent   My forecast overall is similar to the Greenbook’s, and I expect a weak first half and a   return toward trend growth later this year and into ’09 and inflation at the 17 to 2 percent range    But the policy assumptions that I make to achieve the forecasted outcomes for the intermediate   term are different from the Greenbook’s  The ongoing housing correction and poor credit market   conditions are a significant drag in the near term on the economy, and I expect growth in the first   half of the year to be quite weak, probably around 1 percent  As conditions in the housing and   financial markets begin to stabilize, I expect economic growth to improve in the second half of   the year and move back toward trend, which I estimate to be about 2¾ percent, about 50 basis   points higher than the Greenbook, I think, in 2009   The slowdown in real activity suggests a lower equilibrium real rate  How much lower is   difficult to measure with any precision  Ten-year TIPS have fallen about 100 basis points since   the beginning of September  In such an environment, optimal policy calls for the FOMC to   allow the funds rate to fall as well  And we have; the funds rate is down 175 basis points since   September—or more if we cut today  But we also must remain committed to delivering on our   goal of price stability in this environment of rising prices  To my mind, that means we must   continue to communicate that commitment to the markets and to act in a manner that is   consistent with that commitment  I want to stress that while many of us, myself included, have   argued that inflation expectations remain well anchored, we cannot wait to act until we see   contrary evidence to such a claim because by then it will be too late and we will have already   lost some credibility  I also might add that the staff memo on inflation compensation, which I   thought was very good, suggests that one reason for the increase in forward inflation   January 29–30, 2008 63 of 249    compensation might be a greater inflation risk premium rather than a rise in expected inflation    That may, in fact, be true, and I think the memo was very well done  But if that is the case, if the   rise is in the inflation risk premium, then I think it might be worth asking ourselves if the   increase in inflation uncertainty might be an early warning sign of our waning credibility     This perspective leads me to a different policy assumption from the Greenbook’s  In   particular, once the real economy is stabilized, the FOMC must act aggressively to take back the   significant easing it has put in place in order to ensure that inflation is stabilized in 2010    Employment is a lagging indicator, so we will likely have to act before employment growth   returns to trend, should output growth pick up in the second half of the year as forecasted  Thus,   I expect we will need to begin raising rates by the fourth quarter of this year and perhaps   aggressively so  In contrast, the Greenbook assumes a flat funds rate at 3 percent throughout the   forecast period  Despite the real funds rate remaining below 1 percent—and well after the   economy has returned to trend growth—inflation expectations remain anchored in the   Greenbook  In my view, this seems somewhat implausible or, at best, a very risky bet  It   appears that the Greenbook achieves this result through an output gap—related to the question I   was asking earlier this afternoon  I think all of us understand the very real concerns that many   researchers have with our ability to accurately estimate the level of potential GDP  Furthermore,   in the recent research on inflation dynamics that we have discussed—and President Yellen was   referring to this—inflation becomes less persistent and appears to be less related to other   macroeconomic variables as well  We do not know whether these changes are an outcome of a   more aggressive and credible stance of monetary policy against inflation or are due to some   fundamental changes in the world economy  If the lower persistence is due to enhanced policy   January 29–30, 2008 64 of 249    credibility, then it is incumbent upon this Committee to maintain that credibility  Otherwise, we   cannot expect inflation persistence to remain low   Thus, if the economy performs as forecasted on the growth side, with a return toward   trend growth in the second half, I would be very uncomfortable leaving a real funds rate below   1 percent  The Bluebook scenarios involving risk management indicate that the inflation   outcome is poor when there is a gradual reversal of policy  Better outcomes are achieved under a   prompt reversal strategy  Given that forecast, I believe we must begin thinking now about what   our exit strategy from this insurance we have put in place is going to be  How we communicate   our monetary policy strategy will also be crucially important because of the effects such   communications will have on expectations  We need to better understand in our own minds, I   think, what our reaction function looks like so that we can be more systematic and articulate in   our implementation of policy  Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Since September, this Committee has   lowered the federal funds rate 175 basis points  My estimate is that the real funds rate before any   action today is 1 percent or slightly below that, and that is very low by historical standards  The   slowdown in growth suggests that the equilibrium real rate really has fallen, and the Committee   has appropriately allowed the nominal funds rate to fall as well  Do nominal rates need to go   lower and, if so, about how much?  Part of this depends on what you think the equilibrium real   rate of the economy is now  The Bluebook indicates that estimates of r* vary considerably by   the model and the process they use to calculate them  The 70 percent confidence interval around   January 29–30, 2008 122 of 249    them is 3 percentage points  Moreover, the estimates of r*, as we talked a bit about yesterday,   can be quite volatile  It troubles me that the estimate of r* consistent with the Greenbook has   changed by 140 basis points from December to today  I am uncomfortable using an estimate that   is so variable and so sensitive to stock markets as a guide to setting policy  I also want to note   that the Bluebook indicates that the appropriate funds rate, based on a range of Taylor rule   specifications, is anywhere from 40 to 120 basis points above where we currently are today    That includes forecast-based versions of the rule that rely on the weak forecast found in the   Greenbook   While I don’t want to suggest that such guidelines are definitive, they do suggest that the   current level of the fed funds rate is clearly accommodative and that we have taken out insurance   against downside risk  When do we stop taking out more insurance?  If we do cut 50 basis points   today, which is the amount the market is expecting, it would bring, to my mind, the real funds   rate down to below ½ percent  That is based on expectations of about 2½ percent inflation,   which in fact may be conservative  To my way of thinking, that is a very accommodative policy   by any standard  Moreover, I don’t believe that enough time has elapsed for us to realize the full   effect of the cuts that we have already put in place  I share President Hoenig’s concern that only   the market can solve many of the problems that we see out there, and we must give the market   time and patience to do so  The last time real rates were this low was in 2003-04, when the real   rate was in fact apparently negative  But that was different  Inflation was running around   1 percent or less, and our concern was possible deflation  Today, we are not worried about   deflation in the near term  We are worried about inflation; inflation has been moving up    Lowering rates too aggressively in today’s situation would seem to me a risky strategy, fueling   inflation; possibly setting up the next boom-bust cycle, which I worry about; and delaying the   January 29–30, 2008 123 of 249    recognition of losses on bank’s balance sheets but not eliminating them  The main effect of the   rate cut will be after the first half of the year, if the economy begins to recover  I think we need   to be very cautious not to get carried away in our insurance strategies with lowering rates too   much  In my view, we are on the verge of overshooting, and I worry about the broad range of   consequences for our credibility and the expectations of our future actions such behavior may   have  That is closely related to President Lacker’s comments about what people interpret that   behavior to mean about what we may do in future episodes  But two things are even more   important, in my mind, about what we may do and what we do today     First, we need to be very careful about our communications and not to excessively   reinforce the market’s expectation that further rate cuts are coming  In particular, I would feel   much more comfortable with supporting a moderate 25 or 50 basis point cut if the statement   language today were more agnostic about the balance of risks, as I suggested in my memo before   the meeting  The market interprets our saying that there are downside risks to growth as that we   are planning to cut rates again  I do not think we should encourage those beliefs  I worry that   the balance of risks portion of our statements has come to be a code for predicting the path of our   federal funds rate  I think that is not a good position for us to be in, nor should we condone it    Given the Greenbook forecast, I don’t believe that negative real rates are called for, and   signaling further cuts clearly sends the message that negative real rates are on the way, if not   already here  When our forecasts are released, the public will get our assessments of the risks in   our outlook  We don’t need to say anything more about it in the statement  That, of course, does   not preclude us from cutting rates again if our forecast deteriorates further  But until it does, I   am reluctant to encourage the perception that more rate cuts are forthcoming   January 29–30, 2008 124 of 249    Second, as I said in the last go-round, we need to be able to better understand how we are   going to unwind these cuts that we have implemented as insurance against the macroeconomic   effects and financial disruptions  Of course, this was the theme of the discussion we had before   the go-round  Unwinding those cuts too slowly not only risks our credibility on inflation but also   risks setting up the next boom–bust cycle  Hindsight, of course, is always 20/20, but as we   discussed in Monday’s videoconference, the Fed’s being slow to raise rates back up after the   deflationary scare was over in 2003 may indeed have contributed to the conditions we are facing   today  Thus, it is crucially important, to my mind, that we do have a plan for unwinding the   significant cuts we have implemented as insurance against the financial turmoil  If the market   turmoil subsides, I believe this Committee needs to have clear signals as to what we are going to   look at and what has to happen before we start to remove the accommodation  I believe that the   Committee must undo the accommodation as aggressively as we put it in play  We need to   determine what indicators we will be looking at to determine when that process should begin    When we know ourselves, we want to help the markets and public understand what our process   will be as well  I strongly believe that we must be both credible and committed policymakers,   and our communications must signal not a particular funds rate path but articulate and focus on   the contingent nature of that path and help the public understand and appreciate the systematic   part of our policies and our policy decisions  Thank you, Mr Chairman    I can pass if it gets too long  That’s okay  "
8397,2008-03-10,PLOSSER,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  If I could, I have basically three clarifying   questions, a couple of them related to other comments  The first is on this issue of haircuts and   discounts on the collateral  If I understand from looking at what we do for the TAF and for the   discount window, the haircut that is given depends on the duration of the security, and it ranges   from 8 percent to 3 percent  As I think Bill Dudley suggests, it is lowest for very short term   duration buckets  But those haircuts apply, at least in my understanding, only to assets for which   there are in fact market prices being quoted somewhere  For assets that are committed, even   AAA assets, for those types of collateralized mortgages where there are no market prices, the   haircut is 20 percent  So are we then accepting only collateral for which market prices in fact   exist, or would we be following what we do at the discount window and take a substantially   higher haircut for securities that we don’t observe market prices for?  That is my first question    Okay  The second concern—I want to go back to President Fisher’s   and President Hoenig’s comments—I am a bit nervous about the slippery slope here  Once we   start taking assets of a particular class that is in distress, are we setting ourselves up for potential   risks down the road, when all of a sudden some other asset class that is commonly used in both   trading and securities, whether by mutual funds or banks, comes under greater duress and for   which spreads widen significantly?  Are we going down a path here in which we are going to   March 10, 2008 13 of 39    implicitly provide support for a whole range of potential asset classes?  I worry a bit about where   this might lead us over a longer period of time  That is related to my question  Maybe I missed   it reading the document or in the discussion  This facility is different from the traditional lending   facilities that we have in place primarily because of the term, even for the non-schedule 1 assets    Are we going to bill this as something different, and if so, does that mean we can remove it at   some point?  How long do you anticipate this facility being in place, and how do you think about   the magnitude of the operations that we want to open the door for?    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I have just a couple of observations and a   question  I am not terribly confident that this will have the effect we desire  I thought I heard   Governor Kohn saying that the ECB actually does take this sort of risk and collateral and it’s not   working particularly well  So I’m not sure we ought to hold out a whole lot of hope that it will have   the desired effect here  That doesn’t mean we shouldn’t try it, but I’m a little dubious  I am   concerned with the comments that President Lacker and Governor Kohn made about crossing a line    However, having said that, I can go along with this proposal; but to be honest, I am concerned about   the exit strategy here  Mr Chairman, you said that we would stop when the markets were no longer   impaired  I’m not exactly sure how we would define that at some point  I wonder whether it might   be worthwhile thinking about putting this facility in place and doing it for a fixed period of time—I   don’t know, three months or whatever—and then having it automatically expire or to be renewed by   a conscious act of this Committee rather than having an ongoing process where there was some   vague notion of how we would define when we would remove it  I just offer that as an idea for   doing this  I guess that’s all I have to say  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
8415,2008-03-18,PLOSSER,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  As anticipated, Third District business activity   showed continued weakness in February and March  Reports from retailers, manufacturers,   bankers, and other business contacts remain somewhat downbeat  At the same time, there has been   little moderation in price pressures facing our firms and consumers  There is little new in the   regional housing markets  So rather than dwell on housing, let me talk about some of the   information that we have received since our last meeting   Banks in the Third District have generally been relatively unscathed by the toll on the   financial markets  Many had not been in the subprime market and did not have instruments based   on subprime  They do, however, hold a high proportion of commercial real estate and residential   mortgage loans in their portfolios  So to the extent that the commercial real estate market slows as   we expect, our banks are likely to be feeling the effects  Bankers, thus, have become somewhat   more pessimistic over the past six weeks or so  They don’t expect financial conditions to improve   any time soon, and several noted signs of declining business loan demand, which they had not been   seeing earlier  Bankers also report some deterioration in personal-loan credit quality and are   expecting increases in credit card delinquencies  Despite these increases, these delinquencies and   default rates so far remain well within historical norms   Manufacturing outlook activity in the District remains weak  Our March business outlook   survey is confidential until we release it this coming Thursday  It will show a little improvement in   February’s dismal readings  Since the beginning of the year, the general activity index has been at a   level typically associated with either a national recession or a substantial slowdown in economic   March 18, 2008 47 of 127    growth  So despite the modest improvement, it doesn’t move us out of negative territory    Responses to a special survey question in February indicate that the majority of our firms considers   their inventories to be at an appropriate level, and firms are unlikely to substantially replenish these   inventories until midyear or later  But it doesn’t seem as though there will be more-dramatic   reductions in inventories—as, for example, in the Greenbook’s basic story, where there’s a very   large inventory correction, it appears   Despite the weakness in activity, there has been little moderation in price pressures in the   District  The current prices-paid index in our business outlook survey continues to accelerate, and   both the prices-paid and prices-received indexes over the past three months are at very high levels   relative to the last twenty years  Firms in various sectors, not just manufacturing, were reporting   significant increases in prices, particularly of imported inputs  Although our firms are expecting   continued weak real activity, they expect prices to rise over the next six months  Indeed, the   forward-looking price indexes in the survey are at very elevated levels, and the future-prices-paid   index is at its highest level since the early 1980s  Our firms seem to be as skeptical as I am of the   arguments of the critical link between inflation and resource utilization   Turning to the national outlook, I struggled coming into this meeting with a growing level of   discomfort  There are four dimensions to my concerns  first, the outlook for growth; second, the   outlook for inflation; third, the calibration of monetary policy given that outlook; and fourth, the   turmoil in the financial markets  First, in terms of near-term economic growth, the outlook has   deteriorated somewhat since our last meeting  I expected weak growth in the first half of the year,   but the incoming data suggest that growth will probably be somewhat weaker than I anticipated  I   and many private-sector forecasters, like the MA or the Blue Chip survey summaries, have   responded to the incoming data with downward revisions to our forecast for certainly the first half   March 18, 2008 48 of 127    of 2008  But our changes are considerably smaller than the revisions in the Greenbook’s forecast,   which have revised down personal consumption in 2008 from 23 percent in the January forecast to   zero in the current forecast while incorporating significantly more monetary policy stimulus  I   realize that the Board’s staff has a good track record, but I am not wholly comfortable with the   Greenbook’s forecast, which I think incorporates a number of judgmental adjustments that are   responsible for taking it pretty far away from where private-sector forecasts now are   Second, I’m just less comfortable with the inflation outlook  I’ve said before that, if   inflation expectations become unhinged, we will face an even more difficult problem as monetary   policy will feed more quickly and directly into higher inflation outcomes  The ensuing loss of   credibility will be costly to regain  I wish we had the luxury of waiting for unambiguous evidence   that expectations have lost their anchor  But if we wait until then, it will be too late  This means   that we have to look for early warning signs so we can take appropriate action to ensure that   expectations remain anchored, and I am concerned that we are seeing those warning signs  Despite   last Friday’s CPI numbers, headline and core inflation have been trending up  Oil prices are at   record highs  Commodity prices continue to trend up, and the dollar has fallen sharply   Our business and consumer contacts are consistently stressing price pressures as a concern    These developments concern me partly because research indicates that inflation actually may have   become less persistent since the 1990s, and I think we have to be careful not to interpret the lack of   persistence independent of what monetary policy actions are taken  Moreover, inflation   expectations measured by surveys and market-based measures have all risen over the last couple of   months  Inflation risk premiums have risen, which could be an early warning signal of a waning   credibility or commitment on the part of the Fed  The National Association for Business Economics   March 18, 2008 49 of 127    survey in early March shows that a third of the respondents think that monetary policy is now too   stimulative, and that is up from less than 10 percent just a few months ago     According to a special question on our November Survey of Professional Forecasters—I   reported on this several meetings ago—half of those forecasters, 23 out of the 45, believe that the   FOMC has an inflation target  Of those 23 forecasters, 20 believe that long-run inflation over the   next ten years will be 50 basis points or more above what they view our inflation target is  I might   be able to shrug off one or two of these, but the predominance of these signals has me concerned   about the risk to our credibility  I’m also concerned that the public seems to perceive that the Fed   has effectively set aside one part of its mandate, price stability, in our all-out efforts to promote   economic growth  Said differently, it seems to suggest that not only are we incorporating new data   into our loss function as our forecasts change but we are changing the coefficients on that loss   function  I don’t believe that we are necessarily doing that, and I don’t believe that’s the right way   to make policy, but I do believe that ultimately it’s up to us to make that clear to the public as best   we can   Third, we have to calibrate the appropriate level of the funds rate and not just its rate of   change  This is not an easy task, especially in the current circumstances  We have reduced the   targeted funds rate by 225 basis points since August and 125 basis points in just the last six weeks    It is simply too soon for the economy to have felt the full effects of these rate cuts  While the recent   deterioration in the outlook might suggest that we need easier policy, I believe that the recent   increases in inflation expectations mean that the real funds rate has already fallen either below zero   or close to zero depending on how we measure it  For example, the real funds rate is now minus 1   percent, which is below the more pessimistic Greenbook-consistent r* of minus 05 percent given in   the Bluebook, if you measure the real rate as the nominal funds rate minus the Greenbook’s one-  March 18, 2008 50 of 127    quarter-ahead forecasted headline PCE  The Greenbook suggests that the real funds rate can be   negative over the next two years and inflation will continue to decelerate as upside inflation   pressure is offset by greater slack in product and labor markets  I am skeptical  This outcome is   predicated on inflation expectations remaining well anchored despite aggressive and persistent   easing for a sustained period of time  Given the current fragility of inflation expectations, this   seems very unlikely to me  The alternative Greenbook scenario with more inflation pressure from   oil and imported goods suggests a steeper policy path and higher inflation by 2010-12   Fourth and finally, like everyone else, I am very concerned about the developments in the   financial markets  I’ve been supportive of the steps we’ve taken to enhance liquidity in the markets   through the TAF, the TSLF, the PDCF, or whatever      Well, I’ve been supportive of those, and I want to compliment the New   York Desk and the people who have worked on this because I think they are very innovative  I’m   not clear how successful these instruments will be, and they are not without their own set of risks of   creating some potentially dangerous expectations regarding future Fed behavior, which eventually   we must deal with  But I think they are worth trying as long as they are removed in due course  I   can also support a further narrowing of the spread between the funds rate and the primary credit   rate, although I would eventually like to see a review of what we think that spread ought to be in   more normal times and what our exit strategy might be like as we move toward that  Giving some   thought down the road to that I think would be helpful   So while I believe that we have appropriately reduced the funds rate in response to the   worsening economic outlook for the real economy, I am less convinced that reducing the funds rate   March 18, 2008 51 of 127    further will do much to stem the liquidity problems in the market or to lower risk premiums    Uncertainty about valuations seems to be the root cause of liquidity problems  The price discovery   process needs to continue, and it may take a while  In this case, I think the Fed needs to continue to   do its job to reassure markets that it will act as an appropriate lender of last resort, but we must be   careful that a lower funds rate, if that is the path we take, doesn’t become just a form of forbearance   that contributes to delaying the necessary writedowns and the price discovery process itself  Yes,   the financial markets can have spillovers to the real economy to which the Fed needs to react with   monetary policy, and I believe we have  At the same time, we need to keep focused on both parts of   our mandate  We put our credibility at risk if we do not do so, and this would be a cause for severe   problems later when we may need to act to regain it  We will have to face the fact at some point   that we will disappoint the markets with their ever-increasing forecast of a lower funds rate  Thank   you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  As I mentioned in my first go-round, and   like Rick, I have been terribly depressed on multiple dimensions about what is going on and have   struggled mightily in trying to think about what appropriate policy is going forward and, as   President Lacker suggested, about what our strategy is as we move forward  I certainly believe   that easing of policy is appropriate in a weaker economy, and I have supported that  But as I   alluded to earlier—and, Mr Chairman, as you said—I do believe that a weaker economy does   not mean that we continue to cut rates as long as the economy is weak  We need to calibrate the   level of the funds rate; I think it is very important  I think the markets seem to have the   expectation that it is the rate of change, not the level, that matters  That concerns me and feeds   into some of the problems that we are facing  I won’t elaborate any more about expectations,   March 18, 2008 99 of 127    which I mentioned before  But I would prefer actions as well as language that reinforced our   commitment to price stability and a pause today in our rate cuts  I think that the language of   alternative D would accomplish that  But I also believe that a more modest cut, combined with   language such as that in alternative D, might accomplish the same thing  I am afraid that an   aggressive move combined with the language that we have in A or B feeds the belief that we   have placed aside our commitment to price stability and the expectation that we will continue to   cut rates for the foreseeable future and that there is no bottom in sight   We have talked a lot about taking out insurance around this table  I believe the time has   come to buy some insurance against our waning credibility about restraining inflation  That does   not mean that we couldn’t choose to continue to make rate cuts at some future date, should that   be called for  Ultimately, if we wish inflation expectations to be well anchored, we must act in a   way that is consistent with such an outcome  Words are simply not enough  Reputational   capital, whether it be for a central bank, an academic institution, or the brand capital of a firm, is   very hard to build  But most of us know, in the private sector and in other sectors, that capital   can be easily squandered  We must not let that happen   I appreciate, Mr Chairman, your comments regarding the idea that we may be reaching   the limits of what monetary policy and the central bank can do  I very much agree with that  At   the risk of maybe sounding a bit trite to some of my colleagues who are familiar with this—I   don’t mean it that way because this expresses some of my concerns—I would like to remind my   colleagues of a quotation of Milton Friedman, which he made in 1968, that “we are in danger of   assigning to monetary policy a larger role than it can perform, in danger of asking it to   accomplish tasks that it cannot achieve, and, as a result, in danger of preventing it from making   the contribution that it is capable of making”  Thank you, Mr Chairman    March 18, 2008 100 of 127     How about two?  "
8442,2008-04-29,PLOSSER,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I have two questions  One, in comparing the   staff’s forecast with a lot of the private-sector forecasts—what it looks like and its shape—one thing   that is striking about the forecast is the very large adjustment swing that occurs in inventories  My   interpretation is that one thing that is occurring in the way you’ve made adjustments to your   forecast—or maybe this is more of a question—is that the spending of the tax rebates appears to be   occurring out of inventories  Therefore, there is no production response, or less production   response, to the presumably increasing demand that may materialize  Can you give me some   feeling about why you chose that way of treating this?   The second question goes back to inflation  I thought your discussion of the uncertainties   around inflation was excellent  Part of what you talked about in the Greenbook was the uncertainty   about pass-throughs of commodity price increases and oil price increases into various measures of   consumer price inflation, which you indicated were imprecise and which we don’t really know   much about  I was struck that, if there is more pass-through than the baseline says, we’re going to   get more inflation in the near term, and then disinflation will be more rapid when you assume that   commodity prices are going to come down  But if commodity prices only stabilize and don’t come   down, then it’s going to be a more complicated picture  You do have an alternative scenario that   April 29–30, 2008 37 of 266    says that commodity prices keep rising, but you allow expectations to move up only fairly modestly   in the model  It seems to me that, particularly if expectations become more unanchored than that,   the time paths of the funds rate that are implicit in the simulations become much more aggressive on   the other side  I just want to make sure that my intuition is correct here    A lot bigger than just the rise in expectations    In the theoretical literature there is a lot of discussion about inventory   modeling now and what the appropriate way is to think about it    Yes, just a follow-up  Another way to ask my question is, Given your   assumptions about the fiscal policy stimulus and tax rebates, if I took the view that your estimate of   spending was not really 50 cents, 40 cents, or 60 cents but really 10 cents—most of it will get saved   and not spent—how would that affect your inventory assumptions and, therefore, the path over the   next several quarters?    Thank you, Mr Chairman  In the Third District, there has been little   change in economic activity since I reported in March  Business activity remained weak over the   intermeeting period but no more or less than anticipated and than we reported in our March   meeting  Manufacturing activity, residential construction, and employment remained modestly   weak in the District  Retail sales were also sluggish   Our staff’s coincident indicators of economic activity, which summarize our regional data,   show a decline in activity in Pennsylvania and Delaware but moderate growth in New Jersey in   March and, on average, for the last three months  Overall, our firms are not very upbeat about near-  term growth; and like many forecasters, they have revised downward their expectations since the   start of the year  For example, in response to a special question in our business outlook survey, the   number of manufacturers saying that current demand for their products fell short of what they had   expected at the start of the year exceeded those who had underestimated demand  More firms have   decreased their capital spending plans, with 10 percent indicating that they either delayed capital   spending or postponed it indefinitely  While growth in the District has been weak, price pressures   facing our firms and consumers have intensified  Area manufacturers continue to report higher   production costs, and the percentage of firms raising prices on finished goods is larger than earlier in   the year  The indexes of prices paid and prices received are near 20-year highs for our firms, and   firms expect to see prices move higher over the next six months  These firms have a very   pessimistic outlook for inflation   April 29–30, 2008 43 of 266    Turning to the national outlook, I have revised down my growth forecast from what I   submitted in January, as almost all of us have, but that revision occurred largely between January   and March  There has been little or no change in my outlook since our March meeting  Compared   with my January forecast, I now see real GDP growth coming in around 15 percent for 2008 and   close to 26 to 28 percent in 2009–10  Overall, this is about ½ percentage point weaker for ’08 than   my January forecast, but there is little difference in my forecast for ’09 and ’10  The indicators that   have come in since our last meeting have generally been in line with my March outlook  Certainly   they have pointed to continued weakness, but not worse than I had expected  Although some strains   in the interbank markets remain, they do not appear to have intensified, and our alphabet soup of   targeted tools seems to be having at least modest beneficial effect, even if only psychologically   I remain concerned, however, about inflation and our calibration of the appropriate level of   the fed funds rate consistent with our goals  Inflation readings have abated marginally since our last   meeting; but as the Greenbook suggests, there is reason to believe that this is a temporary reprieve   and that the levels remained elevated—year-over-year CPI inflation was 4 percent in March, and   year-over-year PCE inflation was 34 percent—well above their 2007 levels  As we have been   noting, oil and other commodity prices continue to move up, and businesses and consumers   continue to stress inflation as a concern  Near-term measures of inflation expectations have risen   sharply  In the Michigan survey, one-year inflation expectations rose to 48 percent in April, up   from 43 percent in March and 34 percent in December  Clearly, the greater media attention on   inflation and the discussion among the public are bound to have some effect on expectations as time   goes on   I have some concerns and difficulty interpreting the measure in TIPS given the disruptions   in financial markets right now  So I take those with a little grain of salt  Nevertheless, five-year,   April 29–30, 2008 44 of 266    five-year-ahead inflation compensation is 28 percent using the Board’s measure  This is down a   little from early March but is still higher than it was at the end of 2007  In fact, the instability of   these measures of inflation expectations itself is a cause of concern for me  It may suggest that   markets question our willingness to take actions consistent with sustained and credible price   stability   Now, we have often alluded to the idea that near-term weakness will help mitigate some of   the inflation pressures  However, I would just like to remind us that this critically depends on   inflation expectations remaining well anchored  I hope that going forward we can reinforce that   conditionality of the statement about weakness helping us on the inflation side so that we do not   perpetuate the notion that a stable Phillips curve is at work here and that a slowing economy will   always lower inflation  I believe that the FOMC’s commitment to price stability remains credible at   this time, but just barely  I worry that we may be resting too much on our laurels, trying to talk a   good game, but unwilling to take the actions necessary to support and sustain that credibility  As I   have said before in this group, we must not wait until expectations have broken out because by then   it will be too late  Inflation has been well above at least our implicit goal for a sustained period  As   the Bluebook points out, core PCE inflation has been above 2 percent since 2004 every year, and is   projected to be so again this year, and the projections are even worse for headline numbers, either   CPI or PCE  If we continue easing or maintaining a real funds rate well below zero for a sustained   period despite inflation well above our goal, can we really expect inflation expectations to remain   anchored?     The Greenbook seems to think that we can  It assumes that the fed funds rate falls to   175 percent in June and remains there through the end of 2009  Given the inflation forecast, this   means a negative or close to negative real funds rate for almost two years  Despite this, Greenbook   April 29–30, 2008 45 of 266    baseline inflation expectations remain reasonably contained, and inflation is projected to decline   over the forecast period even as growth picks up toward trend  To put it kindly, I have serious   reservations about that scenario  The Greenbook discusses an alternative simulation in which there   is greater inflationary pressure  The estimated Taylor rule funds path in that is somewhat steeper   than in the baseline  Inflation ends up higher at the end of the forecast period—the end of 2011 and   2012—than in the baseline  More progress on inflation will require obviously a steeper path, but   even in this alternative simulation, inflation expectations only drift up  They do not become   unhinged  If they did, I would expect the policy path to have to be considerably tighter in 2009   Now, I know that talking about money in the context of monetary policy is not very   fashionable these days  But I would like to note that the monetary aggregates as measured by M2   and MZM have exploded  Despite the flight to quality and the associated increase in the demand   for money associated with that, M2 grew less than 5 percent during the fourth quarter of 2007    Since then, however, its growth rate has nearly tripled  In January it grew 8 percent on an   annualized basis  In February after our rate cuts, it grew 18 percent, and in March it grew   13 percent  Growth rates of MZM are even worse over this interval—for the three months the   annual rates were 14, 42, and 26 percent  Such rates suggest to me that there is substantial liquidity   in the economy  While I don’t really like the old P* model and have had a lot of problems with it, at   the back of the Greenbook the story it is telling is one of considerable inflation over the next couple   of years     Combined, the growth in the aggregates, the substantially negative real interest rates, and the   fact that most versions of the Taylor rule call for a higher fed funds rate than we have currently   heighten my angst about the outlook for inflation and our credibility  Market participants reacted to   the incoming data by appreciably tightening their policy expectations—at least as implied by the   April 29–30, 2008 46 of 266    futures markets, as Bill Dudley pointed out—and that has had a negligible effect, certainly no   negative effect, on markets or the economy more broadly  One interpretation is that the market   participants have also become uncomfortable, as I have, with a fed funds rate that remains too low   for too long  I take this as a healthy sign actually and one that we shouldn’t ignore  Indeed, we may   just wish to use it to our advantage  I will stop there, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  What I would like to do—it will probably   come as no surprise—is to make the case for why we should stand pat today and make no   change  My case is built on a number of points, and I’d like to articulate those as best I can   First, as we all know, the economic outlook has weakened since the start of the year, but   that deterioration occurred largely between January and March  Since the March meeting, there   has been little change in the Greenbook forecast or in my own outlook for the economy    Incoming data over the intermeeting period are consistent with a weak first half but not   appreciably weaker than we earlier anticipated  I believe that easing policy is appropriate in a   weaker economy, but continuing to cut rates for as long as the economy remains weak is not   appropriate  Although it is a difficult task, we must try to calibrate the appropriate level of the   fed funds rate with the economic prospects and our policy goals  I will just note that, since last   September, we have lowered the funds rate 300 basis points  This year alone, in a period of less   than 60 days, we have cut 200 basis points  This is a very aggressive policy of easing  Not   enough time has passed, in my view, to see the full effect on the economy of those cuts, and a   April 29–30, 2008 106 of 266    further 25 basis point cut in the funds rate at this point will do nothing to change the near-term   outlook of the economy   Second, we are currently running a very accommodative monetary policy, no matter how   you look at it  The real funds rate is negative or very negative, depending on which measures of   inflation you use to construct it  The nominal funds rate is below the level of most versions of   the Taylor rule, even when adjusting for some interest rate and real rate effects, given our   objectives  As I noted yesterday, monetary aggregates as measured by M2 and, to some extent,   MZM have expanded very rapidly, especially since our rate cuts in late January  Now, although   none of these measures of monetary accommodation or monetary ease is perfect—each has its   drawbacks—I am concerned that all the measures of monetary accommodation suggest that we   are very accommodative at the current time   Third, inflation is high, unacceptably high in my view, and has been that way for a   sustained period, as I talked about yesterday  Some would argue that the weakened economy   will bring the inflation rate down  But theory and experience both say that such will occur only   if expectations of inflation remain anchored  But since the end of last year, most measures of   expected inflation have moved up  The instability in the measures of expected inflation is a   cause for concern  It suggests to me that markets may be less convinced of our willingness to   take the necessary actions that are consistent with sustaining a credible commitment to price   stability  I certainly understand the difference between a relative price shock and inflation    Clearly, oil prices and other commodity prices are in part a relative price shock  There is no   question about that  But it is also true that in the 1970s one of our mistakes was that we   accommodated relative price shocks with very accommodative monetary policy, and in so doing   helped convert a relative price shock into sustained inflation  I think we should be careful not to   April 29–30, 2008 107 of 266    fall into the same trap  Besides, I think that in most monetary models today we worry   particularly about stabilizing core inflation because it represents the sticky prices in our sticky-  price models  So if relative price shocks begin to seep into the core, or into the sticky-price   elements, monetary theory would suggest that we need to respond to those  If we are going to   achieve something close to optimal monetary policy, we should be concerned about that seepage   because it may affect expectations and it is part of what monetary policy should be doing, at least   in that class of models   Although it is true that we have not seen much in the way of wage inflation to date and   that is encouraging, I would also reiterate, as some people noted yesterday, that wage inflation   tends to be a lagging, not a leading, indicator of overall inflation  Contrary to the Greenbook   forecast, which has us maintaining a negative real funds rate for two years and inflation coming   down, I think that, if we continue easing or maintain the real funds rate well below zero for a   period of time despite inflation well above our goal, it is reasonable to assume that expectations   will not remain anchored  The FOMC’s stated goal of price stability cannot remain credible   independent of our actions  If we want expectations to remain well anchored, we have to act in a   way that is consistent with that   Fourth, I believe that we are in the fortunate position today of being able to pause    Market participants have reacted to the incoming data by appreciably tightening their   expectations of future funds rate moves—at least as measured by the futures markets, as we have   seen  Participants seem to be getting less comfortable with the idea of very easy monetary policy   over a sustained period, given the outlook for inflation  I note that the markets’ reassessment of   their policy expectations over the intermeeting period doesn’t appear to have had any significant   negative effect on the markets, or the economy more broadly, during this period  I think this   April 29–30, 2008 108 of 266    reassessment by the markets presents us with an opportunity to reinforce our stated commitment   to price stability, not just with words but with action or, in this case, inaction  I think a pause   today would send a strong signal of our commitment to price stability, which could further help   anchor inflation expectations, which I consider to be very fragile  A pause, it seems to me,   balances the risks of the two parts of our mandate  Some might argue that, in the midst of the   financial market disruptions that we have seen this year, it is important for the Fed not to add to   market turmoil by taking policy actions not anticipated by the markets  The mean expectation   for the markets is for 25 basis points of easing today  But market participants are placing odds of   somewhere between 25 percent and 30 percent on our pausing, so I don’t think a pause would be   very disruptive to the markets  The magnitude of the surprise would be about the same as the   surprise we had last time when we cut 75 basis points  That surprise, in my view, did not really   cause much turmoil in the marketplace   Finally, when I say that cutting 25 basis points won’t help the outlook for the economy   very much, others might respond that cutting 25 basis points won’t hurt it very much either, so   why not  I disagree  I think a cut today will not be a disaster but will contribute to a further   eroding of our credibility in the eyes of the public  At past meetings this Committee has spoken   a lot about the need for rapid reversals of our rate cuts that we took out for insurance  I think we   should not be overly confident of our ability to implement such rapid reversals  In fact, the   lower the rates go, the further we will need to come back when we start taking the   accommodation back  I am dubious of our ability because we will be so much further from what   might be a more neutral rate   In summary, to my mind the gain in credibility from pausing today substantially   outweighs any negative effects from slightly disappointing the markets  It doesn’t preclude us   April 29–30, 2008 109 of 266    from choosing to resume cuts at a later date should economic conditions warrant them  After all,   I think this Committee has demonstrated its ability to act aggressively in response to economic   conditions, and we can do so again  But that is the future  For today, I think we should take the   opportunity that the economy and the markets have afforded us to pause  As the old Latin   expression says, “Carpe diem”     With regard to language, I am happy with alternative C  Rather than the language in   paragraph 4 of alternative C, I would prefer the language of paragraph 4 of alternative B  I   would just make that the language for paragraph 4 in alternative C—that is the only change that I   think would be necessary  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Excuse me  Make sure that you say you’re speaking for yourself, not for   me, in terms of how I think about policy   April 29–30, 2008 134 of 266     Yes, just an implementation question  One thing you talked about was in   periods of stress, the way we’ve conducted policy intraday, you have had firmness in the funds rate   in the morning and then weakness in the afternoon causing some intraday volatility  The difficulty   of hitting the target was partly the fact that we were entering the market only once a day, in the   morning, and you had to see through that  With all these other strategies, as they are implemented   in other countries, are the central banks doing the same thing?  Are they entering the market only   once a day, or do they come in several times a day?  I just wondered if there are differences in their   approaches as to how often they interact in the marketplace   April 29–30, 2008 173 of 266     Thank you, Mr Chairman  This will be very brief  Option 2 looks very   attractive to me  I think option 1 may be a fallback position, but like President Stern, given our   tendency to move slow too quickly, if that makes sense, I would rather take the opportunity to   make a larger step  So I think option 2 is fine  Option 5 is interesting, but its distinction is that   nobody else is really doing that  So it would be a little more of a wild card in terms of how we   might implement it and how it might work  But I think it has some merit   I had asked Bill Dudley back in the fall, when we were having trouble meeting the end-  of-day targets, about why we didn’t set the price  The answer I got was, “Well, this was a good   time to think about that option in the context of paying interest on reserves”  I was probably a   little disappointed that we didn’t see more of what such a strategy might look like and how it   would behave  Thanks to President Lacker, his interpretation of option 4 is pushing us more in   that direction  I hadn’t really thought of option 4 in that context that way, but I like it  I still   have the view that essentially looking at everything as a quantity-based view of how we go about   doing this restricts the way we think about what our options might be  So I would like to see a   little more explanation of what a price target, where we buy and sell, might actually do  How   that might interact with option 4 would be an interesting way to enrich the set of options   April 29–30, 2008 183 of 266    Another question I had—and I don’t know the answer to this—is that we have instituted a   number of new facilities  There is the TAF, there is the TSLF, and so forth  I wasn’t quite clear   how those facilities would interact or be appropriate or inappropriate within the context of these   things, or whether this would substitute for all of those in some sense  If we wanted to pull those   off the shelf again at some future time, how would they interact with these systems?  I think it   would be useful to have a little discussion about what those interactions might be   The last observation is related to President Lockhart’s comment  How we go about   paying interest on reserves has implications for other parts of what the Federal Reserve System   does—in particular the retail payment system and the way we calculate cost recoveries and our   revenues under the Monetary Control Act  There are some separate study groups that are   thinking about this, but we ought to make sure that we tie these pieces together as we go forward   so that we know what the domino effects of going this direction might be  Maybe there will not   be a concern, if we get out of retail payments, how it affects the Monetary Control Act   requirements on fees for services and things like that  I would like to see that loop closed   somehow before the end of the discussion  Otherwise, I want to congratulate the staff on a very   thorough report  I was at the conference as well in February  I thought it was very interesting,   and I applaud the staff on some good work  Thank you  "
8467,2008-06-24,PLOSSER,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Just to follow up on that question, I was at a   meeting in New York not too long ago and was talking with some people on Wall Street  They   suggested that for the primary dealers there was stigma attached to borrowing from the PDCF  I   wasn’t quite sure what to make of that, and I just wondered if you had any observations or   comments about whether you thought that was real or perceived, or is there an interpretation I   should give to that?    Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  In the Third District, as anticipated,   manufacturing activity, residential construction, and employment have remained weak    Nonresidential construction has now softened, although vacancy rates in Philadelphia and around   the District remain relatively low  Retail sales remain sluggish  Bank lending has been   restrained  The outlook among our business contacts, however, varies significantly by sector    Manufacturers expect a rebound in activity over the coming six months, and residential real   estate contacts report that they believe market conditions may be near bottom, although they   expect any recovery to be slow  Interestingly enough, it is the same sort of anecdotal evidence   June 24–25, 2008 51 of 253    that President Lockhart referred to  Now, it is hard to know whether it is just mostly wishful   thinking or whether there is something real there—although his saying it and my saying it sort of   reinforces it a little  But it is the first time that I have heard such news in a very, very long time    Retailers are quite pessimistic, however, because they are expecting the increase in energy prices   to limit sales, especially among lower-income customers, despite the tax rebates   Despite the soft economic conditions, the most prominent concern that we have heard   from our business contacts across a variety of industries is the run-up in commodity prices and   other prices  Thus far, firms have resisted passing along their rising costs to customers, to the   extent that they could, but many firms tell us that they have gone as far as they can on holding   the line on their own prices and plan to raise prices further in the next few months  Some firms   are including general cost-increase clauses in their new contracts  Earlier we saw various sorts   of fuel surcharges added onto prices, but now contracts are being written in a way that includes   broad cost-adjustment increases  This is still only anecdotal evidence although it has been   referred to—I think President Fisher made a couple of comments in this regard  But it may be   yet another early warning sign that inflation expectations cannot remain in check indefinitely in   this current environment  In June, the prices-paid index in our business outlook survey of   manufacturers rose to the highest level it has been since 1980  Manufacturers and firm contacts   across a wide range of industries say that they expect their input prices and the prices of their   own goods to increase further over the next six months  They see no abatement of price   pressures in the near term or medium term and are very pessimistic about inflation   The national economic situation is similar to what I see in my own District, and it is an   uncomfortable situation for all of us  The data we have received on economic activity over the   intermeeting period have come in slightly better than I expected, but the continued price   June 24–25, 2008 52 of 253    increases, particularly in oil and commodities, have been a very unpleasant development    Certainly, economic conditions remain weak, and the recent positive news may prove to be   transitory  From the financial side, credit spreads have fallen, bond issuance has risen, and it   appears that financial market functioning has at least improved  In my view, although downside   risks to growth remain, the tail risk of a very bad outcome has clearly been diminished   I expect GDP growth to come in around 17 percent this year—only marginally higher   than my April projection—before picking back up to trend of around 27 percent in 2009-10    Despite the upward revisions in the Greenbook baseline, my forecast remains somewhat more   optimistic for growth in 2008 and 2009 than the Greenbook  In fact, my forecast is similar to the   Board staff’s “upside risk” alternative scenario, which essentially removed the downward   adjustment factors the staff added to build in more recession-like features caused by the financial   turmoil and other factors not captured in their baseline model, which is what Dave was   mentioning earlier   My concerns about the inflation outlook have increased since our last meeting  I am not   alone  Inflation has become a predominant concern for many businesses and consumers, and you   only have to read the newspapers to see that  Obviously, monetary policy cannot control the   price of energy, but we do have a responsibility to act to keep broad-based inflation under   control  Contributing to the increase in inflation risk is not only the surge in energy and other   commodity prices; it is supported also by our own accommodative stance of monetary policy    Short-term inflation expectations and headline inflation measures are up significantly since our   last meeting  So far, core inflation increases have been modest, and long-term inflation   expectations remain, although volatile, within a tolerable range  But if we continue to maintain   the real funds rate well below zero, despite inflation that is well above acceptable levels, can we   June 24–25, 2008 53 of 253    really expect inflation expectations to remain anchored?  We must remember that longer-term   inflation expectations tend to lag inflation not to lead it  If we wait until these measures rise, we   will be too late   Apropos of President Evans’s question about wages, I have been troubled by stories in   the press suggesting that we can be less concerned about inflation than we were in the 1970s   because wages haven’t risen and labor unions are less prominent  These stories suggest that the   wage–price spiral caused the unanchoring of inflation expectations in the ’70s  But I think this   gets the direction of causation backwards  In my view, the story of the ’70s was that the public   lacked confidence in the central bank’s commitment to price stability—it didn’t believe the   central bank would take the necessary steps to bring inflation under control  As a consequence,   inflation expectations rose and wages rose  It was the higher inflation and the lack of credibility   that led to higher wage demands     The key to avoiding such a situation, in my view, is maintaining the credibility that the   Fed has worked so hard to achieve  The Board staff memo on optimal monetary policy in the   context of higher oil prices illustrates the importance of maintaining credibility, and I want to   thank the staff for their efforts in this regard  I think it was an excellent piece of work  As they   clearly say, the critical factor in containing inflation through an expectations channel is the belief   that policymakers will always adhere to a full-commitment rule  When the central bank is   unable or unwilling to commit in a credible manner to future policy actions or to a long-run   inflation goal, the result is both higher inflation and lower output  In the real world, of course,   full commitment can never absolutely be achieved  But beliefs about which regime better   approximates reality are informed by the actions taken by the central bank to maintain its   commitment to price stability   June 24–25, 2008 54 of 253    I believe that the FOMC has done a good job with our words—including FOMC   statements, minutes, and speeches—in helping to anchor longer-term expectations  I believe the   Chairman’s speech at the Boston Fed conference earlier this month delivered a well-articulated   and important message about the importance of keeping longer-term inflation expectations   anchored  But our credibility rests on more than just words  We must act in a way that is   consistent with our hard-earned reputation, or our credibility could soon vanish  To underscore   our words, we should take actions and take back some of the insurance we have put on in the   context of elevated downside tail risks   Given recent economic developments and the improvement in financial market   functioning, coupled with our accommodative stance of policy, it seems pretty clear to me that, if   the economy continues to evolve as it has over the past couple of months, we should move to   raise the funds rate  This is also the view of market participants, whose expectations for policy   have steepened considerably over the intermeeting period  My forecast, therefore, incorporates a   monetary policy path that is steeper than the one in the Greenbook  I assume that the funds rate   will reach 275 percent by the end of 2008 and move up to 45 percent by the end of 2009  This   steeper funds rate path is necessary, in my view, to deliver inflation that is declining back toward   our goal   Regarding the suggestion by the Subcommittee on Communications on lengthening the   forecast period, I think it can be a very useful device, and I support it  My preference, however,   is for option 2, although I think option 1 could work just as well  I’m for option 2 partly because   I, too, am less confident about forecasting whatever the dynamic adjustment process happens to   be, and so just going to year 5 I think would be useful  Omitting year 4 is not omitting any   information that is terribly informative, as far as I am concerned  I am a little reluctant to go to   June 24–25, 2008 55 of 253    some longer-term average like five-to-ten years because I think that muddles the communication   picture and may signal a weakening of our commitment about the timeframe over which we   think we can really achieve some objective  So I am most comfortable with option 2, or I could   be happy with option 1 as well  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  In my view the economy is evolving in a way   that suggests that we need to take back sooner rather than later some of the insurance we put in   place against downside tail risk  I base this view on several points  First, economic activity remains   weak  I don’t dispute that  The data since our last meeting have been better than expected  The   Greenbook forecasts as well as most private-sector forecasts have been revised up  So although   downside risks remain, the tail risk of a significant recession-like outcome for the economy, though   it has not vanished, has certainly diminished  Second, financial market indicators suggest that   market functioning, though not back to normal, has certainly improved somewhat in recent months    Demand for Fed liquidity from the primary dealers has fallen  Primary credit borrowing generally   is down  Now, although we may wish to keep our liquidity facilities for now as a backstop, the   extra accommodation that we have built into monetary policy may no longer be needed or even   appropriate at this point  The real economy and financial functioning have improved since our last   meeting, but the inflation outlook has worsened, as we have been hearing  Headline inflation is up    Expectations of various kinds are elevated  Upside risk to core inflation has increased, as the   Greenbook has said  As I said yesterday, these upside risks stem not only from the potential pass-  through of energy prices but also, in my view, from the fact that we’re running a very   accommodative policy despite rising inflation     In fact, I believe that policy has actually become more accommodative since the meeting at   the end of April  First, the nominal funds rate has been at a constant level, but expectations of   inflation have risen  So, in fact, the real funds rate has actually declined since our last meeting as   June 24–25, 2008 112 of 253    inflation has risen  Second, real rates of interest more broadly have been gradually drifting up since   late March or early April  The TIPS rates, the real interest rates, have been drifting up by,   depending on which term you look at, anywhere from 25 basis points to 35 basis points  So as the   real rates on risk-free securities have risen, which may be appropriate given the fact that prospects   for the real economy have improved modestly, the real funds rate has been declining  As a   consequence, whatever you think about the level of the fed funds rate, we have become more   accommodative since the last meeting   As I’ve argued before in this Committee, optimal monetary policy in a broad class of   models suggests that you get Taylor-rule-like rules but that the funds rate follows the real interest   rate as it moves around  Optimal policy calls for following the real rates  I argued that was the case   and appropriate as real rates fell in the context of a weakening economy  It was important that   policy match those declines in the real rates, which I think it did  It’s a coherent policy, but it also   means that as real rates begin to rise, as we have been seeing, policy needs to adjust to those real   rates rising  Now, of course, a lot of judgment is required in this type of policy  There are   smoothing issues  Real rates could be quite volatile  There’s debate about which real rate you want   to be looking at  I understand that  But I don’t think there’s any question that the objective should   be to match those movements in the real rates, and we should be thinking about it in those terms   Long-term inflation expectations have been volatile but have moved within a reasonably   defined range over the last period, and I’m comforted somewhat by that  But as I have said, I   believe that inflation expectations are fragile  At the very least, the anchor is dragging, and if we   continue to maintain a real funds rate well below zero with rising inflation well above our goal, I do   not think we can continue to assume and trust that expectations will remain well anchored   June 24–25, 2008 113 of 253    We’ve done a good job with our words so far, but with the shift from downside risk to   growth to upside risk to inflation, we need to take action to ensure that price stability remains a   credible objective of this Committee  If the economy and financial markets continue to evolve as   they have over the last couple of months, that time may be soon  We must take back some of the   insurance we put on  Not doing so soon risks having to respond more aggressively later on, which I   believe will be much more difficult for the Committee to do  In fact, smaller moves sooner will   help with our credibility in the marketplace and will help anchor those expectations as we wait for   more data and for the economy to strengthen     In this regard, I think we are fortunate that market participants reacted to the incoming data   by appreciably tightening their policy expectations  Thus, a move to raise rates is unlikely to catch   them off guard  Moreover, I don’t think that we should disabuse them of such policy expectations    Some might argue that an increase in policy expectations is a negative development  I would   disagree  I think that it reflects rising expectations of a somewhat stronger economy and concerns   about inflation  As the Chairman said, we should resist any erosion, any rise in longer-term   inflation expectations  Now, as I said, the timing of such a move is a judgment call, and I expect   that my views will differ from those of some of my colleagues, particularly since I had my fed funds   rate path rising to 2¾ percent by the end of ’08  So let me turn to language   In the rationale in paragraph 2, I have only one suggestion  I think that we should   acknowledge that the functioning of financial markets, while not back to normal, has improved  So   instead of saying “financial markets remain under considerable stress,” which we have said for   some time, perhaps it might be easy to say just that the financial markets remain under stress,   leaving out “considerable”  That acknowledges the fact that there’s some improvement but that   stress is still there  Finally, in paragraph 4, I am pleased that the revisions make more explicit that   June 24–25, 2008 114 of 253    the upside risks to inflation and inflation expectations have increased and that the downside risks to   growth remain but are diminished  I was going to suggest that we strike “near-term,” but Brian beat   me to the punch there  So I approve of that change  I think that’s very good  In alternative B, I   would prefer that we add some of the language from the Chairman’s recent speech to paragraph 4  I   think it would be a stronger message that the Committee will take actions to ensure that inflation   expectations do not become unhinged, and it would also convey that both parts of our dual mandate,   price stability and economic growth, are at risk should inflation expectations become unhinged    Thank you, Mr Chairman    Governor Kohn, a question, or a comment, about interest rates  A lot of   our discussion has been centered on how accommodative we think policy is and how we interpret it   in the current environment  If I want to quantify the magnitude a bit, at least the way I think about   it, even if I believe that the economy is weak enough so that the appropriate equilibrium real rate of   interest is zero, we have inflation running somewhere north of 3 percent  That would suggest a   nominal funds rate of about 3 percent as opposed to 2 percent  So roughly speaking, I would   interpret that to say that we have roughly 100 basis points of extra accommodation built into our fed   funds rate relative to what—and that’s assuming an equilibrium real rate of zero, which might even   be low  So if I’m thinking about it that way, could you clarify how we should quantify it in some   way?    I apologize    Given that I suggested removing the word “considerable,” my purpose   there was merely to indicate, as many people around the table have said, that things are   somewhat better  I don’t think that we should suggest that problems are solved, because things   are still under stress  I agree with Vice Chairman Geithner in that regard  I am willing to   withdraw that suggestion  I don’t feel that strongly about it  I thought it would have been useful   to convey a direction that we saw  But I don’t disagree with Vice Chairman Geithner’s   suggestion that these things can reverse themselves and maybe a little more stability might save   us some zigging and zagging down the road  So I withdraw that suggestion  I can live with the   language as it is, if that simplifies things    As they always do    Yes  I asked Bill Dudley yesterday a question about what I had heard   from the Street—that they perceived that stigma was attached to it  With this conversation, it   certainly appears to me that I was hearing them say that, at least from the investment banks’ point of   June 24–25, 2008 152 of 253    view, they do feel that some stigma is already attached to it, good or bad  Now that I’ve heard this   discussion, it is consistent with what I was hearing from those Wall Street firms    So—I’m sorry—what percentage would that be?  When you say it’s   growing, is it now 10, 20, 50, or 80 percent?    On that point, I have been reading a bit recently  It might be useful in   thinking about some of these issues about how we tie our hands and the mechanism for doing that    The IMF went through an extraordinary study effort during the sovereign debt crisis and came up   with some very important mechanisms for how to change the contracts that were being written by   sovereign countries so as to avoid the IMF’s having to step in and look for other solutions, which is,   I think, along the same lines  I don’t know whether or not there are things from which to learn in   parallel with that to think about how we approach that issue    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I will be very brief  A lot of my views have   been shared already  Just to expand on President Rosengren’s comment—how we define the   right institutions, the scope of this, I think that some of the questions here are really hard  It is   my understanding that the workgroups we talked about last time are going to be working on   some of these things, and we need to get those well under way to help us define these problems    On the longer-term problem—Vice Chairman Geithner made this point, and I just want to   June 24–25, 2008 177 of 253    reiterate it—it is really important in the short run that we not do things that constrain our longer-  term options  It is a very slippery slope that the long run ends up being transformed into a series   of short-term steps, and by that almost inevitably you end up in places you don’t want to be  So I   just want to make sure that we stay abreast of that and not let that happen to us—that we find   ourselves six months from now in a position where, gee, we wish we hadn’t done that  So I just   wanted to stress that again   I’m fine with extending the facilities through the end of the year  I don’t have any   tremendous problem with that, although I have always been a little puzzled by “unusual and   exigent circumstances”  What does that really mean?  How do we define that?  It would be a lot   easier for me to think about when to take it off if I knew what the criteria were for putting it on    It would be helpful to me, anyway, if we could work on defining those criteria a little more   rigorously  I know there will be judgment involved in that at the end of the day  I don’t disagree   with that  But it would help us to define what we mean by that because it is going to be really   hard to define what we mean by a “systemically important institution”  I am not sure I know the   answer to that  I think it is a very difficult question  So I am okay on the short run     I will just reiterate the other point that President Stern made about the issue of credibility   and commitment  You know, I have talked a lot about this over the last couple of years   regarding monetary policy  It applies equally well in this framework  Figuring out ways to   implement our policies, whatever they may be, in both a time-consistent and committed way, and   defining those boundaries and how we live up to them, is a really hard problem  But I don’t   think we can avoid dealing with it, and it is going to be a critical piece of how we think about the   longer term  I will just leave it at that    I want to come back to one of Governor Warsh’s comments, just probe   it a little further, because I was intrigued by his notion that in some way trying to wean ourselves   from this he suggested that we raise the price  It occurred to me in that same context, if we   thought that had value in some sense, another way we could do the transition is to cut back either   the frequency or the size of the TSLF, as we sort of wean the markets off access  Announcing   both those things in advance might have some value to us moving forward  I wanted to hear   other people’s thoughts and reactions  "
8492,2008-07-24,PLOSSER,"  I want to go back to the collateral issue for a minute  I share some of   the concerns about the options on the TSLF that President Lacker and President Hoenig were   discussing  I assume we will come back and talk more about some of those things, but I do have   a question about the collateral  My understanding in the discussion about the larger collateral on   term lending is that it would also apply to the primary credit lending, which means that if   somebody came into the primary credit facility and asked for primary credit of two or three days,   July 24, 2008 15 of 50    they would have to have this 125 percent or this extra collateral  Is that the way we are   interpreting this thing, and is that really what we want to be doing by raising the collateral on   term loans at the primary credit facility?  I am just confused about that and whether—particularly   on things less than 30 days, the primary credit facility—we want to be applying the same   standard to that lending as we are on the longer TAF stuff  Just a question    Yes  But if they really want a week-long loan, do we really want to be   encouraging our depository institutions coming in to just roll it over one day after one day after   one day after one day  It seems to me, that really changes the nature of the way most of our   July 24, 2008 16 of 50    primary credit has been made  For us, in particular, the collateral that most banks use for   primary credit is not the sort of securities that they can pull in and pull out very easily—a lot of it   is loan collateral and securities of that type  If you really want more collateral on these longer-  term loans, making it more than just one day, it seems to me, is too short  I am just wondering if   it makes more sense, so that we don’t drastically change the nature of the primary credit window,   to say it is longer than 30 days or some other time frame  I realize it is going to be a discrete   point at which it turns over  But I just think it would be very awkward, and I don’t think it is   really necessary for the very short term end    That would make a little more sense  You know, anything in excess of   30 days or somewhere in that range would make a little more sense to me anyway    Thank you, Mr Chairman  There are just two other observations I want   to share  They aren’t direct questions, just sort of my thoughts on this  In general, I am okay   with the extension to the 84 days—I don’t think that is problematic  As I mentioned before in   our meetings, I really would like to see some more clarification and standards applied to what the   July 24, 2008 21 of 50    Board and the staff mean by “unusual and exigent circumstances,” how we define that term and   how we know when it is time to take it off  I understand that there is stress in the marketplace  I   am not disputing that  But I think as we go forward—and following up on President Hoenig’s   point—it would be useful if we had a way of discussing more explicitly the criteria that we use to   put this on or take it off  So at some point I would like to have some discussion about that   The other point I would make is that I am just not persuaded by the staff’s arguments   about the options  The TSLF is undersubscribed  If we wanted to make loans available, we   could offer more-frequent auctions  We aren’t tied to any particular two-week schedule  We   could offer auctions near the end of the quarter  I am just not convinced that this is going to   provide much to the marketplace  Even the staff suggested that it might be marginal  The more   we tweak and change these things and try to provide things that we don’t know whether they are   needed, I am not persuaded that they are adding anything  I think the 84 days runs over quarter-  end  There are auctions as much as one week or two weeks before quarter-end every quarter    There are funds available  So I am just not sure that this is necessary  Thank you    I’ll pass, except for just a brief comment  I agree with what President   Lacker was saying about the options  If we are going to create new specialized facilities, the hurdle   for the problem we think we will be solving ought to be a little higher than just, well, we think it   might help a little  That’s all  Thank you    Yes  I’m comfortable with 84, but I also have some sympathy for the   view of having two tranches, and 28 and 84 would be fine with me as well  "
8515,2008-08-05,PLOSSER,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I want to follow up on that a little because it   seems to me that, over a year ago now, there was a lot of discussion by various parties that had to   do with risk premiums being very low  People were worried that the economy and the financial   markets were underpricing risk  Now, all of a sudden, these spreads have increased  If you look   at the OIS spread that you referred to, the one-to-two years out, is there a possibility that this is   permanent—that in some sense the level of spreads in the pricing of the risk is just now higher   August 5, 2008 10 of 145    and it is going to stay higher, maybe not as high as the peak but at some higher level?  If that is   true, then using those spreads as a measure of how distressed the market is could be very   misleading  As a consequence, it would seem as though you would want to be asking questions   not just about the prices and the spreads but also about volumes in these markets  Maybe, Bill,   you can elaborate on what volumes are doing—certainly in the near-term, the overnight, and the   one-month interbank funding markets?  Are volumes back to their levels even though the spreads   are higher?  I think we have to be a little careful that, if this really is a permanent shift in risk   premiums, looking at these things may be the wrong metric for assessing what is going on  If   you have any observations about that, I would like to hear them    How about volumes?    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I have two questions  First, on the Greenbook   forecast, one thing that struck me is that there was a fairly large revision in your forecast for   nonresidential structures going forward  In fact, after a pretty good showing in the first half of this   year, you marked down the second half of this year for that and marked down substantially 2009  In   the last Greenbook, you had structures actually growing positively in 2009; now it’s minus 4   percent, something like that  Is that driven by something in the model, or is that some adjustment   factor that was added in?  If so, what was the rationale for that, or why might it be coming out?    Why do we have that change?  Then I’ll follow up with another question    But the change is not just in the second half of this year  You’ve got a big   change for ’09, too    If we think about the phrase that people use—“financial headwinds”—and   the credit problems that we see, my interpretation of how the staff has modeled that is on the   demand side—of restrained credit limiting demand  But I can also think of the financial sector as   having been hit by a very significant productivity shock, if you will, where the production function   for intermediation has taken a huge productivity shock to it  So in thinking about a model in which   that has happened, you might find yourself thinking about the consequences of that, particularly   how that affects the path of potential output over the near term  If you think that type of shock is   driving potential output down over the near term, depending on the magnitude of that, it is going to   affect your estimates of the gaps and therefore your estimates of inflation and what the economy   looks like going forward  So I guess my second question is, Have you thought much about this, or   is much of this incorporated in the evolution of your output gaps or your potential output measures,   working through that channel?  If so, what might be the ramifications for inflation and policy going   forward?    August 5, 2008 24 of 145     So maybe I’m not so kooky after all  [Laughter]    So in the way you’ve modeled this in your forecast, are you thinking of   yourselves as modeling that net effect, or do you think of yourselves as modeling and forecasting   just one side?  Have you made any effort to incorporate both sides of this potential effect?  Even   though it may be small, the question is how small it is    Thank you    On the inventories and the sequencing, which I think is very interesting   because of how it plays out, I learned recently—and you can correct me if this is wrong—that, in   the inventory of new homes for sale, the way that’s counted includes permits that have been issued   even though there’s no home that’s been built  So a developer may get permits but may not have   started the home yet  It may just be sitting on a pile of permits  So if that’s correct, and I think it is,   August 5, 2008 33 of 145    it means that, if you think about the sequencing of what’s going to happen as demand begins to turn   around, those permits don’t have to get bought, but they may start building on permits that they’ve   already been issued and they haven’t started building yet  Is that a correct way of looking at the   data?    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Economic conditions in the Third District   remain relatively weak, but they are not materially different from what we and our business   contacts have been expecting for the past several months  Manufacturing and residential   construction sectors continue to show a slow decline  Payroll employment in our three states fell   August 5, 2008 58 of 145    in June, but it is still above the levels of where it was three months ago and so has been   performing somewhat better than in the nation as a whole   The pace of retail sales seems to have been softening, and commercial real estate firms   indicate that most office and industrial markets have weakened slightly since the spring  My   business contacts generally expect weak growth for a while  Manufacturers do expect a rebound   during the next six months; but most other sectors, particularly retail sales, anticipate only soft or   slightly improving conditions in the near term  Residential real estate is not expected to   strengthen appreciably in the second half of the year  Banks expect somewhat sluggish growth   in overall lending for the rest of the year, although compared with some regions, banks in our   District are in pretty good shape  There are stresses, but they seem to be manageable  Credit,   however, is generally available to businesses, and we hear only sporadic information from   businesses that they are unable to obtain needed loans     For some time my business contacts have expressed concern about rising energy and   commodity and transport prices  Our business outlook survey’s prices-paid index rose yet again   in July, and it is now at its highest level since March 1980  Although the prices-received index   edged down slightly, it remains at a very, very high level relative to historical standards  The   BOS’s future prices-received index rose to 496 percent, which is the highest level it has been   since January 1989  This indicates that roughly half the manufacturing firms that responded to   our survey expect the prices they receive for their products to be increased over the next six   months  To gauge the extent to which manufacturing firms have been able to pass on rising costs   to their customers, we asked several special questions about product pricing in our July survey    More than 60 percent of our respondents indicated that, since the beginning of the year, they   have been able to raise prices and pass along increased costs to their customers  About   August 5, 2008 59 of 145    26 percent said this took the form of increases in base prices  Almost half of them had increased   base prices  The rest said they have used either surcharges or escalator clauses and, in some   cases, combined those with base price increases as well  Surcharges and escalation clauses are   not likely to go away anytime soon and may even become more widespread  About 56 percent   of our respondents indicated that price escalation clauses and surcharges are likely to be a part of   their pricing in the future  Further, since a large number of firms have already built cost   increases into their base prices, it is not clear at all that prices will come down quickly, even if   oil prices stabilize at a lower level   On the national level, the incoming data since our June meeting have been mixed but   largely in line with my expectations for the near-term path of the economy  Real GDP growth   for the second quarter came in somewhat weaker than many expected, although I will note that   as recently as April many people were expecting negative growth in the second quarter and it is   now almost 2 percent  But I think that the strength is a remarkable testament to the ability of this   economy to weather shocks from financial market disruptions, a severe housing correction, and   surges in energy and commodity prices  Nonfarm payroll employment has fallen an average of   66,000 jobs per month over the last seven months—a weak number to be sure but not nearly as   severe as the job losses over the last three recessions, which averaged nearly 180,000 jobs a   month  Since our June meeting, we have taken further steps to address fragile financial markets   that were manifested by the difficulties surrounding the GSEs and the IndyMac takeover   On balance, my outlook for the economy is little changed, although the financial market   developments since our last meeting have marginally increased the uncertainty surrounding my   forecast  I do see near-term weak growth for the economy, but I continue to expect an   improvement in output and employment growth next year as the economy rebounds closer to   August 5, 2008 60 of 145    trend  Unfortunately, there has been a resurgence in financial market volatility, especially on the   part of the banking sector and mortgage markets related to the problems of the GSEs  The   liquidity in the interbank and primary dealer markets appears to have improved somewhat   relative to the first quarter of this year     I read the conditions in the financial markets and the wide spreads on selected assets as   having improved somewhat on net and the spreads we are seeing increasingly reflecting real   credit risk as opposed to dysfunctional markets  As I indicated in my questions earlier, we   should not use such spreads as the primary criteria for assessing the fragility of the financial   markets  Moreover, we must be cautious in using monetary policy or other tools at our disposal   as a form of forbearance that delays the necessary adjustments in the pricing of various financial   claims  I think we need a high hurdle—that there are real market failures—before we intervene   to stem liquidity desires on the part of traders or attempt to influence the price of specific asset   classes  To agree with President Bullard’s comments, we should begin to deemphasize and de-  stress the importance of systemic risk because I think it is gradually dissipating as firms adjust to   the more volatile and risky environment   The current state of the financial markets seems to me to bear some resemblance to the   financial headwinds analogy that many people referred to during the early 1990s  Indeed,   spreads on many forms of business and consumer loans are behaving now much in the way as   they typically behave during recessionary times as credit risks rise  In the early ’90s, monetary   policy was less accommodative than it is now—at least the funds rate reached a low point of 3   percent from October 1992 to February 1994—and during that time headline PCE inflation ran   about 2 to 3 percent  The real funds rate, measured by a one-quarter-ahead forecast of the CPI   from the professional forecasters, was minus 01 percent over the six quarters from 1993Q3 to   August 5, 2008 61 of 145    1994Q4  Currently, the real funds rate using the same measure of one-quarter-ahead   professional forecasters’ CPI stands at minus 11 percent   The inflation outlook remains a cause of concern  Headline inflation is higher, and there   is evidence of modest pass-through to core inflation measures  Inflation compensation on the   six-to-ten-year horizon has risen modestly  Inflation compensation at the near term has fallen   with recent declines in oil prices, but it remains volatile  The staff has suggested that a portion of   the increase in the longer-dated inflation compensation measures may reflect an increase in   inflation risk premiums  That is, markets are uncertain about the long-run path of inflation  This   is not terribly comforting  It suggests that our credibility may be waning   Despite the recent drop in oil prices, I remain uncomfortable with the longer-term   inflation outlook  Indeed, the focus of monetary policy must be on the intermediate to longer   term, and we must resist the temptation to act as if our funds rate decisions can manage the   outcomes over the very near term  Year-over-year inflation, headline CPI and PCE inflation,   have now been consistently above 3 percent since October 1987  Year-over-year core PCE   inflation has exceeded 2 percent every month but one since April 2004  That is four years    Businesses are reporting an increased willingness to pass on cost increases  Near term, we might   get some moderation in headline inflation, if the recent drop in oil prices holds  This might   result in less upward pressure on inflation expectations, at least in the near term  Of course, as   has been pointed out, oil prices are notoriously hard to predict, and we may well see a resurgence   in oil prices before the year’s end; but we don’t know  More important, a drop in oil prices will   only temporarily mask what I view as the underlying inflationary pressures  Oil prices have   clearly exacerbated the recent numbers and may mitigate them in the near term going forward     August 5, 2008 62 of 145    But my concern is that the real source of intermediate-term to longer-term inflationary   pressures comes from our own accommodative policy, whose consequences for inflation will be   felt only over time  We are unable to control the rise in oil prices and its consequences for   inflation in the short term, but we must hold ourselves accountable for the longer-term   consequences of our choices  Should we maintain our accommodative stance for too much   longer, my view is that we are likely to see higher trend inflation in the intermediate term and a   ratcheting up of inflation expectations  If that scenario unfolds, it will take a much more costly   policy action to re-anchor those expectations than the cost of a preemptive move to raise the   funds rate in the near term   To be sure, shifting policy to a less accommodative stance will be a difficult decision to   make, given the continued volatility in financial markets and the projected near-term weakness in   employment and output growth  However, what has been referred to as the tail risk of a very   negative growth outcome has decreased since the start of the year, whereas inflation risks have   increased  I think the enhancements we have made to our liquidity facilities should be sufficient   to address any remaining dysfunctions in the financial markets, but they will not address the   credit or solvency issues, nor should we expect them or desire them to do so  The markets will   have to do that admittedly heavy lifting  I do not believe that we can wait until employment   growth and the financial markets have completely turned around to begin to reverse course  But   by our aggressive attention to short-term risk to growth and financial turmoil, we do put at some   risk our ability to deliver on our intermediate- and longer-term goals of both price stability and   sustainable growth  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  As you can imagine, as we’ve discussed, this   meeting presents a difficult policy position for us—and for me in particular  I think we must pay   careful attention to the financial market volatility; and to the extent that it has consequences for the   real economy, I’m certainly sensitive to that concern  I had a similar experience with my board of   directors that President Evans did  I went into my board recommending no change and got   considerable push-back in discussion about how we dissent and what the consequences of doing   August 5, 2008 117 of 145    that are  They are concerned about inflation, and I’m concerned about our mandate to keep longer-  term and intermediate-term inflation in check   We’re unlikely, in my view, to get confirming or convincing evidence about whether   expectations have become unanchored until well after the fact  I agree there has been very little   wage–price pressure to date  But that will be the last shoe to drop in this sequence of raising   expectations, and by the time we get to that, I’m afraid it will be too late  I think in the near term we   might see some relief in headline inflation; but as has been discussed, whether that will persist is   highly dubious   My real concern is that I believe that monetary policy is accommodative, and with all due   respect, Mr Chairman, when I look at the data comparing the levels of borrowing rates of   consumers and businesses, both the levels in real and nominal terms and the spreads, what we see in   this period looks remarkably similar to what we’ve seen in lots of other recessionary, slow growth   periods  So, again, following the analogy that President Lacker was using, I see this period as less   atypical and more typical of what we see in slow-growth periods  I think it’s important that we   begin to prepare the markets for an impending shift to a tighter policy  I agree with President   Hoenig  The request here is not for tight policy but somewhat less accommodative policy; and if we   choose to go with no funds rate increase today, I think the language must help prepare the markets   going forward   I’m pleased with a lot of the discussion around the table  We are actually beginning to talk,   I think, about what our exit strategy is going to be from this  I think it’s very important to have   those conversations, and I appreciate them  I, too, share the observations that President Evans had   about talking with people who say, “Well, we can’t possibly remove accommodation until we get   August 5, 2008 118 of 145    rid of the facilities”  I think that is wrong  As you said, Mr Chairman, actually having the facilities   might make it easier for us to correct monetary policy, and I think that’s very, very important   I guess my bottom line is that I can accept leaving the funds rate unchanged today as long as   our language is sufficiently strong about inflation  To that end, I was actually a little more   comfortable with the draft table 1  I didn’t like the addition of the word “also”  I thought that   weakened the statement  I would prefer paragraph 4 without the “also”  I also have one other,   minor observation about paragraph 3, and that’s the first sentence, which says that “inflation has   been high, spurred by the earlier increases in the prices of energy and some other commodities”    Well, I think that’s partly true, but I’m concerned that somehow it conveys the impression that the   problem with inflation is oil and commodities, when in fact more correctly my concern about   inflation is not just oil  My concern is about the stance of policy  So I would put on the table the   possibility of saying that “inflation has been high, partly spurred by high oil and commodity prices”   to say that it’s more than just the short-term behavior of commodity prices  I think the word “also”   means that inflation concerns there are added as an afterthought, which is my reading of the change   from the draft table 1 to paragraph 4  So I prefer that “also” be eliminated  Thank you, Mr   Chairman  "
8539,2008-09-16,PLOSSER,"  Just a question on the PDCF, about the expansion of the collateral base    You said there was $42 billion, $28 billion of it was Lehman  Do we know what kind of   collateral Lehman posted?  Did they actually make use of the expanded options or not?  What   was the nature of it, do you know?    I just have one clarification  I have no basic objection to this  I wonder   whether or not, if the FOMC is going to delegate the decision to this group, it is sort of an open-  ended delegation to do this on an ongoing basis  Does it make sense to define a period of time   for which this open-ended delegation is appropriate—that it would expire and would have to be   renewed?   September 16, 2008 15 of 108     Yes  I think it ought to have a termination point so that, if we wanted to   renew it, we would be free to do so, but it wouldn’t last forever    Can we read the resolution?    As actions are taken, presumably you’ll circulate the outcomes of these   decisions to this Committee in advance of any announcements?    We’re all trying to be brief, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  New data and survey and anecdotal   information in the Third District suggest that the economy in our District continues to be weak    There have been further declines in some industries and deceleration of growth in others, but   generally data are coming in as expected  Employment growth was flat over the three-month   period ending in July, and I expect that unemployment rates in our three states will tick up in   August, when the regional data come out, much as it did in the national data   Overall, the activity in our region, as I said, has remained weak since the last meeting    Housing construction continues to be weak  Sales of existing homes remain sluggish, and   inventories remain high  One builder said, “Things don’t feel very good  I feel as though I am in   a tar pit  My feet are maybe now on the bottom; my nose is still above the level of the tar; and   while I may feel the bottom, it still doesn’t feel very good”  On the commercial real estate side,   we saw a slight uptick in the value of July contracts, but they are not very high  In fact, they   really remained at the average level of the last seven years  Retailers remain pessimistic in the   latest Beige Book  District banks saw loans rise slowly but steadily in August  The Beige Book   reports from them see slight gains in consumer and real estate lending and C&I loans essentially   flat   The good news is from our business outlook survey for September, which will be   released to the public on Thursday at 1000 am, but the results are in  The survey is from the   first two weeks of September  The general activity index has been negative, if you recall, for the   last nine months—since December 2007  The last value was minus 127  The September   September 16, 2008 37 of 108    number, not to be released until Thursday, is a positive 34, so that’s a swing of 15 points to the   good  This is clearly somewhat encouraging, although we don’t want to get too excited about   one month—but it is good news  Furthermore, both the new orders and shipment indexes in the   survey improved in September  Price pressures have abated somewhat with the fall in   commodities and oil, but they remain  The six-month-ahead outlook indexes also improved   substantially in the new survey  This is the best picture that the survey has painted in certainly   quite a while—about the last six or eight months  In summary, the economic conditions of the   Third District remain weak and sluggish but are not materially different from what we and our   business contacts had been expecting over the near term   While a lot of attention in the short run is being paid to financial markets’ turmoil, our   decision today must look beyond today’s financial markets to the real economy and its prospects   in the future  In this regard, things have not changed very much, at least not yet  Indeed, the   Greenbook forecast has changed only modestly since the last Greenbook  The economy remains   weak but not appreciably different from what I anticipated or even what the Greenbook   anticipated at the last meeting  I agree that the recent financial turmoil may ultimately affect the   outlook in a significant way, but that is far from obvious at this point  We also need to   acknowledge the long lag times associated with the effect of monetary policy actions on the real   economy  Actions today will not help us very much in the very, very near term where the real   economy is concerned   On the inflation front, there has been some good news  The decline in the retail price of   gas has contributed to a decline in headline inflation in August  In my view, the price declines in   commodities and oil have mitigated somewhat the upward pressure on expectations and have   reduced the likelihood that inflation expectations will become unanchored, at least in the near   September 16, 2008 38 of 108    term  Nevertheless, I remain concerned about the inflation outlook going forward  In part, my   concern stems from the fact that I do not see that the ongoing expected slowdown in economic   activity is entirely demand driven  As I noted before, the impact of financial shocks and high   commodity prices can plausibly lead to a decline in the growth rate of potential output  If so,   there will be less offset to inflation going forward than incorporated in the baseline Greenbook   forecast, which relies heavily on slack variables to control inflation  The Greenbook simulation   entitled “costly reallocation” provides some welcome effort from the staff in this regard, and I   appreciate that  Yet the details of that experiment were a bit sketchy for me, and at some point I   would be interested in a little more detail as to how that actually plays out   In my view, the main driver for the outlook of future inflation over the next two years is   not, nor has it been, oil prices per se, but the path of monetary policy that the Committee will   adopt over the next several months and quarters  I appreciate the memo that the staff produced   regarding the stance of monetary policy  According to the memo, the current stance of policy is   not unusually accommodative  However, I would like to note that that conclusion depends   critically on the specific forecast and the nature of the FRB/US model  A different model, one   that says that inflation expectations are more forward looking, may well lead to a very different   conclusion  But I take the message of the memo to be that the assessment of the stance of   monetary policy is dependent, at a point in time, on a model, and I very much agree with that   assessment  Given that my model is somewhat different from the staff’s model, I continue to   believe that monetary policy at its current level is accommodative and that, if this current stance   is sustained, the economy will experience faster inflation in the medium term  Clearly, we must   pay attention to the adverse effects of the financial disruptions  But we also must recognize that   our policy actions today and over the next several months will affect the outcomes of inflation   September 16, 2008 39 of 108    over the medium term  As I said, it is my view that the current stance of policy is inconsistent   with price stability in the intermediate term and so rates ultimately will have to rise   Now, I acknowledge that there are risks to economic growth going forward  The   slowdown and the financial market turmoil could turn out to be worse than I expect  I also   recognize that, given the events over the weekend, now is probably not the time to shock markets   by raising rates  But neither is it a time to panic and lower rates  A cut today may be reassuring   to some in the financial markets, but it also may serve to scare markets by sending a signal that   we are much more worried than perhaps they are  There is just way too much volatility and dust   blowing around to make such snap judgments on monetary policy  We have been aggressive   with our liquidity provisions, and we will continue to be so, and I support that  Stability coming   from monetary policy is an important attribute, and I think we have an opportunity to provide   some stability here  However, I am uncomfortable with the current Greenbook baseline path that   has the funds rate remaining unchanged well into the second half of next year  In my view, that   will not deliver an acceptable path of inflation outcome over the medium term  At the same   time, I do not perceive an immediate threat to the unanchoring of expectations, so I can accept   keeping the funds rate at an unchanged level at this meeting  But at some point, before the   unemployment rate begins to improve substantially, I believe this Committee will need to raise   rates in order to deliver on our inflation objectives   Regarding language, I can live with the language in alternative B  Thank you, Mr   Chairman    I think “market” may be construed too narrowly  We don’t really mean   it that way, I don’t think    September 16, 2008 80 of 108     As long as we are throwing monkey wrenches into the language, I think   we do signal our concern  In paragraph 2, we put the very first sentence, which says, “Strains in   financial markets have increased significantly”  So we have acknowledged that at the very top of   September 16, 2008 83 of 108    this statement  So there is no going back on that  I am a little concerned about what moving   back “closely” means  Another alternative that I’ll throw out would be, rather than use   “closely,” to say that “the Committee will continue to monitor economic and financial   developments”     SEVERAL  That’s what it said last time    Well, that seems fine  We are monitoring these things  Is this the   FOMC statement dictionary we are going to?  Is this the code book?  [Laughter]    We make note of this in the lexicon of FOMC terminology    "
8555,2008-09-29,PLOSSER,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I was confused about April 30  I thought I   heard Bill Dudley say that he’s requesting the TAF be extended to April 30  Is it just the swap lines,   or is it both?  Can I get some clarification?    It’s not pertinent to this particular decision, but I was going to ask Bill   whether there are any other sorts of measures or tools that the Desk in New York is considering—  that are being explored or thought about going forward?   September 29, 2008 7 of 16     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I have a question about the $300 billion of   mortgage assets referred to that were segregated out, and the FDIC said that Citi will take the first   $54 billion  Does anybody know whether that is current market value?  What is the $300 billion?    Is it market price, or was it face value?  How was that valued—do we know?    Does the first $30 billion markdown come out of the $54 billion?    So they have already taken roughly $30 billion of the $54 billion losses   they’ve promised they’d take?    Thank you  "
8571,2008-10-07,PLOSSER,"  We just thought we would outflank him, but we haven’t succeeded    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’d just like to make a couple of observations   and perhaps ask a question and make maybe one observation about language  As a general   proposition, I do not like intermeeting cuts  I think they signal more panic than they do stability    On the other hand, I think this is an opportunity, given what the other central banks are doing, that   might prove to be an exception to that  So I am reluctantly or modestly comfortable with this,   however you want to characterize it, because I don’t think that anything that we do today—cutting   the funds rate 50 basis points or whatever—is going to make the next couple of months in terms of   the overall economy any less painful  They won’t be felt in the real economy for some time to   come  They may provide some solace to the markets  I hope that they will  I wouldn’t bet the   ranch on that, but I do think that the coordinated effort might be helpful  I like in the statement the   stressing of the point that, as you put it, this is based on a deteriorating economic outlook, and I   October 7, 2008 17 of 30    think it is very important that we continue to emphasize that point as opposed to just volatility in the   financial markets  So I feel that’s very helpful   I have one question  President Yellen alluded to this, and I would like your thoughts on this,   Mr Chairman  Obviously, as we have been experiencing over the last year, things have seemed to   change very rapidly at times, sometimes in surprising ways and in ways that we couldn’t anticipate    But I have stressed in past meetings the importance for us of thinking not just about a funds rate   decision on any given day or at any given meeting but about what we think the path should look   like  So rather than just considering our action today, we obviously have a scheduled meeting   coming up in a few weeks  Do you think that this is the precursor, as President Yellen suggested, to   perhaps additional cuts, and where do you think a likely path might take us going forward, given   that this is an intermeeting cut?     My last comment has to do with the language, and I’d just like to make an observation about   the sentence on inflation  It reads, “Inflation has been high, but the Committee believes that the   decline in energy and other commodity prices and the weaker prospects for economic activity have   materially reduced the upside risks to inflation”  I guess I would make two observations, Mr   Chairman  One, that seems to be a much stronger statement about the reduction in the prospects for   inflation than actually you gave in your speech today, where you emphasized that it had been   reduced but that there continues to be lots of uncertainty and inflation continues to need monitoring    I would put on the table for discussion that we change the phrase “materially reduced” to these   things have “mitigated near-term upside risks to inflation”  Clearly commodity and oil prices have   both mitigated the expectational channel for inflation in the near term  But I’m not necessarily   convinced—and it’s very model dependent—as to what inflation might do in the latter part of ’09   October 7, 2008 18 of 30    and so forth  So I think that we should emphasize that the inflation risks for the near term have been   mitigated as our rationale there  Thank you, Mr Chairman    I would prefer that  I think it is more consistent with both your speech   today and our previous statements and it still conveys the correct message  So I support and would   be happy with just leaving out “materially”  "
8599,2008-10-28,PLOSSER,"  I have just a clarification  This is a question  Don’t we already have a   swap line, a standing facility, with Mexico as a part of NAFTA?  So we don’t have to add it    I guess my question is why we can’t use the swap line that is already in   existence    I guess I’m worried about this for all of the considerations that President   Hoenig and President Lacker have just been talking about  I don’t know where we draw the lines,   and when we have to go to the State Department and start asking what countries we can or can’t   develop swap lines with, I’m not sure those are the criteria we want to be using  We mentioned the   countries already  What happens when  552 USC (b)(4)  ?  You can just go down the list    I understand, but if you really follow the logic of the argument about being   large and systemically important, if we draw a line somewhere, we start expanding this now bit by   bit and we draw a line somewhere, and the question then becomes, Will markets begin to question   other countries on the periphery and create problems?  It’s not that any one of them—  552 USC (b)(4)  , I don’t know, pick one—is large and systemically important, but by doing what we’re   October 28–29, 2008 35 of 206    doing and creating the uncertainty that President Lacker was referring to, maybe we are forced to go   and do it collectively because they all band together and as a group say, “We’re all facing this   problem  Why can’t we have the same access?”  Partly I like President Rosengren’s suggestion   about using repos with securities, which we have here as a mechanism  Alternatively, if the IMF is   creating a largely unconditional or low conditionality type of program, why not just say that   everybody else goes to them first?  If they tap out of the IMF access, maybe then we might consider   being a backstop rather than their coming to us in the first place  I just don’t know where this ends    I think that, with all of the questions you raised and tried to answer, you hit it right on the head  On   all of them that you said were kind of marginal, you went one way, and I’m leaning the other way   on the same criteria    We don’t know what the needs are yet, do we?    I just want to clear up the question  I think Tim and Nathan may have   both answered this, but it’s a question that President Lockhart raised earlier  In Mexico’s case, for   example, where almost all the major banks are foreign owned—EU banks, Spanish banks—those   banks clearly have access to dollars through the ECB swap line  There’s no reason that the dollar   funding needs of those banks, to the extent that they can move these things around, can’t be satisfied   by access to dollars from the ECB  Is that a correct or an incorrect assumption?    I guess I’ll approve, but with reluctance  I think this is a very slippery   slope  I’m worried about other central banks ganging up on us as a group, saying that they have to   have this  I would prefer that even these large countries use some combination of the IMF facility   October 28–29, 2008 42 of 206    plus their own reserves to meet these needs  I think that would be a better outcome and better for us   in that regard  So that’s a very reluctant “yea” vote  I’d also insist that any further expansion come   back before this Committee    Just a clarification  If we were to take that step, are there any other   institutions that participate, other than the GSEs?    I have a question  As you characterized the forecast in the Greenbook, it is   really the result of very large adjustments to the financial constraints piece—in fact, they’re about   double what they were in the September Greenbook—and those adjustments or factors really   account for a large portion, maybe not all, of the downward revision in the forecast  Now, one of   the inputs in the financial factors are spreads of various kinds in the VARs that you used to estimate   those  But those spreads we’ve learned are very, very volatile  They can rise very quickly, as we’ve   seen  They also can fall very quickly sometimes  Spreads have actually come down a little in the   last few days, which is the good news  If our facilities are successful, they actually may fall   further—knock on wood; that would be very nice  But I get a little nervous making our forecast be   driven so much by something that’s potentially very, very volatile   Now, we get a bit of a picture of this—and I want to applaud the staff—in I guess it was   exhibit 5, where you were comparing the baseline forecast and the two alternative scenarios,   particularly the one in which you get quicker recovery in the financial sector  I thought that was a   October 28–29, 2008 60 of 206    very useful exercise, and I really appreciate it  My interpretation or intuition is that the “more rapid   financial recovery” scenario is what the forecast would look like had we not done the additional add   factors in October and instead held them to what they were in September  That suggests that the   real data, whether on spending or other things, have driven the forecast down a little, but not a   whole lot  In fact, in that scenario, you imply that the funds rate would actually be held constant at   1½ percent  So, in looking at those two scenarios and trying to parse out how much risk or how   much probability to attach to them, what is the staff’s view?  Obviously here’s what you thought the   baseline would be, but if I ask you what you think the probabilities are on some of these different   scenarios—in particular, I’m interested in this sort of faster recovery—do you have any sense of   what the probabilities of these two different outcomes might be and how one might think about   that?  They imply very different paths for the funds rate and very different forecast profiles, but their   differences depend on variables that are very, very volatile  So can you give me some probabilities   of how you think about those two scenarios?    You can give me a distribution    I was looking at the table in the Greenbook, at the bottom  That’s   where I was trying to back out some of this  Thank you very much    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’m not going to say much about the District   conditions  In the Third District, as many of you have noted, they’ve weakened considerably  I will   make just a couple of observations that I think might be pertinent  Our last Business Outlook   Survey, the one that was released a week ago, had actually gone into positive territory in September   to 38, which was the first positive reading we had had since January—since, I guess, last   December, actually  And it dropped from that plus 38 to minus 375 in one month  Now, it’s   relevant to know the timing of this a bit  Our survey is done during the first 2 weeks or the first 10   or 12 days of each month—which meant that the September survey was closed on September 12, 4   days before that weekend  So what we see is a very precipitous, dramatic change in the tone that   had as much to do with events and perhaps policy actions as with what was actually going on in the   economy   I share a bit of President Lacker’s concern to try to disentangle a little the tone and feel of   the economy, which really did feel as though it fell off a cliff in September, unlike any other month   that I’ve seen during this episode  We have to think carefully about disentangling that effect not just   because something fundamental happened to the economy but also to see to what extent policies,   whether our policies or Treasury’s policies, have contributed to a change in tone and increased   uncertainty and aggravated what might be the real fundamentals going on  I don’t know the answer   October 28–29, 2008 82 of 206    to that question, but it suggests something that many of us have argued over time—that more-  consistent and more-predictable policies can help us avoid some of that   One special question that was asked in this survey in October was whether firms had trouble   getting credit  Interestingly enough, only 14 percent of the respondents reported that they had   trouble obtaining credit, but twice that number, almost 30 percent, reported that they believed that   their customers were having trouble getting credit, which was an interesting dynamic going on that   leads to a bit of uncertainty  I guess the best thing I can say about the Third District right now is   “Go Phillies!”  [Laughter]  Maybe that will turn things around in the Third District   Anyway, let me turn briefly to the national outlook  It has deteriorated, certainly more than   I expected, from what I thought in June  In our conference call on October 7, I indicated that I was   revising my forecast downward  I expect the economy to contract during the second half of this   year and perhaps in the first quarter of next year—but that’s less clear to me—and then gradually   approach what I would consider trend growth over 2009, so that by the end of 2009 we’re getting   back toward what might be considered trend growth, which I consider to be about 25 to 27 percent    In essence, for 2010-11, I pushed out my recovery of the economy by somewhere between six and   nine months because of the current turmoil  I expect the unemployment rate to peak around mid-  ’09 at about 7¼ and then to decline gradually to its long-run rate of about 5 percent by the end of   2010  Inflation pressures have subsided somewhat since June, and inflation expectations have   remained contained  I expect core inflation to decline gradually from the current levels to my goal   of about 17 percent by 2010   Now, my overall forecast is considerably better than the Greenbook baseline forecast  In   fact, it’s similar to what we talked about as the “more rapid financial recovery” scenario, which   makes some of the adjustment for the financial turmoil somewhat quicker and somewhat less   October 28–29, 2008 83 of 206    dramatic than in the baseline  The fed funds rate path underlying my forecast is less   accommodative than the Greenbook  I assume that the fed funds rate remains at 1½ percent through   the spring of next year and then gradually begins to rise, reaching 4¼ percent by the end of 2010    Now, there are certainly risks around that forecast  Somebody at this table has to be a little more   optimistic after all, and we have risks around all forecasts in this environment  Certainly mine is no   exception  In particular, the effect of the financial markets, as we’ve all been talking about, remains   highly uncertain and highly risky, and I am not trying to disregard that  Every day it seems as   though there’s a new development, usually negative, although I guess 900 points on the Dow today   should be considered good news     But in fact, I believe that the risks around the Greenbook baseline forecast are to the upside,   as I have alluded to  First, the baseline entails a sizable downward adjustment based at least partly   on the volatile financial data, especially spreads  Spreads can fall dramatically, although they don’t   always do so  But they can rise and fall very quickly, and I think it’s very risky to base monetary   policy, which ought to be taking a longer-term perspective, on week-to-week movements in such   volatile variables  If spreads do continue to fall over the next quarter or two as they have in recent   days and if the financial market tools we’ve put in place have the desired effect, we could see the   economy becoming much stronger than the Greenbook’s baseline  Second, in the Greenbook,   inflation falls and remains low despite a very low fed funds rate path  In fact, it’s reminiscent of the   funds rate path in 2003-04  This apparently is due to the sizable output gaps that open up in the   forecast period  Now, these output gaps arise in the forecast because the effects of the financial   turmoil show up mainly in aggregate demand  However, as I’ve suggested in previous meetings   and as President Lacker alluded to, I think a plausible alternative view is that the financial market   disturbances we’ve experienced—resulting in a restructuring of the financial system and a lowering   October 28–29, 2008 84 of 206    of the efficiency of financial intermediation—act on the supply side as well, much like a somewhat   persistent productivity shock with an associated damping effect on measures of potential GDP for   some period of time  If so, we’ll see much smaller output gaps opening up, and that means the risk   of higher inflation than in the Greenbook, especially if the baseline funds rate path is followed as   they lay out   In thinking about the appropriate monetary policy going forward, it’s important that we not   let our policy be whipsawed by volatile market data  We have been lowering the funds rate since   January, largely in anticipation of a recession or to mitigate the chances of one occurring  Now, it   may finally have arrived  Does that mean we have to lower more?  A difficult question  The level   of the funds rate is always a difficult question  Clearly, if we experience a sustained slowdown in   real economic activity, which suggests a lower equilibrium in the real rate of interest, policy needs   to allow the funds rate to fall with the equilibrium rate, and I based my recommendations   throughout the year on such a forecast  But I think it’s a mistake to overreact to volatile data,   especially when it’s the stock market  Although there has always been the desire and much pressure   from markets to do something when we see such swings in the market, in my view, the economy is   better served if monetary policy is a steadying hand, taking appropriate action when the   intermediate-term view dictates, but not overreacting to fluctuations in the market with an   inappropriate tool  Thank you, Mr Chairman      Yes    Well, I don’t like the NAIRU, but in my baseline forecast, my natural rate   of unemployment is higher than what the Greenbook has    Yes, right    But even in my steady state, if I view this as a permanent inefficiency in   financial intermediation that changes things, the unemployment rate is a little higher    My, you’re good    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Clearly, forecasts have been marked down   since our September meeting—mine included  This reflects the weaker data that we have   obtained on the real side, especially consumer spending and manufacturing, but also worsening   conditions in the financial markets  Accordingly, in an intermeeting move on October 8, we cut   the funds rate 50 basis points  Yet the additional effect on the economy of financial turmoil   during the last month remains highly uncertain  Spreads in many markets remain higher than at   the time of our September meeting, but some have started to decline  If our new facilities have   the desired impact, we may well see spreads continue to fall back to September or lower levels    It is very difficult to say at this time  Although I dislike intermeeting rate cuts, I supported the   October 8 cut because it was part of a coordinated effort among central banks around the world   and it seemed justified given that our growth outlook had deteriorated and inflation expectations   had remained stable   We may well have to do more, but I think we are near the end of what we can do with   monetary policy  Of course, it’s difficult to determine the appropriate level of the funds rate, and   I want to draw your attention to the Greenbook, which showed that, whether we cut today or   don’t cut today, the paths of GDP, employment, and inflation over the next year or two are not   much different  In fact, in most models, cuts of that magnitude do not show up very heavily in   October 28–29, 2008 128 of 206    real variables  I would also note that, according to the Greenbook, we could cut the rate to zero   and have no effect on inflation, apparently, for the next four years  However, given the fact that   rate cuts don’t have much effect, even in the Greenbook simulations, we have cut rates  It may   not make much difference, as President Hoenig was saying  My preference at this meeting   would be to stand pat and see how the data and financial markets improve  We are already   engaged in extraordinary quantitative easing, even at this point, and we are hearing from bankers   that the funds rate will do little to stimulate lending on their part or improve their balance sheets    Now, delaying necessary rate cuts is not desirable  But given the considerable uncertainty   around our forecast, it is not clear that further cuts are either necessary or desirable or are going   to be effective  And doing so for purely psychological reasons, from my standpoint, is a dubious   way to conduct policy   A comparison of the baseline Greenbook forecast with the alternative scenario involving   more-rapid improvement in financial conditions suggests that the appropriate policy path is very   much dependent on knowing whether the increase in financial stress in September will be   lasting  If conditions deteriorate further, which they might, we may want to cut in December  If   conditions improve, this may not be necessary  Given the decline in confidence in our markets   and institutions, I think the Fed can play a positive role by being a steadying hand  That’s   another reason to wait a bit longer before moving again   I do not believe that we inspire confidence by appearing to react to market fluctuations    Even though that’s not what we’re doing, I fear that we often give that appearance  Moreover,   although we have gotten positive reactions to the creativity of our liquidity programs, I think we   have missed opportunities for raising confidence by rolling out our liquidity facilities in a   piecemeal fashion  We had announcements made every day between Monday and Wednesday,   October 28–29, 2008 129 of 206    on October 6, 7, and 8  I think it would have been far better to announce these actions as a well-  thought-out package, explaining the intention of the individual pieces and how they related to   one another  For example, we now have three different lending programs designed in whole or   in part to support money market mutual funds  I have concern that we have been looking   reactive rather than proactive, even though I know that some of these programs had been in the   works for a while   I have argued that it is important that we think about our policy choices in terms of policy   paths—that is, a dynamic path  The principles of dynamic programming suggest that we think   about our policies in a backward-looking way  This, I believe, applies not only to monetary   policy but to our liquidity programs as well  In this spirit, I believe that we must think hard   about our exit strategies both from the liquidity programs and from our very low funds rate  I   think we have dug ourselves a very deep hole in terms of the breadth and depth of our lending to   the private sector  We seem, at times, to be the lender of first resort as well as the lender of last   resort  We must make sure that we have a sturdy ladder that will enable us to climb our way out   of this hole  This is especially important given the interaction between the programs and the   differences across the programs in their current expiration dates   On the monetary policy side, we have added significantly to liquidity in the economy, as   I alluded to earlier  Given the uncertainty surrounding our forecast, we may very well find   ourselves in a position of having to reverse those injections sooner than expected  I am even   more concerned with this planning process than I have been when I have raised this point before    The baseline funds path in the Greenbook is quite extraordinary from my perspective  It   suggests that we can keep the funds rate low, below 1 and even close to zero, throughout most of   the forecast period  Indeed, in 2011 the funds rate is still below 2 percent, even though the   October 28–29, 2008 130 of 206    economy is growing at 44 percent  We may disagree somewhat on the magnitude of the   contributions of our low interest rate policies in the 2003–05 period to the current problems, but I   don’t think many of us want to repeat that episode  Yet looking at the baseline forecast and   where the funds rate remains—below 1 percent or certainly below 2 percent for the next four   years—it strikes me as a risky strategy at best and perhaps even a dangerous one  We have   previously expressed views around this table that this Committee historically has been reluctant   to raise rates in a timely fashion, and I believe that fear is reinforced by what I see in the baseline   forecast in the Greenbook  That projection worries me a great deal  We must not act in a way   that sows the seeds of the next crisis     Despite the pressure of the here and now, we cannot and should not ignore the   consequences of our actions in the intermediate term  Managing our way from point to point,   dealing with immediate problems, can very easily lead us to a place in which we do not wish to   be—thus the importance of thinking in terms of a path  I think it would also serve us well to   think about the process we will follow to unwind our liquidity programs in advance, so that we   avoid unintended consequences across markets, and about the communication strategy that will   ease the transition back to a more market based provision of liquidity   In sum, Mr Chairman, although I would prefer not to move today, I recognize that my   forecast is more optimistic than most  Moreover, I also accept the notion that there is a great   deal of uncertainty about the outcomes and fragility in the marketplace, and your concerns are   well noted  Thus, I will not dissent against a 50 basis point cut  But I would like to remind the   Committee of our earlier discussions and the general agreement I thought I heard that, when the   time comes, we will have to raise rates and we may have to do so aggressively  In all likelihood,   October 28–29, 2008 131 of 206    that will occur before lagging indicators, such as the unemployment rate, are firmly on the   decline  This is not the projection offered in the Greenbook baseline  Thank you, Mr Chairman    I’d just like to just take a moment to react  I’m not sure whom you heard   saying that the result was primarily a result of this Committee’s actions or the Chairman’s actions or   anyone else’s actions  If those were words you were putting in my mouth, that was not what I said,   President Geithner  I do think I have been supportive of almost all the actions in terms of liquidity   facilities; I supported the actions  I also was supportive of the Lehman Brothers decision  But I   think it’s a far cry from saying that uncertainty about policies contributes to uncertainty—which you   agreed to—it’s a far cry from that to saying we lay the blame at the feet of this Committee or the   Chairman  So I don’t know what straw man you were setting up, but it certainly didn’t apply to this   member of the Committee  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Just a question or thought  As the staff prepares the review of the 2003   studies and memos and thinks about what zero effectively means and how we might operate in   those circumstances, one thing I think would be useful to include is a discussion of whether or not   when that time comes we announce that publicly and say, “Okay  This is it  From now on we have   to do X, Y, or Z,” and make it part of the communication strategy  Maybe they would anyway  But   if we get to the point where we now as a group have some concerns that, well, effectively we really   don’t want to go below X, we will have to do some other operational actions as a substitute for that    Just to follow up on that—I think that’s a very excellent suggestion,   President Geithner  To be very specific about that, in our trial run, one thing that we did was to look   at what we thought was the steady state  One way to engender some communication about the   longer run might be to include what the Committee thought the steady-state neutral level of the   funds rate would be in that environment  I’d describe the path by which we got there; it would   convey some sense to the marketplace of what we thought would be in some normal world a   reasonable level of the funds rate consistent with those targets  I just throw that on the table as   something to think about    Can’t we meet before then?  [Laughter]  "
8626,2008-12-15,PLOSSER,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I, too, want to add my praise to the staff  It   was an extraordinary set of memos, as Jeff indicated, making reasonably clear very difficult   December 15–16, 2008 36 of 284    literature on a complex topic  So I want to thank them  Reading through them was very helpful   to me in trying to sort out some of my own views as well   As we know, the nominal funds rate has been trading well below our target  It is near   zero  The real funds rate is about minus 2 percent  The outlook for growth is now even weaker   than it was before  In that case, we would want our policy rates to decline with the equilibrium   real rate  But the zero bound, of course, may constrain us, and our ability to do that is   complicated by the prospect of declining inflation expectations, which make more difficult our   ability to let the funds rate fall  Once we are in the situation in which our policy rate is   effectively zero, it does become a constraint on monetary policy—as has been well explained  In   that case, theory suggests that our policy strategy must focus on ways of raising expectations of   inflation, so that, near the zero bound, real rates can decline while nominal rates remain close to   zero  One way to implement such a strategy is to credibly commit to keeping policy   accommodative for some period of time after the funds rate is no longer constrained by the zero   bound and before moving policy back to more neutral rates, thereby raising expectations of   inflation  Eventually, however, we would need to bring policy rates back up in line with   economic conditions, to avoid a permanent increase in long-run inflation expectations  That will   be a tricky task to be sure  What we promise to do with policy in the future is of overriding   importance in this framework     Now, I am sympathetic to this theoretical analysis, but I have some concerns as well    The models that deliver these results are models of full commitment and thus presume that   policymakers have already in some sense credibly committed to deliver on an inflation target and   to deliver this strategy in the event that the near-zero bound becomes binding, which in these   models amounts to having a price-level target as opposed to an inflation target  I would like to   December 15–16, 2008 37 of 284    think that we are committed and credible policymakers as far as the public is concerned, but,   frankly, I have my doubts  I would feel more comfortable if this Committee had agreed to a   well-articulated inflation target  Had we done so, the current task before us might have had a   greater chance of success   Unfortunately, we do not have that luxury  Consequently, I am somewhat less confident   of how the public and the marketplace will react to our efforts  The trick we face now is how to   make these promises understandable and credible  One difficulty is that the optimal policy for   many models in these circumstances is very complicated and very difficult to understand, much   less communicate  If we hope to affect expectations, we need to explain our policies in a way   that the public can understand  Even approximation of optimal policy in these circumstances   would involve price-level targeting, as I said, and it would be very difficult to explain,   particularly since the FOMC has never formalized its inflation target, let alone a price-level   target  I think we would be better off trying to communicate something simpler  First, we need   to tell the public that we have lowered the funds rate as low as we think it is beneficial to go     I do have some concerns about lowering the target rate all the way to zero  We still do   not understand why having interest rates on reserves isn’t working to keep the funds rate at its   target, and there may well be unintended consequences of moving our target to zero, beyond   those well articulated in the Board’s staff notes  Whether that lowest rate is 100 basis points,   75 basis points, 50 basis points, or 25 basis points is very hard to say  However, given the law of   unintended consequences and our lack of experience at the lower bound in this country, I do not   want to go all the way to zero  But I think we do need to communicate clearly to the public that,   when we reach whatever that effective zero rate is, we are done  A way of communicating that   might be by giving a funds rate target or range, say, between zero and some percent     December 15–16, 2008 38 of 284    There are two additional practical advantages I see that argue for bounding our target rate   above zero  First, it will allow additional time for banks to become more proficient at managing   their reserves, so that our interest-rate-on-reserves regime can become effective  By going to   zero, we will effectively shut out that learning process  Second, I believe that when the time   comes to raise rates, even by modest amounts, we will be in a better position to do so from a   non-zero position than from a zero position  Next, we need to communicate that the FOMC   desires inflation rates that are higher than perhaps our long-run target and communicate an   inflation range we are aiming for  That is somewhat difficult because we have refused to   communicate such a target in the past  We certainly need to communicate that we do not wish   deflation in a very weak economy  We also may wish to convey that we are going to keep the   nominal funds rate low for some period of time because we desire higher inflation, and that   currently seems to be expected  Communicating this serves to increase commitment, and it also   limits misunderstanding when inflation rates might temporarily be above a longer-run target    Thus, I think we need to say ex ante that we desire higher inflation rates than currently  As   suggested earlier, this would be easier to communicate had we adopted a target earlier   Regarding the use of nonstandard policy tools—in my view, we are already there  With   the funds rate trading below target, we are effectively conducting monetary policy through   quantitative easing, which I define as increases in reserves either by open market operations or   by any other means  Indeed, expansion of our balance sheet, including unsterilized lending, is   monetary policy, as it is monetizing the debt, either public or private  As an aside, I find the   description of such a policy as nonstandard a bit peculiar since using balance sheet quantities as   instruments of policy has had a long tradition in monetary policy  Indeed, even the Federal   Reserve has targeted nonborrowed reserves at various points in its history  In principle, I have   December 15–16, 2008 39 of 284    no objections to quantitative easings of this form  But if that is how we view the new regime,   then we need to publicly acknowledge that we have changed—that we have a new instrument—  and communicate how monetary policy will be determined going forward   Internally, we also need to resolve, as has been pointed out, how decisions about our   lending and liquidity facilities will be made, particularly now that these have become the main   instrument of monetary policy as opposed to being the mechanism for providing liquidity to   improve market functioning, which is then sterilized  The FOMC, and not only the Board of   Governors, needs to be involved in decisions about the magnitude of such lending and the choice   of assets  In effect, these are choices about the extent of the Fed’s balance sheet and its   expansion or contraction     There are a number of ways in which one might proceed  First, I believe we need to   publicly convey that we have entered a new regime  Otherwise, it may look as though we have   lost control of monetary policy or that the FOMC, which sets the target funds rate, and the Board   of Governors, which largely is controlling the liquidity provisioning, are at odds  One obvious   step would be to change the directive to the Desk, which is released in the minutes, in a way that   clearly indicates that the new regime is now operative and that the FOMC has deliberately   chosen to be in that regime  We would then have to communicate something about the size of   the balance sheet going forward in terms of limits, ranges, or maximums of some form, such as   President Lacker was suggesting  My preference is for the directive to specify objectives in   terms of asset quantities rather than the level of non-funds-rate interest rates or interest rate   spreads  That is question 7 of the staff memo  These latter two are not under our control and,   even more so than before, reflect counterparty risk not liquidity impairments  Moreover, the   December 15–16, 2008 40 of 284    transmission mechanism from reserve quantities to rates and spreads is not precise enough for   these to be operational objectives   Setting a quantity limit on the size of the balance sheet is more familiar—similar to our   experience with operating a reserves-based target  In this quantitative regime, it means that the   Board of Governors wishes to implement new lending programs that expand the balance sheet—  that is, that are not sterilized  The Board of Governors would have to seek approval of the   FOMC to get such an expansion but not necessarily for the composition of the assets   As I have articulated before, I believe we need to remain cognizant of the line between   monetary policy and fiscal policy  I would prefer to see us purchasing Treasuries rather than   riskier assets, as I would favor the purchases of long-term Treasuries over new 13(3) facilities    This refers to questions 4 and 5  To the extent that some of our lending programs are targeted at   aiding specific markets, my preference would be to shift those assets from the Fed’s balance   sheet to the Treasury and substitute Treasury securities  This would help distinguish monetary   policy from credit policy and preserve our ability to conduct independent monetary policy   We also need to recognize that, as the economy begins to recover, these programs will   need to be unwound, and this may occur before all financial institutions are fully recovered    Some of our facilities have termination dates and will shrink naturally as those dates are reached;   but others, like the agency MBS programs or the TALF, will complicate the problem  Under a   well-functioning corridor system, should we get there, the target rate will be somewhere between   the upper and lower bounds, and we will have to shrink the balance sheet if we expect to hit our   target  The reduction may be quite significant if it is accompanied by a general fall in the   demand for reserves by banks   December 15–16, 2008 41 of 284    Even if we imagine going to a floor system in which, in principle, we can raise the target   rate without shrinking the balance sheet, we need to be concerned about the health of our balance   sheet so that we can ensure that we can finance the interest rates on reserves and pay them  Note   that if we do go to a floor system, the rate paid on excess reserves will become our instrument,   and we will need to agree on how to set that rate going forward  In my view, that rate should be   decided by the FOMC   In summary, under a quantitative easing regime, the magnitude of the quantitative easing   should be an FOMC decision  To the extent that the quality of assets on our balance sheet   complicates future monetary policy decisions, the asset makeup of the Fed’s balance sheet   should also be in the FOMC’s purview  One option that has been discussed is for the Fed to   issue its own debt—other than Federal Reserve notes, I assume  I am uncomfortable with this   proposal  It is likely to require congressional approval, and oversight will no doubt be sought   since the Fed’s securities will be public debt  This potentially generates opportunities for the   Congress to control our debt ceiling and perhaps the pricing of our securities, in ways that may   limit our ability to conduct independent monetary policy  Thus, I am very skeptical that this   would be a good path to follow  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Third District economic news is similar to   the national news  It’s all bad  Our December business outlook survey, which remains confidential   until Thursday, will post another very weak number  In November the number was minus 393    The December reading will be released, and it will be minus 329—somewhat better but still deeply   in negative territory  New orders, shipments, and employment are all very weak  Price indexes on   the survey have fallen appreciably below zero for the past two months and are near their lowest   levels since we began the survey in 1969  This is after being at nearly their highest levels over the   same interval just a few months ago  Moreover, firms are expecting prices to continue to decline    November’s reading marked the first time that the future prices-paid index has been negative  The   mood is generally quite grim  The Greenbook also paints a very bleak picture  I would like to think   that this isn’t the most likely outcome, but it is increasingly difficult to argue against that based on   recent economic data  I have revised down my own forecast, of course  Although I’m still not quite   as pessimistic as the Greenbook, I admit that the Greenbook is no longer an outlier as I am used to   December 15–16, 2008 134 of 284    thinking about it  The forecasts for output are nearly as bad as or are worse than the economy   experienced in 1974-75  Inflation has moderated significantly, and near-term inflationary   expectations have also moderated  Our December Livingston survey participants see CPI inflation   averaging just ½ percent in 2009  In the Greenbook, forecasted core inflation will be just over   1 percent next year and will decelerate to ¾ percent in 2010   With the growth prospects so weak and inflation expectations decelerating, the appropriate   real funds rate obviously will probably decline, raising the possibility as we discussed yesterday that   the zero bound on nominal rates will pose a problem for us  At the same time, since mid-September   the effective funds rate has been trading well below the FOMC’s target of 1 percent  As we   discussed yesterday, we are effectively conducting monetary policy through quantitative easing—by   which I mean an expansion of the Fed’s balance sheet by both conventional and nonconventional   means  I have no objections in principle to this easing process; but as I discussed yesterday, I   believe that we need to acknowledge publicly that we are now in a new regime, with a new way of   implementing monetary policy, and that it is a deliberate choice of this Committee  Otherwise we   risk confusing market participants or implying that we are no longer in control of monetary policy    But in doing so, we need to communicate how this policy will be conducted going forward  The   Board of Governors and the FOMC will have to decide how they will handle the governance issues   surrounding this new regime  It seems clear to me that monetary policy determinations should   remain in the purview of the FOMC regardless of whether we are using standard or nonstandard   policy tools   Thus, I think we have to come to grips with three very important policy issues at this   juncture  They include (1) how to implement monetary policy via an expansion of our balance   sheets for standard fed funds targeting; (2) what decisionmaking process the FOMC and the Board   December 15–16, 2008 135 of 284    should use in implementing these policies via the balance sheet expansion; and (3) how to   communicate all of these to the public in a transparent and, most important, credible fashion  I   agree with the Chairman that we need to maintain and embrace the collaborative process between   the Board of Governors and the FOMC, which has been our method of moving forward during this   crisis  But I remain convinced that in these times of uncertainty we need to be explicit and to   communicate that monetary policy remains under the purview of the FOMC  As we discussed   yesterday, our primary goal is to set policy that yields the best economic outcomes for the economy,   consistent with our dual mandate  I think our history demonstrates that the institutional structure of   the FOMC and clearly articulated goals and methods yield the best policy  Thank you, Mr   Chairman    Just a follow-up on that  I am a little confused that we don’t set a target   but we are operating under an interest on reserves scheme by which we pay a deposit rate, which   in fact we just lowered  Is there some kind of disconnect between what is in alternative A,   paragraph 5—lowering the discount rate and the interest rates on reserves—and not noting a   change in the target rate when, in fact, we have already established that the deposit rate is going   to be the target rate  So I am confused  Maybe the markets will see through this, but I don’t   know  I am not quite sure I understand what is going on and how this would work, in terms of   communications or interpretations    I guess my trouble is that the Committee judged that it is not useful to   set a specific target for the funds rate and yet this will be interpreted as that we reduced the target   in effect    Thank you, Mr Chairman  These are, indeed, troubling times, and I think   in troubling times it’s even more important that we be as transparent and clear as possible  I think   it’s time that we publicly convey that we have entered a new monetary policy regime  To do   otherwise perpetuates the view that we are no longer in control of monetary policy rather than that   we have opted to implement policy through a different means, particularly our balance sheet   There’s ample room for judgment here and disagreement, but, Mr Chairman, with all due   respect, I’m deeply troubled by elements of the steps that we are taking today  In effect, I interpret   our proposed actions as substituting credit-allocation policies for monetary policies  Both the   expansion of our balance sheet and the fed funds rate are now determined or will be now   determined by decisions about which markets or firms are deemed worthy of our intervention and   support and some assessment of how much money we want to throw at them  I think we all agree   that we are looking for the best policies  I think that it’s also true that best policies are based on   clearly articulated goals and objectives and in credible and systematic actions to achieve those goals   and objectives, and they can also be credibly communicated to the public  I feel that our approach   to credit policy comes up lacking in each of these dimensions  Our goal may be to prevent systemic   risk, but we haven’t clearly defined what that is or the criteria that we’re using to decide whom to   lend to and when to lend to them  It’s very important for both clarity and transparency that we   rectify this deficiency, or we may continue to create moral hazard and to see market after market   after market seek our help   The message from the literature we discussed yesterday is that near the zero bound our   credibility and our commitment to generate inflation and prevent expectations of deflation to   develop are paramount  My reading of the proposed language is that it does little to signal that   commitment  Indeed, it seems to suggest that our primary objectives are and will continue to be   December 15–16, 2008 191 of 284    credit interventions  Confusing our monetary policy objectives with our credit policies is not the   kind of message that I’m comfortable with  I think we need to be careful not to convey to the   market that monetary policy has become ineffective, and I don’t think anyone at this table wishes to   do that   President Lacker articulated the importance in the current environment of keeping inflation   expectations well anchored, and measures of the base—or if you would rather, look at the asset side   of the balance sheet, either way they’re both measuring the balance sheet—are a means of   anchoring those expectations  I don’t think the language of the directive or the statement is clear   enough in addressing either the effectiveness of monetary policy or the credible commitment to   avoid deflation or even to maintain inflation near our target, which is clearly not deflation  I’m not   quite as fearful of deflation as President Bullard or some others, but I think we need to be mindful   and reinforce our commitment to low but stable inflation   On the governance side, I continue to believe that the FOMC is the appropriate body for   making monetary policy decisions and that replacing monetary policy with credit policies that are   unconstrained by this Committee is to violate both good governance and the spirit of the operating   understanding of the FOMC  Yesterday and in my memo to the Committee earlier this week, I   argued that the directive and the statement should clearly state that we are in a new regime and   should articulate how that new regime will operate going forward  My interpretation is that the   proposed language, particularly alternative A, does help indicate that we are moving to a new   regime  That’s important, and therefore, I lean in that direction  But that language fails to articulate   how that new regime will operate, except to say that the Board of Governors will continue credit   market interventions  It says nothing about the terms and strategies that we’ll employ to do so  The   implicit message is—and I think the market will clearly interpret it this way—that the FOMC has   December 15–16, 2008 192 of 284    ceded monetary policy decisions to the Board of Governors, and I think that will be damaging    Such a step, in my view, is not good policy, nor is it good governance, and it may have political   ramifications as well  Once the Committee sets the precedent that the Board of Governors can   assume sole responsibility for monetary policy, we run the risk of losing the strength and the   diversity of views that the System has always brought   My sense is that this Committee’s setting some kind of cap on the size of the balance sheet   was an effort to clarify the role of monetary policy in contrast to credit policy  I think the reaction I   heard yesterday around the table was a litany of reasons why setting base growth targets is not   appropriate  While that might be an interesting debate to have, that was not the point I was   proposing  I was requesting that we have a debt ceiling, if you will, and that the FOMC would   review and adjust that debt ceiling as it deemed appropriate—not targets for balance sheets per se    Such a debt ceiling would not prevent the Board of Governors from managing the asset side of the   balance sheet via 13(3) lending  Only when unsterilized lending exceeded the debt ceiling might   formal approval be required from the FOMC  Mr Chairman, my discomfort is not a matter simply   of good governance  It is more fundamentally about the lack of clarity, discipline, and transparency   that the strategy is offering, and I have deep concerns   I’d like to offer a couple of suggestions for the Committee to consider about language, and   I’m working off alternative A, which I think is probably the working hypothesis here  So to answer   your questions, Mr Chairman, I have been and continue to be in favor of an explicit inflation target    Most of you are aware of that  I am sympathetic to the view, as I think President Lacker said, that   slipping it in in the dead of night is probably not the right way to go about it  I would add that I do   not like the bracketed phrase regarding the Committee’s seeing some risk of inflation coming in too   low  As President Lacker suggested, it might cause fear in the marketplace  But I do think we   December 15–16, 2008 193 of 284    could change the second bracketed statement, which was struck out  “In support of its dual   mandate, the Committee will seek    a rate of inflation    of about 2 percent”  I think we could   change that and heighten the importance of inflation to us and our dual mandate by saying   something to the effect of “in support of its dual mandate, the Committee will seek a low and stable   inflation rate over the intermediate term”  That would be short of specifying an inflation target but   would reinforce the notion that we are still committed to achieving a low but stable inflation rate   My biggest problem is with paragraph 4, which I think could be simplified greatly  I would   like to emphasize that monetary policy remains in the purview of the FOMC and that we have   entered a new regime  So I would propose, just for the sake of getting it on the table, that   paragraph 4 be simplified to say that “the focus of the FOMC’s monetary policy going forward will   be to continue to support the dual mandate and the functioning of a financial market to stimulate the   economy through open market operations and other measures that entail the use of the Federal   Reserve’s balance sheet”  Then I would say, “Today the FOMC affirms the expansion of the Fed’s   balance sheet up to $3 trillion and will periodically review and adjust that in the pursuit of our dual   mandate”  Repeating the litany of credit-market interventions that we have engaged in seems just   repeating what we’ve already done  I’m not sure that serves much purpose in the context of   monetary policy making at this point  I’m not opposed to buying GSEs  I’m not opposed to buying   longer-term Treasuries  I think we need to modify Brian Madigan’s statement about the conditions   under which we should purchase GSEs so that we are being internally consistent, but I don’t have   any objection to it   So I think we could be clearer  We could be less confusing in our policies by emphasizing   again our commitment to keep inflation stable and at a positive level and clearly indicating that   quantities do matter and that this Committee is responsible for those quantities and will interact with   December 15–16, 2008 194 of 284    the Board of Governors and our credit policies to see that we can achieve the goals that we all   decide on  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Would you read that again, please?  I’m sorry, Mr Chairman  This is very   difficult    I think it is the focus of the FOMC’s monetary policy    Of the Committee’s policy—fine    Yes, much improved    This is a clarification, Mr Chairman  I hate to be difficult, but in thinking   about this as a step, we talked about an inflation target  What other steps do you see that we need to   clarify as we try to make this process more—I’m looking for some forward-looking language here    I guess, given the zero lower bound issues that we have been discussing   and some of the consequences of being there, the difficulty of dealing with policy in that   environment, in previous meetings on this topic we have talked about the prospects of specifying   the funds rate path or the range of the funds rate paths of Committee members and their   projections  It was suggested earlier that, had we done that previously, we might be in a position   to signal to the markets more about our commitment to inflation or something like that  So I   guess what I’m saying, in the context of both inflation targeting and its projections, giving that a   second round of thought, in terms of how it might fit in with that, would be useful under some   circumstances     But in some sense, just to follow up on this point, the limits are what is   really important here because, as long as we don’t define some limits and we just say limited by   TARP capital, well, that doesn’t really answer the question  As long as the markets act as if we or   someone else is going to step in and rescue them from any more lending arrangements they happen   to be facing, the incentives for the intermediary system to repair itself or to gradually adjust are   going to be limited  I’m worried about the lack of definition about what constitutes a legitimate   market or instrument or firm that we wouldn’t save    And what are the limits to it?    By the way, Mr Chairman, I want to thank you  I thought your exchange   of letters with Senator Dodd, I guess it was, over the automobile issues was well done    Excuse me, I read about it   December 15–16, 2008 235 of 284   "
8647,2009-01-16,PLOSSER," Thank you, Mr Chairman  As I have argued at previous meetings, I am   in favor of the Committee’s establishing a numerical objective for price stability and announcing   that objective to the public  My view of this is based on the importance of price stability and the   effective functioning of our economy and the financial system  In thinking through the details of   how to implement such a numerical goal, I am guided by the important roles that credibility,   commitment, and transparency play in our ultimately achieving this goal  I believe that   specifying a numerical objective for medium-term inflation would focus our policy discussions   and help anchor expectations, preventing them from drifting either too high or too low  By   reducing the public’s uncertainty about our goal, long-run expectations would become less   responsive to changes in short-run inflation Again, this should help enhance monetary policy’s   flexibility to respond to economic shocks as we deem appropriate   Numerical specification appears to have been associated with better-anchored   expectations in foreign countries that have adopted it  It seems to have produced a moderate        January 16, 2009 24 of 69  improvement in monetary policy, and inflation outcomes have improved without negative   consequences for output growth But to be effective, the Committee’s stated commitment to the   objective must be credible  Transparency can help strengthen the credibility of our stated   commitment  Thus, in choosing specifics of how we implement the numerical objective, we   should be guided by those that enhance our transparency and credibility in the process  Just   saying that we have an objective isn’t enough  We need to design mechanisms and take actions   that help achieve that objective and make that objective and those mechanisms transparent   In normal times, when policy is implemented by a fed funds rate target, the path of the   target itself can serve as a nominal anchor for the economy  Including the funds rate in the set of   variables included in our economic projections would be a way for the Committee to   communicate how it planned to achieve its goal  I know there has been some reluctance to do   this for fear that it would undermine the Committee’s policy flexibility  But reporting the central   tendency and range of fourth-quarter averages of funds rates, as we do with the unemployment   rate, wouldn’t seem to be too constraining and would help inform the public about how we   anticipate hitting our goal, thereby raising our credibility and our stated commitment   However, we are not operating in normal times at the moment  Because our funds rate   target is effectively zero and is expected to remain at that level for a while, the funds rate cannot   now serve as a nominal anchor  In implementing credit policy, we are operating without a   controlling nominal anchor at this point, and this could jeopardize our ability to ensure price   stability Missing our goal could seriously undermine our credibility  Thus, I think it behooves   the Committee to do some serious thinking about how we ensure that the current credit policies   we are pursuing today don’t put price stability seriously at risk in the future  This includes limits   on the growth rate of our balance sheet overall or perhaps of individual credit programs  At the                 January 16, 2009 25 of 69  very least, we should be monitoring these and developing metrics to assess the implications of   credit policies for the future of price stability It would be a mistake, I believe, to declare a target   and fail to conduct policy consistent with that target or fail to communicate how our current or   future policies and actions relate to that target and that intermediate objective for price stability    I don’t think words or communication is enough  They need to be linked to actions in some   specific way   In terms of the details of implementation, there are some aspects about the design that I   feel more strongly about than others, and some of the choices are interrelated  For example, a   longer-term horizon should mean a tighter control range  A longer horizon makes the choice   between headline and core less important  A longer horizon in my view means that the choice of   core would be less compelling  Regarding which price index, in general I prefer a headline   index, even though it is likely to be harder to control than the core in the short run  I prefer   headline because I do not want to convey the idea that we are insensitive to the wider array of   prices that influence behavior  It also affords us the opportunity to use core in our   communications when explaining why we might or might not have policy react to a temporary   blip in headline   This is similar to the practice in other central banks that have announced numerical goals    I note that there is some justification for measures of inflation that include only the sticky price   components, as some monetary models suggest that optimal policy should be aimed at stabilizing   those sticky prices But the core measures of inflation do not necessarily correspond to the   sticky price sectors For example, apparel prices are more volatile than food prices  The   experience of foreign banks, almost all of which use the CPI, gives us some indication that using   the headline CPI can work The headline CPI is the measure most understood by the public, and           January 16, 2009 26 of 69  unlike the PCE, it is not revised  I think the fact that it is not revised is very important because it   aids transparency  The public and we will be in a better position of assessing whether we have   achieved our goal when metrics aren’t revised  That seems to me like a salient reason to prefer   the CPI over the PCE   Of course, I think it will be important for us to consider how we will respond and   communicate about inevitable misses from our target  Presumably, the larger the miss, the more   burdensome the communication requirements should be on us, similar to the requirement, for   example, in the United Kingdom for a letter to the Chancellor  Presumably, a miss should be   calibrated also to the variability and measurement precision in the underlying inflation measure   used Small deviations from targets should not be considered misses, but large deviations clearly   should require more explanation   Regarding a point goal versus a range, I continue to prefer a point goal  In reality, there   is a range around this point goal reflecting the precision with which policymakers can control   inflation This control range will differ depending on the inflation measure we use and the time   horizon However, I would be reluctant to announce such a range as part of our goal unless we   could ensure that the public would not interpret this range as a tolerance range  I think that may   be a very difficult communication task For headline CPI, I would be happy with a point target   anywhere between 1½ and 2 percent  It is not as critical to me—having a goal is the important   part I think that this is consistent with our goal of price stability—the estimated measurement   error of the CPI being a little less than 1 percent—and gives us a margin for reducing the chances   of getting into the zero bound situation   Regarding the time horizon, I feel strongly that we need to specify a time horizon so that   we can be held accountable for meeting or missing the goal  If the horizon becomes too long, it        January 16, 2009 27 of 69  imposes less discipline on the Committee and therefore presumably reduces the benefits of a   numerical goal in the first place  So I oppose making the horizon much too long  Because I   favor using headline CPI, which is more difficult to control than the core, I am comfortable that   something like a three-year horizon is appropriate and achievable, given the typical shocks that   hit the economy and the volatility of the CPI measure  If the Committee prefers a shorter   horizon, that might be a reason to think more precisely about the core   Regarding targeting the price level versus inflation—price-level targeting I think has   some attractive features, especially when we are near the zero bound, as we have talked about in   the past couple of meetings  We could operationalize this by defining an average inflation goal   over the time period so that, if inflation increases above this average for a time, we would need   to bring inflation below the average for a time in order to achieve our goal  But I think it would   be difficult to communicate price-level targeting to the public and get them to understand what   we are doing and why we are doing it The increased transparency of it persuades me that, at   least as a practical matter, stating our objectives in terms of an inflation objective is probably   preferable   Finally, I am in favor of the Committee’s including the longer-term projections for GDP   growth and unemployment in its projections  These would be interpreted as steady-state values   for the variables, and I think that would be a good thing  Presumably, in most situations our   inflation goal will be our long-term projection for inflation  As I said earlier, I am in favor of the   Committee’s including forecasts for our target policy rates as well in these projections  Again,   that would be a form of communication  The range and central tendency of these variables, in   let’s say the fourth quarter of each year, would give the public information on how we are              January 16, 2009 28 of 69  planning to meet our inflation goal  I believe this would increase the benefits of stating a   numerical goal by making our commitment to that goal more credible   Mr Chairman, I also recognize the political sensitivities in this matter and certainly am   willing to defer to your judgment  However, I do think that dragging the process out too slowly   may have some unintended consequences and perhaps lead us to lose some of the near-term   benefits that having a goal might provide us  If you conclude that we have a window of   opportunity here, both politically and practically, I would urge you that we not let this window   close on us Thank you very much, Mr Chairman   Thank you, Mr Chairman  Because I have made the case for balance   sheet observation, I just thought I would share a couple of thoughts  First of all, I appreciate your   efforts and your thoughts on this matter  I think the memo was informative and helpful, and your   comments have been very welcome from my perspective  I would make just one minor suggestion   or at least comment  My view about the balance sheet in terms of the FOMC’s role, in part, was not   to set or particularly to target the balance sheet or a specific size of the base  Both in the last   meeting and currently, my point has been to think more broadly about putting caps either on sizes of                       January 16, 2009 61 of 69  certain programs or on the balance sheet as a whole, recognizing full well, as you pointed out, that   some of these programs are demand driven and they go up and they go down perhaps even from   week to week in some cases  I fully understand that, and my thinking along these lines is that we   would try to set caps either for the overall balance sheet or maybe even for individual programs, that   we would review them periodically and, if demand or circumstances arose where we felt it was   appropriate to expand the size of the programs or create new ones and therefore adopt changes in   the balance sheet accordingly, we could adapt the interaction between the Committee and the Board   in that way   So I don’t want to be misunderstood as that I was trying to have a base growth target or even   a balance sheet growth target in the way I was thinking about it  I was trying to recognize—as you   pointed out, Mr Chairman—that there is an interaction here between the nature of monetary policy   and the nature of the credit programs that we are managing  We need to acknowledge explicitly that   interaction and make sure, as these programs and these efforts evolve, that we take into account that   interaction in an appropriate way  That is the critical piece of what I think we need to think about    Moving forward, I agree with you that we ought to try some new strategies and discussion in our   meetings I hope in the process—as you said, it is an experiment—we will work through a   collaborative effort to achieve our objectives  But this does relate back—as you pointed out in your   comments—to our earlier discussion about inflation targeting and, in any communicative effort, we   need to be able to link our actions that we take as a Committee on monetary policy and our charges,   relate that to what we are doing and to our objectives in a fairly systematic way  As you pointed   out, and I agree with you, right now that is very difficult to do  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
8669,2009-01-27,PLOSSER," Well, some of my remarks were in fact going to be exactly this point—   that we need an opportunity to bolster our credibility  As President Fisher said, I think we have   an opportunity The AMLF, in particular, is winding down  It is not being used very heavily,   and indeed it is a facility that is almost redundant given that we have the commercial paper   facility and the MMIFF and all of those three programs are intimately related to one another  It   doesn’t appear to me at all obvious that we need all of them  Whatever the AMLF is providing   could also be provided as backstop through the CP program and through the MMIFF  So I think   we could do ourselves a real favor and signal to the market that we are judicious, careful, and   wise about our choice of programs—that when we believe we have redundancies in the programs   we don’t just let them run on and on and on  I think it would do a lot for our credibility   There is another program that we haven’t really talked about in a while and that I think   we could also eliminate without much consequence and have, again, a credibility issue with the   distinction between us and the Treasury In August, we had an agreement with the Treasury to   allow the GSEs to borrow from the discount window  The argument in that case was that we   were doing that because the Treasury did not yet have the appropriations to do the lending and   they needed to get that worked out  They certainly now have that, and indeed, the GSEs are   wards of the state To the best of my knowledge, we have never lent to the GSEs through the   discount window I don’t anticipate that there is any prospect that we will  The fact is that we   are buying agency debt as it is To the best of my knowledge, we haven’t rescinded that   authorization—or at least the Board hasn’t rescinded that authorization   So I think these are two examples in which programs are actually not doing anything   particularly We have other means of backstopping the markets that we are worried about  By     January 27–28, 2009 50 of 267  beginning to show that we can be thoughtful in how we unwind some of this stuff, it could   actually be a credibility-building device  To the extent that there are very, very fuzzy lines out   there in the world among the political classes, including the public, about where the boundaries   are drawn between fiscal policy and monetary policy—which I believe is the case—these two   actions might help us draw back and gain a little more clarity about what we are about and what   we are not about I would just say, Mr Chairman, that I applaud your efforts with the Treasury   on this, and I support them 100 percent and will do anything I can to help that along because I   think it is a very, very important step  I think that we could have an opportunity by extending   some of the programs but not extending those that aren’t really doing anything   As long as I have the floor, Mr Chairman, I would like to comment on a couple of other   things I think we need to work harder on developing the specific information—that is, both data   and qualitative information—that we need to make our decisions exactly about extending or   exiting from these facilities and any new ones that we might create  This would help our own   policy deliberations, making us more systematic in our approach, and would be beneficial to   market participants, helping them learn what to expect from us  Although the decision today for   many of you may seem obvious that we should extend all of these facilities for fear of disrupting   something or other, I think that, as we get closer in time to a situation in which we really do want   to exit these programs, the decision process will become more difficult  Having a more   systematic, data-driven approach to making that decision in advance will do a lot to help us as   we move forward   We presumably want to look at metrics to gauge the efficiency of these facilities in   improving the functioning of particular markets  In the past, we saw a great deal of information   on spreads, but, as I have said before, I don’t consider spreads as sufficient information         January 27–28, 2009 51 of 267  Volumes are important as well, as I have stressed  I appreciate the work of Spence and the staff   I thought that the detailed discussions of the different programs were very helpful, and I applaud   the staff for that effort But we also need to know what to do with those data and how we   interpret and analyze the information  As has been alluded to already, if trading is thin, for   example, some spread measures may be completely irrelevant to thinking about some of this   information  It may be a demand problem as opposed to a market liquidity problem  Moreover,   I think we need an idea of what level of spreads and volumes we will be satisfied with when the   time comes  The memo from Vice Chairman Dudley on Desk authorizations talks about   reducing spread levels more in line with historical norms  Is that the right level?  What does that   mean?  Does it mean that we have spread levels similar to those in July 2007?  I very much   doubt that Shouldn’t we be thinking that these spreads will be elevated perhaps for some time to   come given the real credit risks that have been revealed in the current episode?  If so, how much   higher?  And shouldn’t we be thinking about spread levels consistent with weak or recessionary   economic periods as a more proper benchmark in this environment?  It is certainly true that   spreads on some consumer-type loans are very high  But many are not out of line with what we   have witnessed in other recessionary periods  How do we tell the difference, and how do we   think about that?   In addition, to the extent that private-sector intermediation is broken and the Fed’s   lending facilities are substituting for some of that role, it seems to me that you want to look at   metrics to gauge the degree of private-sector intermediation  I think that we need to focus more   on the health of the banking sector itself, such things as loan growth and the use of reserves in   the banking sector As I discussed last time, I think quantities of these various measures on our   balance sheet will be relevant for those sorts of discussions as to how we think that        January 27–28, 2009 52 of 267  intermediation process is functioning  We need to pay attention to how we set prices in these   facilities We want to ensure that our lending facilities don’t crowd out private-sector   intermediaries when they are healthy enough to return to the market  Otherwise, of course, we   risk distorting the real price signals and potentially delaying the recovery of credit-market   functioning More discussion of price-setting in our facilities would be welcome  We heard   some of that today, and I applaud that  Do we have the right penalty rates built in?  Are the   auctions set at the right minimums?  Referring to these on a regular basis and discussing the   implications they have on volumes would help us be alert to changes in markets and their   functioning and help ensure that we are not delaying the markets from healing themselves  So,   overall, I think we should have a much more systematic analysis and discussion of these sorts of   issues if we are to properly assess the effectiveness and necessity of these facilities   I have already talked about terminating some of these programs  By letting programs like   the authorization of the GSEs and the AMLF expire—I think they are redundant—and canceling   this emergency access to the discount window, we can strengthen our credibility, we can further   delineate the line between fiscal policy and monetary policy or between the Treasury and the   central bank, and we will strengthen the belief that we in fact will withdraw from these special   arrangements at the appropriate time and do so in a thoughtful way   I would like to talk just a bit about the purchases of long-term Treasuries  The staff   recommends keeping this program at bay for now or at least not implementing it  I don’t really   have any strong objections to that  I think the staff’s memo, though, omitted one reason that   buying Treasuries, in fact, might be desirable, and I really didn’t find its arguments for not doing   it terribly compelling either I see some benefits to having more Treasuries in our portfolio,   regardless of how one assesses the magnitude of the real economic effect on borrowing  It might           January 27–28, 2009 53 of 267  prove easier—and I think this gets back to the accord, Mr Chairman, in your discussion—for us   to unwind from some of these things if, in fact, we have Treasuries rather than MBS  I think our   credit programs do carry risks  Aside from the moral hazard problems we have created, we face   challenges when we attempt to liquidate particularly non-Treasury assets from our portfolio  We   will get pressure from various interest groups to retain certain assets  We will certainly, in all   likelihood, get calls from consumers, builders, and Congressmen if we start to sell mortgage-  backed securities out of our portfolio in order to reduce its size  We will hear fears that the   mortgage rates may rise  We will have some market participants resisting our desire to pull back   from our credit programs, fearing that markets remain too fragile or the economy’s headwinds   are too strong  I think we will make every effort to resist such pressures, but they could make it   difficult for us to conduct monetary policy in a way that is consistent with our mandate,   particularly our mandate for price stability  Moreover, given that we have crossed the bridge on   credit allocation schemes to specific markets, it will be much easier in the future for special   interest groups to ask us to repeat such actions, especially if they can’t get the answers they want   from the political process   Thus, I think—and I realize this view isn’t shared by all—that the credit allocation   schemes we are pursuing run a real risk of impinging on our independence and our ability to   control our balance sheet and, hence, monetary policy  Again, drawing back from the AMLF   and perhaps the GSE discount window lending facility may help us begin to reassert a bit of that   independence For that reason, I am not uncomfortable with buying long-term Treasuries, partly   because of their portfolio effect as a substitute for buying MBS  Mr Chairman, I think that your   comments about moving more of this to the Treasury are exactly right, and it certainly applies to   Maiden Lane I think it would apply to the CPFF in some respects and perhaps to the TALF, as        January 27–28, 2009 54 of 267  President Lacker was suggesting  I didn’t find the staff’s arguments against purchasing long­  term Treasuries particularly compelling  I guess I share President Lacker’s view that, if we are   blowing up our balance sheet—whether we are blowing it up with MBS or with Treasuries—it is   still expansionary monetary policy as far as I am concerned, and I don’t think it should make that   much difference on inflationary expectations The staff also raised the problem of interest rate   risks inherent in longer-term Treasuries  Again, I don’t see this as a particular problem distinct   from our purchases of mortgage-backed securities, which also contain interest rate risk at the end   of the day, if we have to sell them  Both of these programs increase the maturity mismatch on   our balance sheet in very similar ways   I am a little puzzled—maybe I will save this for the policy go-round—about why we   should leave the door open in the statement  The estimated reduction in longer-term yields, as   the staff suggested, is somewhere between 10 and 30 basis points, which is, at best, quite   uncertain based on the empirical evidence Putting aside my concern for portfolio composition   and my preferring Treasuries, I don’t find buying long-term Treasuries that compelling, except   for this portfolio reason Thus, a better reason for leaving the door open may be this portfolio   argument, but I don’t think we could explain that very well  We could simply say that we   continue to weigh the costs and benefits  But I do have some reservations about continuing to   discuss in our statement programs or actions that we might or might not take  I think that there   are certain risks to that in terms of making markets believe that we may do something, and then,   if we don’t do it, we lose some credibility  But we can talk about that in the policy go-round    Thank you, Mr Chairman   The AMLF is not the FOMC; it is the Board   Thank you, Mr Chairman   May I just ask about that? The asset-backed paper that actually comes   through the AMLF, is it mostly commercial paper?   So they could also sell that into our commercial paper facility, could   they not?   Thank you   I agree with you, President Rosengren, about the objective of trying to   lower the spread on the MBS, and the mortgage market is important  However, another way of   expressing one of my concerns is that, as we continue to focus on one asset class at a time—   mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed credit card debt, auto loans—I worry that we are   gradually being drawn into an ever-wider array of private credit markets and private asset classes   and instruments that we will just gradually expand  Where is the limit to this, and how do we                  January 27–28, 2009 66 of 267  define what those limits are? How do we decide what the criteria are that constitute something   important enough for us to intervene in that way?  I see this creep broadening our balance sheet   in ever-greater dimensions in these private credit markets  I worry that, in its doing so, the   implication is that, almost in a negative feedback loop, each market is going to become   dysfunctional by something so that it will drag us in  My desire is to have better objective   criteria that help us decide when it is appropriate and when it is not, because I think that we are   just going down a slope here that is broadening the scope, which is not helpful for the institution   I was going to ask exactly the same question  So thank you   I have a few questions, two really short ones—just clarifying ones—and   two longer ones On the presentation, I have a question on exhibit 7, the recovery across   different recessions I note that you say you started it at the second quarter of ’08 as being the   trough Everything else starts that at the NBER trough, which would have been the fourth   quarter of ’07 Why did you do that and not do it elsewhere?  Is there any reason for it?           January 27–28, 2009 98 of 267  I was just curious what the rationale for using that peak in some cases,   but in other parts of the presentation you used the fourth quarter   The second clarifying question—I’m curious about tightening standards   on consumer loans, particularly credit cards, in exhibit 4  When you asked a banker in the   survey about tightening credit card lending, how am I supposed to interpret that?  Does that   mean that they have reduced physically or technically the credit limits on credit cards?  Does it   mean that they are offering fewer credit cards?   It has been great that I get much fewer requests to apply for credit   cards [Laughter]              January 27–28, 2009 99 of 267  I guess the issue there for me is, if they are reducing excess credit   lines—for example, on credit cards that were not being exercised anyway—or just not offering   as many cards, how I interpret that in terms of really tightening credit is a bit loose there   compared with some other things  So I just wanted some clarification   Now, I have two more-substantive questions  First, about inflation forecasting  The best   way I can describe forecasting in this environment is guesswork, and certainly my staff and I   have struggled with the inflation forecast In a lot of models, the approach to inflation   forecasting both depends on and is very sensitive to varying degrees of incorporating forward-  looking expectations and how much looking backward you do  In this environment, when you   have big swings up and down in inflation, looking backward may or may not be very helpful or   very good It also depends a lot on how much credibility you think the central bank has  It is   further complicated because we are at the zero bound, and that is difficult to incorporate into the   models So I would like a little discussion from you about how you came up with your forecast   for inflation in this model—how much of the path that you got is really dependent on the model   because, frankly, it is really hard to figure out what to do, given all those things I just mentioned   Okay I think it is very difficult   So just two observations about that  One is that we spent a lot of the   past year, as we had the run-up in headline inflation due to oil on the upside, and most of us   stressed the importance of anchored expectations and believed that expectations remained fairly   well anchored Consistent with that ongoing view, my outlook looked more like your “anchored   inflation expectations” framework I guess I’d also just comment that a lot of the empirical   evidence on, let me call it, the new-Keynesian Phillips curves with output gaps suggests that the   sensitivity of inflation to some of those gap measures is certainly not as large as the sacrifice   ratio of 4 that you would put in So I think there might be reason to diminish that effect,           January 27–28, 2009 102 of 267  particularly if you thought, as we have discussed before, that some of these shocks might, in fact,   be shocks where you actually have a new, lower equilibrium  So the gap is maybe not as large as   it appears to be   My last question is about fiscal stimulus and your estimates there  It is   hard not to read the commentary, and there is a huge debate going on about the effects of   stimulus  Look at the empirical evidence, the theoretical evidence—the empirical work by   Blanchard, and Valerie Ramey’s stuff, and you have Christina Romer’s work on the different   estimates of multipliers and all that sort of stuff  And I was curious In the discussion, you   highlighted two pieces in particular  The first was the consumer tax cut and the debates about   whether or not that is going to be saved or spent, and the second one, which I thought was   somewhat more interesting, was that you thought that the business tax cuts would not have much   effect I guess I had two questions about that  One, my reading of the empirical evidence is that   those business tax cuts often do have some very short run stimulative effects, but the empirical   evidence also says that large spending increases oftentimes have a negative effect on business   investment  That is where the substitution comes from  So I just would like a little insight in   terms of the model or the assessment of the pieces of this stimulus and how it plays into what   you’re assuming about some of those multipliers and so forth   If that is true, it would suggest that the other relevant piece of evidence   for this is that, if large increases in expenditures as opposed to tax cuts act as a negative on   business investment, as some of the empirical evidence suggests, your forecast for business   investment may be worse than what you have in your model—or not?   Well, the key is that you were treating them as permanent   That answers the question there           January 27–28, 2009 104 of 267  Okay Thank you   I tried to get an answer on that, and they would not give it  Maybe they   will answer it for you   Thank you, Mr Chairman  Like everybody’s District, our District has   slowed and continues to look very weak  The business outlook survey actually rose a little last              January 27–28, 2009 121 of 267  month, but it is still measured deeply in recessionary territory  Our banks continue to lend—to   households, in particular They have cut back on commercial lending, and credit quality   continues to deteriorate across all loan categories in the District  Housing sales are down, but   prices have not fallen to the degree that they have in some parts of the country, probably on   average—the declines have been more modest  And the housing problems are not quite as bad   as in some parts of the nation, but everything has deteriorated  So, basically, in the Third   District, the current economy and its outlook look largely like those of the nation as a whole, and   all indications are that this recession will certainly be one of the worst in the postwar period   There are lots of reasons for doom and gloom  As we have just heard, there are lots of   reasons that we think that this recession and this weakness will continue, perhaps for some time   to come  But somebody has to take a somewhat more optimistic view—just to make the   distribution complete, if for no other reason, right?  [Laughter] I think there are common   elements to many business cycles  I also find that one thing people have focused on a lot   regarding the press and other things is that business sentiment, consumer confidence, and how   people feel about the future appear to be very sensitive in this particular phase of the cycle    Those things are pretty gloomy right now, but I would suggest that many economic cycles do   have some commonalities, and one of those commonalities that often appear—not every time,   but often—is that sentiment can turn around very quickly and it can change for reasons that   sometimes we don’t understand or can’t easily predict   It is also true that financial markets can move very quickly in various directions  We   have seen them move very quickly to the bad  Once markets begin to heal, they could move very   quickly in the other direction So for the sake of optimism, I think there is still a possibility that   at some point—maybe not in the first half of this year and maybe not even in the second, but                 January 27–28, 2009 122 of 267  there is still the hope—things could turn fairly quickly  I am not basing a lot on that, but I do   feel somewhat more optimistic than a lot of people—including my staff, by the way  They   forced me to say that they take no responsibility for this, [laughter] and so I am letting them   completely off the hook   They have disowned me  They have had it  I do anticipate the growth   path to look somewhat like that in the Greenbook  But I am basically a little more optimistic   than they are—a very weak first half, maybe some positive growth in the second half, which may   just balance each other out, but that may be an optimistic perspective  I expect the economy to   gain some steam in 2010, to about 3 percent, and settle into something closer to a steady state or   at least to a long-run trend in 2011  I have less overshooting in my forecast than some of the   models do—and I think than the Greenbook—because, as I explained yesterday, I have less of an   output gap than they do I think some of the productivity shock on financial intermediation is   showing up in less of a gap, and therefore there is less of a closure and pushback on the other   side Unemployment rates will clearly rise this year above 8 percent, but I hope that by the end   of the year they will begin to stabilize or perhaps come down a bit   On fiscal policy, as I was asking the staff yesterday, I am not very optimistic that the   fiscal package will do much for the economy  A multiplier of 13 is probably pretty optimistic,   from my perspective  So I haven’t built in much effect from fiscal stimulus  I hope the fiscal   package is constructed to give its best shot at helping, but I am not entirely optimistic about what   its shape will actually look like or whether it will actually be very much help   Obviously, because I am on the more optimistic side, the risks to my forecasts are clearly   to the downside My inflation forecast is less deflationary than the Greenbook’s baseline, and it     January 27–28, 2009 123 of 267  is similar, as I said yesterday, to the alternative simulation labeled “anchored inflation   expectations” In that sense, I am relying more on forward-looking expectational models than on   distributed lags of past inflation, which heavily affect both the output gap and the forecast of   inflation going forward, given the wild swings in relative prices that we have seen  I think more   in terms of estimated new-Keynesian Phillips curves, in which the output gaps both are smaller   and have less effect on inflation  Again, those lead me to a little less dire scenario in terms of the   deflationary pressure of output gaps going forward  I put a lot more weight on our credibility for   keeping inflation near 2 percent than on the past behavior of prices  There is some risk to this   inflation forecast, as I alluded to Near term, we will not see much inflation  I am not concerned   about that Nor do I think that deflation is going to be very persistent  Some of it is already in   train because of the way oil prices are behaving  I do think that, in the longer term, there are   inflation risks unless we manage our balance sheet appropriately  I am encouraged by our   discussion yesterday and some of the language that we talked about in terms of thinking about   how we manage that in a careful way   Finally, I would just repeat my request—I think it was at our January meeting on inflation   targeting—that it would be useful in our forecast summaries actually to forecast and report out,   as we do with other measures, our assumed policy paths that each of us are using for our   projections In the internal summary, you give a verbal description of people saying what their   assumed policy path is  But I do think that it would be useful to summarize those in terms of   both ranges and central tendencies because, as we move—assuming that we can and do—to a   more explicit inflation-targeting regime, that range of central tendencies for the assumed policy   paths should be added I think it will both help for transparency reasons and help anchor   expectations as to what we are doing, and that would be good  So I would encourage us to              January 27–28, 2009 124 of 267  continue to pursue that effort, and, of course, I am in favor of the longer-term projections  Thank   you, Mr Chairman   They will be pleased   I would just reiterate that I worry about that phrase for exactly that   reason We potentially shape the expectations in a way that we do not want to have them shaped   by going too far in that direction  So I share your view   Or, in fact, it may suggest that, if we believe it, our policies aren’t going   to be enough to prevent it   Well, there are a lot of things that are factually correct that we don’t   say   Thank you, Mr Chairman   Thank you, Mr Chairman  I think it is clear that we will be keeping the   funds rate between zero and 25 basis points for some time to come, although “some time to   come” is a bit vague, which obviously has some desirability  I recall last time that we had a   significant discussion about making sure that our statements about the fed funds rate had some   conditionality to them  I do not know whether the statement the way it is worded is actually   sufficiently conditional or conveys that message or not, but I just raise that as an important   aspect of communicating Our plans are, in fact, conditional, and we need to make sure that is   included   Actually, I can live with the language in alternative B  I think it does seem to   characterize the current state of the economy, which is clearly quite weak  As I expressed   earlier, I am really not inclined to put in the additional sentence that President Yellen suggested   for the reasons that I worry about the fragility of expectations, and I think we need to maintain   our credibility and our firmness with our view that we are going to maintain those  I am also a   little worried I have two problems with alternative A  One, it sounds too panicky to me  The   Chairman and actually Governor Kohn mentioned the fact that things look pretty bleak  But if   you look at the Greenbook forecast, it is really not that much different from the one in   December  December was a clear shocker, if you want to think in terms of changing people’s   expectations about our forecast profile From December to now, it is not entirely obvious to me   that the bad news we have received was that much unanticipated—maybe a little, but not hugely    So I would hate our statement or the minutes to reflect such a gloomy view that the markets read   it as another big downward shift in the forecast because I think it may do more to damage the   markets and cause concern  So I would like to have the minutes and even the statement reflect a     January 27–28, 2009 190 of 267  little more that this was not entirely unanticipated, which is why I like alternative B  This is not   that big a change in our view, which was pretty gloomy to begin with   As I have argued before, and others have mentioned, anchoring inflation expectations, as   I alluded to, is central to both our credibility and our success going forward in this environment    I agree with President Bullard, as he said in the earlier go-round, that the Greenbook path—and I   alluded to this as well—of a zero fed funds rate for the next four years paired with a 3 to   4 percent real growth rate and essentially no inflation to me seems highly implausible both as a   positive statement in terms of a forecast and as a normative one  Somehow those three pieces do   not fit together real well in the way I think about the world, in part because I am not sure I   understand entirely how the expansion of our balance sheet actually fits into that forecast and   perhaps how that affects inflation as well  So I do not find that terribly, terribly plausible   More important, if we are to retain our credibility to maintain stability of inflation   expectations, we must develop or offer a more transparent discussion of the link between our   current policy actions and that objective or those expectations  I do not think we have done that   yet In this regard, we do need to think more about sizes, quantities, and evolutions of our   balance sheet As I stressed at our last meeting, and as President Bullard suggested, there are   ways to begin doing that I don’t claim to know what those right quantitative measures are  I   think we need to do some research But just because we don’t know what the right measures are   doesn’t mean that they don’t matter or that we should ignore them  The clarity of policy   demanded by the public for the TARP and the pattern of interventions applies not just to the   Treasury but also to our bailouts and our interventions  I think we need to continue to work on   transparency in this regard and the way all of these pieces fit together  Otherwise, I do fear that             January 27–28, 2009 191 of 267  we would be further contributing to a delay in the recovery, as institutions sit on the sidelines and   investors wait to see what next intervention or bailout is likely to come   So I am not terribly comfortable with alternative A  I don’t like naming quantities for   some programs and not others  I think that is not a good strategy—it singles out some programs   as being more important  I don’t think we know enough about the quantities to be able to   mention them  I also agree with President Hoenig and others who have suggested that we really   don’t know how the fiscal policy bailout, the aggregator bank, and our roles in these various   things might evolve  We need to wait and see before we make commitments to specific numbers   of things in which we are not sure what role we will play  Finally, and related to this, I do have   some concerns about continuing to discuss programs or actions that we might choose to pursue    While I understand the intent of that may be to manage expectations and signal our commitment   to explore every possible avenue to support the economy, such statements are speculative in   some sense and may at times do more to confuse the market than to settle it  Indeed, if we were   to talk about things we might do and then decide not to take these actions, how would that affect   our credibility and the message that we are sending?   In his discussion, Brian talked about how the phrase about longer-term securities might   be interpreted—and this is really what I am referring to  I don’t know how it is going to be   interpreted, to tell you the truth I have a lot of uncertainty  But I do worry about our talking, in   a statement of policy actions, about speculative actions that we don’t know whether we are going   to do or not I worry about what that is going to do to the markets, particularly if at some future   time we drop it, and that we may have gotten ourselves into a bind by putting it in there  We   need to think very carefully going forward in this regime when we really haven’t decided yet           January 27–28, 2009 192 of 267  what policy instruments we are going to be using and how we are going to be using them—   speculating about that in our statement seems to me to be a bit risky   So I can support alternative B, Mr Chairman, pretty much as it stands, with the caveats   about not being more negative than we were last time and some caveats about both the   conditionality and the forward-looking statements  Thank you, Mr Chairman   Mr Chairman, on that point—it does concern me that this is a bit of a   conundrum about how we do the statements, but I would be more comfortable with the language   that Governor Warsh suggested, which gives a little more conditionality to it   I am sorry  I didn’t even write it down  It just sounded better  "
8691,2009-02-07,PLOSSER," Thank you, Mr Chairman  I think this last round of discussion about   communication is really critical, and I share some of the concerns that have been raised  The   other point Governor Duke raised that I think is important is the relationship between the   proposals for sterilization and the increase in the size of the TALF  And I like the proposal you   made, Mr Chairman  I think it’s a great step forward  But I’m anticipating that we’ll have to   hang tough on that—that there might be a lot of pushback from the Congress saying, “You don’t   need to do this Just do the TALF and increase it to $1 trillion anyway  We don’t need to   provide you with the sterilization capabilities”  And I think we have to be pretty tough in trying   to ensure that we have that flexibility  I think it’s an important step   The other thing is the Government Investment Board you talked about  Will they have   oversight over all banks who accept capital from the TARP, either old or new?  Or will it be   partitioned by some sort of size—just the top 22?  And, therefore, are they the ones that will be   imposing these conditions you spoke of—the commitments to lend, the executive compensation   issues that would have some stronger conditions, and the dividend restrictions?  Is that going to   be managed through this oversight board, or is that something separate?  And whom will that   apply to?  Again, just the ones that have accepted capital, or everyone? I don’t know if there’s   any clarification on this   Back to the communication—about the $1 trillion headline number  I think it’s going to   be viewed by many people as a target  And we’re going to have to work hard not to have it   interpreted that way              February 7, 2009 36 of 65  My last question is about the aggregator bank  Having a good bank–bad bank model is   obviously not something new  There are a number of banks in history who have created good   bank–bad banks internally where they actually split a bank into two and gave shareholders and   debt holders shares in both banks I’m wondering about a way of minimizing public   commitment of capital for the bad bank, and I’d just like to hear a little more discussion about   how the public-private relationship in this bad bank might look  Anything more expansive you   can offer on that I’d appreciate Thank you, Mr Chairman   Thank you, Mr Chairman  I appreciate the answers  But in some   sense, won’t the scrubbing exercise, at least for many of these banks, help drive them to make   perhaps different decisions about those assets that they’re willing to sell and what they’re willing   to sell them for?           February 7, 2009 39 of 65 "
8715,2009-03-17,PLOSSER," Thank you, Mr Chairman  A procedural question We had seven   presentations Are we just going to do questions for now?  Are we going to have an opportunity   to do a sort of go-around?   I just wanted to go by the rules  On the large-scale asset purchases, I   have a couple of questions about some of the underlying assumptions  I was struck by the fact   that the assumption was that, under an MBS purchase of $500 billion, the rates on corporates and   Treasuries also go down But the net effect of that, given the assumptions you made, was that   corporate spreads rise by 20 basis points, whereas under a Treasury bill purchase, corporate   spreads fall by 20 basis points I’m puzzled about what model generates that kind of differential   effect, and how much that might be driving some of the stimulation results that you’ve got  I’m   a little puzzled about what drives—well, I know what drives it; the numbers you put down drove   it—but I didn’t know whether you thought that was internally consistent or whether there were   economic mechanisms that you thought that was consistent with           March 17–18, 2009 33 of 266  The second question I had was about the assumptions about the elasticities  You’ve got a   mortgage-backed security market that’s $7 or $8 trillion, somewhere in that neighborhood,   you’ve got a $500 billion purchase—so that’s a little less than 10 percent of the marketplace—   and you get a 75 basis point effect, whereas for long-term Treasuries you’ve got less than $2   trillion total and you do a $500 billion operation, and you only get a 30 or 50 basis point effect    So there you’re participating in almost a third of the market, and in the other case only about 10   percent It may be true that those are the right elasticities, but I’m wondering where those came   from  To get any effect in some of this stuff, you’ve got to have some sort of market   segmentation going on so that you can play the yield curve game a little bit   The other question on that topic was related to President Lacker’s question  The   presumption of these programs, particularly the mortgage-backed purchases, is that there’s   something amiss in the markets, that we’re trying to fix some intermediation problems, or there   are some dysfunctions in those markets  And yet it seemed to me that, as you expanded the so-  called spillover effects and they got bigger and bigger and bigger, it goes against the very   presumption of why you wanted to be in these markets in the first place—to try to promote   intermediation and liquidity  So I didn’t know how these two assumptions connected or   reconciled with one another—how you could get both large spillover effects and maintain the   presumption that these markets were dysfunctional I wasn’t quite sure how those two pieces fit   together   On the swaps, following President Lacker’s comments, I had some of the same questions    It seems to me that you offered three reasons why these swaps might be needed  One was this   issue of not having enough collateral in the foreign country for the central bank to do the lending   it wanted to do, and the second reason was the foreign central bank maybe wouldn’t accept the                    March 17–18, 2009 34 of 266  US bank’s collateral  But the other reasons really had to do with the solvency of that   institution It seems to me that, from an operational point of view, if a bank is insolvent, it’s not   clear we ought to be lending to them in the first place, so I’m not sure that’s a reason to be in this   business And given that it only applies to perhaps four or five banks, if it’s really a liquidity   problem, it seems to me that doing this through the discount window is a much more natural way   to think about what it is we’re doing and the problem we’re trying to solve  You offered some   concerns about how difficult that would be I guess none of those seemed insurmountable to me    And the fact of the matter is that we would probably be doing most of this lending out of New   York anyway, so it’s not as if you’re going to have to worry about lots of the Reserve Banks   necessarily having to get foreign currency It just seemed to me that it might be a better way to   go because (a) we do not want to lend to insolvent institutions and (b) the discount window   seems appropriate for exactly that liquidity problem rather than designing another facility   The last question I have is about the announcement effects  I worry that this is going to   be interpreted by the markets as a veiled or not-so-veiled attempt to support one institution  I   think the markets will see through that very quickly  I don’t know how to mitigate that if we   decide to do it  It could be viewed as a less than transparent effort on the part of this institution   to support a particular institution, and I think that, in turn, may damage our credibility and   damage our reputation in the marketplace  I think if an institution is in trouble and we make the   decision to help it in some way, then we ought to do it on its merits and not try to “back door”   that solution through another mechanism  Thank you   If you want to get a lot of response, it seems to me you’ve got to think   about it as a segmented market of some kind   Why is that?  Because the market would anticipate that we may go in   and buy those other private assets, such as corporate bonds?   It’s just a funny distortion, it seems to me   What I was trying to get at was this issue that the payoff is lowering all   long-term interest rates  And your assumption is that you’ve got this differential spread effect    Is that driving this notion that buying MBS might be differentially better?  Why wouldn’t you   just buy Treasuries and get the spillover?   Well, that really prompts the other question  What’s the appropriate   way to think about the scales of these operations?  How do we think about diminishing returns in   these markets?   Well, uncertainty about our policies really creates a lot of problems   Thank you   We’ve done a lot of things without much history  [Laughter]              March 17–18, 2009 44 of 266  But the question is Wouldn’t it be useful to try to get some handle on   it?  Suppose that limit’s not $2 trillion, suppose it’s $750 billion  How do I think about what that   number looks like, even within some ballpark?  I think it would just be very helpful for us to   think about when those diminishing returns on the types of costs that the Chairman alluded to   begin to kick in And how do we think about that?   I have just a clarifying question  When you say this stuff merges into   the TALF, I’m just not quite sure I understood how this would work  Could you explain that   again?              March 17–18, 2009 63 of 266  Okay So we would have to set a new schedule of haircuts for these   securities, because presumably they would be the much riskier and perhaps toxic assets of the   banking system   Back to the accord issue for the moment—you talked about Maiden   Lane going back to the Treasury at some point or under certain conditions  Would these assets in   the TALF be candidates for that same sort of transfer?   Okay Thank you   But the Treasury capital is the same  The ratio hasn’t gone up for these   assets relative to the TALF assets   Mr Chairman, just a two-hander  I was going to ask a question about   the difference between the FDIC program and the TALF-related program  How would I think   about what type of assets would go to the FDIC program and which ones would come in to us   through the hedge funds?  Based on the relative pricing of those two mechanisms and how they   would work, which vehicle would attract what types of assets?   Thank you, Mr Chairman  There are two sorts of questions I’d like to   address and tell you where I think I am and where I might be tomorrow or the next day after that    The questions are, first of all, the expansion of the balance sheet Should it be bigger than it is?   I’m not opposed to expanding the balance sheet  I’ve never expressed much opposition to it    What’s not clear to me is whether we have the right set of metrics to help us judge how much   expansion we need and what the right tradeoffs are as we do it  In that regard, before I go any   further, I want to thank the staff I’ve been raising some of these questions off and on  The New   York staff and the Board staff have presented an incredible set of memos for us this time, and I   just want to thank them a lot for their efforts  They’re really working hard to try to address these   questions, which are very challenging because they do not have easy answers  It’s much easier   to ask them than it is answer them, and I appreciate that fact  I do think, though, that we need   some better metrics to think about what it means to expand the balance sheet  I’m very   sympathetic to President Lacker’s view that maybe we ought to think about what’s the size of the   monetary base or the size of the balance sheet and set some bounds on it and how we think of           March 17–18, 2009 101 of 266  measuring that  Improving on metrics in that regard would be very useful  Also, in terms of the   size of the balance sheet, thinking about why it ought to be bigger or smaller and what the   appropriate magnitudes would be may help us think about what the composition of that balance   sheet is going to look like So I think we need to think about the size first of all   The second issue is, if we agree to increase the balance sheet to whatever size we want it   to be, then we need to think about its composition  Should the increase be in Treasuries?  Should   it be in mortgage-backed securities?  Should it be more TALF?  And here I’m a little frustrated   because I find myself, as I’ve said before, worried about credit programs and fiscal policy issues   and other things But even stepping away from that, it seems to me that we do these various   programs on almost a one-off basis  I think one of the challenges we face is getting some grasp   of how these programs are benefiting us at the margin  We’re always taught that you do things   at the margin  So you want to equate the marginal benefits of the different programs that we’re   trying to be involved in, regardless of our debates on other points about them   One of the things that I think we should also think hard about is how the different   programs interact with each other  I raised the question last time, when we talked about   extending them, whether maybe we could get rid of some of them, whether maybe they’re not   doing what we thought they would do How does the commercial paper program interact with   the Treasury’s guarantee program, which interacts with the AMLF, which interacts with the   MMIFF?  In trying to get, as I think the Chairman said last time, some rationalization of these   programs, I’d ask where at the margin we’re trying to get some benefit from each of these and   how do we equate them across that   I worry a little about the consequences of our pursuing programs where we become the   lender of first resort rather than the lender of last resort  One of the things we want is to have our            March 17–18, 2009 102 of 266  benefits spread across, or marginally equated across, programs  But I worry about the   consequences of our participation in some markets, where we either are the market or we’re   making ourselves the market by what we do  I think that’s something that we have to be   concerned about We have to worry about the anticipation that other players won’t be in the   market, as long as we’re there  Looking a bit beyond just the direct impact  Are we   discouraging participation?  Are we trying to revive markets that maybe shouldn’t be revived?    Indeed, by trying to keep certain specific markets in place, are we impeding the marketplace’s   search for other credit-allocation or capital-raising mechanisms? So I think we have to worry   about the endogeneity of the performance of these markets with respect to the decisions and   plans we make   That brings me back to President Bullard’s point about having a plan and having a path  I   think it’s very important, and it interacts with this notion of the degree to which we’re creating   problems for markets or solving problems in some of these markets  Not knowing what our path   of actions is going to be over the future, I think, is a source of uncertainty in the marketplace    The way I think about it is by trying to get to answers for questions like What do we think the   size of our balance sheet ought to be or what should its path be? How do we equate the marginal   benefits from each of these programs to achieving that growth, knowing full well that if we don’t   articulate what our strategy is and how we’re going to end when we enter markets, then we can   actually increase uncertainty and volatility rather than reduce it?  We have to think about those   choices   How does that play against the TALF and Treasury bills?  If we’re going to expand our   balance sheet—and, again, I’m not convinced that we need to, but I’m not necessarily opposed to   it—I do lean towards Treasury bills for a couple of reasons  I worry about the knock-on effects           March 17–18, 2009 103 of 266  that I was just alluding to about TALF programs at the margin and the various other programs   that we have I’m uncomfortable with not having more Treasuries on our balance sheet; I think   Treasuries would help our exit strategy at the end of the day My view of buying Treasuries,   though, is really about the composition of our balance sheet and not about trying to drive down   long-term Treasury rates  Of course, in this environment, where it’s essentially a zero interest   rate bound, buying short-term Treasuries is sort of a swap, and economic theory tells us that’s   not going to help us very much  So we end up being forced into buying longer-term assets  But   my first concern is getting a better balance of Treasuries versus all this other stuff on our balance   sheet So I’d be inclined in favor of buying Treasuries  It doesn’t mean I’d be opposed to   buying more MBS at some point in the future, but we haven’t gotten to the $500 billion level yet,   and we haven’t articulated a path  So I’d wait until we got a plan together to articulate this path   before we announced additional purchases of those types of assets   Like President Stern, I’m not a big fan of doing the legacy ABS through the TALF  I’ll   treat the bad bank model separately  But expanding the TALF to legacy stuff is going a little too   far Again, I worry about us becoming the lender of first resort, and I’m just not sure that’s   where we want to be   On the bad bank/good bank—President Stern made this point—I’m not sure that ought to   be our business or that we ought to be funding it  I think that should be a Treasury issue, and if   we can avoid being in that business, I would prefer it   But we’re taking on the assets in support and providing the liquidity   through the TALF to do that I’d rather let the FDIC program work than have us augment it              March 17–18, 2009 104 of 266  But let me move on to the other two issues  On the resolution mechanism, Mr Chairman,   I think you’ve been very clear about it; in fact, people in this room, myself included, have been   talking about this for almost a year  We need to get on with that, and it’s very critical  I think   that’s going to help us a lot, so I support that effort   As to the accord, I shared a memo about it with the Committee  My views there are   pretty clear They really haven’t changed  I do think that it’s important that the accord as I   proposed it be about keeping our balance sheet much more pristine and about the exit  It had its   antecedents in Al Broaddus’s and Marvin Goodfriend’s work and even was a recommendation of   the financial stability group of the G–30   But I do think that it’s a form of constrained discretion  If we don’t want to be in the   business of doing fiscal policy and we want to discourage the Congress from coming to us to   engage in fiscal policy, then we want to make it easier for us to say “no” in those circumstances    I think, Mr Chairman, you’ve done a terrific job in this; in the example of the Congress talking   about funding the automobile companies, you were very clear that that was not our business  We   want to discourage those kinds of requests, and my concern is raising the threshold for saying   “yes” What worries me about the Fed bills option, as opposed to the supplemental financing   securities, is that the Fed bills option is going to make it easier for them to ask us to do things  I   think of it as giving us an almost incredibly unconstrained discretion to do fiscal policy or to be   asked to do fiscal policy And that may ultimately become a lack of independence, not a source   of independence That worries me, because, at some point down the road—maybe ten years,   fifteen years, whatever—if the Federal Reserve became more politicized than it has been in the   past, it might be much more susceptible or much more responsive to a claim that “we have to   coordinate monetary and fiscal policies, and therefore, Federal Reserve, you should issue some           March 17–18, 2009 105 of 266  Treasury bills on our behalf and do some things to help coordinate policies”  That probability   may not be large, but it would be a very bad outcome for the institution, and I think we should do   all we can to resist being in that spot  The sunset provision, Mr Chairman, as you suggested,   may provide us some protection against that, but if the sunset provision comes along and we’ve   issued Fed bills in the past, then it might be easy for them to want us to do it again  So my   current feeling is, if I cannot get a true accord, as I advocated in my memo, I’d prefer the   supplemental financing program to be conducted as needed  If we think we need that   sterilization capability, I’d rather go that route  Thank you, Mr Chairman   Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Third District economy remains very   weak, and there are few signs that this weakness will lessen any time soon  The three-state   region hit its employment peak in January 2008  Since then, it has lost 18 percent of its jobs,   and 60 percent of that loss has come just in the last three months  You might step back and say,   “Well, maybe this is the darkness before the dawn”  I wish I had confidence in that, but I’m not   sure that’s what’s going on  It looks pretty bleak        March 17–18, 2009 132 of 266  Our Business Outlook Survey is set to be released at 1000 tomorrow morning, so it’s   confidential until then Last month’s reading was near a record of minus 41  The reading that   will be reported tomorrow morning is minus 35, so it’s some improvement  We usually take   about five points as being statistically significant, so this is just at that margin  A few months   ago, the index went up and just fell back down again  So I don’t know that there’s a whole lot of   comfort in the most recent number; I take it to mean things are about the same as they were    Survey participants do expect the outlook to improve in the next six months  But many of the   forward-looking indicators suggest that before that comes about there will be further cutbacks in   employment and further retrenchment in capital investment at our regional manufacturers   Although banks in the Third District are in somewhat better shape than the national   average—they tend to be doing pretty well—they do report consumer loan volume is down  And   many of them also report that companies don’t want to invest and don’t want to borrow money at   this point So it’s demand retrenchment rather than just supply retrenchment, from their   perspective   Bankers in general in our District are angry—they’re mad, they’re furious at the   government  I’m getting requests to give TARP money back at an increasing pace  They’re not   being allowed to do it, or nobody at the Treasury is helping them do that  They are, as President   Lockhart said, frustrated with the lack of clarity about where policy is going and what it’s going   to be They’re angry about the changes in the rules of the game, the ground shifting beneath   their feet And they’re frustrated that some of the programs aren’t doing what they’re supposed   to be doing I have one major player in the student loan industry saying that the TALF is not   going to do anything for student loans, which, by and large, are 7- to 10-year loans in view of the   time it takes to get through college  So buying new issues of three-year loans won’t help them,        March 17–18, 2009 133 of 266  because they don’t offer many student loans for three years  I can go down the list of many other   industries who feel the same way  Whom are we going to bail out, whom are we going to   protect, and whom are we going to support going forward?  I think there’s a lot of angst, a lot of   uncertainty, and a lot of frustration out there in the business community and the financial   community in particular   So our District economy’s outlook looks largely in line with that of the national   economy  As President Bullard suggested, one of the things that has been most worrying in the   recent episode is the dramatic decline in foreign countries and the impact that’s having  That’s   something we can’t do much about directly, but it is worrying, and, again, it’s causing more   angst and more fear and more problems   Now, amidst this downpour of bad news and numbers, there is a possible ray of sunshine    I note—as Dave Stockton did—that the consumption numbers seem to suggest that the free fall   in consumption may have come to an end  I hope that’s the case; that would be encouraging    Both retail sales and disposable income numbers have held up in the last couple of months, and   personal consumption expenditures have as well   The last two months of consumer price inflation data suggest to me that the risk of a   sustained deflation, at least in the near term, is somewhat abated  So I’m not as concerned as   some are—President Bullard, for example—about the shift to sustained deflationary   expectations Although I think we have to worry about it, that’s not my number one concern at   this point   Overall, my outlook for the national economy is pessimistic for the near term, although I   continue to have a lot of belief that markets eventually will recover, so I may be a little more   optimistic on a recovery than the Greenbook           March 17–18, 2009 134 of 266   Thank you, Mr Chairman  I raised some issues yesterday about asset   purchases and policy I think some of the things that remain questions for our policies going   forward include, for example How do we evaluate the merits of the various programs we have?   What are the tradeoffs?  Which ones work best?  Which ones don’t?  How do we equate the   programs at the margin to get the most bang for the buck as we use our balance sheet?   I think a lot of the discussion yesterday about Treasuries versus MBS had a mixed tone to   it, in the sense that part of it was a desire to use monetary expansion to support the economy at   large, while some people wanted to use the asset purchases for liquidity purposes or to bring   mortgage rates down or to target credit market interventions in certain markets  Certainly, part   of the debate about whether to use Treasuries or MBS depended on which side of that fence you   were on So I think we still have some work to do about deciding the policy mix   But I’m going to throw a monkey wrench in the works  Yesterday the Chairman asked   for alternative ways of saying some of this  One of the issues we discussed, and it came out, I   think, loud and clear, was that there’s a lot of concern about the path of policy  When we                                                                     March 17–18, 2009 181 of 266  announce policy actions—whether they be the TALF, MBS, or what have you—we tend to   announce them as quantities  As a result, it’s not very clear what happens when that quantity is   reached What happens after that?  What will be the next market?  What will happen going   forward?  I think there’s an argument that conducting policy in that manner creates a lot of   uncertainty in the marketplace about what’s going to come next  Are they going to do it again?   And, if so, how big would that be?  Another issue when we target specific volumes is that the   conditionality of those interventions doesn’t come through very clearly  It may seem that we are   going to do the $500 billion no matter what else happens   So President Bullard and I—I’m going to implicate him as well—wondered, “Well, is   there another way to do this that might be helpful?”  We put together a new version of the   statement, with the idea that we want to get beyond just announcing one-off programs that we   may or may not do again and move toward thinking about saying that we’re going to have a plan   to increase the size of the balance sheet or increase the size of certain components of the balance   sheet over a period of time, and that we’ll adjust those growth rates, if you will, as needed, as the   economy either worsens or improves   The proposed wording was passed around—we’ve called it alternative B′′6  The idea   here was to address the question, “Okay, how else could we communicate to the markets about   what our plan is?”  Paragraph 1 basically becomes, “The Federal Open Market Committee   decided today to continue to increase the Federal Reserve balance sheet through the purchase of   agency MBS and Treasury securities  The Committee expects the growth rate of the MBS and   Treasury components of the balance sheet combined to average about 10 percent a month  The   Committee will carefully monitor macroeconomic and financial conditions and adjust this rate of   expansion as warranted”   6 The statement distributed by Mr Plosser is appended to this document (appendix 6)              March 17–18, 2009 182 of 266  Now, we came up with 10 percent a month  Basically, that would get us to the $1 trillion   over the course of the year, which we were talking about yesterday  It’s ambiguous about   whether it ends up being Treasuries or MBS  It then says we will carefully monitor this   expansion at each meeting and adjust it as we deem appropriate—if we need to ramp it up, we   can do that, and if we want to bring it down, we can bring it down  The rest of the statement is   pretty much the same as the original  We took the rest of what was paragraph 1 and made it   paragraph 2, which is basically a discussion of the TALF and the other programs that we’ve   initiated So it is the same there, and the rest of the statement basically follows B  Again, our   view is that we were looking for a way to get us out of thinking about one-off programs or   volumes of purchases that we’re going to make, and instead we were trying to set a target or   objective for a growth rate of some set of quantities  I think there can be debate about whether it   should be Treasuries plus MBS I think President Lacker would probably prefer it to be targeting   the base to get the same outcome   But we wanted to put this on a table as kind of a straw man to get the Committee thinking   a little bit about different ways to help us manage expectations better  It’s also contingent on   economic conditions, which we think is important   So, Mr Chairman, I know we surprised you with this, but you asked us this question, so   we thought we’d try to come up with an alternative that’s worth discussing   I have a preference for Treasuries in general, as I discussed yesterday    My preference for Treasuries is not particularly driven by a desire to push down long-term   interest rates so much as it is by a desire to help manage the composition of our balance sheet    I’m not as worried about the effect on inflation expectations of buying Treasuries, in part   because, if there is a concern about expectations of inflation, it’s that I really don’t want them to   fall So I am not too worried about that aspect of it, and I do prefer Treasuries  In terms of the   magnitudes, I’m sympathetic to expanding, but I don’t have strong opinions about how much we   should expand   Pardon me  I missed one point I wanted to make in my comments    President Fisher reminded me of it  In our B′′, one of the things we changed was the description   of the economy, which, Jim and I both agreed with President Fisher, sounded panicky  We   changed what I think was in paragraph 2 to take out a lot of the detailed description and wrote,   “The decision reflects the Committee’s view that the economy is undergoing a severe   contraction,” which it is And we said “the near-term outlook is weak”  The other change in the   same spirit is in the rest of that sentence  “the Committee anticipates that market forces and   policy actions will contribute to a gradual resumption of sustainable economic growth”  I think   in the original it says that policy actions alone will stabilize the world  And, frankly, I think              March 17–18, 2009 186 of 266  creating an impression that the only game in town is policy actions and that market economies   have no contribution to make in this stabilization is setting us up for failure and a credibility   problem So we added the reference to market forces  Thank you, Mr Chairman   Well, actually, Mr Chairman, we did debate whether or not there ought   to be horizon on it But I think you could give a horizon if you wanted to, as long as you kept   the conditionality that we will monitor this going forward and that it’s subject to economic and   financial conditions   I think we say an “average” of 10 percent a month   Just a quick remark  I had suggested this notion of putting in market   forces in terms of returning to stability  I didn’t know whether you had forgotten that, but   nobody ever commented on it   “The Committee anticipates that market forces and policy actions will   contribute to …”   There’s not much confidence that government forces are going to fix it   either So I’m not sure   Can somebody explain to me how I am supposed to interpret that   change?   You just added “economic”   "
8741,2009-04-28,PLOSSER," Thank you, Mr Chairman  I, too, want to extend my appreciation to   the staff and to you, Mr Chairman, as well, for your comments just now about the extensive   work that’s being done I think it’s really terrific, and I know that it has been a lot of work and a   lot of new ideas on the table, and I just want to extend my appreciation for all the efforts   Mr Chairman, I do have two questions that I’d like to raise  One is in regard to Fed bills    As I’ve expressed before, I have some trepidation about Fed bills, not because of their economic   effect but because of the political ramifications that they may have in terms of a potential   invitation for the Congress to express more opinions about what we do with our Fed bills and   how we use them  One way to describe this is to suppose that we propose Fed bills to the   Congress, and of course, as we’ve discussed, your preference would be to have those Fed bills   with no strings attached—not subject to debt limits, not subject to oversight by the Congress, and   so forth It’s not an unreasonable possibility, for example, that the Congress might come back           April 28–29, 2009 24 of 201  and say, “We’re going to give you this, but here are the strings that are going to be attached”    My question is, What would we do in that circumstance?  Would we be forced then to take Fed   bills with the strings attached, or would we then turn around and say, “Oh, on those terms we   don’t want it”?  If we broach it that way and they come back and say, “Well, you’ve got it,” then   from a political standpoint they have potentially a lever to call the Federal Reserve before them   to talk about either debt ceiling limits or uses of Fed debt in replacing other kinds of public debt    So I’m just wondering if we have a strategy or if we thought about the consequences  Would we   be forced to take it on their terms as opposed to our terms?   Right The political environments of other central banks that have   those aren’t necessarily the same as our political environment   My second question, which you haven’t mentioned, is that I’d   appreciate any update or thought you have on the inflation-targeting issues that we talked about   recently  Is that a continuing discussion?  And if so, what is its status?   Thank you, Mr Chairman   Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Third District’s economy remains very   weak, and the Philadelphia staff’s state and coincident indicators and leading indicators suggest   continuing weakness, especially in the labor markets both in our District and in the nation as a   whole Although unemployment in our District is currently slightly below the national average,   there is little reason to believe that we won’t catch up at some point           April 28–29, 2009 49 of 201  Our business outlook survey improved a bit in April, rising to minus 244 from a   minus 35 in March, but obviously this is still a very low reading  The survey does offer some   glimmers of hope—“green shoots,” as I guess is the wisdom now—and firms’ expectations about   activities six months from now have improved considerably  They rose more than 20 points last   month, to a plus 362, which is the highest reading since October 2007   In general, our business contacts and our staff forecast suggest that the contraction will   continue for a while in the District  One piece of anecdotal evidence that is worth noting,   however, comes from one of our board members, who is the CEO of a leading manufacturer of   residential and commercial flooring For some time now he has been quite pessimistic, as you   can imagine, and for the first time in well over a year he said something positive last week—that   he is beginning to see a bottoming in the housing market  I take this as significant because he   has been one of our most pessimistic commentators over the last year and a half—of course,   understandably so His information is consistent with other signs in the data of some stability   beginning in the housing market, like the news of the upward revision of February new home   sales that we received last Friday  Let’s hope that such welcome signs continue, but it is not a   sure thing I would also note that my contacts from the credit card industry have told me that   non-auto consumer purchases for the month of April seem to be tracking at a fairly modest pace   of plus 04 percent on a month-over-month basis  Though not a great number, it is encouraging   that the stabilization in consumption and spending seems to be continuing   So the Third District’s economy looks largely in line with the national economy  Now, I   have never been one to go easily along with the crowd, and in that regard I continue to be   somewhat more optimistic than President Rosengren about economic growth, particularly in the   second half of this year and in the next year, and even more so than the Greenbook  However,              April 28–29, 2009 50 of 201  based on incoming data, I did revise down my GDP forecast for 2009 from the January forecast   and revised upward the unemployment forecast  The revision reflects the fact that the   contraction in the first quarter of this year seems to have been much steeper than I had   anticipated in early January I expect positive but modest growth in the second half, making the   fourth-quarter-over-fourth-quarter change in real GDP modestly negative   I have not changed my growth forecast for 2010 or 2011  I expect the economy to gain   traction in 2010, picking up to about 3 percent in 2010 and settling into something closer to   about 27 percent for the long-run trend in 2011 I see less of a growth rebound than many   forecasts because I view the financial market shock with which we have been hit acting much   like a negative and somewhat persistent productivity shock to the financial intermediation sector    One implication of that view is that the equilibrium real output has fallen, and thus the output   gaps as usually measured would be overstated  The very weak labor market data during the first   quarter have led me to revise up my path for the unemployment rate almost 1 percentage point   throughout my forecast period   Obviously there are risks to this forecast, and I share President Rosengren’s concern   about the fragility of the financial markets and the potential for the stress-test announcement to   have unfavorable reactions My downwardly revised projections are roughly balanced, but with   perhaps more than the usual amount of uncertainty  Now I realize that my forecast is more   optimistic than many, but I don’t think we should discount the economic dynamics suggested by   the historical data, even though I realize that the current episode might be a significant outlier   from prior experiences  This view is shaped, in part, by forecasts from a New Keynesian DSGE   forecasting model that we are developing, whose virtue is that it runs solely off historical   correlations in the data as reflected both in its estimated parameters and in the model shock           April 28–29, 2009 51 of 201  processes This type of model produces a forecast with significant recovery under way by the   end of the year   While I see somewhat more growth than the Greenbook, I also see less deflationary   pressure than the Greenbook baseline and greater risk of higher inflation in the outyears  There   are several reasons for this less optimistic view on inflation  First, my forecast relies more on   forward-looking expectations of inflation compared with FRB/US, in which backward-looking   elements are more heavily weighted in forming expectations  Second, I put less weight on   output gaps as predictors of inflation as seems to be called for by the empirical estimates of New   Keynesian Phillips curves  And third, I’m not convinced that the size of the output gap is nearly   as big as suggested in the Greenbook for the reasons I have already mentioned regarding the   nature of the shocks we faced This perspective also seems appropriate and is consistent with the   work of Orphanides and some others indicating the pitfalls of depending too much on output gap   measures, which it shows cannot be reliably measured in real time  Indeed, Orphanides finds   that the ex post revisions of output gaps are of the same order of magnitude as the output gap   itself  It is particularly hard to measure gaps at business cycle turning points   My skepticism of the empirical relevance and measurability of output gaps and my view   that forward-looking expectations of economic agents dominate lead me to be highly suspicious   of the Greenbook’s inflation outlook Indeed, if we look at inflation forecasts from a DSGE   model, we find inflation rising over the forecast period, with headline PCE inflation rising above   3 percent in 2010 and exceeding 4 percent by 2012 Of course, I understand that the current   situation and the nature of the current shocks suggest that sizable error bands are around the   forecast Still, I find that it is a useful exercise to examine these kinds of forecasts from   alternative models, which are informative and helpful in thinking about the overall outlook        April 28–29, 2009 52 of 201  Thus my view is that there is a growing risk of higher-than-desired inflation in the   outyears of the forecast With the funds rate at the zero bound and the concern for some near-  term deflation, having inflation in the near term run a little higher than our long-term goal might   be desirable  But I don’t think that we should be willing to accept inflation outcomes above our   goal once the expansion is well under way  I see that the longer-term inflation risk is tilted to the   upside because I have grown more dubious of our ability to correctly time the withdrawal of the   significant liquidity injections we have undertaken  Thus, for 2009 I am forecasting inflation in   excess of 1 percent—1½ percent and rising through the forecast period  Now, this forecast is   based on my assumption that, as the financial markets and conditions improve and housing   markets stabilize, the FOMC will begin to contract its balance sheet and raise the funds rate    Appropriate monetary policy in this forecast requires that we begin raising the funds rate by the   end of this year, certainly by early next year, and then continue to raise it throughout the forecast   period I have it reaching 3½ percent by the fourth quarter of 2011  Of course, this is a much   steeper path than that in the Greenbook, which wouldn’t be surprising since the Greenbook is   zero from here on out; but it is consistent with my more optimistic forecast and my view that we   cannot keep the funds rate at zero for the next three years and expect to achieve anything close to   our inflation objective  My forecast would show considerably more acceleration if I assumed the   Greenbook’s baseline forecast Thank you, Mr Chairman   Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Committee has embarked on a strategy   of working on all fronts to combat the severe economic downturn and continuing problems in   our financial intermediation sector  The recent return of some relative stability in financial           April 28–29, 2009 114 of 201  markets is, of course, welcome  But I believe it remains fragile  In particular, as many noted   yesterday, I think that the pending release of the bank’s supervisory stress tests has the potential   to be very disruptive to markets Let’s hope that doesn’t happen   Like many of you, I agree that the type of recovery we are likely to see is going to be   modest, but my reasoning and my view of that modest recovery is somewhat different from those   perhaps expressed through the Greenbook As I tried to articulate yesterday, my view of the   decline in equilibrium output is driven by a severe shock to the financial intermediation sector    It might be not only large but also fairly persistent  What that does is manifest itself in higher­  than-normal unemployment rates—sectoral reallocations as the Chairman is referring to—and   perhaps imbalances that the economy must work through in response to that shock  Thus, GDP   will be lower and unemployment rates will be higher  The main difference such a view has for   the outlook, compared with the Greenbook view, is the model’s implications for output gaps,   inflation, and policy paths  In this equilibrium story, the real allocations must occur, but it is   dubious that the policy actions can do much to prevent those costs from occurring  This view   also implies that gaps are smaller and less downward pressure on inflation is present, and thus   the appropriate policy paths under consideration would be less expansive in order to constrain   inflation   Turning to policy, I think we face some very big challenges and uncertainties  The Board   has now approved another expansion in eligible collateral for the TALF, with the previous   expansion announced just a month ago  And the staff is considering even further collateral   expansions, including legacy assets, with recommendations expected in the next few weeks  It   seems as though we are in a cycle in which we announce interventions in one market or asset        April 28–29, 2009 115 of 201  type and then almost immediately turn around and consider other interventions in other markets   and other asset types   Clearly, our intention is to improve market functioning in these sectors  But I am   increasingly uncomfortable with the practice, and I am concerned that our announcements—and   indeed the whole strategy of gradually expanding the breadth and scope of our interventions   across both asset classes and maturities—are another source of instability in the marketplace  I   am not certain that we have adequately evaluated the interactions among all of these programs or   that we have an adequate sense of the marginal benefit of the incremental actions that we are   undertaking Moreover, can we be sure that our programs are not distorting markets,   discouraging the return of participants who are waiting on the sidelines for the next great deal or   subsidy from the Federal Reserve policies, and hampering the development of new, sustainable   market mechanisms for raising capital and allocating credit, thus actually delaying financial   market recovery?   As I have said before, I am not against expanding our balance sheet, given the current   economic conditions and outlook  I do prefer that expansion be done with more-liquid   government securities, such as Treasuries rather than MBS, relative to illiquid private securities    I am troubled by our difficulty in quantitatively determining what might be the right amount of   expansion that is appropriate  Nevertheless, given our current commitments, I am against   announcing any further increases today The change in the forecast, and certainly in the   Greenbook and many people’s forecasts since March, doesn’t seem to warrant further   expansions I think we need to give our actions time to work   Thus I favor some version of B, B′, B′′, or B′′′ [Laughter]  That narrows it down quite a   bit I would also prefer, in general, that we be more explicit about the linkage between our           April 28–29, 2009 116 of 201  policy actions and our inflation goals  We mention in paragraph 1 that our policy actions will   contribute to a gradual resumption of sustainable economic growth, yet in paragraph 2 we give   only a forecast for inflation with no mention of our related policy actions  This seems to me   oddly asymmetric  By failing to link our balance sheet expansion with our inflation goals, we   fail to communicate an important and explicit aspect of our policy  We don’t say, for example,   that we are taking these actions in part to help ensure that we avoid deflation or, given that we   are operating at an effective lower bound, having inflation slightly higher would not be   unwelcome  By failing to make this link to our policy actions and our inflation goal, we are not   being as transparent as we could be, and I think we risk the public’s breaking the link between   our actions and inflation, thus potentially weakening our credibility and our ability to maintain   those well-anchored expectations   Short of being explicit about adopting an inflation target, we could, for example, create   more of a link by slightly modifying paragraphs 2 and 3  I am working off of B rather than B′   for now We could strike the second sentence in paragraph 2 on inflation—if I’m looking at the   right one—where we say, “Moreover, the Committee sees some risk that inflation could persist   for a time below rates that best foster economic growth and price stability in the longer term”    We could strike that sentence and change the first sentence of paragraph 3 to read, “In these   circumstances, the Federal Reserve will employ all available tools to promote economic recovery   and to forestall any risk that inflation could persist for a sustained period of time below rates   consistent with price stability”  In other words, I think we need to make sure that the actions we   take link to our inflation objectives more directly   As I suggested yesterday, I think we are at risk of generating substantial inflation in the   not-too-distant future, and that is particularly so in the policy path described in the Greenbook                     April 28–29, 2009 117 of 201  It’s useful to remind ourselves that the high inflation episode in the 1970s is a case study of a   rapid monetary expansion in the context of an apparently substantial output gap, and the   overreliance on and overstatement of poorly measured estimates of an output gap and a   reluctance to make the difficult decision to reverse accommodation in a timely fashion   contributed to very bad economic outcomes in that episode  I believe the current situation poses   an eerily similar set of circumstances and conditions, and we must be careful not to repeat that   unpleasant experience  I’m troubled by the challenge that we face in determining how we will   decide when we’ve done enough As I’ve noted several times, I’m skeptical of relying too   heavily on interest rate spreads as the sole criterion   More generally, I’m uncomfortable with the communication of our actions  The memo   that President Bullard and I circulated last Friday tries to address some of these concerns  We   have proposed language that reinforces the notion that our policy is state contingent and that we   are on a policy path rather than focused on one-time announcements for the purchase of some   class of securities, be they MBS or Treasuries, of some magnitude usually expressed in some   round number of billions of dollars without any explanation as to where those numbers come   from, much as President Lockhart’s question is about where the $450 billion came from  I think   our recent statements may be creating more uncertainty than necessary about what the FOMC   will do next in terms of announcing new quantities or new purchases of assets  The current   approach will leave the impression, as was just discussed, that we will stop purchasing assets   suddenly, cold turkey, and perhaps face the cliff problem that was just discussed   So I’d like to spend just another minute, Mr Chairman, to make some comments about   B′′ and B′′′ from my standpoint just so the Committee understands a little where we are coming   from  We did two or three things that we think are pertinent and important  First, we moved the              April 28–29, 2009 118 of 201  action up to the first paragraph, which is more consistent, we believe, with the traditional way in   which we’ve structured our policy statements  We also took seriously the notion that we have   made commitments  Rather than providing a litany of numbers, we think that we would just say   in the first sentence, “Treasury securities”  We purchased “Treasury securities, agency debt, and   MBS in a manner consistent with our previous announcements”  That suggests two things One,   in our previous announcements the Committee was explicit about saying that we would purchase   up to a certain amount  It doesn’t guarantee either that we would get there or that we might not   exceed it, but it does say “up to”  I think it is important that we maintain that flexibility, and we   think that our language helps ensure that We also chose to focus on the asset side of the balance   sheet, as the Chairman has many times discussed the issue of focusing on assets rather than on   the liabilities  We also note that we retain flexibility as to how the Desk would actually   implement this  Trish just gave us an example of the lumpiness of some of this thing  This does   not say that we would purchase every asset at the same pace, but it talks about the general pace   of expansion of the balance sheet, and the Desk would have some flexibility to implement that   depending on the nature of the securities that they were purchasing   In the staff’s B′ version, we were troubled by the expression “20 percent per month” for a   given period of time, which ignores compounding problems  If you did follow 20 percent per   month literally, we would actually far exceed the purchases that we announced  So we chose to   focus on growing the balance sheet and the total purchase of these securities by, we said, 18 to   20 percent per month over the near term because as, the balance sheet grows, the growth rate   would actually start to decline  We thought it would be better to express it that way than over a   longer period The log of 1 plus r approaches r when r is small, but when r is 20 percent, those   approximations don’t work very well anymore  Finally, in the first paragraph we make very              April 28–29, 2009 119 of 201  explicit, as Brian suggested, that the Committee stands ready to adjust both the timing and the   overall amounts of its purchases as the economy evolves, and that’s the important conditionality   We believe that trying to move to a statement that looks like this will not only help us   communicate to the markets that we are on a path—an important path, we think—but also   preserve our flexibility in terms of conditionality  We also believe that having a statement   structured more like this will help us when the time comes to start an exit strategy  This gives us   more flexibility in expressing what we believe the policy path may be  I will leave it at that    Thank you for the extra time, Mr Chairman  I appreciate it   By the way, I also want to compliment and thank the staff  Brian and I had several   conversations over the last several weeks talking about how to do this, and the staff were very   helpful and very accommodating, and I just want to express my appreciation for the interactions   that led to these suggestions So thank you   Well, that’s why the B′′′ was there That was part of the discussion, to   figure out what’s the best way to express that  But, again, I think that’s a point worth discussing    I don’t feel as strongly about that as I do some other pieces   Just to clarify the unemployment rate discussion, Governor Kohn, I   think the difference in the language that you and I would use on this particular issue has to do   with the fact that, even at 6½ percent unemployment, which was my forecast for the outyears, is   above what I would consider the steady state  But that does not necessarily mean that monetary   policy has some ability either to speed up that convergence or to alter it, and that’s the difference   between the models and the assumptions that we’re talking about  That’s the distinction   How about just “evaluate”?   I kind of like it [Laughter]   My concern was that we wanted to link our policy actions that we   believe are consistent with our objective of price stability  Mr Chairman, your suggestion   doesn’t link the two necessarily It just places it in a context  I am struggling a bit with what the   right language might be   Okay   So you are going to add that sentence  "
8781,2009-06-23,PLOSSER," There’s nothing that says they can’t operate, but do you think the   political environment is such that something dramatic might happen in response to that, given   what has gone on in this episode?  I would think that would be the bigger risk, not the accounting   treatment  It’s the political force   Thank you, Mr Chairman  I have a few questions Some of them have   been touched on already, but let me just see if I can get some clarifications  One question is for   Brian, and it’s related to your conversation with Eric about SOMA lending of agency debt and   the liquidity in the market  You said that one of your reactions so far has been that you have   kind of slowed down the purchases In fact, if you’re worried about the liquidity of that market   and we’re soaking up all of the liquidity, what’s wrong with another option, namely, to stop   buying?  Why create a program where we’re buying them and lending them back out again?   Why not just not buy them in the first place and let the liquidity of the market deepen as we   move forward?  Is there something wrong with that strategy?   That’s because we are buying them, right?              June 23–24, 2009 54 of 261  No, I was thinking purely in terms of the liquidity of the market, which   I thought you were concerned about  If we are heavily into buying in these markets and taking   those assets out of the market, and there are some liquidity problems for some of these issues,   then all we’re doing is turning around and lending them back out again to help liquidity  It   seems like we’re giving with one hand and taking away with the other  I’m just trying to   understand a little bit about it   I’m not necessarily opposed to the program   Another question On the winding down of some of the liquidity   procedures, there are some specific recommendations that are made about the TAF auctions and   some others about mixtures of extending the dates, cutting back auction sizes, and/or changing           June 23–24, 2009 55 of 261  prices in some form  I’m curious about how the staff thinks about the right mixture of   controlling prices versus quantities, the tradeoffs  I mean, October is still what, five months   away In thinking about when is the right time if we thought we wanted to extend, how much in   advance do we need to do that?  Is there an option of continuing to sort of just proceed with   gradually ramping up prices or costs of these programs to encourage the users to wean   themselves off of this and go back to the market?  Then we would not make the decision to   extend maybe for—I don’t know—a little longer or wait a little while to see whether or not we   can wean these players off and into the market  So thinking about the mix of both price and   quantity controls, I guess I was looking for some insight as to how do you pick between those   two and the tradeoff versus extensions or not   What I was thinking about was the pace  Take the TAF, for example—   the recommendation is to cut from $150 billion to $125 billion, and maybe or maybe not to raise   the minimum bid rate  Why don’t we cut to $100 billion immediately?  It’s undersubscribed by a   substantial amount Why not move the minimum bid to something closer to the interest rate on   excess reserves rather than making it so far below it that we’re subsidizing, at least in the current   environment  We’re sort of mixing those two things up, trying to figure out what the right   balance and strategy are, or how aggressive one wants to be in this process   Well, I worry particularly about the TAF—it’s so dominated by a   couple of banks, and I don’t want to confuse supporting a couple of banks with the broader   purpose of sort of what these bank programs might be doing   I wanted to make a couple of other points—and Jeff made both of these in a different   form  One is the communication issue  If you provide more flexibility to the Desk to do some of   this stuff, communication is going to be really, really, really difficult, and we may be accused of   being less transparent rather than more transparent about that  So I think that’s going to be a   very tough task   The other point is on the interest on excess reserves  It’s certainly true   that there’s a possibility that as the markets and the economy begin to recover, we’ll have a lot of   excess reserves sitting out there And the opportunity cost to banks may be, “Okay, when can I   make a good business loan at 8 percent or 7 percent?”  And they view the risk tradeoffs for that   as the right ones We may be faced with a situation, even if we thought interest on excess   reserves worked perfectly, where we would have to raise the IOER very aggressively to choke   off that massive amount of liquidity that may be just sort of running out into the marketplace  If   interest on excess reserves isn’t working as we’d like to see it work, then we are going to have to   combine that with some other mechanism for draining those excess reserves  The question is   What’s the relevant interest rate that’s going to guide us in some of those moves?  And I think   that’s very difficult to sort out, even with the tremendous job the staff has done—there’s a lot of   forest and a lot of weeds here in trying to sort through the details  But I do think it’s important   that we try to make sure that if Plan A doesn’t work, we have a Plan B  That is, we need to make   sure that if IOER doesn’t work as we hoped it would, we have other mechanisms to drain the   reserves  But we may have to do that at a very rapid pace, which may mean some of these   mechanisms that you suggest may operate more quickly and are more easily implemented than   others, and that might be a consideration that we have to think about   I don’t think overnight, but it may be a period of months   Mr Chairman?   I have a very brief intervention, because it’s related exactly to this   point Brian, a little earlier when I asked you the question about agency debt, you said that you   presumed we were going to go to the limit on that  Is it the expectation of the Desk and the   markets that the operative words of “up to” certain amounts in our policy statements are   basically irrelevant, and that, in fact, we’re viewed as committed to going to those amounts and   we wouldn’t consider doing less?   Do you think the same is true for the MBS and Treasuries?   Thank you, Mr Chairman  On your three questions, I agree with much   of what Governor Warsh just said  In terms of exit strategies, I think the staff did a terrific job in   thinking through this and in the very elegant way they laid out the options  In my own personal   view, I think we could be a little more aggressive in either cutting quantities or moving minimum   bids up in some combination, particularly for the TAF and even for some of the others, in terms   of the haircuts In general, I’m very supportive of the strategy  The only thing I was very   disappointed in was the GSE facility  That facility came on not quite a year ago  It has never   been used The Treasury got funding to support the GSEs  I would have liked to have seen that   facility rescinded back in September or October after the Treasury got funding  I still think it   ought to be rescinded I don’t think that is a place we ought to be  I do think the announcement   of these modifications to the facilities and particularly the language in the press release that the   Chairman read will, in fact, be positive for the economy as a whole  There may be some places   in the markets that will lose the subsidies that some of these things might be providing, but on   net I think it will be a good signal to the marketplace   On the tools for managing the balance sheet, again, there were a lot of interesting ideas  I   think many of them could work  I would just like to reiterate how strongly I feel about not   wanting to have Fed bills It is a bad idea, not because it can’t manage the balance sheet, but                 June 23–24, 2009 76 of 261  because I fear that it poses incredible political risks to the System  It’s an opportunity for   interference, an opportunity for the Congress and the political parties to view this as another way   to intrude on Federal Reserve policymaking  Although we may ask for the autonomy to make   those decisions, that doesn’t necessarily guarantee that they will grant it  I have expressed this   view before I feel very strongly about Fed bills as not a good way to go in this environment;   many of the other tools, though, such as reverse repos and others, could accomplish much the   same thing, and I would encourage us to continue to work on those and the other options,   because they entail much less potential political risk   On the LSAP issues, I agree with almost everything Kevin just said  Our objectives, I   thought, were fairly clear; that is, we’re not targeting a price or a yield  The markets seemed to   believe that we were I think we would be well served, as was suggested, by clarifying it,   perhaps in the Chairman’s testimony in July, to try to reinforce that and disabuse the markets   I was struck by some of the other things that the Desk was talking about  I want to read a   couple of sentences, and I quote “Staff sees evidence of both stock and flow impacts from our   experience so far, although we cannot be certain of the precise mechanism by which they work,   or if the effects are permanent or transitory  That leaves a considerable degree of uncertainty in   designing and implementing the LSAP programs”  That suggests to me we don’t know exactly   what we’re doing or how it’s working, and so that argues against flexibility and the notion that   we’re going to go in there and play some game to raise this yield or lower that spread when, in   fact, we don’t know how these mechanisms are working  So I guess I would steer away from the   flexibility  I think that the “slow but steady” path is just fine, and that we can clarify that we are   not targeting a particular yield or price, but rather we’re encouraging market functioning and   liquidity, and leave it at that           June 23–24, 2009 77 of 261  In terms of the expansion, we still have a lot of purchases we could make if we wanted to    I’m opposed to going out and authorizing more purchases of agency debt, MBS, or Treasuries at   this point I don’t think we need to make that decision right now  And if anything, things are   looking somewhat better  So I would oppose that   I would also be against this notion of going in and buying hybrid ARMs or creating   options I think we do that because we can  It’s not clear to me what the objective is  We have   been pretty unclear as to exactly how effective we have been in some of these markets on some   of these prices and yields and what exactly the impacts are going to be  I think the evidence is   pretty mixed on our ability to go in and sort of micromanage various subsectors of these markets    So I don’t see any particular reason to expand into hybrid ARMs or to sell put options on   longer-term assets  I just do not think that is going to help us very much  Thank you   Thank you, Mr Chairman  I have a question I appreciate the   discussion about measures of slack and output gaps, and I was particularly struck by the   measures that were produced by the EDO model  In the Bluebook, your description of the   construction of the output gap is not the way I normally think of it—it looks like some long-run   trend or steady-state model  Most of these stochastic, general equilibrium models think about   equilibrium output being at a point in time, and then you get shocked away from that  The           June 23–24, 2009 113 of 261  difference between what might be produced by a sticky price model versus a flexible price model   gives you some measure of the difference between what’s feasible and what you actually get    But you’ve defined the output gap in a much different way, using what looks like some concept   of steady state, and I was a little puzzled by that choice  Of course, in your discussion you   highlighted the fact that that actually led to the EDO model having a very large output gap rather   than a somewhat smaller one  Most of these DSGE models lead to much more volatile measures   of what you might think of as equilibrium or potential output at a point in time  If you sort of   rethink, then, the range of where potential output might be in terms of what different models give   you, I guess I wouldn’t have selected that subset, I would have selected a little different subset   Right It depends on your model   I guess I don’t disagree with anything you’ve just said, except that I   think it’s important to note that the concept of potential output is not model-free  Therefore, we   have to think hard about what this construct looks like  At some level, you’re making some   assumptions about what that concept means, and that concept can differ quite a bit across models   that one might choose from  That’s what makes all of this hard in sort of figuring out what the   interpretation might be   Thank you, Mr Chairman  Good morning  Business conditions in the   Third District remained relatively soft in May and early June  Nevertheless, the steepness of the   decline appears to have eased rather dramatically, and the tone from our business contacts has   noticeably improved While our contacts don’t expect a strong upturn in business activity, they   clearly see signs of stabilization in the near term   The most positive indicator from our Business Outlook Survey, which was released last   week, is manufacturing, and that index said that general activity improved from a minus 226 in   May to a minus 22 percent in June—a 20-point swing, which is rather significant as these   standards go This indicates essentially flat activity in the District now  This is considerably   stronger than some of the national industrial production numbers, but consistent with some of the   other regional manufacturing surveys  Our survey has a fairly long history—a little longer than   Richmond’s, I believe, but I’m not sure  [Laughter]  And a movement above zero in this index   likely marks the recession’s trough, based on past relationships between this index and NBER   recession dates  The future activity index moved up quite sharply in June to levels we haven’t   seen in several years   The most negative factor in the District was the unemployment report  The   unemployment rate in our three states rose another 04 percentage point and now stands at   84 percent Payrolls have continued to fall, and, even in our surveys, the employment picture   does not look terribly bright   Based primarily on the expected labor market data, I’ve revised downward slightly my   near-term forecast for 2009 and upped my unemployment rate forecast compared with April    But I have to confess that my forecast in April was on the outlier side of positive compared with   many others  The basic shape of my forecast, however, remains very similar  A return to           June 23–24, 2009 119 of 261  positive economic growth in the second half of this year and recovery gaining traction in 2010,   picking up to about 3 percent This is actually similar to the Greenbook’s forecast, which has   been revised up since our last meeting, so maybe we are converging here at some point    However, our inflation forecast continued to differ  I see less deflationary pressures than the   Greenbook baseline, and, even with its upward revision to inflation, I see greater risk of higher   inflation not in the near term, but in the outyears   I continue to be skeptical of putting too much weight on output gaps as predictors of   inflation My reading of the literature suggests that gaps are difficult to measure with any   precision, and this may be one reason that gap measures get little weight in empirical estimations   of New Keynesian Phillips curve models  From the staff discussion yesterday on the range of   gap measures, it appears we may have very different perceptions about how to go about   constructing the appropriate measure of potential output  Nevertheless, I think it was interesting    In fact, the estimates reported yesterday showed a very wide range of views of what the output   gap may be—from something like minus 7 or 8 percent to minus 2 or 3 percent  We view that as   being a range of uncertainty about the magnitude of the gap  In a simple Phillips curve model,   that may imply a difference of between 200 and 300 basis points in what a Taylor rule might   imply about the fed funds rate  That’s a pretty large difference in policy stance, so that may   suggest very different policies   If we are closer to the smaller measure of the output gap than to the larger measure, it   also means that we may have to raise rates sooner than we might think  In Philadelphia’s own   DSGE forecasting model, we actually get considerably higher inflation pressures going forward   than the Greenbook baseline shows, particularly if the fed funds rate stays at zero through 2012    Given the difficulties in estimating and forecasting inflation, I do think we need to consider              June 23–24, 2009 120 of 261  alternative forecasts seriously  With the aggressive monetary policy actions we have taken, I   think this means looking at the possibility that our own inflation forecast possesses clear risks to   the upside and preparing ourselves and the public for the possibility that we may have to act   sooner rather than later In addition, the size of our balance sheet might complicate our ability to   respond as rapidly as necessary to curtail inflation pressures  And while inflation expectations   have so far remained anchored, I think we have to be cognizant of the fact that this might change   if agents become convinced that projected fiscal deficits will be monetized or if we fail to act in a   timely manner  For these reasons, I think we should be very cautious of being overly confident   that we can leave monetary policy accommodation in place as long as the Greenbook suggests   without some very bad consequences on the inflation front   Needless to say, with that perspective in mind, the fed funds rate path embedded in my   forecast is considerably steeper than the Greenbook’s, which holds rates at zero through 2011  I   believe we will need to begin raising rates by early next year at the latest and throughout the   forecast horizon, to at least 3½ or 4 percent by the fourth quarter of 2011  I don’t believe we can   keep the fed funds rate at zero and expect to achieve anything close to our inflation objective or   maintain our credibility in achieving that objective over the longer run  We can say what we   please, but it cannot substitute for action  Our assessment of the output gap will be central to   how the Committee thinks about the appropriate time to change course and begin to tighten, and   we may have to do so in a fairly rapid way  If we dramatically overestimate the size and   persistence of the output gap and wait, we will be too late to stem significant inflation risk   I think we also will need to monitor carefully quantities of various kinds, whether it be   bank lending or other measures  In the past, our operating procedures have constrained reserves   deliberately through our control of the fed funds rate and through limiting reserves to the              June 23–24, 2009 121 of 261  marketplace  Now those reserves are already out there, in the form of excess reserves in the   banking system  When banks decide it’s time to start lending again, those reserves can move   from excess reserves into bank lending very quickly, and they will not need to be supplied by us   as in the old operating regime  Therefore, I think this transition might be very quick—I don’t   mean days, but certainly over a series of months  Depending on what we view as the appropriate   equilibrium interest rate, our setting for the fed funds rate or the IOER may have to move up   quite rapidly, because the opportunity cost of funds in terms of bank lending may move up fairly   rapidly in the process   I think we’re going to face some severe challenges at the turning point when we have to   make the decision to move  It may come sooner than we think, and it may have to be more rapid   than we think I think we have to prepare ourselves for that possibility, and through our   communications, prepare the public for that eventuality as well  Thank you, Mr Chairman   Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ve already highlighted some of my views   on policy yesterday and earlier today  Let me just sort of clarify  My view of the outlook for the   real economy is really not much different from most people’s around the table—near-term    weakness, with modest growth returning in 2010  In fact, my own forecast is for less growth in   2011 than the Greenbook’s—a slow recovery in the economy in many respects  I don’t disagree   with that     Where I disagree has more to do with the nature and the specification of the Phillips   curve and how that guides both our inflation forecast and its implications for policy  I don’t   believe that the empirical relationship with gaps or slack is nearly as tight and predictable and   reliable as oftentimes we think it is, so my concern is that we have to be careful about that  I   would remind the Committee that, between 1991 and 1996, the staff, according to the chart they   handed out yesterday, had substantial output gaps ranging from 2 to 4 percent for most of that   period, and inflation hardly budged—it remained between 2½ and 3 percent during that whole   period So while I don’t want to rely on anecdotal information, it is true that this link between   output gaps and inflation is not a very strong one  I think we have to be cautious about relying   too heavily on that   My skepticism about the measurement of those gaps and the relationships with inflation   is most relevant for the deliberations we will have about when it’s time to reverse course and   how we decide when that time is  I think that’s going to be a very difficult choice, given the   uncertainty surrounding these relationships A tightening cycle will inevitably occur, and           June 23–24, 2009 170 of 261  choosing the right time to do it is going to be important for our future ability to achieve price   stability   I also think that, historically, this institution has been somewhat slow on the uptake many   times  If we rely too heavily on measures of slack in labor markets or unemployment rate gaps,   we will inevitably find ourselves behind the curve, because we know unemployment rates take a   long time to turn around, and the economy will turn around before that  If we wait until the   unemployment rate becomes an unacceptable level to reverse course, I’m fairly confident that we   will be well behind the curve So my point is really about the nature of the Phillips curve, and   about the reliability of those estimates, and about our ability to rely on them for policy decisions   during this critical time   I believe the economy is in this sort of bumpy transition from dramatic contraction   hopefully to expansion I agree with everyone that there are substantial risks to that forecast, and   we need to be conscious of those risks and those concerns  I’m very supportive, as I said   yesterday, of the staff’s proposals on winding down the facilities  I am opposed to increasing our   large-scale asset purchases  I think we need to be very cautious in that effort  We still have a   ways to go, so we still could increase purchases if we chose to do so  And I don’t believe we   ought to make decisions about adding to that volume very precipitously or quickly  I would also   hope that the argument is symmetric; that is, if the economy improves and evolves in the way   that many of us are hoping it will over the course of the fall, then we may not necessarily have to   go to the full limit on some of these programs  I think we have to make that clear to the public as   well   A major issue I see in the policy decision today has to do with language—I think it’s the   communication effort that’s going to be so difficult  I think ultimately we are going to have to        June 23–24, 2009 171 of 261  find a way to extract ourselves from the current language of “exceptionally low levels of the   federal funds rate for an extended period” That’s why I am somewhat sympathetic to the first   part of paragraph 3 in alternative C, although I wouldn’t be nearly as explicit about the timing in   that paragraph “until late this year”  I would sort of strike that and just say, “for some time”    Even if we raise the federal funds rate by 25 basis points, it’s still exceptionally low, so I’m not   sure that the difference between level and changes here is important   Given my hesitancy and skepticism about tying our inflation forecast too tightly to slack   measures, I actually am happier with paragraph 2 in alternative B than I was before, in the sense   that both the persistence and size of the output gap become somewhat less dominant  I would   prefer C in that regard, but I think paragraph 2 is better than the version in the Bluebook that we   saw, so I’m happy with that   I think we have some difficult choices before us in the coming quarters, and it would be   helpful if we could continue to push for our inflation targeting goals  I hope that that is not off   the table and will continue to be pursued  But I do think that in the coming months and coming   quarters we are going to have to make some very difficult economic decisions, and we could face   considerable political pressure in the face of that  We need to prepare ourselves for that and   prepare the markets for it  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
8808,2009-08-11,PLOSSER," I would like to go back to the point about the 3/1s, 5/1s, and 7/1s and   whatever—how that affects the credit scores, a point that President Fisher raised  If we were to   go in and concentrate our purchases in some subset of these ARMs, hence driving their rates   down, then we expect the market response to that would be that maybe those credit scores   wouldn’t stay the same, that there would be a response where mortgage brokers and others would   help direct people into those products for which we are trying to drive down the yields and make   them more attractive  I think there is going to be an endogenous response to that, and we have to   be careful that we don’t put ourselves in a position by which we are creating even more   distortions than we already are by picking products in individual securities and trying to affect   their individual prices and not others  I think that is a very dangerous position for us to be in,   and we end up perhaps aggravating problems and actually preventing markets from doing the   healing that they need to do rather than just helping them along   My point is that there will be a demand response to this price change and that we cannot   necessarily assume that we won’t be, in effect, driving people to particular products and away   from others, and I think that’s something we have to be very, very careful of  So I just think we   should be very dubious about our strategy here in terms of making this work  Also it runs a risk     August 11–12, 2009 18 of 165  politically—not economically, but politically—and I think this is probably what President Fisher   was suggesting Actually the staff memo raised this issue  Politically it looks as though we’re   going into something that everybody has been condemning as part of our problem, and I think   we should be very, very careful about that   So I’m just wondering, Eric, do you really think there wouldn’t be a demand response to   our driving? If Brian is right and we can drive down the yields on the 5/1s and 7/1s by 100 basis   points, do you think that there wouldn’t be a demand response to that and, therefore, that credit   scores might, in fact, decline as opposed to being high?   It wasn’t much of a recession though   So you create one distortion, and you fix it by creating other distortions   to offset it?   Yes, a short one Brian, the way you have described the ARM market   and how it is not functioning the way we think—or at least some estimates suggest that it   might—I wonder if New York and the staff have on their agenda what the next market is  If I   listen to what you say, we ought to be in the jumbo market  And I am wondering, with the very   high spreads in the jumbo market, can we expect to see a proposal from the staff that we are   going to buy jumbos now in order to get their spreads down?   The argument is the same, though, isn’t it?   We could think of a way, couldn’t we?   Okay   Thank you, Mr Chairman  I have a question about both the TALF   piece and the tools  First of all, I very much support the Board’s views to suspend work on   RMBS and expanding the range of assets we include in that  It probably comes as no surprise to   most people I think that is the right thing to do  The Board’s staff actually gave a pretty good,   compelling case from my perspective of why that is a risky and maybe not a wise thing to do   With regard to the CMBS extension, I have two questions  One is that, no matter when   we choose to end it, if the view is that there are always six months of planning that go into it,   when are we going to decide to actually stop it?  Part of that has to do with the question of what   we mean by “unusual and exigent” circumstances and when that will come into play  So we   won’t get four months from June 30 and we won’t say, well, we need another six months to keep   it going I think we need to clarify a little for ourselves what the criteria are that we’re going to     August 11–12, 2009 43 of 165  use to choose to say “no more” and when we’re going to stop it  It also raises the question for   me, given the long planning time, about some of the rationale for these programs and the 13(3)   lending, in particular It is unusual and exigent circumstances, but it has been things that had to   be done immediately  Given the long planning periods for CMBS and other types of lending—   the Congress certainly was willing to do “cash for clunkers” and supply a lot of money to   subsidize the automobile companies and the automobile industry— and given the unusual nature   of the challenges in the commercial real estate market, oughtn’t this be a program for the   Treasury rather than a short-term liquidity program for the commercial real estate market?  That   is just an open question How do we determine when the right time is going to be, and when is   the six-month lead period going to be enough on the TALF?   On the tools, in listening to the discussion, I was struck that for the reverse repos the   volumes, at least relative to the size of our balance sheet, are pretty small  And I, like everybody   else, hope that interest on reserves works, that it is enough, and that we do not have to do a lot of   this extra stuff  But we need plans A′ and B to make sure that we can deliver on the policies that   we want So given the volumes that we would have to do, if the task really came to shrinking the   balance sheet in order to be able to do this, are these tools enough to keep the interest rates where   we want?   I guess that raises the question for me, which is sort of the last stop, about actually selling   assets We did have a discussion—I think it was at the last meeting—in which we talked about   income implications of selling assets and interest rates  It seems to me, when we talk about   reviewing these tools and mechanisms for hitting our targets in managing reserves, that   understanding both the consequences and the mechanisms by which we would actually sell   assets if the time came to do so need to be in our hip pocket  I guess my request is that, in the              August 11–12, 2009 44 of 165  process of reviewing these reserve management tools, we include the selling-assets piece as a   way of better understanding what the consequences might be if the world came to that’s what we   had to do That’s all   Buying and selling we know how to do   On a continuing basis   Thank you   Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Third District’s economy seems to be   bouncing along the bottom  Signs of stabilization abound, but evidence of robust activity is   lacking in any specific sector Let me hit just a couple of highlights   There has been some improvement in the residential real estate market, and a large   national homebuilder told me that the pickup might in fact be understated in the data  He   indicated that very few offers are now being canceled, and he is actually becoming less willing to   negotiate on price and in some markets even beginning to raise prices on homes  This seems to   support the national data, which seem to show some firming in house prices nationwide  Further,   he indicated that his firm is beginning to purchase raw land for development  On the other hand,   non–real estate investment is still declining  Office vacancy rates continue to increase, and   nonresidential construction contracts are few and far between outside of government, education,   and health care A number of leaders in small and medium-sized business have told me that they   are willing and able to expand in the near term  But the Congress’s debates about health care,   taxes, deficits, and spending give them great pause, and they are indeed inclined to wait until   some resolution has occurred in the Congress  This, in fact, could delay recovery rather than   enhance it           August 11–12, 2009 72 of 165  Labor markets continue to deteriorate in our District, although the pace of decline has   lessened One encouraging bit of anecdotal evidence comes from the CEO of a very large   temporary employment agency, who told me that both requests and placements have risen   substantially in the last couple of months  This seems broadly in line with what seems to be a   somewhat less dour employment picture at the national level   Bankers in our District are reporting deteriorating loan quality, and they are watching   their commercial real estate portfolios very carefully  However, a very large national credit card   issuer told me last week that new credit card delinquencies—that is, those showing up in 30-day   delinquencies—have fallen for 8 consecutive weeks  Although there remain many delinquent   accounts that are working their way through the system, this is indeed an encouraging piece of   news and may suggest that the financial situation of the consumer may be starting to stabilize   Our Business Outlook Survey was a tad weaker in July than June—and the August   numbers are not in yet—but it was not significantly so  However, the general level of activity   and new orders and shipments have all improved substantially since earlier in the year and are   well above what were previously characterized as recessionary levels  Manufacturers in our   District are not signaling that they plan to increase future hiring or capital expenditures as yet,   but they do expect activity to pick up over the next six months  Indeed, our index for economic   activity six months ahead remains at a very high level, consistent with early phases of recovery,   given historical statistics So the Third District’s economy and outlook is largely in line with the   national economy  We are seeing signs that both investment and manufacturing may be   stabilizing and, I hope, improving   I believe that we will see a bit more strength in residential investment than is indicated in   the Greenbook projection, and I think inventory investment may become a source of short-term                    August 11–12, 2009 73 of 165  strength as firms rebuild inventory from what seem to be very low levels  Countering that   strength is weakness in nonresidential construction and consumption  Some of the weakness in   consumption may wane, though, with the rise in asset prices and abating declines in house prices    And the credit card data I referred to earlier may be an early precursor of that improvement  All   in all, I believe that the second half of this year looks a little better to me than it did at our last   meeting and perhaps a little better than indicated in the Greenbook; and I expect to see   approximately trend growth in 2010  That said, I am cognizant of the economy’s fragility    On the inflation front, my view of the underlying inflation pressures, unlike that of some   of my colleagues, is less rosy than that of the staff, although let me stress that my near-term   outlook for inflation is benign But the divergence of the way I think about the inflation process   and the underlying methodology for forecasting inflation in FRB/US leads me to see stronger   inflationary pressures over the next few years than does the Greenbook  It is interesting that   inflation expectations seem well anchored for now, and that’s good  At the same time, both   survey and financial market measures of inflation expectations are not particularly well aligned   with the current Greenbook inflation forecast   Indeed, one-year-ahead consumer survey measures of inflation expectations have been   unusually volatile over the past year, but they have been rising since the beginning of this year   and are now at about 3 percent, which is where they were in 2007  This is more than twice the   inflation forecast in the current Greenbook  Longer-term survey measures have moved very   little, and they, too, remain in the 3 percent range  Longer-term inflation compensation based on   TIPS, the staff’s over-five-year-forward rates, has actually increased this year  Now, I agree that   we need to be very careful in taking signals from the TIPS measures at this point  I think   expectations of increased liquidity in TIPS markets and other things can certainly affect that        August 11–12, 2009 74 of 165  market  But I don’t think we should completely ignore them  Thus, the public and the staff   seem somewhat at odds over the likely path of inflation over the next several years, and at this   point I am a little closer to the public’s view than to the Greenbook’s  I think this disparity is   reflected in the market’s expected funds rate path, which anticipates a funds rate of almost   3 percent by the end of 2011, compared with the Greenbook baseline scenario, where the rate   remains at zero   Now, given my outlook for inflation, my views on appropriate policy conflict with the   underlying policy assumptions in the Greenbook as well  Maintaining a funds rate so close to   zero for another two years would, I believe, reignite significant inflation  Moreover, given the   lags between policy actions and the surfacing of inflation, we will have to act well before   inflation pressures become evident  Otherwise, we will be too late, risking both inflation and our   credibility   I have several reasons for this less optimistic view on inflation  As I have discussed at   previous meetings, I put a good deal less weight on output gaps as predictors of inflation  As I   continue to analyze this concept in more detail—and I really appreciate Michael Kiley’s   excellent presentation at the last meeting—I remain convinced that the usefulness of output gaps   for policy depends very much on the nature of the shocks affecting the economy  In the standard   New Keynesian model with the traditional time-series measures of potential output—whether   trend or smoothed output measures—the output gap and inflation are negatively correlated with   markup in technology shocks  But a monetary policy shock or a demand shock generates   positive correlations between output gaps and inflation  Thus, in order for measures of output   gaps to give an accurate read on inflation, you need to condition on the underlying disturbances            August 11–12, 2009 75 of 165  This explains in part why the empirical relationship between output gaps and inflation are found   to be consistently fairly unstable   Without a clear explanation of or a buy-in as to what types of shock the forecasters   believe are hitting the economy, I grow increasingly reluctant to rely on inflation forecasts based   on output gaps Indeed, the Board staff has estimated sizable output gaps in Canada and Europe   over the past year, and yet we have seen very little decline in core inflation rates in these   countries I am happy that we are not seeing deflation, but I do think this should give us pause   and we should be very skeptical of the reliability of output gaps for forecasting inflation  As   always, I continue to study this issue and will continue to do so because I think the issue will   loom large for us in assessing the point in time at which we must reverse course  Thank you   very much, Mr Chairman   Thank you, Mr Chairman  Financial market conditions have indeed   improved, and there is increased evidence that the economy has bottomed out with all of the   mixed signals that turning points generally experience and, therefore, it is poised to grow   somewhat in the second half of the year  Based on these developments in the outlook, I see no   compelling reason to increase our purchases of long-term assets  Indeed, I would prefer that we     August 11–12, 2009 122 of 165  cut back the scale of our MBS purchases somewhat  Our current rate of purchase is outstripping   the issuance, and the Fed’s share of that market is significant  We are potentially crowding out   private investors and risk preventing the healing process from progressing and, in doing so,   perhaps permanently affecting the functioning of this important market    Thus, I am going to favor beginning to taper our rate of purchases of MBS immediately    Doing so would have two primary benefits  It would allow us to better gauge whether private   financial intermediation in MBS is improving and thus allow us to recalibrate our total asset   purchases based on those additional data If the experience is good, we may not choose to reach   the maximum we indicated—that is, the $125 billion  If we have concerns, we can always   extend the purchases into next year Given the increased stability in residential real estate   markets and the improvements in intermediation in some other MBS markets, my expectation is   that the MBS market will improve and that we will be able to pull back     I welcomed yesterday’s discussion of the tools we will use to tighten policy when the   time comes  Improving the efficiency of interest on excess reserves is an important avenue  But   given the size of our balance sheet, as I indicated yesterday, I wouldn’t want to rely entirely on   just this I think we need to discuss whether or not we are prepared to sell assets, even if it   means taking losses on our balance sheet, should the need arise  I for one would want to do so if   our price stability goals required it  Another element that would help our efforts in this regard to   maintain price stability is to continue to pursue our efforts to implement inflation targeting  I   appreciate the difficult political environment we are in, but I hope we don’t lose sight of that   initiative   As I have stated in the past, I think the language in our statement should be modified with   a view toward our eventual exit from the zero bound  That means trying to find a way to        August 11–12, 2009 123 of 165  extricate ourselves from the current exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for   extended periods At some point, we will have to move away from the “extended” language  I   believe we should be preparing ourselves and the markets for that eventuality  My preference   would be to say that the Committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at   zero to ¼ percent and anticipates that economic conditions will likely warrant low levels of the   funds rate for a period of time  Just drop “extended”   The options in alternatives A and C are, however, worse than the current language in my   view At least the use of “extended period” can be interpreted as a state-contingent or a state-  dependent context I think that replacing state-contingent language with time-dependent   language is misguided for a number of reasons, not the least of which is that we actually make   policy on a state-contingent basis Tying ourselves to a time table, given the tremendous   uncertainty surrounding the future economic conditions, I believe is not wise  In general, I   would prefer alternative C, without the time-dependent language because it scales back our asset   purchases   I would be comfortable, though, with alternative B or B (revised) if we indicate that we   will immediately begin to taper the pace of MBS purchases without necessarily committing to an   end amount or an end date  We have already said that we will go to $125 trillion, yet we may   not want to get there We don’t have to decide that yet  But reducing the pace immediately   would give us some flexibility to allow the private markets to gradually reenter this market and   would let us reemphasize that policy decisions are in fact state-dependent  We might want to   stop the agency debt purchases altogether, given the size of that market  But the amount is not   very significant, so I don’t feel terribly strongly about that  Thus my preference would be to   replace the sentence regarding MBS with something very simple like “the Desk is authorized to        August 11–12, 2009 124 of 165  purchase up to $200 billion in household-related agency debt and up to $125 trillion of agency   MBS The Desk is expected to gradually slow the pace of purchases of these securities as   markets improve”   Finally, Mr Chairman, I think we must be very careful in our interpretation of recent   declines in inflation A tremendous run-up in oil prices in 2007–08 had both a significant effect   on headline inflation and, to some degree, a pass-through into core inflation  We are fortunate   that expectations remained well anchored during that period, and we were helped when oil prices   made a sudden, dramatic reversal and declined  I think this oil price decline accounts for much   of what we have seen this year in the decline in inflation, though expectations have been   remarkably stable throughout this period, which is a very good sign  Apparently, the markets are   looking through the large relative price changes, both in the run-up as well as the come-back­  again So I think we must be careful not to attribute inflation to last year’s oil prices and then   attribute the reduction in inflation this year or the risk of persistent deflation to output gaps  That   is my view  Those are two sides of the same coin  We will learn more, I think, about underlying   inflation pressures, or lack thereof, in coming quarters as we have a more stable period of oil   prices, so that it is not jerking around both headline and core inflation  Thank you very much,   Mr Chairman  "
8835,2009-09-22,PLOSSER," Two-hander   I’d like to go back to this estimate of the effects of cutting back   purchases from $1¼ trillion to $1 trillion I’m looking at exhibit 4, chart 20  The effect on yields   is somewhere—let’s just take a modal number—between 50 and 75 basis points  I thought the   argument had been that it is the stock that matters, not flow so much  If we cut from $1¼ trillion   to $1 trillion, that’s one-fifth of the total stock  If you do a back-of-the-envelope calculation—            September 22–23, 2009 16 of 212  divide 75 basis points by five—that would suggest somewhere between 10 and 15 basis points,   not somewhere between 25 and 50 basis points  So I’m not quite sure I understand the argument   that by cutting the program by one-fifth we’re going to take away as much as half or three-  quarters of the basis point cut that the dealers seem to think there has been Could you clarify   that for me?   I have a couple of questions for Bill and one for Brian  One is just a factual   question In your first chart where you talked about the projected level of excess reserves, were you   including in that the increase in the roughly $200 billion from the end of the SFP program?   Is that the first peak?   Okay  I just wasn’t sure whether it was included  Second, I was thinking about   the story and the analysis that you’ve done  At the end, you say, well, okay, what if this analysis is   wrong?  What would the outcomes be?  My question is how we should think about metrics and variables   and things we should be looking at as we go forward during this period of very high reserves to get a   handle on which way this story is actually going, because I think there’s a lot of uncertainty about how   this might, in fact, play out  How would we structure our ongoing analysis of what’s going on out there,                           September 22–23, 2009 35 of 212  so that we would be alert to whether or not the kinds of things that might be the alternative play out?  Are   there metrics that we should be looking at?  Are there things that we want to monitor carefully to be able   to get a handle on that?   So is that like the decline in short-term Treasuries vis-à-vis the higher reserves   that we witnessed recently?   Would things like quantities of loans, quantities of various kinds, as opposed to   just prices, become important?   All right Thank you I have a question for Brian on the TAF  I’ll ’fess up—   I’m one of the ones who keeps asking about price as opposed to just quantities, and I’m a little bit   confused Brian, we don’t want penalty rates  The Committee made a conscious decision a while back,                     September 22–23, 2009 36 of 212  when we cut the spread between the primary rate and the funds rate, to reduce the penalty rate of being at   the discount window  We did that as a conscious decision  But for quite a while now, we have been in a   situation where people can almost confidently predict that they’re going to get a lower rate if they go to   the auction than if they choose to borrow from the discount window directly  There are borrowers who   come to our discount windows who are of a scale and size and scope where the TAF auction isn’t easily   available to them in the amounts that they would like to borrow  So, in fact, we’re taking one group of   borrowers who want to go to the discount window, and we’re making them borrow at a penalty rate    Right now we’re in an environment where—and, de facto, we’ve set this up—if you’re big enough and   want to participate in the TAF, you can get money at a cheaper rate   I remain a little bit puzzled about why we want to perpetuate that differential  They’re both   discount window lending  Why don’t we want to make borrowers from both of these mechanisms more   similar?  I understand that if you reduce the quantities enough at an auction, you can raise the price above   that minimum, but TAF borrowing is longer term and there are some other restrictions  So I still remain   somewhat puzzled at the reluctance to move the minimum bid closer to the primary credit rate, the rate at   which many banks still come and borrow from us  Maybe I’m being dense here, but the logic is escaping   me I haven’t figured it out yet  So could you help me out?   We have no idea what the quantities are going to be, because it’s underbid every   time So I don’t quite understand  If we’re not maxing out on the quantities, then we really aren’t setting   the quantities The market is setting the quantities, and it’s setting the quantities based on a low price that   we basically are offering  So I’m having trouble reconciling all of this   I’ve been called worse things   Yes I wanted to follow up on Governor Duke’s question  She asked about   lending standards and banks’ behavior  The way I interpreted what she was asking was about the supply   side or willingness of banks to lend But, as we witnessed in the last intermeeting period, a lot of the                           September 22–23, 2009 42 of 212  private-sector forecasts for growth have been ramped up substantially in the last few months, both for this   year and for next year in some cases, to varying degrees  So, in some ways, the issue is not just the   banks’ willingness to lend, but also what the new demand for loans is going to be  While banks may not   lower their lending standards, as the demand for loans from the private sector begins to ramp up with   continued economic growth, they may not change their lending standards, but those excess reserves will   get translated into loans as the demand for new loans goes up, and the price may rise as well  So it’s not   just what the banks are willing to do, but also how demand will evolve over the course of this recovery   that will determine some of that  You did mention that, but I think both of them are clearly important   Exactly   Using reserves to do so   Just to follow up with that, I appreciate that comment  I think what that   should suggest to us is that the staff could begin to pursue how to think about a more permanent,   longer-term life for the TAF  This is an issue that needs to be grappled with so that in the future   we don’t find ourselves having this same debate   I have a question Dave, both you and Nathan referred to financial   headwinds as one of the downsides or stresses to growth going forward  That phrase has come   up a lot over the last couple of years As financial markets have improved, I was wondering if I   could get a handle on the degree to which financial headwinds affect this forecast compared with   the degree that you marked down your earlier forecasts when you also saw headwinds  Has the   picture changed for you in some way?  I’m not saying that headwinds have necessarily gone   away, but have they changed given the evolution of the financial markets, and, if so, how?  And   how is that reflected in your forecast?  And, Nathan, for the international side, the same question   Since last spring, though   Well, how much of the improvement of your forecast, in some sense, is   reflected in the diminishing of the negative add-factors that you had been putting in before and   how much of it is really the model?  I think you probably gave me as close to an answer on that   as I’m going to get  [Laughter]   Okay Thank you Nathan?   Just one clarification Would you characterize the improvement in   financial conditions that we’ve seen outside the US as of roughly the same order of magnitude   that we witnessed in the US?   And would you say that there’s not a great differential between what’s   going on in the US and what’s going on in the countries that are the most important for our   growth?  In other words, would you say that they’ve improved by roughly the same order of   magnitude that we have?   Thank you very much   Thank you, Mr Chairman  Business conditions in the Third District   continue to indicate generally sluggish activity, and nonresidential investment remains soft    Nevertheless, a number of positive trends have begun to emerge  Our September Business   Outlook Survey index of general activity came in quite a bit stronger than it did in August  The                 September 22–23, 2009 75 of 212  gain was primarily driven by increases in shipments  It’s hard to parse out what part of this   increase in shipments was due to drawn down inventories and what part was new production    Most likely it was some of both  This rise in the index seems consistent with the general signals   of improvement in manufacturing coming from other regions of the country, even Richmond   Prices paid and received by manufacturers in our region seem to have firmed a bit, as   well The BOS current prices paid and current prices received indexes have all been positive for   the last two months  In fact, the index for prices expected to be paid six months from now will   increase to a number over 40, a very high number  Manufacturers thus seem to be more attuned   to the prospects of higher prices than falling prices  These data might mitigate some of our   concerns about the risk of deflation or deflationary expectations taking hold   As in the nation as a whole, employment has continue to fall in our three-state area,   though the pace of decline has lessened somewhat, as it has in the nation  The BOS future   employment index rose in September and has been positive for five consecutive months    Evidence is mounting that the employment level in the three-state area is at or near the bottom   Overall, conditions in the Third District look slightly better than they were six weeks ago,   and signs are pointing to a gradual strengthening of economic activity in the coming months  On   the national level, the data we have received since our last meeting are indicative of an economy   where recovery is gradually taking hold, and it now appears that the worst of this recession is   quite likely behind us We are, in my view, in the midst of that transition period from   contraction to expansion The level of employment is still depressed, but, given the trends in   job-loss and job-finding rates, it seems to me that we can begin to expect employment to increase   and growth to return in the near term  The signs of financial stress that also concerned us so   much this time last year have greatly abated, as we’ve discussed        September 22–23, 2009 76 of 212  While these indicators are not all back to their pre-crisis levels, they are about where I   would expect, given the current state of the economy and economic conditions more broadly    The bottom line is that current economic conditions are much better than they were, and they are   better than what we and many private-sector forecasters were expecting just a few months ago    They underpin a substantial upward revision in near-term GDP forecasts both from the   Greenbook and from many private-sector forecasters   However, I remain highly skeptical of the staff’s forecast regarding inflation, which, by   and large, has been unaffected by the upward revisions to growth in their forecast  In particular,   I continue to see stronger inflationary pressures over the next few years than is implicit in the   Greenbook forecast Many other forecasters also see more inflation than is in the Greenbook    For example, the Greenbook 2010 CPI forecast is below both the average and the median CPI   forecast among the fifty-two forecasters in the September Blue Chip consensus  I think we need   to consider seriously that there are upside risks to inflation, particularly to the staff’s forecast of   inflation, when we think about policy   Let me discuss why I have some concerns about the inflation outlook First, it’s quite   clear from the staff’s write-up that forecasted inflation paths depend importantly on inflation   expectations, as Dave Stockton mentioned  With those expectations well anchored, estimates of   economic slack going forward become virtually the sole determinant of the path of inflation in   the forecast  The forecast anchors those expectations at 2 percent, which is lower than the   readings of inflation expectations that we have been receiving  In particular, while they seem to   be anchored, longer-term expectations of inflation as measured by surveys are still in the 3   percent range My own view on longer-term inflation expectations is closer to the public’s, as   reflected in those various surveys, than the staff’s        September 22–23, 2009 77 of 212  The dependence of the staff’s inflation outlook on inflation expectations remaining   anchored over the forecast horizon brings to the fore my second concern with the Greenbook   outlook on inflation In my way of thinking, expectations of future inflation will ultimately   depend on the public’s expectation about the future path of monetary stimulus  In the Greenbook   forecast, the funds rate is held constant at least through the end of 2011 and probably into 2012,   while the public seems to believe we’ll be raising the funds rate by the middle of next year    Clearly, there is more monetary stimulus built into the Greenbook forecast than the public   currently expects If we were to endow the public with this knowledge, I seriously doubt that   inflation expectations will stay near 2 percent  Thus, the Greenbook assumption of longer-term   expectations being anchored at 2 percent over the forecast horizon seems to me at odds with this   divergence between the market’s expectation of policy and the proposed policy path in the   Greenbook Inflation expectations could rise in this context and could easily overwhelm the   effects of economic slack that the Greenbook relies so heavily upon for its forecast   My third concern is the fact that the model underlying the Greenbook forecast does not   appear to depend explicitly on forecasts of liquidity or other quantities in the banking system,   such as forecasts of excess reserves, required reserves, or loans And despite the results of the   consultation with banks that we heard about earlier regarding the high reserve balances and the   simulation exercise, it seems only a matter of time before those huge reserves in our banking   system begin to flow out into the economy, particularly with growth rates at the level that they   are And that time may come sooner than many people think, given the upward revisions in our   forecast Needless to say, this outflow will not have an immediate effect on current inflation, but   expectations of inflation may become more sensitive to such a rapid increase in liquidity    Nevertheless, the outflow will undoubtedly create the preconditions for an eventual rise in               September 22–23, 2009 78 of 212  inflation expectations and inflation  We need to be prepared to soak up those excess reserves, as   we’ve been discussing   Of course, knowing when to raise rates and when to reverse course is always a challenge,   but it will be more difficult in this complex environment, as we are near the zero bound  That   brings me to my fourth concern  While I believe that we have a range of tools to control excess   reserves and reserves in general, including interest rates on reserves, asset sales, and some of the   other techniques we talked about this afternoon, I think we still have some work to do to figure   out what the right metrics are that we need to be looking at that will signal to us when the time is   right For instance, as I noted in my question to Bill English, I find it curious that Treasury   yields fell over this intermeeting period, given the better-than-expected economic data  A staff   memo on high reserve balances noted that at least one respondent adjusted their reserve balances   downward, and another was getting ready to make adjustments  Could these yields be a result of   downward pressure from cash equivalents to induce reserve demand to equal reserve supply?   Yields abroad fell, too, but foreign central banks are also providing high levels of liquidity    What implications does this have for the increase in reserves that will follow on the heels of our   increased MBS purchases? What implications does it have for inflation expectations?  Is a small   rise in the inflation compensation in five-year forwards over the past few weeks a precursor to   that in the near future?   My final concern has to do with the reduction in the Treasury’s SFP balances and how   this Committee plans to address that  The staff estimates that the reduction in the SFP program   will add about $200 billion in excess reserves to our balance sheet  If we choose not to sterilize   this expansion in reserves, I think this additional source of stimulus will add upside risks to   inflation Even if one believes that the reduction in the SFP program is temporary, as the balance        September 22–23, 2009 79 of 212  sheet projections assume, there doesn’t seem to be any reason for us not to sterilize this increase   by reducing our own LSAP program When and if the SFP rises again—and I’m not sure we   want to encourage it to rise again, for that matter, from an independence point of view—we can   alter our approaches if we deem it appropriate  The amount of stimulus we apply to the economy   should remain the decision of this Committee and not be passive or be choices made at the   Treasury   The bottom line for me is this  Given the amount of stimulus that’s in the forecast, given   the size of the balance sheet and excess reserves, given the uncertainty regarding our ability to   know when to act, I largely see only upside risks to inflation relative to the latest Greenbook   forecast Based on these concerns about the forecasted paths of inflation, my views on   appropriate policy are fundamentally different from those underlying the policy assumptions in   the Greenbook Maintaining a funds rate so close to zero for so many years, in my view, can   only reignite significant inflation Moreover, given the lags between policy actions and the   surfacing of inflation, we will have to act well before inflation pressures become evident    Otherwise we will be too late, risking both inflation and our credibility  I believe we could have   helped our own cause by adopting an explicit inflation target, but I fear we have missed the   opportunity to advance that initiative when deflation fears were more widespread among the   public and Congress  Thank you, Mr Chairman   Thank you, Mr Chairman  My preferred statement for this meeting is a   slight variant of alternative C for basically most of the reasons that Brian Madigan alluded to  I   think that the Committee is not yet ready to begin exiting from the “extended period” language   of the statement  I happen to think it is time to do that, and I’m hoping that the Committee will   get to that point relatively soon  So, given my understanding of the Committee’s preferences, I’d   like to address instead the language in alternative B  I think it’s important to try to explain to the   Committee my concerns and why   I think that this debate about slack is at the core of thinking about policy, and that means   the Phillips curve is at the core of how we think about monetary policy  In my view, it is true   that the data and most of the empirical research suggest that the relationship between inflation   and the output gap, at least the simple bivariate relationship, is not terribly stable—it tends to            September 22–23, 2009 140 of 212  vary over time  And it tends to vary over time in part because, as President Lacker said, the   Phillips curve is usually estimated as a reduced-form statistical relationship  It is not necessarily   a structural one One of the things that I think we know about the Phillips curve relationship, as   it is usually thought of, is that a necessary, although not sufficient, condition for this relationship   is stable expectations of inflation  In order for us to have any predictable relationship between   the output gap and inflation, we need stable inflation expectations  And one of the things that is   important for the stability of inflation expectations is that the public forms expectations about   inflation, and the actions and language of monetary policymakers can shape those expectations   Therefore, my concerns are about the language we use to explain our current policy   actions and how it may shape expectations going forward  And I think we have to be careful   about that language, so that it reflects the importance of expectations, and so that it reflects the   fact that expectations don’t move independently of either our words or our actions  We know   that expectations matter from past episodes  Marvin Goodfriend identifies inflations scares in   1983 and 1987 They tended to occur when the Fed has tried to exploit the Phillips curve by   delaying in raising rates (or in cutting rates after the economy has weakened)  The response to   both of these inflation scares was that inflation expectations were cut off by the Fed’s reacting   and raising rates to fight the inflation scare, thereby preserving its credibility to maintain price   stability   I think one of the questions that the Committee has to ask itself and be prepared to act on   is How would it react if there were an episode where inflation expectations do begin to rise, or   inflation begins to rise because of fears of the size of the Fed’s balance sheet, because of fears of   monetizing the debt, or whatever? And if that happens when slack is high and large, as it is now,   how will the Committee respond?     September 22–23, 2009 141 of 212  I think that putting expectations of inflation in paragraph 2 of the statement was a very   important step forward, although from a language standpoint I think it should be stronger than it   is I think the statement ought to read, “With longer-term inflation expectations stable,   substantial resource slack is likely to dampen cost pressures and keep inflation low”  I want it to   be a conditioning statement, not a passive statement, as if expectations were kind of an   afterthought  If we can reverse those clauses, it would be a more accurate statement about, I   think, what we actually know about the Phillips curve   I also think that the language in the statement has to be consistent with giving us the   option to raise rates at some time in the future, when slack, however you choose to measure it—   whether it be unemployment or output—is high  What I fear about this language, and our   persistent use of resource slack in the statement, is that we’re creating the impression that we   will not act in response to inflationary concerns  I think we need to be more balanced and   nuanced about the nature of the language we are using to ensure that we will act, if required, to   preserve both aspects of our dual mandate  I also worry that, without both the conditioning   aspects of inflationary expectations and more about preserving price stability, we’re potentially   creating a problem where the public will come to perceive that we will not act until resource   utilization is high or higher at some point   The measures of resource utilization, I think, are problematic  I think we have a very   difficult time measuring resource utilization, and I think we have a difficult time measuring   inflation expectations But I don’t think that absolves us of the responsibility of having to deal   with both of them  Choices among measures of resources utilization depend a lot not only on   statistics and on measurement problems, but also on what kind of model one has and different   models yield different measures  At the Philadelphia Fed, we have a DSGE model, sort of a                September 22–23, 2009 142 of 212  workhorse neo-Keynesian macro model  There, our resource slack measures are about minus   3 percent, as opposed to minus 6 or 7 percent as in the Greenbook  Well, what does that say?   They both contain measurement error, clearly, yet where do you start?   The question is not what we do today, but what we do down the road when we reach the   point where we are going to have to make a decision  And I’m terribly worried that we might get   ourselves into a position where we cannot make that decision  As the resource gap narrows,   obviously, we’ll get closer and closer to facing a very difficult choice   So I think this is really about language  It’s about shaping the state-contingent nature of   our policy actions, and those policy actions depend not just on resource slack, but also on the   path of inflation and inflation expectations  I think we need to make that clearer, and I think the   language in alternative B is unnecessarily distorted towards saying that we don’t care about   inflation—that policy is going to be flat for as far as the eye can see  And I think that’s   potentially misleading  It is also problematic, because it sends a signal about how policy will   react I think we have to be very worried about that, and I’m very sensitive about that, which is   why my focus and my comments yesterday were a lot about expectations—not that they’re easy   to measure, but that they matter a lot in this context  And I think we have to preserve our   flexibility   I’d like to make three points about the language in alternative B  First, in paragraph 1,   we added new language about a gradual return to higher levels of resource utilization  I’m not   exactly sure where that language came from  It’s new language  I don’t know why we want to   bring it back in I’d prefer just to see us say, “Strengthening of economic growth,” and eliminate   the phrase “and gradual return to higher resource utilization” and “in the context of price   stability” I have real problems with “in the context of price stability”  I don’t know what that        September 22–23, 2009 143 of 212  means  It seems to convey that somehow we’re not responsible for that context or that we don’t   have to be accountable for it—it’s sort of an environmental factor that we react to  I think higher   inflation and higher inflation expectations should not be treated as an environmental factor    They should be something we take responsibility for  Second, in paragraph 2, I have already   suggested that I would prefer to see “with longer-term expectations stable” as the opening clause,   as a conditioning clause, that says that is what permits slack to keep inflation contained  And,   third, as to the “up to” phrases, I think it is terribly important that we keep “up to”  Even if we’re   not ready to cut, I think, given the nature of the recovery, if we stretch this out too far, we may   find ourselves in this conundrum of buying MBS and maybe trying to raise rates at the same   time, in which case undoubtedly we would stop buying MBS  So I think we need that “up to”   language   I think this debate is really about forming the language and the expectations of the path of   monetary policy, not about what inflation is doing today, or maybe even what it is going to be   doing next quarter or the quarter after that  I have no fears of inflation in the near term, but it’s   about shaping the longer term, about keeping our options open, so that we have the ability to act   and do act when the time comes  Thank you, Mr Chairman   Mr Chairman, before you do your summary, I’d like to put something   back on the table that really hasn’t been addressed as much as I think it needs to be  I raised it   yesterday, and President Lacker raised it today, and that’s this issue of the SFP program and the   importance it plays; in fact, it will be adding more stimulus to our balance sheet and more   reserves to the economy  The Treasury has the authority to make this decision at the end of the   day, and if this Committee is consciously choosing not to sterilize that and, therefore, increase   stimulus, then we need to acknowledge that we are choosing to do that rather than accepting it   passively It’s not clear whether the discussion about the increase in stimulus around this table   and the options for providing it have been under the premise that the SFP is going to be there    As you suggested yesterday, when you alluded to this and talked about it briefly, it is important   that this Committee make an active decision to accept that additional stimulus, if that’s what the   Committee so chooses, or to reject it and sterilize it  But I would not like that to be just sort of   skipped over and accepted without a conscious discussion about how we think that fits into our   broader strategy That’s my issue, Mr Chairman           September 22–23, 2009 175 of 212  That’s okay, but there are two elements to this   One is the “up to” and the other is how long we extend it for  So I’m   trying to figure out whether we want to treat those separately   For some of us that might be dependent           September 22–23, 2009 178 of 212  Excuse me   I’m just trying to make sure I understand  Does that mean that your   view would be that, in the absence of the return of the SFP program, we would actually use these   tools to offset, in effect, that increase in stimulus or increase in reserves that’s happening?  Is that   what I’m hearing you say, or is it something different?   I guess I’m being difficult, but I’m worried about the perception of the   marketplace, namely, that we are passively accepting an increase of $185 billion of reserves   without an active decision by this Committee to do so  If we do anticipate that SFP comes back,   in some ways that eases our exit strategies, and I understand why that may, in fact, be desirable            September 22–23, 2009 181 of 212  But given the political interaction between debt ceilings and other things, do we want it to go   away or do we want it to come back?  Those are knotty, little questions about how then we   manage these extra reserves in terms of this Committee’s view of policy going forward   Or we could say “broad range,” which is in between—   I would just comment that we do have this phrase that household   spending will be “constrained by ongoing job losses, sluggish income growth, lower housing   wealth, and tight credit” So we have some caveats in there about weaknesses that are inherent   in the economy already in this paragraph   No, for my purposes, I was trying to get some more conditionality into   it   The degree to which slack will damp pressures is conditional on these   anchored expectations, and that’s the message I was trying to instill by reversing the order   I acknowledged that was a step forward  I thought that was great  "
8863,2009-11-03,PLOSSER," Actually, Ben, this is for you   I thought we have all Red Sox fans and all Mets fans with us    [Laughter]   I just had a follow-up to the answer that Nathan gave on the intraday   volatility that you referred to in terms of reserves  To what degree was that also the creation of   our own operating procedures—that we were going into the market only once a day and we were   reluctant to be players on a continuous basis?  Could we have solved some of that problem by   our own operating procedures and being in the market more continuously?   Is that because we were targeting quantities rather than prices?  Once   again, could we have been closer had we been more frequent?    I was just reacting to your saying that was one of the major reasons we   want to have this  In some ways, we could have done some things on our own to help mitigate   some of that, I guess   I guess I will start with swaps because that seems to be popular  I share   a lot of the concerns, actually, that Governor Kohn had  Don, I thought I understood you to say   that your inclination, which I would agree with, is that it is fine to keep these things on the shelf,   but you don’t necessarily want to delegate it to the Foreign Currency Subcommittee to make the   decisions each time that it really ought to come back     For the first draw I found the argument in the memo a little strange   about the transparency issue—that we wouldn’t want to have it appear in the minutes that this   was voted on And I find that sort of anti-transparency, which I wasn’t sure I found very   compelling   The other thing I think about the swaps is that, as President Lacker was asking, many of   these banks do have lots of dollars at their disposal  Okay?  Given that, I would think one proper   way to think about this may be that we would like them to use their own dollars as their first line   of defense, rather than coming to us  I don’t know whether that really makes sense, whether we   could price this in a way that would make that a sensible strategy, or whether it is even a   desirable strategy in some sense, because if these things were operational on a continuous basis,   would this be a kind of “no questions asked” way for them to request dollars?  Or is it only   reserved for crises?  So I’d like to put their dollars on the line first, and I’m not exactly sure how   we would do that I don’t mind having these things on the shelf and ready to go and   operationalized I am a little concerned about the usage and whose dollars come first  And I   think putting the RCAs on hold is fine                    November 3–4, 2009 44 of 201  The other aspect is something that President Lacker returned to, which is the term   deposits and the RPs I kind of share his view in that I am not sure we have the tools in the right   order, at least as suggested by some of the staff discussion  But one question I had about the   term deposits was, if the term deposits are eligible for collateral at the discount window, a bank   could have a term deposit and turn around and post it as collateral at the discount window and   borrow, taking out short-term reserves again  It seems as though they would undo the term   deposit by doing that So what is the point of having the term deposit if they can turn around and   undo it this way?   So that interacts with how much that discount rate varies  But they   would be willing to pay something to get that reversed  It almost makes these things tradable at   a fixed price for short-term reserves Right?  And so how do we control, or would we control,   that in terms of this conversion?  It seems as though we are defeating part of the purpose by   doing that   Well, suppose they did it today, posted the collateral at the discount   window, and went to the TAF auction and borrowed 28-day money for reserves in the TAF   auction at the minimum bid         November 3–4, 2009 45 of 201  Well, they are borrowing at less than the primary credit rate, right?   That is what they would be doing today   Well, but at the end of the day, that kind of undoes the purpose of the   term deposits to begin with  Right? I guess here is my point  I think this is maybe part of what   President Lacker may be getting at—a lot of these tools interact with each other in how you   would design them and how you structure them  So rather than doing them on a one-off basis,   we need to think of them in the context of how we are going to manage the discount window   going forward Are we going to have term primary credit?  Are we going to go back to overnight   money? I think these things are interrelated  And to get a sense of how they will play out, we   need to think of them collectively in how they interact with one another, rather than on a one-off   basis I guess that is really what I am thinking about   I am just saying that is fine, but then that undoes the purpose that we   have for the term deposit, which is to reduce reserves or hit our target   Yes, I had a quick comment  Janet, I think we’re talking about two   different things  My support for the swaps early in the crisis is exactly the point you were making   of the difference between inside and outside money, and I understand that  I was more concerned   about having these lines of swaps continuously open in normal times whether we really wanted   them used or whether, as Vice Chairman Dudley suggests, we price them in a way that prevents   their usage except when a crisis might occur I think that was where I was going   Thank you, Mr Chairman  I guess I’m up second  So I don’t know what   that means I’m supposed to do as a baseball player  Get on base, right?   Advance the ball?  [Laughter]   PARTICIPANT  Sacrifice   Hit to the right side behind the runner, right?  That should be easy    [Laughter] Thank you, Mr Chairman  Business conditions in the Third District remained sluggish   in September and October  While regional business contacts continue to anticipate a recovery in the   months ahead, expectations of the recovery’s strength seem to have moderated somewhat, and   uncertainty abounds  So let me touch on a few highlights   Our manufacturing survey’s general business activity index fell from 141 to 115 in   October However, I am not too concerned about this slight drop  The index has been positive now   for three consecutive months  The last time that occurred was in November 2007  The index of   future activity remains high, although it was down a few points from September  It is well within                               November 3–4, 2009 67 of 201  recovery ranges from past experience  Payroll employment continues to decline in the region and at   a slightly faster pace than reported six weeks ago, but the rate of decline still is less negative than   that of the nation as a whole  The average unemployment rate in the three states in the District rose   02 percentage point, to 92 percent, but still remains below the national figure  The District’s   commercial real estate market continues to be weak, as it seems to be everywhere  Our contacts tell   us that they are not expecting any improvement there until 2011   At the national level, recent data on the economy continue to point to an emergent recovery    Financial market conditions continue to improve, but the labor market remains under severe stress,   and I anticipate further modest increases in the unemployment rate  Nevertheless, the pace and   character of real activity appears to be consistent with employment growth turning positive in the   not-too-distant future  I have become more confident rather than less that the emerging recovery   will be a sustainable one even after the effects of fiscal and monetary stimulus begin to wane   On balance, the recent data on third-quarter growth came in somewhat stronger than I   expected in our last forecast submission  This has led me to revise up slightly my own projection   for growth in 2009, compared with that in June  But the basic structure and shape of my forecast for   2010 and beyond remains largely unchanged from my June forecast  I anticipate that the recovery   will gain more solid footing as we move into 2010 and real growth will average about 3 percent in   2010 through 2012 This is somewhat weaker growth in output than in the Greenbook  I suspect   the differences between our forecasts reflect different assumptions about the magnitude of the   impact of the fiscal stimulus and the evolution of natural or potential output  Indeed, if there is a   risk to my GDP forecast, it is likely to be to the upside—that is, economic growth could easily turn   out to be faster than the 3 percent average that I am predicting                               November 3–4, 2009 68 of 201  My forecast for inflation continues to differ from the Greenbook’s  In the near term, I   expect inflation to remain rather benign, but I expect it to drift up over the next couple of years  In   contrast, the Greenbook anticipates disinflationary pressures over the forecast period based on low   levels of resource utilization and large output gaps  I believe that we will ultimately maintain a   moderate rate of inflation, but to do so will require a significantly higher path for the fed funds rate   than is in the Greenbook   My view of optimal policy, therefore, assumes that the fed funds rate will reach 2½ percent   by the end of 2010, still very low by historical standards  Associated with an increase in the funds   rate, I assume that we will begin reducing the level of excess reserves in the banking system through   our various tools that we’ve been discussing   My inflation forecast is shaped by my views about the fundamental drivers of inflation   dynamics  I concur with the broad thrust of President Bullard’s memorandum on output gaps  I   have been arguing for some time now that I am skeptical that low resource utilization and large   negative gaps as typically measured are generically useful concepts for thinking about the structural   determinants of inflation dynamics  Aside from the difficulties of measurement surrounding gaps,   the current state-of-the-art empirical models of inflation dynamics, such as the New Keynesian   DSGE models, do not give clear guidance on the appropriate role of traditional output and   employment gaps  That is not to say that we cannot build models where such gaps might matter    We clearly can  But it means that the nature of our debate is about the models and, just as   important, about the nature of the shocks we are facing   We should remember that these newer models were developed, in part, as an outgrowth of   the failure of earlier models to capture the instability in the inflation–output dynamics  Like   President Bullard’s, my reading of the empirical evidence—for example, Stock and Watson’s recent                          November 3–4, 2009 69 of 201  work on Phillips curve forecasts—is that gap or activity measures are not reliable predictors of   inflation for the post-1970s US economy  Indeed, recent work by the Philadelphia staff looked at   Phillips curve forecasts of inflation over the last six recessions  Outside the double-dip recession of   1980 and 1981, gap-augmented inflation prediction equations would not have led to significantly   better forecasts than benchmark autoregressive models  Notably, this was also true in the 1974–75   recession, in which a fairly large unemployment gap opened up, and it is also true for the current   recession   I am more persuaded by the theoretical and empirical evidence that indicates that inflation   outcomes depend importantly on inflation expectations, which in turn depend significantly on our   own credibility and commitment to price stability  Philadelphia has its own New Keynesian DSGE   forecasting model in which inflation dynamics are governed primarily by expected inflation and   marginal costs, as these models tend to imply, and it suggests much greater inflationary pressures   than in the Greenbook, especially when one conditions on the Greenbook funds rate path  In that   conditional forecast, inflation runs at about 5 percent by 2012  The unconditional forecast from the   model calls for a funds rate path that looks more like that embodied in the current futures market,   but even in that forecast, inflation rates drift up noticeably over the forecast period  Admittedly,   different specifications of such models will likely lead to different inflation forecasts, but a key   element of all these equilibrium models is the interplay between monetary policy actions,   expectations, and economic outcomes  They suggest that, if we respond in an appropriate and   predictable manner to the shocks in the economy, inflation expectations will remain anchored, and   inflation will remain stable   Fortunately, measures of medium-term and longer-term expectations of inflation have   largely remained stable  However, inflation uncertainty seems to be rising  The Philadelphia staff                    November 3–4, 2009 70 of 201  examined the cross-sectional dispersion of inflation forecasts from our SPF respondents since the   1980s  To the extent that the forecast dispersion is lower when monetary policy is more credible,   we can take comfort in the fact that the forecast dispersion today is quite a bit lower than it was   during the 1980s  However, dispersion measures such as the standard deviation or interquartile   range have been trending up since 2005 and have risen noticeably since 2007  This trend, I think,   bears watching as it may be an early signal that the stability of inflation expectations may become   fragile   The concern that I’ve been expressing for the last several meetings is that we are creating a   narrative that overemphasizes resource utilization as a determinant of monetary policy  A key   question we will face in the months ahead is when to begin the policy-tightening cycle  The   extraordinary monetary and fiscal policy actions taken to date raise the possibility that policy may   have to be recalibrated at a time when potentially mismeasured gaps suggest that a combination of   actions should remain in place  The message we continue to drive home in our statement that   stresses gaps and slack make this transition or recalibration more difficult and/or more disruptive   than necessary, or it may even lead us to inappropriately delay action   More generally, I believe that the timing of our recalibration will mean that we will need to   pay attention to more than just gaps and measures of expected inflation  Given the extraordinary   nature of our actions and the consequences for our balance sheet and the fact that we are de facto   with a zero lower bound, we will need to focus on various quantities, such as the mix of required   reserves to excess reserves, new loan creation, and general portfolio positions of banks as they seek   higher returns for the massive reserves that we have forced them to absorb  As banks begin to seek   higher returns, excess reserves will be transformed into required reserves as the traditional money-  multiplier mechanism begins to recover  We may not be exactly sure where these funds are going                             November 3–4, 2009 71 of 201  They may be used to purchase short-term Treasuries, guaranteed government debt such as MBS, or   some other duration-lengthening asset, or they may go into loans as risk appetites grow  As a   consequence, we may find it hard to identify the early stages of such transition by monitoring only   prices, but it will be occurring nonetheless  Thus, I believe that quantity measures should become   an important and routine part of our policy discussions going forward and as we contemplate the   timing of our exit strategy Thank you, Mr Chairman   That’s like Philadelphia sports fans [Laughter]   Mr Chairman, on your discussion about credit and banks and the amount   of loans outstanding—my understanding is that if we look at, say, C&I loan outstanding credit,   there are two components to that  One is new loans being made, and there are also the write-downs   of existing loans that reduce what appears to be the outstanding value  So one of the things that I   think would be interesting in looking at that is distinguishing between those two things—where the   volume of new loans is, how much of it is new loan creation, and how much of it is just write-  downs of existing loans; and that might tell us some interesting things about what’s happening   Just in thinking about this transition, one of the things that would be   interesting to know is—and, Mr Chairman, you talked a bit about this yesterday—where do you   want to get to at the end of the day in terms of how we are going to conduct policy?  Are we   going to envision ourselves in a corridor system of some kind or a floor system?  How are we   going to treat the federal funds market?  Getting more specific about where that endpoint is,   where we think we want to get to as we come to more normal policy, would be helpful to us, and   then working backwards to figure out the transition we want to get there  I think this is a really   good exercise for us to be doing, and so I would encourage you to keep pursuing that, and   thinking about that endpoint would be a useful addition to thinking about that   All right Thank you, Mr Chairman  While the timing of our exit from   this period of extraordinary monetary policy accommodation remains highly uncertain, I do think   it is important for the Committee to begin to consider language that begins to prepare the markets   for that eventuality Never being shy about being a maverick, I think that we should begin that   process sooner rather than later Thus, I have a general preference for the language in alternative   C, although even in C I would not choose at this point to cut MBS purchases from $125 trillion   to $11 trillion Just at our last meeting we took out “up to” and, therefore, committed to   $125 trillion I don’t think cutting it would be a good idea  It would confuse the market at this   point However, for some strange reason, I get the impression that the Committee is not yet   ready to adopt alternative C [Laughter] Maybe one of the more understated statements I have   made, but I certainly get that impression          November 3–4, 2009 135 of 201  But I do think there are some elements of C that could be useful incorporating into   alternative B to help prepare markets for a shift in policy stance at some point  So I would like   to suggest a couple of those in particular  I think the emphasis in paragraph 2 of C on stable   inflation expectations—and, particularly I like the language on policy adjustments that will keep   inflation “at levels consistent with price stability”—is good language  From my perspective, this   indicates a more proactive approach to price stability, which I think is appropriate  Thus, I   would prefer to substitute paragraph 2 of C for paragraph 2 of B  Now, an intermediate step for   that might be to leave paragraph 2 in B as is and substitute “inflation will remain subdued in the   near term” for “inflation will remain subdued for some time”  Then include a sentence in B   adopting from C “with appropriate policy adjustments” the Committee expects inflation to   “remain at levels consistent with price stability,” reinforcing our efforts to say that we will   clearly deliver on this   The other modification I would make to alternative B is in the forward guidance for the   funds rate in paragraph 3 Obviously, I would have preferred that we move away from “an   extended period” and substitute “some time”  I think this is a signal that the policy environment   is in fact changing We have kept rates near zero now for almost a year, and the “extended   period” language has been in place since March I think we are closer in time, whenever that   time may be, to raising rates today than we were in March, and now might be a useful time to   indicate as much   In fact, even if we were to raise rates to 50 basis points or to 75 basis points, they would   still be extraordinarily low by any historical standard  Indeed, there may be some real advantage   to moving policy modestly away from the zero bound to allow these short-term financial markets   and money markets to begin operating more normally in a more normal environment  I would        November 3–4, 2009 136 of 201  suggest that we need to consider the fact that our extensive intervention in some of these markets   may be an inhibitor to the financial and economic recovery that we all desire  In any event,   changing the language in this manner is not inconsistent with other actions we have taken to   gradually unwind our extraordinary actions For example, we have ended the Treasury purchase   program  We are limiting TAF auctions  We are prepared to cap purchases at less than the full   amount of agency debt in the statement  And we have suggested the termination of some other   liquidity programs  The markets now know that we will gradually remove accommodation, so I   don’t see that a shift in terms of this language would be either dramatic or disruptive  Yes,   probably the timing of the language change may come as a surprise, and there may be some   immediate market reaction  I don’t think this should deter us, since I also think there are costs to   waiting too long to at least signal that we are contemplating a more direct exit     With respect to the new language in alternative B, paragraph 3, I prefer the revision to   what was in the Bluebook, although I am a little uncomfortable with some of the ambiguity  By   being explicit about resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation   expectations as among the joint determinants of monetary policy—which I think is what the   language is trying to do—we seem to be preparing the markets for the possibility that monetary   policy would react to unwelcome inflationary developments, even if resource utilization is lower   than we would like I think that is a good thing  We ought to be doing that, and I am supportive   of being more explicit about the nature of our reaction function and the factors that matter  I   think that is important for transparency and communication   On the other hand, of course, my view about yet another repetition of resource utilization   language is that this reinforces my concern about our narrative that I talked about yesterday—   that our narrative about resource utilization is something I am uncomfortable with and it may           November 3–4, 2009 137 of 201  unduly tie our hands if we are not careful Nevertheless, even with that I am in favor of the   language change But I do not want, and I don’t think we should prefer, to take steps that   explicitly or implicitly are designed to lower the expected future funds rate path  In fact, I think   it would serve us well if the statement raised the path somewhat   I agree with President Bullard that this Committee has historically not begun a tightening   cycle until often two years or more after the trough  However, while that may be true about our   behavior, I don’t infer from that that such behavior is in any way optimal or desirable, and so I   wouldn’t want to take that forecast as meaning that we shouldn’t do anything for the next two   years; that shouldn’t govern our response   One part of the language that I am a little uncomfortable about is that I find the use of the   phrase “subdued inflation trends” somewhat ambiguous and, thus, kind of lacking content and   transparency How is the market supposed to know what we think the inflation trend is if we   can’t define it for ourselves?  If what we mean is core inflation, then we ought to say so  What   we seem to want to be signaling, as Brian indicated, is that we may not be worried or we won’t   worry about reacting to rising commodity prices and oil prices  At the same time, if we don’t   want to react to those—I don’t recall us going to such pains to make such a distinction when oil   prices plummeted from $150 a barrel to $70 a barrel last fall and winter and then we reacted to   that with fears of deflation So I think a model of the deflation that we have witnessed over the   past year, particularly in headline and to some degree in core, is partly a pass-through reflection   of oil prices falling, just as we get some upside when oil prices rose  We weren’t very explicit   about the nature of relative price movements during that period, and so we seem to be   asymmetric in our reaction function, and I don’t think we should be               November 3–4, 2009 138 of 201  Once again, I think we find ourselves in somewhat of a language box, which could be   greatly mitigated by having an explicit, well-articulated inflation target  What we really should   worry about is the impact of these relative price shifts on expectations of inflation, and having an   inflation target specified over a reasonable period would allow us to focus on headline inflation   and give us much less angst in wordsmithing challenges and explaining what we mean   I will simply note that I am also comfortable with reducing the volume to $175 billion of   the agency debt The Desk has warned us a couple of times about fears and concerns they may   have about our dominating that market and the functioning of that agency debt market  So I   think it is appropriate that we try to exit ourselves from that as soon as possible   Finally, I would like to commend the staff for including the section on a possible   sequence of language and actions in the most recent Bluebook  I think this is a great step in the   right direction  It is important that we begin thinking ahead about how we will exit and the   language that would help us do that  As I mentioned before, it would be nice if we could define   for ourselves what the new operating regime will be in normal times, and then work backwards   in our language so that we get to the place where we want to be  But I found this a step in the   right direction  This is a useful exercise, and I hope we will continue it     I have a couple of comments One, in paragraph 4 of table 2 in the Bluebook—“policy   firming is likely soon,” I guess is the title—I think this may be too small a step  Actually, I think   the first step we might consider taking at some time might be a step to eliminate the range from   0 to ¼ percent for our fed funds rate, that maybe we just ought to set it at ¼ percent as a first   step I think we can do this It wouldn’t be effectively raising effective rates very much  It   would send an important signal, and it would give us some experience in operating under a true   interest-on- reserves regime in figuring out how close we could come to actually hitting our        November 3–4, 2009 139 of 201  target with IOR So I think that maybe could be a useful first step at some point in the not-too­  distant future And then, depending on how that works, we can go from there as we move   forward The other thing is that I do not favor establishing calendar dates to describe our policy   path Policy is state-contingent, where states are economic conditions, not necessarily date-  dependent And I think we need to avoid that if we can  We must continue to stress that   distinction, and work better and harder to articulate the nature of the relevant states that we will   react to, which is why I favor the new language in alternative B   Another possibility that does not seem included in table 2, but is discussed in the   Bluebook and I think deserves more discussion, is the option for us to begin soaking up some of   the excess reserves from the banking system before we make an explicit decision to raise rates    A modest program of selling assets earlier rather than later might support the effectiveness of   interest-on-reserves mechanisms and our ability to hit the target  It would also lead to a smaller   monetary base on which to implement some of our reserve-management tools and maybe even   negate the need for them as we go forward Thus I would urge us to develop this option more   fully and think along the lines of eliminating the range for the federal funds rate     As a footnote, I would remind the Committee that last time we had a discussion about the   supplementary financing program with the Treasury  Over the last two months, if I read the   numbers correctly, something like $150 billion has been added to excess reserves simply because   of the Treasury’s termination of that program  I think we need to be explicit about what we are   doing with that program and how it is affecting excess reserves  The policy discussion seems to   indicate there is some assumption that it is going to come back to $200 billion next year  I don’t   know whether it will or not  It certainly might  But if it doesn’t come back, the Treasury is   conducting quantitative easing on behalf of us  And I think we need to explicitly address that           November 3–4, 2009 140 of 201  concern and make some explicit choices about whether we want that sterilized or not, and I think   that is going to be an important step going forward   Finally, the last topic—paragraph 5 of table 2 in the Bluebook, I think—is on the   discount rate decision, and we talked a little about this last time  We are going to need to address   the issue of the appropriate spread between primary credit rates and the fed funds rate or the term   deposit rate Do we want the penalty rate to come back?  If so, by how much and when?  And   how does that interact with our decisions on raising rates?  If—and this is a big if—we have   effectively driven stigma from the system in part through the crisis and by the TAF, I don’t think   we want to have stigma return if we can help it because we would like the discount window to   operate more effectively  So that may affect how we think about the penalty rate  It would   certainly affect how our credit officers in our individual banks react when they pick up the phone   to call a bank and say, “You have been at the discount window for a week now  What is going   on?”  That is something that many of our credit officers do  It is prudence, but it contributes to   solidifying the stigma process, which I think we would like to get rid of  In any event, I would   encourage the staff to continue working on these important aspects of our transition and the   future of the discount window I appreciate their efforts  Thank you very much   I just keep making my plugs  That’s all [Laughter]        November 3–4, 2009 141 of 201   New York?     I like “low rates of”   Better than “resource slack”   But they speculate that on what we mean anyway                 November 3–4, 2009 175 of 201 "
8890,2009-12-15,PLOSSER," Mr Chairman   I think it is important to do that in January  But I would just like to   emphasize that, in the context of that and thinking about sequencing, I think it would also be   very helpful to think about what we believe the steady-state policy tools are going to be; that is,   how are we going to conduct policy in normal times going forward with interest on reserves?    And, I think it is important to have that discussion, but in the context of thinking about how we   use the tools, and the way we use these tools, interacts with where we ultimately want to end up   in how we conduct policy—whether it is a floor system or a corridor system—and what we think   is going to happen to the funds market  I think these things are tied together, and I’d like to see   that discussion carried on in tandem if we can            December 15–16, 2009 12 of 247  Thank you, Mr Chairman  First, just a follow-up on that last point  I   think the dealers are focusing on reverse repos because that’s what they hear us talk about most   of the time  We haven’t talked as much publicly about the term deposits or asset sales  So I   think we sort of get back from them what we say at times, and we have to be a little bit careful   interpreting that, just as an observation   On redemptions and so forth, I tend to think we are going to have to shrink our balance   sheet, and I think your memo very effectively focuses our thinking about the optimal size of our   balance sheet and how we want to think about that  We have walked up to this question over and   over again over the last year and a half and really haven’t come to grips with what the answer is,   but this sort of raises that question foursquare, and I think it’s important that we think about that    I think the direction going forward is that the balance sheet is going to get smaller rather than   larger, so I’m in favor of letting them all run off  In terms of Treasuries, I do think at some   point, as the Chairman’s comment suggested, if we get back to a SOMA portfolio that looks   more like it used to look, we’re going to have to start substituting short-term for long-term  I   don’t know that we need to do that initially, but certainly that would be a possibility   Back to the sequencing—again, I think these things interact with one another  We have   two other things affecting the overall balance sheet  One is the runoff in the liquidity programs    Another issue, which we haven’t returned to, is the SFP  What’s going to happen to it?  Is it   going to come back?  How is that going to effect our balance sheet? And how would that   interact with all of this?  So I think there’s a whole complex set of interactions that we need to be   thinking about That’s why I commented earlier about the need to discuss our views on how we     December 15–16, 2009 21 of 247  implement policy going forward, sort of a new steady state  How we get to that steady state is   combination of these things  I don’t think we can think about them in isolation   So, if you have got some observations about the SFP, I’d love to hear them, too   But I think that’s why this is important  The SFP got run down on us,   which was implicitly an increase in our balance sheet, and in excess reserves that we did not   necessarily elect to have happen The discussion earlier on this was that it was going to come   back up again What I hear is that it may not go back up, which, in my view, would strengthen   the case for letting some of these other things mature and run off, as opposed to reinvesting   them, because excess reserves are already higher than we thought they would be in the initial go-  around of asset purchases   Fair enough   One quick question, Mr Chairman  You may have alluded to this, but   are we going to take an action on whether or not we want to do the redemptions?   I’d like to follow up a little bit on the TDF, because I’m still   uncomfortable with the potential for arbitrage between it and primary credit  Jim, do you   envision that the TAF will shut down before TDF becomes active?   Otherwise, I can imagine a bank lending to us at one rate and getting   the TAF credit at 25 basis points, which is borrowing backed by posting TDF collateral  It looks   as if you’re going to cap the auction rate at the primary credit rate   Because otherwise you are inviting them to game the system  But if   the term premium is not high enough, then that sort of enters into what maturities you’re going to   offer, whether the term premium for six months or a year would be so large that you couldn’t cap   the TDF rate at the primary credit rate—that is, the spread wasn’t big enough  So I’m just really   puzzled about how all of this is going to sort itself out, and whether or not this is really going to   be effective at draining any reserves at all                     December 15–16, 2009 38 of 247  Right But that spread will partly depend on what the range of   maturities are that we offer at the TDF  The longer the maturity, presumably the higher the   premium, and whether we’ve got the spread high enough to cover that would be something that   we would have to sort of work on, I would think, in order to make it work   Will that end up raising interest rates?  President Kocherlakota was talking about this   Do these tools affect interest rates in some sense?  Is this just a backhanded way of raising rates,   which we might as well raise anyway?  I’m still a little uncomfortable with how this is actually   going to work and whether it’s going to do what we think it’s going to do   Yes, right If I live that long  [Laughter]   It’s hard to know how to take that restrained enthusiasm in this report     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Economic activity in the Third District has   remained slow, but there has been some improvement in a number of sectors, including   manufacturing, retail sales, and residential real estate  The outlook by our firms continues to be   for low levels of activity, but most of our contacts say they believe that conditions have   bottomed out and will improve, but they remain very cautious about the future   Let me start with some very good news, which seems appropriate in this holiday season    Our manufacturing survey’s general activity index in November rose for the fourth consecutive   month, up to 167 from 115 in October  Our December survey, which will be released, and,   therefore, is embargoed until Thursday at 1000 am, also shows an increase, up to 204    Another positive note was delivered on the employment index of our survey, which moved from     December 15–16, 2009 53 of 247  negative territory, where it had been for many, many, many, many, many months, into positive   territory for the first time, at 63  Both of those numbers seem consistent with a steady   improvement in the general activity index, and the growth and positive number for employment   were particularly encouraging   Retail sales in the District improved slightly in November for most of our stores and most   lines of merchandise, including autos, which had dropped off at the end of the “cash-for­  clunkers” program  The retailers we spoke to are cautious about holiday sales  They are keeping   inventories leaner and moving to lower-quality items and, therefore, lower-priced merchandise,   which is going to make it a bit more difficult, I think, to interpret the retail sales numbers going   forward   Employment in the three states continues to decline, but the rate of decline has slowed   considerably, consistent with that in the nation  We don’t have the November employment   numbers yet, but, so far, for the last 12 months, the pace of job losses in each of our states has   been less than that in the nation And the tri-state unemployment rate is only 92 percent in   October, a full percentage point below the national rate  We’ll see—can I use word gap?— if   this gap is maintained when the November numbers come out next Friday   The commercial real estate market remains weak—no surprise there  Our contacts expect   construction and leasing to remain at low levels well into next year  This matters for many banks   in our District, because they have exposure to, and are responding to, and not lending to,   developers Indeed, bank lending continues to contract across all categories—consumers,   businesses, and real estate Bankers report that the declines, though, reflect both supply and   demand factors  They have tightened credit standards, although most seem to suggest that they   are not continuing to tighten credit standards; that is, the bankers we spoke to seem to be        December 15–16, 2009 54 of 247  comfortable where they are for now Lending is down, but it seems to be as much a lack of   demand as a lack of credit supply, especially to businesses  Most banks reported continuing   deterioration in credit quality across all loan categories, but some said the rise in delinquencies   and defaults appeared to be slowing  I would note that in the NFIB survey that came out about a   week ago, small businesses ranked the lack of demand for their goods as a much bigger problem   than the lack of credit As demand rises more generally in the economy, the credit quality of   these firms is likely to improve, and they will increase demand for loans, and lending will be   forthcoming as their credit quality improves  That will be a natural part of the cyclical response   of a recovering economy   At the national level, my reading of the data is that the improvement in economic and   financial market conditions appears to be gaining momentum, and the likelihood that recovery   will be sustainable has increased  Indeed, I think conditions in financial markets have improved   more quickly than many of us had predicted  We’ve been lucky that some of the downside risks   we saw a year ago—including the possibility of steeper-than-expected house price declines, and   no improvement in equity prices—didn’t happen, while some of the upside risks, including   faster-than-expected growth abroad and a more rapid decline in the dollar, did, in fact, occur  So   sometimes we have to take the good news when it comes, and it may be smarter to be lucky than   it’s lucky to be smart sometimes   Employment, retail sales, housing, and manufacturing activity continue to improve  The   November employment report was quite encouraging in this regard and doesn’t appear to have   been driven by seasonals or even one particular sector  The pace of job losses has slowed pretty   significantly over the past few months, and initial claims for unemployment insurance, including   both the state and federal programs, have moved down  Households seem to have made        December 15–16, 2009 55 of 247  significant progress in getting their balance sheets more in order, and consumer spending has   picked up more than expected  Caution, low sentiment, in addition to tight credit, may be   holding back some of the spending, but that could easily change if improvements in labor   markets continue  In the Greenbook, consumption is forecast to grow less than real income, but   given the low level of consumption, this would actually seem to be an upside risk in the forecast   Private sector forecasters have been revising up their forecasts based on recent data  I   think it would be prudent for us to recognize that the recovery may be more robust than we had   been expecting and that the equilibrium real rates of interest may rise faster than anticipated  If   so, we will need to be ready to begin reducing the degree of monetary policy accommodation   sooner than later, which means we may want to begin signaling this in our statement  As real   rates rise, the opportunity cost of banks holding on to vast excess reserves may lead to a rapid   increase in the money multiplier and a conversion of excess reserves into loans or borrowed   money This may happen very quickly and require a rapid response on our part, and we should   anticipate this with the language in our statements, so that we don’t get caught off guard  Thus, I   see a greater upside risk in the medium term—the two- to five-year term—to inflation than the   Greenbook does Inflation expectations for now remain stable  I’m encouraged by that  But,   again, oil and commodity prices have begun to rise again Who knows their effect on   expectations going forward?  We must be cautious in our interpretation of those events    Similarly, the fall in the dollar, while positive for growth, may be signaling increased inflation   expectations  All this reinforces my view that we are likely going to have to begin withdrawing   some of this extraordinary monetary policy accommodation that we have put into place sooner   than anticipated in the Greenbook baseline forecast              December 15–16, 2009 56 of 247  And we will need to begin communicating this possibility to the public  Otherwise, we   may find ourselves behind the curve and unable to raise rates in as timely a fashion as we may   desire, because our language will have constrained us  As growth rates rise, we are going to   have to allow interest rates to increase and not take those increases as signals of market   dysfunction that need policy intervention  Thank you, Mr Chairman   Thank you, Mr Chairman Given the increasing signs that the   economy is gaining momentum, I think it’s important for this Committee to consider language   that begins to prepare the market for the possibility that we will need to begin reducing the   degree of policy accommodation and our interventions in private markets sooner rather than   later The time to change policy is not now, but I do believe the time is getting closer  I think   the language in alternative C does a better job of this than the language in B, with the change in   the forward guidance regarding the path of the funds rate substituting “some time” for “an   extended period of time”  I also note that paragraph 3 in alternative C begins with the phrase “at   this meeting”  I wasn’t quite sure about the intent of that, but my interpretation is—and I have   some sympathy with the view—that this language does emphasize that things may change at   some future meeting, and it sort of keeps our options open that changes can come to pass              December 15–16, 2009 108 of 247  My own view is that, as economic growth picks up and becomes more sustainable, real   interest rates will rise  Appetite for risk will increase, and that will lead to a rise in the   opportunity cost of the vast amount of excess reserves that sits in the system  The money   multiplier will go up, and those excess reserves will flow rapidly out into the economy, as the   opportunity cost gets higher and higher for banks to hold onto them  The combination of more   sustained growth and a flow of excess reserves into the economy would mean that if we want to   retain control over those excess reserves, we will have to raise the policy rate  So as real growth   picks up and becomes more sustainable, our policy rates should rise with that  Put another way,   we may lose control of all those excess reserves   As I’ve discussed at earlier meetings, I favor the inflation paragraph in alternative C   primarily because it emphasizes the dependence of inflation on the stability of longer-term   expectations and on policy adjustments that we will take to keep inflation levels consistent with   price stability, both on the positive and negative side of our target I like conveying this idea that   it is monetary policy actions rather than structural features of the economy that influence   inflation over the longer term  Moreover, I think that the language of paragraph 2 in alternative   C will help stabilize and anchor expectations, as it more strongly signals our commitment to   maintain price stability  I think this can only help us in a period when the dispersion in inflation   forecasts has widened and uncertainty has increased  As I said at our last meeting, the dispersion   of the forecasts for long-term inflation, both in our SPF survey and our Livingston survey, has   widened noticeably, and this should concern us   I favor including the last paragraph of alternative B, which is repeated in alternative C,   regarding the expiration of some of our facilities on February 1 for three reasons  First, and most   importantly, I believe it is the right policy  The improvement of financial conditions over the           December 15–16, 2009 109 of 247  past year has been swifter than some of us might have expected, and financial conditions appear   to be returning to normalcy  I see no compelling reason at this point to keep the facilities open   beyond February Second, the market expects that these facilities are going to be wound down   early next year, so I don’t think the paragraph would cause much of a market reaction, and it   should help reduce uncertainty around that expectation  Third, it’s becoming progressively   harder to justify the existence of some of these liquidity programs as financial market conditions   improve  I assume that the Governors are going to have to take a decision soon about whether   exigent and unusual circumstances continue to exist to justify the programs  In my view, it’s   becoming harder and harder to do that  My only comment is that it’s not clear why we shouldn’t   further reduce the size of TAF auctions at this point  They’re still significantly undersubscribed,   and we haven’t been able to increase the rate There will likely be interactions with the term   deposit facility, as we mentioned yesterday  I suggest we reduce these auctions again to see if   we can’t get supply more in line with demand   As to our discussion yesterday about increasing the penalty rate, the discount rate, I’ll   repeat my plea on this  I’m sympathetic with President Rosengren and repeat my plea that we   not treat our exit tools in isolation  We need to treat them collectively and have a discussion in   January about how all the pieces of our exit tools fit together, with an eye toward what form of   monetary policy framework we’ll want to use after this exit strategy is over  That is, we need to   know not only where we’re going, but also how all of these different tools fit together to get us   there, because there are a lot of interactions  It’s difficult to determine the appropriate exit   strategy and optimal size of our balance sheet without knowing which alternative monetary   policy implementation framework we’re headed towards and what our policy rate strategies will   be Thank you, Mr Chairman                    December 15–16, 2009 110 of 247  I think we should not take it out, because I think listing all the programs   that we’ve done and omitting this one would be noticed, and it might be noticed in a significant   way—I think that’s what President Evans was saying  So unless we really intend to do   something different, I think it would be a mistake not to include it   Something’s afoot, right   Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll try to keep my comments brief  I want   to talk a little about what I took away from some of this  I found the papers very interesting and   fun to read and think about One of the lessons I take away from this—and it’s one that I’ve   taken away for some time, and Jeff referred to it—is that a little humility may be in order, in   terms of our ability to truly understand particularly short-run dynamics in the inflation process   One of the things that I think we learned from this discussion is that, depending on the   model that you write down, and depending on the nature of the shocks that you allow to hit that   model, you can get different outcomes, you can get different relationships between variables   within that model That means that we need to be a little cautious in our interpretation about   how we rely in our policy discussions on one set of variables versus another set of variables in   guiding our outlooks for inflation One of the things that I have tried to convey in some of my   comments over the last several months is that I have been worried that in the way we talk about   inflation—particularly the future of inflation and deflation—we have become a little too fixated   on measures of output gaps  One of the things we learned from this is that, depending on which   output gap you write down and what you think of the shocks, other things may matter, so we   need to be a little more careful about “diversifying our portfolio” about what’s going to happen   and protect ourselves from being put in a bad spot     December 15–16, 2009 177 of 247  So, I think humility is important  I think the nature of the shocks is important  I think the   conversation between Governor Kohn and Mike Dotsey about what we think this shock is and   what it did is a useful kind of conversation to have  The problem comes when the output gap   becomes a shorthand for a whole bunch of other stuff, and then it becomes a communication   problem, because it may or may not be the right shorthand  There may be circumstances where   you need a different shorthand or a different measure  And that’s where talking about the nature   of the shocks becomes useful in how we think about it   If you focus on traditional measures of the output gap, it seems to me there are   circumstances where, with excessive emphasis on trying to close that gap—I’m not talking about   the current circumstances, necessarily—you may not be conducting policy in an optimal way or   even increasing welfare You may actually reduce welfare if you focus on the wrong metric or   the wrong target with the gaps So there may not be an easy, one-to-one correspondence at times   between policy that’s welfare improving and policy that closes gaps, and we need to be cautious   about that Charlie Evans commented earlier about taking other variables into account, and it is   very important that we do that   The last comment I’ll make is that I want to reinforce Janet Yellen’s point, because she   and I agree on this—some people may find that unusual  Given the uncertainty that we have   about the class of models that we deal with, there’s a lot of work on robust rules  Some of the   staff in San Francisco—John Williams and others—have worked hard on this  I find this work   very useful, because they take models where we actually can compute optimal policy, and then   ask what happens What kind of simple rules could we use that would get us close to something   that looks like the optimal policy?  There’s been a great deal of work on this  The simple rules   they write down typically are of a Taylor rule variety with an output gap and a deviation of     December 15–16, 2009 178 of 247  inflation from some target  One thing that comes out of those robust rules, though, is that the   answer is not that the output gap doesn’t matter  But in most of those exercises that I’m familiar   with, the weight on the output gap in the Taylor rule tends to be pretty small  I think that’s one   of the things that is interesting about some of those rules  The important thing about those robust   rules is that the weight on the deviation from inflation target gets very big, and the weight on the   output gap is relatively small in many cases   One of the helpful things that we could do is think about the class of robust rules and   about how robust these rules are against the class of models that are on the table  That could   help focus our discussion and give us, again, this robustness in our policy thinking that could be   very helpful  So I’m very positive towards that line of research in the literature, because, as we   can see here today, models are different, and they can give different outcomes  We need to be   cautious about what we know and how precise we are and not put too much weight on any one   factor at any one point in time—“diversify our portfolio,” if you will  Again, my argument for lo   these many months is to try to get our language to look more robust and a little less focused on   single metrics   I want to thank all of the Reserve Bank staff  They did a great job, and I think this has   been a very useful discussion  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
8919,2010-01-26,PLOSSER,"  Just to clarify your last comment  Does this have to be reviewed   formally every year?    That’s fine  I just wanted to make sure that I understood the criteria    I think my question was answered  I really wanted to pursue the notion,   when we think about what the penalty rate should be, of some theory that tells us what the right   spread is—whether it is 50, 100, or 150 basis points  It seems to me that we don’t really have a   lot of evidence on that point  I just wondered  But I think you and Brian both answered my   January 26–27, 2010 27 of 260    question of what it is we know—and it might not be very much—but it seems to me that, if we   think 100 is the right spread, then we ought to get there quicker rather than not  But you   answered my question, so I won’t ask it again—unless you had something more to add onto it    Well, no  There was a memo or paper on a bargaining model that   someone on the New York staff had done that had a theory that gave you a story  I am probably   not in a position to tell you what that is, but there was one    Thank you, Mr Chairman  With regard to primary credit, I support the   normalization of primary credit  I think we are winding down our special liquidity programs,   and this needs to go along with that  I think we need to raise the penalty back to 100 basis points   and shorten the maximum maturity on primary credit back to overnight  I think we need to end   the TAF auctions, and as I have argued for some time, we need to get the minimum bid rate on   January 26–27, 2010 56 of 260    the TAF auctions back up to something close to the primary credit rate  So I approve and   support all of those things  I think they are all part of the normalization process  Those actions   were part of special liquidity provisions  And the closer we can announce those changes to the   expiration of other liquidity facilities, the better off we will be in terms of our communications  I   don’t think we need to take this normalization in steps  I would just as soon that we do it all at   one time, go back to 100 basis points, end the TAF, and we’re back  I agree it should be   unanimous among the Banks  I think they would be very supportive  So I am supportive of all   of that   I also think, as long as we are taking steps to normalize some of these operations at the   discount window, that it is high time we rescinded the authorization to give Fannie and Freddie   access to the discount window  We allowed access to the discount window to Fannie and   Freddie back in August 2008  It was supposed to be an emergency measure, until the Treasury   could get congressional approval to expand its lending  It did  On December 24, the Treasury   announced that it was allowing its own short-term credit facility to expire because it had the   backstop credit facility and it could now use preferred stock to support Fannie and Freddie to any   degree they saw fit  So I think it’s time we close that option, and I hope we will do that very   soon   Let me turn to the exit strategy removals  I want to skip to the question about the long   run  Before we can answer some of these questions—4, 6, and some of the others, and about   how much we should drain—I think we need to think hard about what our longer-run operating   regime should look like  Given the current size of our balance sheet, it is going to be very   difficult to implement any kind of monetary policy other than via a floor system because excess   reserves are so large  So a corridor system, at least in the near term, seems to be out of the   January 26–27, 2010 57 of 260    question  However, over time, I have become more convinced that we should be headed back to   a corridor system, not a floor system  Now, of course, what that implies is that we will have to   get the reserves on our balance sheet back down to a level where we can target a funds rate that   is above the IOER rate  I say this not because I think the floor system can’t be effective, because   I think it can  But the real reason I say this is that I want to have some constraint on the size of   our portfolio  I worry that, if there is no constraint on the size, it may be considerably harder for   us to resist calls for the Fed to use its portfolio to allocate resources to particular sectors on   behalf of the fiscal authorities   There are smart people in the Congress who will realize that under a floor system we can   saturate the banking system with excess reserves by purchasing large volumes of government   debt or other assets, explode our balance sheet, and generate increased earnings that can then be   turned over to the Treasury  And we can do that as long as the assets we buy have earnings that   are higher than the floor  I think this makes us even a more tempting and an increasingly   tempting and convenient target for the fiscal authorities, and it actually puts our independence at   risk  I think of the corridor system as serving as a kind of commitment device for the Fed that   would allow it to limit the size of its portfolio in order to hit a federal funds rate target between   the upper and lower bound, and this will help us say “no” when the time comes   Now, with regard to some of the other questions, I don’t think we have much choice but   to complete our purchases of MBS, as we have announced  I was not a big fan of removing the   “up to” language  I think it would have given us more flexibility, but we are now stuck with it,   so I am inclined that we have to do that  But relatively soon I think we are going to have to rely   not just on redemptions of agency debt and MBS but also on selling some of the MBS from our   portfolio  And I think we should be prepared to do that when the time comes   January 26–27, 2010 58 of 260    Regarding question 3, about our certainty of our ability to control short-term interest   rates, IO—IEO—I can’t say it either  [Laughter]  Eeyore, right  There we go  The staff memo   suggests that current levels of reserves may damp the effect of an increase in IOER on the funds   rate  Therefore, beginning to drain reserves before we begin raising rates might seem prudent,   and it might put us on a path toward getting reserves back down toward our long-run goal  And   my preference would be a corridor system of some kind   So I think we need to begin to reduce the size of the balance sheet  The tools that the   staff has recommended, whether it be reverse repos or term deposits, do not shrink our balance   sheet  They may be argued as fine-tuning tools that might get the funds rate near the IOER rate,   but they really don’t shrink our balance sheet  And I don’t think we should rely on them   extensively, except in very short term circumstances  Second, I think that the extent of our large   balance sheet complicates the public’s inference about our resolve to maintain price stability, and   if we believe that using IOER and our other tools allows our balance sheet to remain large   without implying higher inflation, then we need to be attentive to the disconnect between what   we think will work and what the message is that the public is receiving  As I have said before,   the dispersion among inflation forecasts of respondents in the Survey of Professional Forecasters   and the inflation risk premiums that might be implied by TIPS have increased  Therefore,   uncertainty about inflation has increased, and we should be attuned to that and recognize that it   may signal that our credibility is somewhat tenuous   One way to show our commitment to maintaining price stability is—I’ve lost my pages   now because I’m skipping around—in fact to begin to drain reserves, and that may prove to be   very helpful  I would also suggest that there are a couple of other advantages to draining   reserves  As we raise the IOER rate with high levels of excess reserves, the interest rates we pay   January 26–27, 2010 59 of 260    to banks will go up  If we raise the IOER rate by 50 basis points, with $1 trillion of excess   reserves, we are funneling something like $5 billion more into the banking system  Given the   political sensitivities around Washington these days, our choosing to raise the IOER rate with so   many excess reserves in the system might get us pushback in the political process about our   providing more and more support for the banking system, and I think we have to be sensitive to   that  I also suggest that, by shrinking the balance sheet and selling assets earlier, as we raise   interest rates, our potential down the road for capital losses on any future sales might in part be   mitigated by the fact that we have sold the assets earlier rather than waiting until interest rates   got a lot higher  That also might have some benefits to it   Regarding the long-term structure of our balance sheet, my answer is simple  It should   be all Treasuries, preferably concentrated in bills and short-term coupon bonds  I would note for   the record that, if the economy were to take a turn for the worse, I would still oppose purchasing   more MBS  If you were to engage in more asset purchases, I feel strongly that they should be   Treasuries  And to the extent that we redeem Treasuries, rather than letting them run off, I think   we should redeem them not with long-term bonds but with short-term Treasury securities—again   with the idea of getting our portfolio back to some more normal structure  Our SOMA Treasury   portfolio has grown from an average maturity of 40 months in 2006 to more than 80 months   today  That is very long  So I would, again, prefer the short-term securities at that point  I guess   that is it, Mr Chairman      830 tomorrow morning    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Economic activity in our region is growing,   albeit slowly  Regional manufacturing activity continues to rise  Our Business Outlook   Survey’s general activity index indicated expansion for the sixth consecutive month in January,   although the level at 152 was a bit lower than the December level of 225  The index is now   slightly below the level we typically see in expansions, which, I think is an indication that,   although the region is in recovery, it isn’t yet a robust one   We asked some special questions this month in our survey, and responses were consistent   with moderate growth  Forty-three percent of our manufacturers said that the underlying demand   for their products had risen in the past three months, whereas only 23 percent reported a   decrease  But our firms remained considerably uncertain about the future  About a quarter   reported that they have become more certain about their forecasts for growth over the next six   months  About the same percentage said they had become less certain about the future  This is a   bit unusual  Typically uncertainty dissipates as the recovery gathers strength  Another sign that   businesses remain uncertain of the strength of the recovery is that, while the index of future   expectations on general activity remains quite positive, it is also slightly below what we would   usually see at the beginning of a recovery   The news on employment in our District remains mixed  Unemployment rates in our   three states fell in November, as they did in the nation, and our Business Outlook Survey’s   employment diffusion index was positive for the second consecutive month in January  These   January 26–27, 2010 118 of 260    were the first positive readings on the employment index in 21 months  This suggested that at   least some firms are thinking about hiring  Unfortunately, the unemployment rate in each state   rose in December and is now above the national average in New Jersey, but it remains below the   national average in both Delaware and Pennsylvania  More anecdotally, we are beginning to   hear some signal from my business contacts that they are starting to think about expanding their   workforce rather than not thinking about it at all  They remain highly uncertain about the   outlook for the demand for their products, and they also repeatedly say things like “until I get   some resolution on fiscal policy”—they don’t know what their taxes and hiring costs are going to   be, and they continue to worry about that, and that plays into their reluctance to hire   At a national level, my outlook for the economy has changed very little from my   November forecast  I believe that the economy is in a recovery and there is an increased   likelihood that the recovery will be a sustainable one even as the effects of monetary and fiscal   policy wane  I think conditions in the financial markets continue to support the recovery  Credit   conditions appear to be easing somewhat in the banking industry—but at least they are not   tightening any further  Some of the downside risks we saw a year ago, including steeper-than-  expected house-price declines, equity-price declines, and other financial meltdowns, did not   occur  Labor markets continue to be under stress, but the rate of job loss is slowing, and I expect   to see payroll growth resume being positive in the first quarter and more than likely pick up   steam in the second half of the year   On balance, the data have been slightly stronger than I anticipated, and I have revised up   my 2010 projections slightly since November  But the basic structure and shape of my forecast   in 2010 and beyond remains largely unchanged  I think the recovery will gain more solid   footing, with real GDP growth of about 34 percent this year, which then will moderate to   January 26–27, 2010 119 of 260    3 percent in 2011 and 2012, a somewhat weaker path than the Greenbook and probably weaker   than one would expect in the normal course of a recession as deep as this one  Thus I see, at   least relative to my forecast, that there may be some upside risks to that similar to what President   Bullard was suggesting   I would also like to note that the Greenbook and the presentations incorporated the effects   of the extended and emergency unemployment benefits on the measured unemployment rate    Unemployment insurance benefits have been extended a significant amount during this recession   and now have reached 99 weeks of coverage  The Greenbook recognizes this and that this can   affect the natural rate of unemployment, and the Board staff has adjusted up its estimate of the   NAIRU about 1 percentage point, from 5¼ to 6¼ percent, through 2011, where it looks as   though it gradually falls back toward 5¼ percent by 2013   Coincidentally my staff in Philadelphia has also done recent work on this issue, and their   work suggests that extended unemployment benefits raise unemployment duration by lowering   job search intensity and dropouts from the labor force  Their calibrated model suggests that the   iterative extension of unemployment benefits that we have seen during this recession could have   pushed up the average duration of unemployment by six to seven weeks, accounting for about a   half to two-thirds of the actual 11-week rise that we have experienced  These estimates also   suggest that extended UI benefits have raised the unemployment rate in the neighborhood of   11 to 17 percentage points over and above what would have otherwise been  It is a slightly   higher percentage than the 1 percentage point the staff has; we think it’s a little more than that,   maybe as high as 15 percent   These findings have two broad implications that we should recognize  First, they suggest   that, as labor market conditions improve and the extended benefits are permitted to expire, we   January 26–27, 2010 120 of 260    may see an accelerated decline in both the duration of unemployment and the unemployment   rate  In other words, going forward, unemployment rates may improve more quickly than in   some forecasts that don’t incorporate the effects of the unemployment insurance  So going on   the other side, we may see accelerated improvement  Second, these findings suggest that there’s   less resource slack than one would have if one ignored these benefit programs  For example,   suppose that the natural rate previously was thought to be in the neighborhood of 5 percent and,   as some people have argued, the permanent shock or the persistent nature of the shock we have   had in this recession has effectively raised the natural rate significantly  Let’s say it’s raised, just   to pick a number, 1 percentage point  So the longer-run natural rate is now 6 percent rather than   5 percent  If we now add the effects of extended UI claims of about 1½ percentage points, we   get a natural rate in the current environment of something like 7½ percent  This would imply a   much smaller unemployment gap than if these effects were ignored—again, underscoring the   difficulty of measuring any sort of resource utilization gaps  While the natural rate may   gradually drift back down as the economic shock dissipates and the benefits expire, such   situations do suggest that we need to be careful about keeping rates too low for too long   My inflation forecast continues to differ from the Greenbook  I expect underlying   inflation to remain moderate in the near term, but I expect it to drift upward over the next couple   of years as it has drifted upward over this year  Moreover, I see the upside risk to this inflation   forecast to be higher in the medium to longer term   I would like to suggest that we exercise some caution in relying on core inflation   measures as a signal for underlying inflation trends  Presumably we seek to peer through relative   price shocks to discern as best we can underlying inflation trends  The argument for core   measures is that food and energy are particularly volatile, although they are not the most volatile   January 26–27, 2010 121 of 260    components of the price index  There are other components of the CPI that can also exhibit large   and significant relative price movements and potentially make it difficult for us to assess   underlying inflation trends  Indeed, one might argue that we have experienced a very large and   significant relative price shock to housing broadly defined  Shelter makes up about 30 percent of   the CPI headline index and even a larger share of the core index  So movements in shelter prices   have a large impact on the CPI  Of course, for the PCE, housing gets less weight, and so the   effects would be less pronounced  For example, for the last three months of 2009, headline CPI   rose at an annual rate of 33 percent  Over that same period, core CPI rose at an annual rate of   13 percent—a rather large discrepancy  Yet if we look at the index excluding food, energy, and   shelter, the rise was 28 percent, much closer to the headline number  Now, for the whole year   the numbers are similar  From December ’08 to December ’09, headline inflation was   28 percent  Core was 18 percent, but core less shelter was 29 percent  Obviously, declines in   the price of housing are a very large contributor to the low CPI inflation as measured by the core   Our colleagues at the Cleveland Fed have recognized this problem recently and revised   their methodology in computing their median CPI measure  They divide owners’ equivalent rent   into four regional components  Nonetheless, owners’ equivalent rent still emerges as the median   component over half the time between January 1998 and July 2007  But the crux of this issue is   that, if the price change in a large component like shelter represents a downward relative price   shock, we shouldn’t be complacent that the low level of core inflation in this environment is   necessarily signaling low underlying inflation trends  Again, of course, these numbers will be   somewhat different for the PCE  I couldn’t really get the data to back out the pieces as you could   for the CPI, but the point is that we’re seeking to peer through large relative price movements to   January 26–27, 2010 122 of 260    seek out our underlying inflation trends, recognizing that the housing shock may be a very large   relative price shock we should recognize   Now, let me hasten to add that I am not advocating that we throw out individual   components of the price index as it suits us or seems convenient  I am also aware that in the   context of some models we should be paying more attention to those prices that are presumed to   be sticky; and shelter, at least until the current episode, might arguably fall into that category of a   sticky price  Yet what we need to recognize is that the decline in core inflation has been largely   a result of the decline in the price of shelter, and it should always give us pause if we want to   focus on trend inflation if an index or a sub-index is dominated by the behavior of one   expenditure category  In fact, the way I think about this is that it suggests to me that we ought to   be placing more weight on headline measures as opposed to any particular sub-index where we   pick and choose what to include and what not  Thus, we should be cautious and not become too   sanguine about the behavior of core as an indicator of our underlying inflation trends   I will briefly reiterate some of the points that President Bullard just made about inflation   expectations  While they seem stable and I am encouraged by that, TIPS measures of five-year,   five-year forwards have been drifting up rather continuously since the beginning of the year    Those should give us pause  Survey measures seem to be rather stable  That’s some good news    But dispersion of survey measures and some interpretations of the TIPS measures may mean that   uncertainty or inflation risk premiums may be rising, and if inflation risk premiums are rising,   that suggests that we should be concerned perhaps about our credibility and make sure we   maintain it   Thus, to keep inflation moderate in the medium or long term I think that we will have to   begin tightening policy some time much sooner than forecast in the Greenbook, and indeed, I   January 26–27, 2010 123 of 260    suspect it will be by late spring or early summer  My forecast suggests that the funds rate will   have to rise nearly to 2 percent by the end of 2010—which is, by the way, still very low by   historical standards—and rise fairly steadily thereafter  I assume that we will begin reducing the   level of excess reserves in the banking system through a combination of tools, including asset   sales, prior to that  The extraordinary monetary policy accommodation we put into place must   sooner or later be removed, and we will have to be careful and cautious in our communications   to the public about how and when we do that  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I guess I get to go first and throw myself to   the bears here    No, no, no  I thought we were starting the go-round    Oh, I am sorry    Thank you, Mr Chairman  The economic recovery, I believe, is   gaining some momentum  I think the Committee has to prepare itself and the public for the   possibility that we will need to begin to reduce the size of our balance sheet and may need to   commence this activity sooner than suggested by the Greenbook  I would like to see us begin to   modify our language in a way that will help rather than hinder our ability to take the proper   actions at the proper time   In terms of this policy meeting, I can support alternative B  In particular, I don’t see how   at this juncture we can do anything but follow through on our announced purchases  However, I   do think we could consider speeding them up so that we complete them prior to March 31 and   not necessarily wait until the end of the quarter  Paragraph 1 of alternative B is fine with me  I   have no objections to that   In paragraph 3, I favor the alternative variant that substitutes the word “holdings” for   “purchases” because I think, again, this is one of those small steps toward signaling our intention   January 26–27, 2010 174 of 260    to exit  I would also favor changing our forward guidance from “extended period” to “some   time” for the same reason  I believe it’s important that we extract ourselves from housing   finance and adopt an operating mechanism to protect our independence and raise our ability to   say “no” to efforts in the political process to use our balance sheet for fiscal policy  I like the   language generally in paragraph 4, which reiterates that many of the special facilities will be   closed on February 1  This is a significant step toward normalization of policy, and I favor that   Now, as I have suggested in several earlier meetings, I have tended to favor alternative   C’s inflation paragraph because it emphasizes the dependence of inflation on the stability of   long-term expectations and on the policy adjustments that will be taken to keep inflation   consistent with price stability  I very much like the idea that it is monetary policy actions and   not structural features of the economy that will influence inflation over the longer run  Given the   concern that a number of people have expressed around this table today about the potential risk   for increased medium- to longer-term inflation, keeping those expectations anchored is very   important, and this change in language would help signal to the markets and to the public our   commitment to deliver on price stability and may put at rest, or at least help put to rest, some of   those fears about outbreaks of inflation   On Bill’s reference to energy prices with regard to paragraph 2, I am comfortable with   deleting the reference to energy prices in part because I see singling out one set of relative prices   for mention and not others can be problematic over time  So I would be comfortable just   eliminating that   Finally, I just want to thank the staff again yesterday for their outstanding work on exit   strategies  I thought yesterday’s discussion was extraordinarily fruitful and interesting  I learned   a lot, and I hope we can continue those kinds of discussion going forward  I think we must   January 26–27, 2010 175 of 260    continue to address the issue and evaluate how our various tools fit together, and I hope we will   soon come to a decision about the type of implementation framework, floor versus corridor, and   the policy rate, funds rate, another market rate, or administered rate like the IOER rate, or where   we are ultimately headed in that regard  I think doing so will help us think more carefully about   the nature of and the way we do our exit strategy, and it will help us address the size and shape   of adjusting our balance sheet as we go forward if we know where we want to end up   As I said yesterday, my own preference is that we aim for implementing policy with a   corridor system, where the market rate such as the funds rate is our operating target, and that we   have a much smaller balance sheet that contains Treasuries only and is weighted toward short-  term Treasuries at that  I think this will give us the ability to exercise our independent control of   our balance sheet and enhance our independence with respect to operating and setting monetary   policy  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Be careful what you wish for  [Laughter]      Yes  I want to ask a question about this “purchases” versus “holdings”   issue  I want to ask Brian—we are purchasing, but there are also redemptions going on right   now  So can you give me an idea of the magnitude of the redemptions that we are going to be   seeing over the next two months or three months?      $5 billion?  $15 billion?  $2 billion?  What?  $100 billion?      My point is that our holdings are being affected by both purchases and   redemptions  And so getting back to the debate about “holdings” versus “purchases,” we are not   just purchasing, we are also redeeming   January 26–27, 2010 200 of 260     Thank you    May I just make one comment?  Previously I actually proposed that we   could keep the resource slack sentence and then just add the second sentence of C2 as a way to   combine the two    I’m sure I will  [Laughter]    One question  What the sentence says is “to warrant exceptionally low   levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period”  The market seems to interpret that as   being that we don’t move at all  Yet we could move 50 basis points and still have exceptionally   January 26–27, 2010 206 of 260    low interest rates  So in your view, what is the interaction between “extended period” and   “exceptionally low”?  Should we be interpreting it as no move or that we may be moving up   slowly?  "
8943,2010-03-16,PLOSSER,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll be very brief because I’ll echo some of   the points that have already been made  In terms of redemptions, I’m all in favor of them  I   think the important thing about where we’re going is not just the size of the balance sheet, as   President Kocherlakota just said, but also the composition  I’m uncomfortable with a   March 16, 2010 27 of 146    redemptions-only policy of either one because at the end of 2014, we’ve still got almost   70 percent of our SOMA portfolio in MBS, and that’s not a satisfactory outcome  So we need to   change the composition as well as the size   On the RCAs, I’m very dubious about their benefits  I’m very worried that this will be   read by the press and others as a way for the Fed to provide backdoor interest on reserves to the   GSEs, and I think we will look bad in that process  I don’t believe it’s necessarily going to be   effective  And I worry that if our long-term objectives are to return to, let’s say, some kind of   corridor system, the RCAs may put at risk the functioning of the fed funds market  Are we then   shooting ourselves in the foot, making the return to a corridor system more difficult, or will we   be forced into looking at other interest rates?   So I think all of this stuff kind of needs to be looked at collectively  As President   Kocherlakota just said, we need to look at scenarios that meet all of our objectives, including    what is our long-term operating regime going to be, how are we going to get back to an all-  Treasuries portfolio, and how are we going to reduce excess reserves  All of those things are   intertwined with each other, and we need to look at them collectively and not as one-off   decisions  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  In general, the business conditions in the   Third District continue to show signs of improvement since our last meeting, and the tone of our   business contacts has become somewhat more positive  The manufacturing sector shows the   clearest signs of increased activity  Our Business Outlook Survey’s general activity index has   been in positive territory now for six months  The index rose slightly in February to 176, and   the preliminary results, which will be released on Thursday, will show another slight increase for   March  Also, the new orders and shipment indexes rose significantly in February, and even the   employment index is now in positive digits  These measures are all consistent with typical   recovery patterns   Retail sales in the District have been growing slowly, with most of our contacts reporting   soft sales as having been tempered somewhat by the snowstorms in February  Firm contacts tell   us they see this positive trend for retail sales on somewhat firmer footing than they did a few   months ago   One of my contacts is the CFO of a very large national cable company headquartered in   Philadelphia  He reports there has been a significant pickup in their businesses in the last several   months  Last year advertising revenues were down between 25 and 30 percent  In the last few   months, local advertising, which they view as more indicative of economic conditions than the   national bulk advertisers, has surged, suggesting that businesses have become more confident   and that the recovery is sustainable  Conditions improved on the consumer side as well    Delinquencies, which rose significantly last year, are falling and now are at or near what he   described as close to normal levels  What they call “churn”—that is, the number of people   dropping their cable accounts relative to those signing up for cable—has also returned to more   normal levels after deteriorating dramatically last year  These are both very positive signs  Of   March 16, 2010 44 of 146    course, all of the news isn’t good  This company usually spends $200 to $300 million a year   building out cable services, mainly laying cable for new home construction  As you might   expect, those capital expenditures are way down, and they don’t anticipate those coming back   until housing construction returns   The weakest signals in our District come from the labor markets  Unemployment rates in   our three states are at or near recession highs, and payroll employment has continued to decline   over the last three months  State and local budget situations are not rosy, and that, of course, is   tied closely to employment, and that also remains a concern   On balance, the outlook for the region is for continued modest improvement  The   Philadelphia Fed’s leading economic indexes are projecting economic growth of around 2½   percent in our District for the next nine months or so  The outlook among our business contacts   has improved, but most are still expecting economic growth to be modest   At the national level, my outlook for the economy has changed very little since January    I see a modest, but steady, recovery in economic activity that I believe will be sustainable even   after the effects of monetary and fiscal policy wane   On the negative side, housing markets continue to be stressed, and the improvement in   sales and starts seen earlier appears to have been driven by the tax credits  It’s difficult to read   precisely, because of bad weather, which also affects the numbers  More broadly, I think that,   given the distortions in the marketplace with programs like “cash-for-clunkers” or first-time   homebuyers’ credits, it remains unclear how much of that spending that was taken out of the   market and directed to those specific products will begin showing up in demand for other goods   and services if consumers feel like spending  So, although we may see a weakening in housing   when the tax credit ends, we also may see a pickup in spending on automobiles and other things   March 16, 2010 45 of 146    Labor markets continue to be weak, but job losses appear to be bottoming out    Businesses’ future hiring plans seem to be firming, and that’s indicated on our outlook surveys    And I continue to expect a resumption in payroll growth in the second quarter  This will be key   to a continued improvement in household balance sheets and consumer spending  The pickup in   business investment and equipment that has been referred to is consistent with stronger business   confidence    The risk I see around my forecast for this year of around 3¼ to 3½ percent is roughly   balanced  My inflation forecast continues to differ from the Greenbook  In the near term, I   expect underlying inflation to remain very modest, but I do expect it to drift upward over the   next several years, and I see upside risk to inflation in the medium to longer term   I continue to believe that we will need to begin tightening policy this year, certainly well   before what is anticipated in the Greenbook, where there is no increase in the fed funds rate until   2012  Sustained economic growth in the next coming quarter or two will be, to me, an important   signal that we should begin normalizing policy  So I would hope that in our April meeting we’ll   be able to work towards a consensus on our longer-term operating framework, including our   operating target  Knowing, for example, that we will want to converge towards a corridor   system will help us in our deliberations on the exit strategy to achieve our goal of dramatically   reduced reserves and a portfolio that consists only of Treasuries  With that, we will know better   how to communicate those messages to the public  Thus, I hope we can reach a decision on that   goal soon  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  There has been increased communication   about our exit strategy—I think this is a good thing—but I think we’re a bit hampered, because   we really haven’t decided upon yet as a Committee or reached a consensus on many of the facets   of the exit strategy, which we’ve just been alluding to, and I hope we’ll continue to make   progress on this important topic  As I’ve mentioned, our choices on the various elements of our   exit strategy are all interrelated in some way, and we need to look at them collectively rather than   as one-off   In particular, I think that we need to discuss further our longer-term operating framework,   including the appropriate operating target, and that we need to do so in conjunction with the   management of our asset holdings as we seek to shrink the size of reserves and move towards an   March 16, 2010 90 of 146    all-Treasuries portfolio  As the Chairman just indicated, I hope this will be an active discussion   on the agenda in April so we can get a sense of where the Committee stands as we, so to speak,   hone our exit strategies  I think having a better idea of where we’re going will help us decide   how we exit   In general, we want our language to help us implement policy, not hinder us from   implementing policy or inappropriately constrain us  Given the economic outlook, I do think it’s   time for us to seriously consider backing away from the “extended period” language  I would   like our language to give us more flexibility with regard to policy than we currently have  The   forward guidance language, I believe, is beginning to become a hindrance rather than a help    The longer we maintain it, the more difficult we may find it to unwind from it  We will need to   prepare the markets for the eventual start of our exit from this period of extraordinary policy   accommodation   It’s important for the public to understand that zero interest rates is not normal policy  In   fact, a 1 percent interest rate is not normal policy  I view in many ways the start of moving rates   up or selling assets from our portfolio not so much as a tightening in the usual sense of the word,   but as a step towards normalization of policy in the same way that we’re unwinding our liquidity   facilities  With the large size of our balance sheet and with rates at zero, policy will remain   accommodative for a very long time to come after we start normalization   I like the idea of discussing some of our plans for exiting in our statement, but again, I   think we need to be careful and choose language that will not become a constraint on us as we   try to react to economic conditions  This means being careful not to make commitments to a   particular sequencing until we have more evidence on how our tools are working and how the   economy is evolving  We are in new territory  We may find that we aren’t able to maintain a   March 16, 2010 91 of 146    particular sequencing and simultaneously meet our policy objectives  From my perspective we   ought to be trying to describe a reaction function that depends on the state of the economy to the   extent we are able, not on something that looks like a mechanical set of actions that are a   function of calendar time   It probably won’t surprise anyone that I’m in favor of alternative C′, but with a couple of   changes  I would change the forward guidance in paragraph 3 to “some time,” period  I oppose   an additional clause that says “at least through the end of the second quarter”  As I said, our   policy needs to be contingent on the state of the economy, not on the calendar  And I wouldn’t   be conveying that idea that it’s tied to the calendar even if we thought economic conditions will   likely mean that we won’t be raising the target funds rate  Again, I want the description in terms   of the state of the economy, not in terms of the calendar   I had similar views to my colleagues, President Lacker and Fisher, regarding alternative   C, paragraph 4  I think the C′ language is a little better  I think President Hoenig’s suggestions   for the first sentence would be fine, but I do have some concern about whether that might be read   as indicating that the Committee is going to act on bubbles, and that part of it makes me a little   cautious  However, in paragraph 4, I would not necessarily commit us to using tools for draining   reserves before raising the IOER rate and the funds rate target  I think this locks us in before we   know how effective these tools will be; nor would I commit to saying that we’re only   considering possible gradual sales of assets from our portfolio or that they would only occur after   we began to raise IOER rate  Based on our previous discussions, it’s not clear that these   sequencing decisions represent any conclusions or consensus of the Committee   I would note here that I believe to a large degree that President Kocherlakota’s view of   the functioning of financial markets is correct  In a market where longer-term and short-term   March 16, 2010 92 of 146    rates are integrated and where we have an appropriately functioning term structure, there may   not be much difference in the effect on longer-term interest rates of selling longer-term assets   versus the expectation effects of beginning to raise the IOER rate and, through expectations of a   tightening cycle, raising long-term rates; it’s not clear how those two pieces could fit together  I   think those are the kinds of interactions we need to explore as we think about our exit strategy   Let me turn briefly to alternative B, because I don’t think alternative C will be the   consensus here  As I’ve discussed in previous meetings, I like the idea of conveying that it is   monetary policy actions rather than structural features of the economy that influence inflation   over the longer run  Thus, I am strongly in favor of including the bracketed sentence in   paragraph 2  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
8966,2010-04-27,PLOSSER,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I will join the chorus of praise for the staff    This is a fascinating set of memos  I learned a lot, and it has stimulated a lot of thinking about   different things   My view is a kind of linear combination of perhaps 2, but probably 3 and 5  One of the   things that struck me about this memo, which has already been said, was the rather modest   effects of very rapid sales on the economy—not zero, but moderate—which leads me to have   more confidence that we can exit from this unusually large balance sheet perhaps more rapidly   than we might have thought  I say that because, again, my objective, like that of many others, is   April 27–28, 2010 40 of 206                   to reduce the size of the balance sheet and get its composition back to all-Treasuries  The   question then arises of what the pace should be and how we would go about doing that  I think   one of the debates about this relates particularly to the relationship between when we raise rates   and when we start selling assets, whenever that may be  I guess I would stress that we don’t   really know very much about how policy and the economy will respond as we raise the IOER   rate when we have a balance sheet with a trillion dollars of excess reserves   Our confidence in how monetary policy is going to work in that environment is highly   uncertain  So I think it behooves us to take seriously the option of trying to get the balance sheet   somewhat more in control before we begin to rely only on moving the funds rate target  That   could protect us from finding ourselves in a position somewhere down the road where we may   decide that we have to raise rates very rapidly, and shrink the balance sheet very rapidly, and   deal with all of the concomitant complications that that may pose for us  I think a more prudent   policy would be to begin earlier, so that we have more confidence in our ability to execute both a   funds rate policy and a shrinking of the balance sheet policy   I guess my views are partly a linear combination of President Kocherlakota’s, President   Bullard’s, and President Lacker’s  I am sympathetic to the notion that it’s a good idea to have   some conditionality in our ability to shrink the balance sheet  In particular, committing for five   years that this is the pace of our sales and then sticking with it seems to me to be perhaps unwise,   particularly when we don’t know the consequences of our funds rate policy in hitting our   monetary policy targets  I also think that if we have to raise interest rates very high, with high   excess reserves, we end up paying lots of money to the banking system in the short run, and I’m   not sure politically that’s going to look very good, either  I think there are good arguments for   not sequencing these things  I think you may have to take them jointly as we move forward   April 27–28, 2010 41 of 206                   I like the idea of committing to sell assets perhaps for an intermeeting period, or maybe   three months or so, and then having the option to reevaluate the pace at which we sell those   assets  But I would prefer, as in option 5, to make that pace more aggressive early  And if we   need to slow it down, we could choose to do that   I would also add that, in talk about the tightening of policy, I think we have to understand   that, as the economy continues to grow—whether or not we have met our dual mandate, which I   think it’s important to achieve—if we leave the funds rate where it is, we will actually be   creating more accommodative policy relative to where we were  So I think we have to be a little   careful in how we interpret our behavior here   Mr Chairman, the last question was about both communications and redemptions  On   communication, I think it is very important that at this meeting, either in the minutes or maybe   preferably in the statement, we make it clear that asset sales are in fact on the table, that they are   a tool of policy, that we desire to shrink the balance sheet over time and to return to an all-   Treasuries portfolio, and that at subsequent meetings this Committee will be further considering   the timing and pace of such sales  I think it’s very important that we make that as clear as we   possibly can   On Treasury redemptions, I’m somewhat ambivalent here  I would like to see Treasury   redemptions simply because it furthers my goal of shrinking the balance sheet  But I also have   some sympathy for the view that if we didn’t want to shrink the balance sheet quite as fast, then I   would prefer, as President Lacker suggested, that we roll non-Treasury redemptions over into   short-term Treasury bills, which would give us more flexibility going forward  I would be   amenable to such a strategy  Thank you, Mr Chairman   April 27–28, 2010 42 of 206                    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Economic activity continues to improve in   the Third District, and a sustainable recovery appears to be under way  Our general activity   index from our Business Outlook Survey of manufacturers has been in positive territory now for   the last eight months  The index rose from 189 to 202 in April  New orders, employment, and   hours worked indexes have also improved this month and seem to be at levels consistent with   typical economic recoveries  The prices paid index rose to 427, our highest level since August   2008  Perhaps more noteworthy, the index for prices received was also positive and now has   been positive for four out of the last five months  The last time we saw a string of positive   numbers for the prices received index was October of 2008  Future prices paid and prices   received indexes have also been rising for our manufacturing firms, and, as manufacturing picks   up, it seems to suggest that firms believe that they will be able to raise prices in the future   Residential construction has also improved in the region  Real estate agents tell us that   the pickup in March reflected seasonal increases and/or buyers taking advantage of the federal   tax credits set to expire at the end of April  They admit that it’s difficult to distinguish between   those two phenomena  Interestingly, one very large luxury national homebuilder told me this   week that he believes the national statistics on housing demand underestimate the strength of the   rebound  His selling pace for the last month is up 100 percent over last year  Many of the   buyers, of course, in this luxury market are higher-income households  Some did not qualify for   the tax rebate, and, given the higher price ranges he operates in, the tax credit probably   April 27–28, 2010 90 of 206                   represents a relatively small incentive for the customers who do qualify  But he said the tax   incentive may be helping these higher-end customers because it allows them to sell their older   homes and move up  The contact also mentioned the traffic through his show homes has been   rising very steadily, which he thinks bodes well for future sales, and he even mentioned that his   pricing power was improving significantly  This is the most upbeat conversation I’ve had with   this builder in three years  So it’s quite a change in his tune   Nonresidential construction appears to be in the tank, but stabilizing at a very low level    We have a little better performance than the nation as a whole, where the value of non-real estate   construction continues to decline  Our commercial real estate contacts indicate that, since the   time of our last meeting, leasing activity has remained slow, but vacancy rates have remained   steady for most types of commercial property, with the exception of some retail centers   Retail sales in the District were up in March compared with February and compared with   a year ago  However, special factors like early Easter and unfavorable weather may have   mushed the statistics between February and March   Although labor markets in the region remain weak, we are beginning to see some   improvement there as well  Payroll employment in our three states increased for the first three   months of the year ending in March, the first three-month increase in two years  The   unemployment rate held steady as increases in the labor force seemed to be offsetting   employment gains   Overall, business contacts in our region are coming to believe that we are in a sustainable   recovery  Consumer confidence in the mid-Atlantic region, while at relatively low levels, has   improved substantially over the last year, and future activity indexes from our manufacturing   survey are at high levels  So, cautious optimism seems to rule the day   April 27–28, 2010 91 of 206                   My view of the national economy is similar to what I see in the District  I have made   little change in my forecast since our January submission  I believe economic recovery began in   the middle of last year, and I have growing confidence that the recovery is on a sustainable path,   even as the effects of monetary and fiscal policy begin to wane  Conditions in financial markets   continue to support recovery at this point, as credit conditions are easing in the banking industry    Labor markets are improving  Consumption growth has been stronger than expected    Investment in equipment and software has been solidly expanding  I’m projecting GDP to grow   at around 3½ percent over the next two years, employment growth to pick up over the rest of this   year, and the unemployment rate to fall gradually over the forecast horizon  I think the risks   around my forecast are now tilted to the upside, not that there aren’t downside risks—there are   several and, as Vice Chairman Dudley emphasized, there may be others yet to come    Nevertheless, as we’ve received better than expected data, I think we also need to remember that   many of our baseline forecasts are considerably weaker than what historical correlations in the   data would suggest, given the depth of the recession from which the economy is now emerging    We could be overestimating the effects of headwinds in our baseline forecast  There are, after   all, mainly add factors to the underlying forecasts, not responses to the historical data  We seem   to be continuing to see the glass as half empty rather than half full, and I think we need to be   conscious of that   My inflation forecast continues to differ from the Greenbook, and I’m getting more   concerned that we may miss the signals to begin normalizing interest rate policy  In the near   term, I expect underlying inflation to remain very moderate, but I do expect it to begin to drift up   continually over the next two to three years, and I see upside risk to inflation in the medium to   longer term  While measures of core inflation are low, commodity prices have been rising  The   April 27–28, 2010 92 of 206                   future price indexes in our manufacturing survey are firming, again suggesting that firms believe   that they will have some pricing power as the recovery continues   I continue to believe that we will need to raise the federal funds rate in the second half of   this year, well before early 2012 as anticipated in the Greenbook  My forecast assumes that the   funds rate will reach 1 to 1½ percent by the end of this year, still very low levels by historical   standards  Our statement now conditions changes in the funds rate on some economic   conditions, and the factors cited are inflation expectations, resource utilization, which is difficult   to measure as I have discussed, and actual inflation  All of those are backward-looking statistics   in my mind  As I’ve indicated in earlier meetings, I prefer to benchmark policy on aggressive   responses to movements in inflation relative to target and, to the extent it responds to real   activity, responses to measures of changes in activity or changes in the unemployment gap  In   my view, the focus on growth rates of output and employment gives us a better chance of staying   ahead of the curve rather than falling behind it  By the time of our next meeting, I expect we will   have experienced four quarters of fairly strong output growth and at least one quarter of   reasonable employment growth   This means that the economy’s underlying equilibrium real rate of interest will be rising,   as it has been  If we don’t begin to adjust policy in response to such growth and rising real rates,   we will implicitly be increasing the degree of accommodation, not just holding it constant  As   shown in chart 6 of the Bluebook on page 27, the current real federal funds rate is now at the   bottom of the range of the four model-based estimates of the equilibrium funds rate  Thus, if   these trends continue, we will begin to need to normalize the funds rate   Now, of course, some may argue that having more accommodation by holding rates fixed   is desirable because of the zero bound  That’s true, but that’s different from a statement that says   April 27–28, 2010 93 of 206                   we’re tightening  But it also seems to me that we made some extraordinary moves in terms of   our large-scale asset purchases and quantitative easing in response to the zero bound  So I think   it becomes increasingly difficult to assess the stance of policy at the zero bound, but nonetheless,   the signals should be moving us towards a normalization  I want to say “normalization” to   underscore the fact that a 0 to a ¼ percent fed funds rate is not normal policy, as we all know    We took a number of extraordinary policy actions to help stave off the crisis  We opened special   liquidity facilities, we purchased housing agency securities and long-term Treasuries, and we   took the funds rate to zero  Now that financial markets’ functioning is improved, we have closed   many of the liquidity facilities  Similarly, as substantial economic growth and recovery   continue, it will be time to take the initial steps in normalizing interest rates and moving the   funds rate away from the zero bound   I view asset sales in the same way  We described our purchases of agency debt in MBS   as credit-easing  We were intervening because intermediation in housing finance was severely   impaired  The market is now functioning much better, and the Fed no longer needs to serve as   an intermediary in housing finance  Thus it’s time for us to begin to shed those assets from our   portfolio and return to a more normal composition and size  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I believe that a sustained economic   recovery is, in fact, under way  I believe that economic growth risks, as I stated earlier, are   slightly to the upside, and inflation risks are tilted to the upside over the medium to longer term    I think we have to recognize that unemployment, C&I lending, and commercial real estate   lending are all historically lagging indicators to the economy, not leading indicators  And I   April 27–28, 2010 141 of 206                   anticipate that, as the economy gains strength, those indicators will recover, as they normally do   during a cyclical recovery   Thus, I think it is time for taking initial steps to normalize interest rates and the size and   composition of our balance sheet  I think that time is rapidly approaching  It’s not too soon, I   think, to consider changes in our statement language to prepare the public and the markets for an   eventual start of our exit from this period of extraordinary policy accommodation  We have   exited from our extraordinary liquidity facilities, and I think we should prepare to exit from our   extraordinary balance sheet policies   I view the start of moving rates up from zero or selling assets from our portfolio not   necessarily as a tightening of policy in the usual sense but as a step towards normalization of   policy, in the same way that unwinding our liquidity facilities was a step towards normalization    With the size of our balance sheet, with interest rates near zero, policy will remain   accommodative for some time to come, well after we begin the normalization process    Moreover, as I said earlier, by the time of our next meeting, we will have experienced four   quarters of fairly strong output growth, according to the forecast, at least one additional quarter   of employment growth, and, from my perspective, that means the underlying equilibrium real   rates of interest will be rising  If we don’t adjust policy in response to such growth, we will   implicitly be increasing the degree of accommodation, not just holding it constant  As I   mentioned earlier, some may be perfectly happy with letting policy become more   accommodative in this manner  But we should acknowledge that that’s our intention, not suggest   that we don’t want to tighten   Once again, I’m in favor of alternative C  I think it’s time for us seriously to consider   backing away from our “extended period” language  The longer we maintain it, I think, the more   April 27–28, 2010 142 of 206                   difficult it’s going to become for us to unwind from it  We could consider using language such   as the Bank of Canada did in its last meeting, where the time for extraordinary low rates “is   passing”—maybe not past, but passing  So I favor including something like paragraph 4 in   alternative C into B, which I suspect will be our choice here, which indicates the Committee will   be using asset sales to begin restoring the balance sheet to a more normal size and composition    But the timing and pace of those sales will be contingent on the economic outlook   The majority of the Committee, I’m sure, will prefer alternative B to C  But, in that case,   I would like to make sure that the statement includes the message that asset sales are, in fact, on   the table  We may not be ready for them yet, but they are an important tool for our exit  Thus, I   do support moving ahead with redemptions of Treasuries  I understand, Mr Chairman, that we   may want to wait another period, but I think that would be the first step we could take, and a   modest one at that, to emphasize our efforts to shrink our balance sheet   Finally, I would hope we could get to further discussions of our longer-term operating   framework, including our operating target, how long we think we will want to be on a floor   system, and whether we’re going to have a corridor system or continue on the floor system  I   think those decisions have important implications for how we approach the shrinking of our   balance sheet as we go forward  I hope we can continue to have a discussion of that to help   guide those decisions about our exit and our communication strategies as we exit  Thank you,   Mr Chairman    Surprise, I would think that would be a good move  "
8991,2010-05-09,PLOSSER,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I have just a quick question  Can you   review for us, Nathan or Brian, the terms of these swaps and the maturities that we’re   considering?    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’d like to go back to Jeff’s point about   sterilization for a minute  I’m wondering about the optics  If the ECB announces that its   interventions in these markets are going to be sterilized, and we, on the other hand, say we’re not   going to sterilize, in effect we’re doing quantitative easing in the United States, whereas they are,   in fact, resisting by sterilizing their own intervention in the other markets  So I’m a little bit   curious about the imbalance in how we’re going to treat that  It sort of goes back to Jeff’s   May 9, 2010 18 of 42             original question  I think it’s a difficult question  Do we want to be easing here on behalf of the   Europeans in that case?    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’m broadly supportive as well  I think this   is something that we need to do  I would just stress two points  I think the discussion we’ve had   up to now about transparency is incredibly important  I agree that we should make the contracts   available, if we can  Explaining this as carefully as we can is in our own best interest at this   point and helps protect us not only on the political side but on other sides as well  I also hope   that we will continue to have further discussion at some point about the issue of sterilization—  where we stand and how we want to think about that as we go forward  We don’t know what the   amounts are going to end up being, and it may partly depend on how we think about that  With   those two stipulations, I agree mostly with what President Dudley said, namely that we’re   attacking a symptom, not a root cause of the problem—Europe has to deal with that—but we   need to cooperate where we can  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
9016,2010-06-22,PLOSSER,"  I’d just like to emphasize that I kind of agree with President Lacker and   President Hoenig here  I don’t see any reason why we cannot just unwind this position, sell our   claims to these 55s to somebody else, and get out from it, and explain that given the short supply   of these securities and the demands out there for them, that this is a technical operation  I think   we can do this without aggravating the situation or engendering the belief that this is the   beginning of a more aggressive selling campaign  Given the number of fails, $800 billion—I   June 22–23, 2010 18 of 213             think I remember we’ve got about $9 billion in these securities, so it’s a relatively small volume   here    Yes, right That’s what I meant, the $9 billion that hasn’t settled  My   understanding is that we’ve got an awful lot of the 5s and 55s on our balance sheet already  So I   would really be in favor of not doing the swaps but of unwinding the position and putting them   back out in the market  That’s my view  Thank you     Excuse me, I don’t quite understand  There are two sides to that   transaction  You’re doing a swap to get rid of those 55s in exchange for the 45s    What we’re saying is, why don’t we just do one side of that transaction?    I guess what I’m saying is  Why isn’t there a market price for that as   well?     I’ll stand by his answer  That’s a good one    My question is related to that as well  I was looking at options 2 and 3   and trying to figure something out  From the memo, it looked as if the way you got the volume   of bills that you held in 2 was driven exactly by the matching up of the auction dates, and that’s   how you got to the mix of bills and lower coupons in 2 versus 3, or in 2    So, under option 2, the $68 billion of bills is likely to be the maximum   amount of bills that you could purchase under that strategy?    Okay  Thank you    Thank you very much, Mr Chairman I’ll try to be brief  Let me just   cut to the chase about what I’m thinking about this  I think one of the things that we did learn   June 22–23, 2010 29 of 213             last time from the memos was that the process of sales in terms of its macroeconomic impact was   going to be modest, particularly if the sales were gradual and at a measured pace   Consistent with those four principles, one of the things that we haven’t emphasized in our   communication, though, is a pre-commitment to the mix of what the balance sheet looks like    We’ve done something, but we haven’t committed to the observation that that mix is going to   remain fixed over time  In fact, it obviously is changing some because of our redemption   policies on MBS  When I look at these two proposals on the MBS swap, as President Lacker   suggested, the MBS swap amounts to a sale of the 55s and a purchase of the 45s, in effect  So   that is a sale and it is a purchase, in effect  I’m thinking, though, that maybe to help normalize   our balance sheet in terms of the mix, selling the 55s and purchasing Treasuries would keep the   balance sheet the same, but just says we’re buying Treasuries instead of buying MBS to replace   those   That leads me to thinking about the Treasury redemption strategy, and I am comfortable   with option 2  I think that’s a sensible strategy and it’s consistent with our goal to normalize our   balance sheet and get the maturity structure down  My preference would be to have a little more   shorter-term assets in the mix than what option 2 offers, but, given the constraints that we face   for the foreseeable future, at least, maybe that’s not feasible, and trying to match what’s available   in the marketplace would be best  Because we haven’t made a commitment to the public or   talked much about what the mix of the portfolio looks like, I think my preference is to forgo the   opportunity to purchase extra MBS or purchase the 45s instead of the 55s, let the 55s go, take   that resource and invest it in short-term Treasuries in line with option 2 of the staff’s memo    Thank you, Mr Chairman    Can I just ask one clarifying question of Brian?  If we were to hold the   55s, given that they have large prepayment risks, what’s the anticipated duration of those   securities?  In other words, if you replaced them with Treasuries of similar duration—this goes   back to what President Lacker said—what would they be?  Five years, seven years, four years?    Because of prepayment?    So if you replaced those with Treasuries, you’d be looking at Treasury   durations of three to five years, presumably  Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Since our last meeting, economic activity   continued to show modest gains in the Third District across most of our sectors  Residential real   estate is the exception  Our contacts say there has been a distinct softening in activity since the   end of the tax credits, and builders report that they do not expect construction activity to pick up   much this summer  However, the tax credit clearly pulls sales forward, so it may take several   months before we will be able to make a more informed assessment of the housing market  On a   positive note, foreclosures and mortgage delinquency rates in our states are showing signs of   moderating and are considerably below those of many other states that enjoyed bigger booms   and are now suffering sharper busts   Payroll employment in the three-state region increased during the three-month period   ending in April, and the region’s unemployment rate remained unchanged at 93 percent for the   third consecutive month  However, the number of unemployed people fell in April for the first   time since the start of the recession  Temporary Census workers have contributed to payroll   employment growth in the District since February  One contact, however, from a large national   June 22–23, 2010 77 of 213             placement company, said that orders for temporary workers were up sharply, perhaps reflecting   some substitution from temporary private sector jobs into the Census jobs  However,   employment gains are likely to be slow  The employment index in our business outlook survey   of manufacturers turned negative in June for the first time in seven months  In May, we asked a   special question about hiring plans  Nearly 59 percent of the firms said they expect to increase   production in the next six months, but only 30 percent expected to hire additional workers to do   it  The others plan to increase hours worked of current staff  Important reasons cited by firms   for not hiring were concerns about future employment costs, including health care and taxes, and   uncertainty about future product demand   Manufacturing activity remained positive in June  However, our index of general activity   fell from 214 in May to 8 in June  That is its lowest level since turning positive in September of   2009  However, underlying that, new orders and shipments remained strongly positive, at levels   consistent with typical economic recoveries  Prices remained subdued  For manufacturers, the   index of prices received fell but remained positive in June, while the prices paid index actually   turned negative for this month  In addition, manufacturing firms’ expectations for price   increases over the next six months have fallen for the last two months  Retailers report mostly   flat selling prices   Overall, the optimistic tone from my District contacts has moderated somewhat since our   last meeting  However, the general outlook continues to be for modest gains in most sectors, and   our leading indicators constructed for our remaining states have remained positive for the last   five months   My view of the national economy is similar to what we see in the District  The troubles   in the euro zone have raised the risk around my forecast, and I have shaved my forecast for   June 22–23, 2010 78 of 213             economic growth for this year by a tenth or two and raised my unemployment path somewhat   over the horizon  I have also shaded down my inflation forecast for this year, reflecting weak   numbers that we have seen so far  However, I expect inflation to increase gradually over the   forecast horizon   I believe that we do have a sustainable economic recovery, and that that remains the most   likely outcome, while acknowledging that the troubles in Europe represent a cloud for that   forecast  I am projecting GDP growth of around 3½ percent over the next two years,   employment growth picking up over the rest of this year, and the unemployment rate falling   gradually over the forecast horizon  Data on hours worked are strong, are improving, and private   demand for temporary workers remains an encouraging sign for future employment gains  My   baseline forecast already incorporates weaker growth than what the historical correlations in the   data would suggest, given the depth of this recession  The upside risk that I had in the last   forecast is now balanced by the downside risk to growth from the fiscal strains in Europe  So,   though at the last meeting I thought the risks were tilted to the upside, now they’re balanced from   my perspective   My inflation forecast continues to differ from the Tealbook  In the near term, I expect   underlying inflation rates to remain subdued, but I expect inflation to drift up gradually over the   next couple of years, especially if we make no move to raise rates until the summer of 2012, as   in the Tealbook  I continue to believe that we will need to begin raising the fed funds rate in the   second half of this year, as the growth rate of the economy, and, therefore, the underlying real   rate of interest, begin to pick up, if we are to keep inflation and inflation expectations well   anchored  My underlying assumption of appropriate monetary policy in my forecast is that the   June 22–23, 2010 79 of 213             funds rates will reach about 1 percent by the end of this year, still very low by historical   standards, and rise slowly thereafter  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Can I ask a technical question about the dollar rolls and the swaps?    How many other issues are pending in that same category? How big is the backlog, in some   sense, of this?  Are we going to anticipate having to face this every ten days or every two weeks,   or—    So what’s the size of the 5s?    Okay  Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Despite the talk around the table, I think the   modal forecast for most of us is that a sustained, modest recovery is continuing, although the   forecasts have been tempered ever so slightly—not substantially at this point  There clearly are   upside and downside risks to that forecast  In my own case, as I mentioned yesterday, at the last   meeting I did see the risks tilted to the upside, because I felt that the recovery was proceeding   and because historical correlations suggested that it ought to be stronger than we were seeing  I   now treat them as balanced, so I changed the balance of risks  But I don’t think that’s a cause for   changing policy at this point   I’m actually quite worried  Several others have touched on this, and President Lockhart   just alluded to this—part of our job is thinking about the what-ifs  What-ifs can almost paralyze   you in making policy decisions  I think we have to be very careful to resist allowing that   paralysis to set in  Given the nature of the discussion around the table, I’m also somewhat   concerned that the minutes not show a terribly bleak picture  Considering that we haven’t   June 22–23, 2010 149 of 213             changed our forecast that much, painting a bleak picture of the uncertainty and risks around   Europe and the euro zone could actually be detrimental to our cause and create uncertainty and a   lack of confidence in the economy as a whole  So I think we have to be careful not to talk only   about the downside risks and the problems that might happen, but rather to focus on what our   forecasts in fact do say  And, speaking of forecasts, I’d like to reinforce President Bullard’s   point about appropriate monetary policy under the assumptions  Certainly, in my own forecast,   while I have inflation contained, I probably have a very different forecast of the underlying   interest rate and appropriate policy than many others might have around the table  So I think we   need to be careful about that   I also share President Lacker’s view about the composition of our balance sheet—I think   our MBS holdings present important political risks to us going forward  I think the longer we   maintain large holdings of those, the more we reinforce the expectation that that’s the   appropriate role of monetary policy, and we’ll be subject to pressure on that going forward  We   bought those—as has been emphasized several times, and President Kocherlakota has made this   point—at a time when markets were in fact dysfunctional  And while there might have been a   good reason for doing it at that time, I think it’s less clear that that’s necessary in the current   environment     Yesterday we discussed option 2 for redeeming Treasuries and moving to a shorter-term   duration of our Treasury portfolio, even though we may be maintaining the size of our balance   sheet  I think that it’s important for us to continue that discussion and that it will be helpful for   you to lay the groundwork in your July testimony for the beginning of that message  So I would   encourage us to continue to pursue that  I think we have some real challenges ahead of us, but I   just want to emphasize that, despite the risks, our forecast is still in place  And we need to   June 22–23, 2010 150 of 213             continue our planning about how we will unwind ourselves from still extraordinary policy   accommodation   I think we have to be very careful not to fool ourselves into a false sense of precision   about the magnitude of actions that we take  Our ability to predict the effect on aggregate   demand, or unemployment rates, from a move of 10 or 20 basis points, in reaction to either an   asset sale or a decision on our part, is remarkably imprecise and completely unknown  After all,   the 10-year Treasury note has fallen almost 50 basis points in the last two months, with no action   on our part  Given that we have so little ability to predict these effects, I think we shouldn’t tie   our hands, worrying excessively about those sorts of moves  I think President Hoenig was   correct that we need to keep our focus on the long-term consequences of our actions  And while   the short term is surely important, again, we must not sacrifice the long term for the short term    That’s what central banks are for and what monetary policy ought to be focused on   I can live with alternative B at this point  I do have one observation about the language,   and that’s in paragraph 2  I share President Bullard’s concern about using slack as the primary   variable that policymakers look at  I’ve talked about that for at least two years now, so I won’t   mention it any more  But I would say I’m puzzled by the insertion of the first sentence in   paragraph 2 about energy prices  I don’t know why we want to bring that into this discussion    I’d be perfectly happy just to leave the statement as it was last time  Our ability to pick and   choose certain relative prices over others to throw into the statement, to try to explain what’s   going on, seems to me not very productive  So I would just as soon get rid of that first sentence   and leave it as it was before  And that’s my only suggestion  Thank you, Mr Chairman   "
9041,2010-08-10,PLOSSER,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Good morning  The Third District looks a   lot like the nation, so, rather than talking specifically about the District, I’m going to talk about   the national picture broadly  As we’ve heard, incoming data have suggested that the recovery   may have lost some of its momentum  Whether this is just the summer doldrums or whether this   heralds much worse times ahead is difficult to determine   Although the outlook may have become more uncertain, I continue to place high odds on   the recovery continuing at a modest pace over the medium term  In my own view, I think it’s   premature to read the data as evidence that we’re heading towards a double-dip recession or a   serious retrenchment  Financial conditions have actually improved, as we were just saying, since   the last meeting, and perhaps we should note it in our statement  The markets also seem to be   functioning normally for the most part  Monetary policy and financial conditions are very   accommodative, and there appears to be ample liquidity in the system  Treasury yields are now   August 10, 2010 23 of 160             3 percent and have fallen by 30 to 50 basis points since our June meeting and by more than   100 basis points since April  Stock prices are up, reflective of better than expected earnings at   many firms  And, as we have just been noting, initial steps taken in European countries to   address their fiscal imbalances and the results of the stress test seem to have helped quell some   of the fears about tail risks   While the new data suggest that economic growth is likely to moderate in the second half   of the year, it’s good to remember, as the staff noted, that recoveries are not always linear  Some   of the weakness in monthly data was expected  For example, the housing tax credit pulled home   sales forward, so the weakening in sales after it expired was not a surprise, nor should it have   been  It will take a couple more readings, in my mind, before we have a better sense of whether   the forecast of a gradual improvement in housing activity needs to be revised  Temporary hiring   of students has also obscured the employment picture, and here, too, I believe, we need a few   more months of data before the underlying employment trends reveal themselves   Overall, the staff has marked down modestly its forecast for the second half of 2010 by   approximately ½ percentage point, and yet the forecast for 2011 has not changed  The forecast   is, thus, for a transitory soft patch, not a falling off the cliff  I would also note that the staff’s   forecast of inflation was revised up very slightly  Such a change in the forecast hardly suggests   to me the need for a policy response, which might be interpreted by markets to mean that much   more aggressive accommodation is on the way   There’s no question that the improvement in the labor market has been slow and less than   desirable, but, given the size and nature of the shocks that have hit the economy, that slow pace   has been part of everyone’s forecast for some time  Real adjustments need to take place  It will   take time for a reallocation of workers from the shrinking housing and finance sectors to go into   August 10, 2010 24 of 160             other sectors, for skill mismatches that are rampant—driven by productivity increases in firms or   the depreciation of skills from the long-term unemployed—to be resolved  One has to ask   whether monetary policy is the right tool to address these issues   At the same time, monetary policy is the right tool to use against sustained deflation, and   I certainly support a dialogue on policy approaches one can take to address such a situation    However, as I have argued at previous meetings, I believe it is premature to conclude that we are   headed toward sustained deflation  Nominal GDP has been growing at an annual rate of more   than 4 percent over the last three quarters  In contrast, in Japan’s lost decade, nominal GDP   growth was zero  Inflation is at a low level, but some measures, like the core CPI, have actually   accelerated in the last three months  Not all components are decelerating  We actually have seen   very large changes in relative prices caused by a very large shock to this economy  As the   economy restructures, I think that we will see the threat of deflation diminish   Nevertheless, in this environment we need to monitor inflation expectations quite   carefully  On this score, there is a degree of comfort  Despite the weaker inflation numbers,   inflation expectations appear to be relatively well-anchored  Measures based on TIPS, especially   at the shorter horizon, are down somewhat since the first quarter, but have been relatively stable   recently  Analysis by the New York Fed’s Market Group indicates that deflation probabilities   based on TIPS have moved little in the past month and remain significantly lower; that is, the   probability of deflation is significantly lower than it was at the end of 2008 and the beginning of   2009  Survey measures of inflation expectations have also been relatively stable  The   preliminary results of our SPF which will be announced next Friday, show that the 10-year   forecasts or inflation expectations changed ever so slightly, from 24 to 23 percent, down   01 percentage point  The SPF’s probability of deflation for both the core CPI and the core PCE   August 10, 2010 25 of 160             are both minuscule—less than 3 percent—again, considerably below the levels that we saw in   2009   I’m also concerned that the press and market commentators may be overreacting to the   incoming data on both real activity and prices, and we should not allow ourselves to be   stampeded into a panic  We know our data are subject to revision  For example, in recent   research, Dean Croushore shows that, on average, revisions to the PCE inflation rate have been   upward over the last decade  Recall that in May 2003, when the FOMC began citing the   possibility of unwelcome substantial fall in inflation, the data suggested that inflation had been   falling since mid-2000  However, by December 2003, most of that decline had been revised   away, and, just a few years later, the revised data showed that there was no decline at all but that   inflation actually rose during that period  Of course, there are cases where data on growth or   prices or output are revised in the other direction   My point is that our forecasts are data-dependent, and the data are revised  Our forecast   will be revised as well  So we need to remember that recoveries are uneven and hard to predict,   and that there are considerable error bands around our forecast and around the data we currently   observe  Our actions and policies should be a source of stability for the longer term, and, given   the uncertainties, we should avoid reacting to high-frequency changes in the data that may prove   either transitory or in some cases illusory  As you can tell, I’m in favor of no change in our   statement or in our policy today at this meeting, and I’ll have more to say about my reasons for   that in the next go-around  I might note that I’m disappointed that alternative B2 was removed   from the table last night as an option  Thank you very much, Mr Chairman    I’ll talk more about that later    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I walked in this morning, and my ID didn’t   work anymore  [Laughter]  So I wondered whether this was a signal that it was time for me to   move on  They got it fixed, so maybe there’s hope for me yet   I do not believe we should change policy at this meeting, and changing our reinvestment   strategy is a change in policy  The language in the statement, from my perspective, does not   clarify why we are doing so or what we think it will accomplish  Are we changing policy to   pump up the economy and reduce the unemployment rate, as the newspapers will suggest?  Or   are we trying to guard against a deflationary risk?  Our inability to communicate our rationale   and our expectations clearly merely adds to the already high level of uncertainty in our economy   August 10, 2010 107 of 160             about fiscal policy and other things  We must not let ourselves be stampeded by the markets into   taking an action, and we must take charge of what their expectations are of our action   I have become increasingly concerned that we are trying to use monetary policy to   address some very serious problems that are driving us away from our goals but that monetary   policy is ill-equipped to solve  A number of us have stressed the nature of the very devastating   shocks that have hit this economy—for example, shocks to employment and to bank lending—  and the uncertainty it has engendered about the future  Monetary policy cannot solve those   problems by itself   I’ve stressed that our forecast for 2011 has hardly changed at all since January of this   year  As President Lacker pointed out, the Tealbook’s forecast for 2010 hasn’t changed much   since earlier in the year, if my memory serves me correctly  As President Hoenig stressed,   policy should be focused on the intermediate- to longer-term trends  And despite the recent data   and weak numbers, the forecasts for those longer-term trends have not budged very much over   the course of the year   I think Governor Kohn raised a very important point when he said, “We need to ask   ourselves why the real economy hasn’t responded more aggressively to our extraordinary   willingness to act and provide accommodation” We don’t fully understand the answer  So, what   makes us think that making marginal changes in our reinvestment rate is going to have any effect   on this very weak economy?  It’s the sort of fine-tuning mentality that I thought we gave up in   the 1970s  I think the hope must be that, by changing something at the margin today, we are   changing expectations that we are going to be much more aggressive in the future  And, yet, the   longer-term forecast hasn’t changed that much  So what is the justification for sending a signal   where we think expectations are going to drive us to do a lot more than these fine-tuning moves?   August 10, 2010 108 of 160             According to the staff estimates, switching the reinvestment strategy is supposed to   reduce longer-term rates by maybe 15 to 20 basis points, if that much  Longer-term yields are   already at near record lows and down more than four times that much just in the last three   months and just twice that much since the last meeting  As Bill English indicated, I am doubtful   that we would get much of an effect from our reinvestment policy  Those effects were estimated   in a period where the markets were impaired and disrupted, and I think markets are no longer   impaired and disrupted, so I suspect the effect is going to be even less  In any case, do we   seriously believe that moving the IOER rate down 10 basis points, or the longer-run rate down   10 basis points, is going to make any difference for this recovery over the next two quarters?    Why do something that is not likely to help in any measurable way?   Moreover, from my view, such steps, which resemble the fine-tuning strategies of the   past, are going to increase the public’s expectation that monetary policy can solve all our   economic ills, damaging our credibility regarding our ability to solve the challenges that we can   in fact address  Households and businesses, as painful as it is, have real adjustments to make in   response to the shocks we’ve experienced  Those adjustments will take time  They are painful,   but monetary policy cannot speed that adjustment appreciably   Our actions also have potential costs  Because they’re likely to have little effect on the   real economy in the near term, they will make us look impotent and put our credibility at risk at a   crucial moment  Suppose inflation does turn out to be a serious risk?  To combat it, we will need   as much credibility as we can get, because, without that credibility, our policies will be much   less effective in changing inflationary expectations  My view is that acting now to alter our   reinvestment policy marginally will be seen primarily as an effort to boost the real economy and   August 10, 2010 109 of 160             lower unemployment, and it will fail  If we need to act more boldly to address deflation   problems later, we will also be seen as not credible and potentially ineffective   To me, the cost-benefit analysis of this sort of marginal move is not justified  If I were   convinced the economy is currently at risk of sustained deflation—and I want to state that I’m a   long way from being convinced of that—I would support taking aggressive action, perhaps   purchasing large amounts of Treasury securities or moving away from the zero lower bound , as   President Kocherlakota suggested  But, in that case, we would need to explain in a direct and   transparent way what we were doing and why we were taking these actions, and that we were   doing so to guard against deflationary outcomes and to anchor expectations  Confusing that   message by allowing the public to believe we’re trying to shape the unemployment rate over the   next two quarters seems to me to be the height of craziness   For those who like to think of policy-setting in a risk-management environment,   marginally reducing interest rates now wouldn’t seem to buy us much insurance against tail   risks  If we thought sustained deflation were an issue, it would seem that we would need to take   much stronger actions to combat it, but I don’t think we are there yet  Some may also think that   we should change our policy to prevent our balance sheet from a mild contraction, yet we have   never communicated to the markets that the precise makeup or size of our balance sheet was   something that we were targeting  Some of us actually tried to argue that earlier on, but we were   unable to come up with a way to articulate what the size of our balance sheet should be   In fact, what we have done is stressed, to the contrary, that this increase in our balance   sheet was done to address credit impairments  If we’re now going to argue for a balance sheet   target, we should clearly communicate what those arguments are and why our target is what it is    August 10, 2010 110 of 160             This would be a huge communication challenge and, at this juncture, likely to create more   confusion and uncertainty than the benefits are likely to provide   I also fear that taking steps today runs the risk of conveying to the markets a sense of   desperation; in addition, as I said earlier, I fear that it will create expectations of much more   aggressive actions later on that may turn out not to be warranted  Thus, any change today may   set in motion a set of expectations about future actions that we may come to regret, especially if   the action fails to provide any useful relief to the unemployment picture in the near term   This Committee has demonstrated over the last two years a willingness to act boldly   when the data tell us to act  I think this proposal is a wimpy response to data that don’t require   action  Given the uncertainties of our forecast, reacting with a change in policy today to small   and potentially transitory changes in our outlook strikes me to be the epitome of fine-tuning   hubris  Thus, I was in favor of B2, “B classic,” and I’m still in favor of it  I’m unhappy that it   was removed  I don’t believe that the current B, even if you took out paragraph 4, is a substitute   for what I thought was B2   We are currently not reinvesting payments on MBS, and I’m not in favor of changing our   MBS redemption strategy at this time  I have repeatedly argued that I would like to move the   composition of our balance sheet towards Treasuries, so I would like to reduce our MBS   portfolio holdings  We hold a large share of that market and have already had trouble executing   purchases we’ve undertaken  To me, standing pat and making as few changes in our signals to   the public as possible is the right decision for today, based on both the economics and the   communication challenges that it engenders  Any changes, I believe, are fraught with risks and   the potential for misinterpretation  Thus, while I am not a voting member at this meeting, Mr   August 10, 2010 111 of 160             Chairman, I respectfully say that if we adopt version B, as written, with paragraph 4, and if I   were a voting member, I would dissent  Thank you  "
9064,2010-09-21,PLOSSER,"  Let me just make one or two comments  I think this is an important   issue, because it’s about transparency—it’s about making sure that the minutes reflect the range   of the discussion  Mr Chairman, you’re correct, that, given the turnover in members, oftentimes   the differences in views between members and participants aren’t that great  This time happened   to be more unusual in that regard   September 21, 2010 4 of 151             I understand the longstanding tradition of focusing the policy paragraph on why the   members chose to do what they did  Because we distinguish between members and participants   in other sections of the minutes, I’m not convinced particularly that you can’t carry out a similar   strategy in that paragraph, talking about what members said, what participants said, and then at   the end noting that the members decided “X”  The alternative would be, I would think, to   expand the economic go-round, where you do talk a lot about members and participants  You   could open that section up more to policy discussions between members and participants, even if   you kept the policy paragraph focused on the members   I think we ought to be able to find a way to make sure that this long tradition of   distinguishing between what members and participants say gets incorporated, because,   otherwise, I do worry that down the road somebody is going to look at the transcripts and the   minutes and find a disconnect, and I don’t think that would serve us well  So I would encourage   continued work on this, and I think we ought to have some process that ensures that this happens   in some way  Those are my comments    Oh, is that right?    I stand corrected then   September 21, 2010 5 of 151              Thank you, Mr Chairman, again, for responding    Dave, I appreciate your discussion  These are very challenging times   for forecasting, but I’ll ask the question I often ask  You’ve revised your forecast down, and   you’ve shaped it by the incoming data, but how much of it was driven by your model and how   much of it was due to add factors and judgmental factors that you added into the forecast at this   point?    Thank you    I’d just like to follow up, because I think the Chairman’s point is a   better way of getting at what I was trying to say  We use this notion—and forecasters use it—of   momentum carrying forward and persistence  Some of that persistence is inherent in the way   you write the structural model down  Some of it is based on assumptions about what the shocks   themselves are doing over time  Time-series models and time-series variations in GDP growth   September 21, 2010 25 of 151             from quarter to quarter are pretty volatile  There’s some persistence, but the serial correlation is   not huge in terms of growth rates  The Chairman’s question was about the nature of the   persistence of the residuals  Is it an estimated parameter, or is it something that you’re just   assuming?    You made him take off his glasses  [Laughter]    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Business conditions in the Third District   have changed very little since our last meeting  There continues to be an uneven pattern of   incoming data that has been established during the course of the summer  The outlook among   business contacts is still positive but has not improved much since our last meeting; but neither   has there been much further weakening in their outlook  Nonetheless, sentiment is cautious in   most sectors  Retail activity actually showed some strength in the intermeeting period, and   manufacturing fell slightly  Our BOS general activity index came in negative in August for the   first time, after nearly a year of being positive  There was a slight rebound in September, but   that only suggests that regional manufacturing was essentially flat but not necessarily declining   very much   The incoming data at the national level indicate that the pace of recovery was tepid   during the summer, but recent industrial production and consumer spending reports have   modestly surprised to the upside  This may signal that the end of the summer may correspond to   the low point of this soft patch rather than an imminent return to recession  This prediction,   September 21, 2010 27 of 151             obviously, must be tempered by reports of ongoing weakness in the labor market, continuing   retrenchment in the housing market, and reports of weak real activity from a few of our contacts   Business leaders continue to stress that the cost of health care reform and other costs are   obstacles to hiring  For example, they are concerned about significant increases in   unemployment insurance premiums that the states will have to impose to replenish their UI trust   funds  Let me also note that labor market activity tends to lag in recoveries, and problems in the   housing market are likely related to permanent changes in fundamentals rather than the results of   transitory factors  Banks and other financial institutions indicate that hiring, however, is   concentrated in compliance officers, legal help, and technology people to meet regulatory rules   and their costs   Monetary policy has been exceptionally accommodative for more than two years  There   is a generous supply of liquidity available for financial markets to support real activity    Moreover, the financial markets appear to be in good working order  The incoming information   suggested that fewer instances of credit demand going unsatisfied are out there   The labor market is still, of course, the major concern to us all  Unemployment is much   too high and is the cause of real pain and suffering in the US economy  However, private   payroll employment growth has been positive since the first of the year, and, in my view, the   current state of the labor market is an example of a problem that is not amenable to future   monetary policy accommodation  I believe that the sources of the slow adjustment in labor   markets are more about persistent supply and wealth shocks, requiring worker reallocations both   across time and across space, as well as disparities between skills in demand and workers who   are likely to be available  No doubt, aggregate demand is one source of the currently high   September 21, 2010 28 of 151             unemployment rate  But the role that fundamentals have played in the run-up of the   unemployment rate, and its persistence, in my view, looms large and has been underestimated   I am looking forward to our discussion of these issues in January, and I think it may be   presumptuous of us to take further action without having that thorough discussion before going   forward  While my current view is that monetary policy has limited ability to improve the pace   of this recovery further, I do believe that deflation is a potential problem that monetary policy   can, in fact, solve  I say “potential,” because I see little evidence to suggest that sustained   deflation is a serious risk   To update my statement from our previous meeting, nominal GDP growth was about zero   in Japan during most of the lost decade of the 1990s  For the last year, the United States has   witnessed nominal GDP growth of about 4 percent or a little less  Overall, inflation has slowed   somewhat since the beginning of the year  Over the last three months, the commodity   component of the CPI has grown at 2¾ percent  The durable goods prices in the CPI have grown   at 21 percent, and the services component is up only about 9 percent  To me, this does not   suggest a serious threat of sustained deflation going forward   I continue to believe that the odds are great that the recovery will remain at a moderate   pace over the medium term  I think this forecast is consistent with the Board staff lowering its   forecast for real growth by a little less than 05 percentage point   All in all, I think recoveries are never smooth  Also, I want to stress that the data we use   to infer the state of the economy are subject to revision and are highly volatile  I agree with the   Board staff that the data available since our last meeting have yielded only marginal increases in   the probability of another recession, since we are now out of the last one, let alone serious   retrenchment  Growth in the US economy has slowed in the past several months, but it is not   September 21, 2010 29 of 151             negative  It seems to me that, without an unexpectedly large shock, persistent negative growth   going forward seems unlikely  I think it best to wait and see the path of the economy for the rest   of the year, including the year-end holiday season, before considering additional steps, whose   effects may be highly dubious at best  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  My policy preference today is to introduce   as few changes as possible in our policy statement  I think the statement needs to continue to   convey the underlying theme of watchful waiting  At the moment, I am not in favor of either   starting a large-scale LSAP program of Treasury securities or of signaling with the statement that   the Committee is preparing to do so in the imminent future  In fact, I would prefer us to back off   from that   September 21, 2010 93 of 151             Like President Lacker, I am of the view that if the state of the economy, and particularly   deflation, becomes a serious problem, I will be in favor of acting both aggressively and   appropriately, with all the tools and commitment that we have at our disposal to combat that    But I don’t think we’re there yet   Like President Lacker, I kind of like the statement in paragraph B1, with paragraph C2   and C3 from alternative C  I do not wish to convey the view that a new LSAP program is any   more likely than markets already believe it’s going to be  I think alternative B is likely to create   that perception   There are several reasons for my views  First, as I indicated in the first go-round, I do not   believe that monetary policy at this juncture is likely to have much effect on the path of the   unemployment rate going forward  In fact, even if we were not at the zero lower bound, such   ineffectiveness may be a legitimate concern  Moreover, using monetary policy just because   fiscal policy is frozen is not an appropriate way to conduct policy, in my view, particularly if   monetary policy is the wrong medicine for the disease  Following on President Fisher’s   sometimes useful medical analogies, a doctor that prescribes the wrong medicine can actually   make a patient worse if he’s got the wrong diagnosis  We have already stepped up to a pace   where we have applied extraordinarily large doses of accommodation to attack this disease  We   must be careful not to overprescribe   But we are not in a usual regime  Normally, monetary policy acts through marginal   changes in short-term interest rates intended to increase liquidity and improve the interbank   lending market  We have long recognized that monetary policy’s ability to control longer-term   interest rates is fairly limited  In fact, I’m not persuaded that there is an easy correspondence   between the short-term interest rate rule and its transmission process on the economy, and the   September 21, 2010 94 of 151             transmission mechanism at the zero lower bound of some measure of quantitative easing   operation that has tended to lower long-term interest rates  In fact, I think we know very little   about that transmission mechanism    I think it has been indicated that quantitative easing is operating in a different policy   space  Thus, I don’t find it very useful to try to compare it with movements in the short-term   funds rate, as the staff memo tries to do  My view is that, in a world where the zero bound is   binding, quantitative easing is primarily intended, as people have indicated, to raise inflation   expectations—in other words, to operate on nominal variables, as the Chairman indicated  In   this environment, if we are worried about deflation or significantly falling inflation expectations,   that’s what we would like to do  If expectations were falling, raising inflation expectations will   prevent real rates from rising, or maybe enhance their falling, as a side benefit  Interestingly   enough, if we are successful in raising inflation expectations, longer-term interest rates are likely   to increase  And that would be a good sign  Bond traders out there currently pushing their book,   arguing for more quantitative easing to lower long-term rates, would actually end up facing   losses if that policy were successful  Indeed, as the Chairman said, this is an action to manage   nominal rates, not so much real rates  Thus, if our desire is to engage in a new quantitative   easing program, we need to be absolutely clear about our communication strategy, about why we   are doing what we are doing, and what we think the expectations would look like if we are   successful   Continuing to use in our language fine-tuning arguments that we are managing liquidity   or trying to achieve unemployment rate targets is not useful  This is about raising inflation   expectations, and we need to be prepared to say so if that’s what we deem it  Indeed, if our goal   is to raise expectations, then we should communicate that that is in fact our goal and do so   September 21, 2010 95 of 151             explicitly  Making references to other goals that we may think indirectly benefit can be   confusing to the public and to the markets, and, in fact, it would undermine our ability to impact   those expectations in the way that we want  So, taking steps that don’t refer to our desire to raise   inflation expectations actually undermines our long-run credibility and the effectiveness of our   policy  I think our current language is counterproductive to that ultimate goal, as it is at odds   with how we are likely to view what we want the Treasury LSAP program to do  If it works,   inflation expectations would rise, as I said  In particular, a successful quantitative easing   program would raise longer-term rates and, therefore, our continuing to communicate that our   objective is to lower longer-term rates directly contradicts that   In summary, quantitative easing is a policy to use in extraordinary times when inflation   expectations are falling and we are constrained by the zero lower bound  The objective is to   raise inflation expectations  This will require focused and clear communication strategies that   explicitly talk about that objective, not confusing with other things that may undermine it  My   view is that there is not yet sufficient evidence at this point that expectations have fallen   sufficiently that we need to undertake such an extraordinary effort  And, therefore, the more we   say that we are trying to do other things, the more we undermine our efforts  Indeed, taking   small movements and fine-tuning our longer-term interest rate targets is actually   counterproductive  I don’t believe we have either the theory or the empirical evidence that   suggests that by trying to move longer-term interest rates we can achieve our objectives in this   context  Perhaps worse, again, as I have just iterated, such an approach to policy actions could   actually undermine our credibility to achieve effective quantitative easing, if we came to need it    As I said, I don’t believe we have reached that juncture  I am opposed to undertaking that policy   today, and, actually, any time in the near future  I appreciate the efforts of the staff in   September 21, 2010 96 of 151             alternatives A1 and A2 to begin to try to address these communications problems, but I don’t   think they go far enough, and they remain, I think, confusing   I agree with the Chairman that there may come a time where we adopt price level target   regimes, such as President Evans has suggested, which I am very sympathetic to  But these   would constitute a regime shift, and I am concerned that it will take more than one meeting for   us to arrive at some agreement on what that regime shift ought to be and how we will have to   communicate it  I am looking forward to the meeting in January about structural employment   and the challenges we face in the unemployment rate  And it seems to me that, until we   understand that better, it would be premature to undertake actions or regime shifts when we are   not quite sure what their impact would be or what we want them to achieve  Thank you, Mr   Chairman  "
9107,2010-11-02,PLOSSER,"  As you think about starting to do this, have you thought about what the   regular interval might be?  Do you envision doing this at about that length of time between the   meeting and the minutes?  Is it going to be a regular thing, or what were you thinking?    So basically what you’re saying is that right now you’re thinking about   doing it the four times a year when the SEPs come out?    I’ve got it  I see what you’re saying, right    I was just asking how you were thinking about the regularity of this,   and you answered my question    Brian, do you think there’d be any difference between the duration   effects of our purchases that you’re talking about, and those if the Treasury announced a program   to quit issuing long-term bonds and issued short-term bonds instead to fund the deficit?    Can I just follow up?  It’s not just volatility that matters for our exit, but   it’s also the level of the rates that’s going to matter, and this doesn’t really address that    You can imagine that the markets may expect rates will be a lot higher,   but they may or may not be more volatile  So there are both the level and volatility issues, and   this only addresses the volatility    It seems to be working for bank examiners, though  They’re getting   lots of outside offers  [Laughter]    Thank you, Mr Chairman  My view of the economy and its trajectory   has changed little since our last meeting  Incoming data for the Third District suggest that a   modest recovery continues, with little change in trends among the sectors since September    Looking out to mid-2011, most of our business contacts expect us to emerge from this soft patch   and for conditions to gradually improve  Consistent with that, we saw a significant rebound in   the indexes of future activity and future employment in our business outlook survey in   manufacturing in October  Currently, regional labor markets remain weak  This is an   undesirable state of affairs, to be sure, but I am not convinced as yet that further monetary policy   November 2–3, 2010 49 of 238             accommodation can speed up the recovery in labor markets, even though we would very much   like for it to do so   Our regional data give little indication that sustained deflation is a risk  Our October   survey showed a sharp rise in the number of manufacturers reporting higher input costs, and they   expect higher costs to continue over the next six months  The index of future prices paid more   than doubled last month  So far, regional manufacturers have not been raising the prices of their   own outputs, but the October survey did show that many of them are now anticipating that they   will raise prices over the next six months; that is, future prices will go up  One of our directors,   the CEO of a national baking company, says that food companies are facing rising prices and   will have no choice but to raise prices in the near term  Retail sector firms also anticipate rising   costs  Some have already been notified by their foreign suppliers that they plan to raise prices   next year   The national recovery did hit a soft spot this summer, and I have revised down my   forecast for the second half of the year relative to June  I now expect economic growth for this   year to come in around 2½ percent  My medium- to longer-term forecast is little changed  I   believe the fundamentals are in place for growth to accelerate to 3 to 3½ percent in 2011, similar   to the Tealbook forecast  I do see a somewhat faster decline in the unemployment rate and a   faster acceleration in inflation than in the Tealbook   The economy is growing  Nominal GDP growth has averaged 4¼ percent so far this   year  As I have discussed in earlier meetings, monetary policy is already exceptionally   accommodative and has been so for more than two years  Some might argue it isn’t   accommodative enough, based on a Taylor rule formulation of output gaps or employment gaps,   but, as we have highlighted, there is a significant measurement problem with these issues, as the   November 2–3, 2010 50 of 238             staff even discussed today  Moreover, a Taylor rule formulation based on the growth rate, which   has fewer measurement problems, suggests that monetary policy is about right  In the Tealbook,   for example, the actual real funds rate, based on lagged core inflation, has remained relatively   stable over the course of this year   It is far from clear to me what the transmission mechanism from further asset purchases   to the real economy will be in this environment  The millions of families facing foreclosure, for   example, are unlikely to be motivated to increase spending because longer-term Treasuries, or   any other interest rate they face, falls by a few basis points  Business leaders and bankers I speak   with see little to change their behavior either  Thus, I’m far from convinced that more monetary   accommodation can do much, if anything, to speed up the pace of this recovery at this point    Indeed, the Tealbook comparison of the baseline with a policy of “no asset purchase” seems to   bear this out  The presentation suggests that $600 billion of asset purchases would reduce the   unemployment rate by 01 percentage point, and have no effect on the inflation rate by the end of   2011   Should we be undertaking policies whose outcomes have such negligible and uncertain   economic significance?  Some might argue this may mean we need to do more asset purchases to   get larger effects  But it isn’t at all clear that a linear extrapolation of this framework is a good   way to measure potential impacts  Even the Tealbook estimates that a $1 trillion asset purchase   would have a very modest impact  Moreover, what I worry about is that, with a policy of   running such large asset purchases, the costs could rise, and perhaps rise exponentially, as our   balance sheet increases   In my forecast, I see inflation rates that are roughly symmetric in the short run but tilted   to the upside in the medium to longer term  Inflation is now running between 1 and 1½ percent   November 2–3, 2010 51 of 238             measured year over year, which is very near my inflation objective  We have experienced   inflation rates of this level before without dire consequences  In addition, most forecasts of   inflation, as summarized by both Blue Chip and the SPF, show a gradual rise in inflation over the   next year, not a decline  Important to all of these forecasts, of course, is that inflation   expectations remain well anchored  And I think the data broadly support that assessment at this   point, but I acknowledge that that bears watching very closely   Some might like to raise inflation expectations in the short run to try to forestall some   deflationary risk, but I am dubious that our credibility is so well entrenched at this time that we   can manage a policy of manipulating expectations with any precision or with any confidence that   our credibility will survive such efforts  Someone pointed out that the current deceleration of   inflation is broad-based in nature and indicative of elevated deflation risk  However,   Philadelphia Fed staff analysis of the 178 PCE components shows that the amount of disinflation   we have witnessed and the dispersion of low or negative inflation across categories are not   atypical of past recessions  It’s also important to remember that the revisions to PCE inflation   are somewhat predictable  PCE inflation is usually revised up  Our last deflationary scare of the   early 2000s was entirely revised away  Thus, I think some caution is called for  Putting all of   this together, I continue to believe that the risks of sustained deflation are low and do not require   a policy response at this point    In summary, we are experiencing a modest recovery, which I expect to continue and to   accelerate somewhat next year  Would I prefer it to be faster?  Of course  But I don’t think that   is achievable by adding more monetary accommodation to the financial markets at this point    And I’ll discuss that more in the policy go-round  Thank you, Mr Chairman    I didn’t state one    I said the current rate of 1 to 1½ percent was near my inflation   objective    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Like President Lacker, I do not support   another round of asset purchases at this time  The economy has been through a soft patch this   summer, but it appears to be emerging from it  Economic growth over the next three years is   expected to be modestly above trend in the Tealbook  Employment is expected to pick up,   although at a painfully slow pace  And inflation is expected to accelerate gradually   In my view, the LSAP program is an unconventional policy tool that is likely to be most   helpful when inflation and the forecast of inflation are falling, when there is serious risk of   inflation expectations becoming unhinged and falling, and when we’re operating at the zero   bound  I might well support it if all of these conditions were met, but they aren’t, in my forecast    It seems to me that if we were in that position, our communication would be much different from   what we are currently considering  In particular, I would focus explicitly on our inflation   objective, on what we think inflation expectations were, and our goal would be to support those,   because that would support the real economy  But even in this case, there may be better, more   effective, and less distortionary tools at our disposal, and I will return to that in a moment   November 2–3, 2010 142 of 238             In terms of our current approach to LSAPs, I have some deep misgivings  Some of the   memos and discussions seem to view LSAPs as a conventional policy instrument that can easily   be translated into short-term interest rates and, thus, rationalized in terms of a more normal   policy rule  I’m strongly in favor of rule-based policies  My assessment is that we have little   theory or evidence to guide us in constructing such a rule for these unconventional policies  And   what we do have seems to me to be subject to skepticism  Certainly, in the Eggertsson-  Woodford model, for example, asset purchases would be irrelevant in escaping from such a   liquidity trap   I think it would be a mistake to convey to the public that we know how to fine-tune an   asset-purchase program to achieve our objectives when, in fact, we don’t  We need to be humble   about what we know about the effects of an LSAP program on the economy and on inflation   expectations  Moreover, we risk undermining both business and consumer confidence if a   renewed and particularly large LSAP program is viewed as a signal that the recovery is   unsustainable or that the economy is worse off than they already think it is   I’m also concerned about the economic and political costs associated with unwinding all   of the LSAPs that we have already done to date, much less adding more  These uncertainties   suggest to me that, in the current environment, the potential costs of such a program outweigh   the meager benefits outlined in the Tealbook  Again, given these very small anticipated benefits,   we should be even more focused on the downside risks of this program  I’m concerned that we   have too quickly presumed that the cost and risk are close to zero  What if we’re wrong?  Doing   something because we can is not a good way to conduct policy, even when the state of the   economy seems unsatisfactory, nor is doing so because the fiscal authorities won’t act  It’s akin   November 2–3, 2010 143 of 238             to asking your dentist to do your heart surgery, because your heart surgeon is on the golf course    [Laughter]   These policies can set dangerous precedents in their own right, create their own form of   moral hazard, and create potentially outsized political risk for us  Trying to use highly uncertain   monetary policy tools to conduct policies that are better addressed with fiscal policy is, to use an   expression that President Hoenig has used recently, perhaps a bargain with the devil   In my mind, the costs outweigh the benefits  So I’m supportive of alternative C, of the   choices we’ve been given  But I acknowledge that this is not the prevailing view of this   Committee at this point, and others may very well disagree with my assessment  But if we are to   proceed, I think we need to improve our communication and ask ourselves a number of   important questions   First, I think we need to be clear about what we expect the transmission mechanism to be    If the effect we seek is on inflation and inflation expectations, then we need to say that very   explicitly, yet we continue to talk about lowering longer-term nominal interest rates  However,   if we were effective, perhaps longer-term interest rates would actually go up  We traditionally   do a very poor job in this Committee of distinguishing between real and nominal interest rates in   our communication, and I think this is a case where that may be particularly important  If we   focus too much on the unemployment rate and the unemployment path, and if it fails to improve   noticeably, we could do appreciable harm to our credibility and/or be led, as President Lacker   was suggesting, to ever-increasing balance sheets as we chase a goal that we can’t achieve   Second, we need to be clear about what we are conditioning the LSAP policy on  It’s all   well and good to say we will regularly review the policy in light of incoming information and   adjust policy appropriately  But I think our communications would be more effective if we   November 2–3, 2010 144 of 238             provided a better sense of what information we’re looking at  For example, suppose the   Tealbook forecast plays out just as written in the second quarter of next year, with a growth rate   of 34 percent, unemployment rate at 95 percent, and PCE inflation at 1 percent  Would the   Committee members who favor asset purchases today take this as evidence that the program is   working, as the Tealbook would suggest, or would they be inclined to do more purchases if they   saw those outcomes?  Perhaps it would depend on some factors other than those key   instruments—maybe it would depend on the level of longer-term nominal rates, maybe it would   depend on inflation expectations  In any case, we need to be explicit about what we think those   factors might be and how they would guide us in our policymaking  If the economy looks   appreciably better in the first half of next year than forecasted with the policy effects, would the   program be interpreted as being more successful than we thought it was?  Or would we interpret   the economic improvement as a sign that the policy is no longer needed?  Would we then be   inclined to shrink the balance sheet, if output turned out better than expected?   Given that we have so little basis for a rule under these circumstances, I think we need at   least a better sense amongst ourselves of how we’ll adjust policy over time, what indicators will   guide us, and what the scale and the pace of such asset-purchase programs will be  What do we   need to see happening to stop purchases early or to increase purchases?  Once we have a better   understanding of our own thought processes, we can convey a better sense to the public and the   markets and be more disciplined in our approach to policy  That’s why these considerations, at a   minimum, suggest that the language we need says that we’ll engage in policies of “up to”   $600 billion, if we really think we’re going to be reevaluating it along the way   Third, before embarking on a new round of asset purchases, it also seems prudent to have   further serious discussions about our exit strategy  In particular, how will portfolio-balance   November 2–3, 2010 145 of 238             effects play out during our exit?  Presumably, if we aren’t selling assets, the size of our balance   sheet will sustain such portfolio-balance accommodation  That might suggest that we would   have to raise the fed funds rate faster than otherwise in order to offset the effects of this built-in   large balance sheet and the portfolio-balance effects  This also plays on the other side of how we   pick the size of this program  It seems to me that many of us have talked about setting the size of   the program in terms of its effects on the Taylor rule, for example, in lowering the funds rate   when we’re at the zero bound  Yet I don’t see that those calculations account for the fact that   we’ve already done nearly $18 trillion of asset purchases    Pick a number for asset purchases, say, $600 billion  If we believe that   that amounts to a move of 100 basis points for the funds rate, then we’ve already done the   equivalent of 300 basis points in terms of the funds rate going into this, and this would be   lowering it yet another 100 basis points  The calculations of the Taylor rule don’t make that   adjustment  When you calculate the Taylor rule, it doesn’t tell you that you’ve already done   300 basis points worth of easing     I’m sorry  I was thinking about the numbers in the Tealbook from the   Taylor rule    I stand corrected, then, if that’s true  I lost my place here  In any event,   I think we need to think clearly about both the scale that we have already done and how it will   affect the economy as we unwind—if we don’t sell assets, then the portfolio-balance effect of   that stock of assets is negative   Finally, let me note that I largely agree with President Nutter—I’m sorry, it was President   Evans who was talking saying that  [Laughter]  Excuse me—that just slipped out  I agree with   him wholeheartedly on the importance of an inflation target  But, like President Kocherlakota,   I’m unclear exactly how further asset purchases, which simply increase the amount of excess   reserves we have in the banking system, would work  I have no idea how they would help raise   inflation expectations in the short run  We already have sufficient excess reserves, and if those   excess reserves flowed out into the economy as M2 or some other measure of liquidity, we have   the kindling that has the potential to create a great amount of inflation  If we wish to affect   inflation expectations, we might be more effective in emphasizing this actuality and the   prospects for higher inflation in our communications   Better still, we might think of using other tools to increase the money multiplier and   encourage banks to put their excess reserves to different uses—this is related perhaps to   President Lacker’s discussion earlier  For example, we might consider enhancing the   transmission mechanism by raising the interest on required reserves to 50 basis points and   lowering the interest on excess reserves to zero  We’ve paid zero interest rates on excess   reserves for most of our history  By creating a wedge between required reserves and excess   reserves, we might encourage some of those huge amounts of excess reserves that are in the   system to move out into assets of various classes, and let the markets take care of it rather than   November 2–3, 2010 147 of 238             forcing us to do something along those lines  So I think we need to consider other ways of   enhancing what we’ve already done   In closing, I agree it would be a surprise if the Fed did not do LSAPs today, given the   recent speeches  But that isn’t a reason, in my mind, to implement an inappropriate policy   whose costs may outweigh its benefits  The Committee should be setting appropriate policy, and   the markets will adjust, not the other way around  Moreover, our focus should be on the   intermediate to longer run  Short-term interests of traders, marketmakers, and the dealers we’re   so fond of surveying about our policy choices may well be at odds with the longer-run policy   objectives of the broad economy  After all, isn’t that one of the reasons for our independence,   namely, to keep that longer-term focus?  Thank you, Mr Chairman    I was confused  "
9133,2010-12-14,PLOSSER,"  For the same reasons I like what the staff proposed  I thought that was   perfectly reasonable, and I kind of like the six-month cycle  That’s fine with me, too    Thank you, Mr Chairman  The news regarding business conditions in   the Third District is on balance moderately positive and consistent with a modest recovery   scenario  Residential and commercial real estate and construction, however, continue to lag   behind the recovery, as these were the hardest hit during the recession  Overall, employment in   our three states rose in October, especially in Pennsylvania  Our November Business Outlook   December 14, 2010 31 of 127             Survey, released just after the last FOMC meeting, indicated a sharp increase in the current   activity index—it rose from plus 1 to plus 225  Manufacturers’ orders and shipments indexes   also rose in November  About 40 percent of the firms plan to increase spending on plant and   equipment over the next 12 months—that compares with 16 percent this time a year ago   Regional business contacts expect a modest pace of improvement in the months ahead    Our December survey, which remains confidential until noon on Thursday, gives similar   readings to our November results  The general activity index rose from the 225 to 243 and is   very consistent with values seen in historical recoveries  And, by the way, the market’s   expectation for that number was 10  New orders also rose significantly in December   As I noted six weeks ago, our regional price data do not raise concerns regarding   sustained deflation  In our November Business Outlook Survey, manufacturers continued to   report higher input costs  In addition, in November, both the future prices paid and the future   prices received indexes rose significantly, indicating that firms are expecting prices to be rising,   not falling, over the next six months   Retailers generally report that wholesale prices are stable, but many contacts noted that   foreign suppliers have raised prices for many products being ordered now for delivery next year    Again, our December survey, which will be released Thursday, indicates that even more   participants are reporting higher prices paid as well as higher prices received  The prices paid   index rose further from 34 in November to 512 in December, and the prices received by firms   actually turned positive, increasing from minus 2 in November to plus 10 in December  That is   its highest reading since mid-2008   Turning to the national economy, incoming data strengthen my belief that the economy is   emerging from the soft patch we encountered this summer  Third-quarter real GDP was revised   December 14, 2010 32 of 127             up; manufacturing and business equipment spending have picked up; consumer spending and   employment continue to expand and have defied the pessimism of those who saw the economy   heading for a double dip   The recent trade numbers indicate that foreign demand for US products has picked up,   perhaps boosting fourth-quarter GDP growth more than previously thought  Thus, I continue to   believe that the fundamentals are in place for real GDP growth to accelerate to close to   3½ percent in 2011, even in the absence of any new fiscal stimulus  I expect the tax package, if   it passes, to add only modestly to this growth in 2011, and, because of its temporary nature, to   generate a small, but not significant, give-back in 2012   Financial market indicators have attracted a good deal of attention in recent weeks    However, I would caution against ascribing too much of the evolution of interest rates over the   last couple of months to either anticipation of or the announcement of our LSAP program  Many   factors have likely affected the decline and then the rise in yields over the last two or three   months  We’ve had the much anticipated and discussed lead-up to the results of the elections for   the House and Senate  We’ve had a flare-up in the European sovereign debt crisis, which   probably resulted in some flight to quality, only to be followed by another “stay” of a   restructuring “execution”  And, finally, we experienced a steady improvement in the economic   data, some of which could not have been the result of either the anticipation or the   implementation of our LSAP  Disentangling the influences of these factors on yields is likely to   be a very difficult, if not impossible, task   The latest readings on core inflation have come in slightly lower than expected and may   raise concerns among some about the possibility of sustained deflation  But there is no such   indication as yet in either market- or survey-based measures of inflation expectations, and the   December 14, 2010 33 of 127             likelihood of sustained deflation is no higher now than it was at the time of our last meeting    And survey measures indicate that the probability of deflation is lower now than it was in late   2008 and in 2009  In addition, I would note that monthly inflation estimates tend to be volatile,   and, in particular, the PCE estimates often get revised up  Thus, I continue to expect inflation   readings to be higher, more in line with our objectives, as we go through 2011   In summary, conditions in the Third District, as well as the nation as a whole, seem to me   indicative of a modest recovery, which I expect to continue and accelerate somewhat next year    The economic news we have received thus far does not give me cause for worry about   encountering any sustained deflation in the near future  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I can accept “no change” in policy at this   time as reflected in alternative B  In my remarks before this Committee six weeks ago, I   expressed reservations about embarking on a second round of long-term asset purchases  A   significant concern was, and it continues to be, in my mind, that the benefit of further LSAPs is   likely to be too small to justify the cost and the risk associated with further expansion of the size   of our balance sheet  While I still hold that view, it would be difficult to reverse course at this   December 14, 2010 82 of 127             juncture  However, I do take seriously the Committee’s promise to reevaluate our policy on a   regular basis and to adjust it as appropriate in the coming months   I would like to take this opportunity to discuss briefly how I think about evaluating the   LSAP program going forward  First and foremost, I would like to reemphasize that there are   significant economic and political risks that stem from the inflated size of our SOMA balance   sheet  The economic risk is that we may find it harder to control inflationary expectations when   the economy goes into full recovery mode and we have possibly upward of $15 to $2 trillion of   excess reserves sloshing around in the banking system  Our reserve-draining tools are untested   for large operations, and I’m concerned that they may not be as effective as we currently   anticipate  I continue to believe that asset sales will need to play a significant role in our exit,   but I’m concerned that political criticisms will make both sales and increases in interest rates   difficult to execute in a timely fashion, thus increasing the risks of falling behind the curve    Moreover, by increasing the amount of excess reserves by about 50 percent, we increase the risks   of falling behind the curve   To be clear about what political criticisms I’m worried about, consider the consequence   of raising interest on reserves  With $15 trillion of excess reserves, a 100 basis point increase in   the IOER rate, which could easily occur over the course of a year sometime in the future,   represents a transfer of about $15 billion from the US Treasury to the banking system  At a   time when the government faces large deficits and the Fed is already vulnerable to intense   criticism regarding its treatment of the financial sector, I’m concerned that this redistribution will   lead to accusations that the Fed is continuing taxpayer bailouts of our largest banks  Such   criticism, I fear, will find further ground because the volume of excess reserves is highly skewed   towards a few of the largest institutions  This potentially politically unpopular redistribution will   December 14, 2010 83 of 127             also happen as we use our reserve management tools when we have to pay banks more in IOER   to sequester the reserves using reverse repos or term deposits  Of course, this does not mean that   we should back away from using these tools, and I believe we should use them when the time   comes, but I think we must be cognizant of the potential cost, namely, the risk to the institution   and our independence of managing such an overly large balance sheet going forward   The key challenge, therefore, is not whether we can raise interest rates in draining   reserves, but whether we’ll be willing to do so at the appropriate time  Will we be reluctant to   act out of fear of criticisms that might endanger our independence?  Of course, that’s not the   language we’ll use, but we’ll say we choose to delay because of headwinds, a fragile economy,   and this will lead to a prolonged “wait and see” attitude by the Committee and its approach to   policies, and we will risk acting too late  If we do fall behind the curve, we may find ourselves   needing to reduce the size of our balance sheet very rapidly to contain inflationary expectations    This may necessitate a large increase in real interest rates with potentially negative effects on   real activity and rising inflation  At the end of the day, we will have contributed to greater, not   less, instability in the economy   Given these concerns, I strongly believe that the economic forecast remains similar to   what the December Tealbook looks like  Our goal should be to implement orderly reductions in   the sizes of our balance sheets sooner rather than later  Given our current forecast, this makes   me less inclined to support policy accommodations that involve adding to our already swollen   balance sheet and more inclined to support recommendations that involve reducing the pace of   LSAPs and ultimately resulting in the sale of assets   That said, I wish to reiterate my remarks from six weeks ago regarding the best way to   manage our LSAP program  First, we need to be clear about the expected transmission   December 14, 2010 84 of 127             mechanisms with these purchases  In my view, the main impact we seek is on inflationary   expectations and real interest rates  Yet our communication does not distinguish between real   and nominal interest rates in the long-term Treasuries, and we continue to tie the effectiveness of   LSAP to near-term paths and the unemployment rate  We know very little about how any given   LSAP purchases affect demand and supply conditions in the labor market  By not being clear   about what we expect LSAP to accomplish, I think we risk damaging our credibility  Second,   we need to convey what we’re conditioning the LSAP policy on  I worry that the tone and   emphasis of our language and our communications more generally may ultimately back us into a   corner  We seem to be increasingly stressing the level of the unemployment rate as the most   important factor determining policy   If we shift our focus from the level of unemployment to changes in it, that would be an   improvement  But we still seem to be suddenly deemphasizing real economic growth and   inflation or inflation expectations as important conditioning variables for policy  This shift, I   believe, is subtle but potentially dangerous  It is a mistake because it risks creating the   expectation that the Committee will delay tightening until the unemployment rate achieves some   desirable level  That would make it even more difficult for us to act in a timely manner   So I’ll be focusing going forward on improving economic growth rates of real GDP as   well as changes in the unemployment rate, not the levels of these variables  Many of us around   this table have noted previously that we will have to begin to withdraw accommodation well   before unemployment reaches acceptable levels or the perceived output gaps are closed  Let’s   not let subtle changes in our language make that task any more difficult than it will already be   Finally, I would strongly advocate that we revisit our earlier discussions regarding exit   strategies  If fully carried out, LSAP2 will increase reserves by about 50 percent, which is a   December 14, 2010 85 of 127             pretty big increase  I think we need to know before it’s time to begin the exit if these additional   reserves will have any material consequence for how fast we will need to sell, or will be able to   sell, assets or raise the funds rates and what we anticipate the consequences of those actions will   be  We had a very fruitful discussion about this earlier this year, and I think revisiting that   discussion in light of the expanded balance sheet could be a useful exercise  Thank you, Mr   Chairman  "
9161,2011-01-25,PLOSSER,"  Should that make us more or less comfortable with the view that is   produced in FRB/US?  If it’s that hard to identify these things, the same problems occur in a   different context with FRB/US, right?    So you can’t really distinguish between these two based on this point    Brian, you mentioned changes to the Supplementary Financing   Program, and you said it was now something like $200 billion  Is that right?    Is that reflected in the balance sheet scenarios that you work out later?    I’m referring to income and size of the balance sheet going forward,   and I ask because that will raise the size of our balance sheet by $200 billion, right?    Okay  Thank you     I’d like to restate my question about the SFP a little more precisely    When SFP goes away, we transfer out of the Treasury, and they become excess reserves, in   effect  Right?  We’ve just entered a program where we’re going to blow excess reserves up by   $600 billion, and the transfer I just mentioned is going to increase excess reserves by another   $200 billion in the process  I was trying to get at the notion that, in part, that’s an effect on   income, because now we’re actually paying income out on the excess reserves that these are   converted to, which reduces our net income   January 25–26, 2011 61 of 282              The policy question is  How does that affect our ability to drain reserves when the time   comes, given that reserves are going to be $200 billion higher because of this action?  This action   may end up affecting what we face in terms of the pace of asset sales or our ability to drain using   reverse repos and other things  In other words, the end of SFP could make the draining problem   bigger than it otherwise would have been    But as interest rates go up on interest on reserves, we’re going to be   paying more and more out    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Economic conditions in the Third District   have continued to improve  The regional economy has shaken off the summer doldrums and   recovery is gaining some momentum as it enters the New Year  Our business outlook survey of   regional manufacturing showed strength in both December and January, and the general activity   index is up to about 20 in both of those months  Underlying that, the indexes of new orders and   January 25–26, 2011 105 of 282              shipments both improved substantially in January  Our manufacturers expect activity to continue   to improve over the next six months  Perhaps more encouraging is the jump in the employment   index from 43 to 176 in January, the highest value we’ve seen for that index since April 2006   Third District retailers and auto dealers report increases in sales at the end of last year   compared with year-earlier levels  Although service sector firms gave some mixed reports, on   balance, activity has been rising  The health care and information technology sectors showed   some growth, and activity related to real estate, construction, and finance, while not great,   seemed to have firmed a bit and stopped declining   Payroll employment in the three states increased on a three-month moving average basis   ending in December, based on data released yesterday  The unemployment rate has been moving   steadily down, falling to 87 percent in December for the three-state area, from a high of   94 percent in July—a drop of 07 in less than six months  This is consistent with the   improvement in the employment readings we receive in our manufacturing survey   On the pricing front, we continue to see increased price pressures  Many of our   manufacturers continue to report an increase in input costs in January, and there are growing   signs of an ability to pass these prices on to customers both in current prices and in expectations   of future prices  During the early part of the recovery, firms held back on price increases even   though they faced increased costs  That attitude appears to be changing  For example, one of   our directors is a national manufacturer of floor coverings; the company has suffered greatly   through the housing bust and is putting through a 5 percent price increase in light of the   continuing rise in materials costs  This is his first price increase in two and a half years, and he   reports that others in his industry are facing the same challenge, as margins continually get   squeezed  Another director, from a large national baking company, says that his industry and he   January 25–26, 2011 106 of 282              will have no choice but to raise prices this year in light of higher food commodity prices—that is,   flour, sugar, et cetera  These two anecdotes do not by themselves constitute compelling evidence   of the future path of prices, but they are illustrative of our business outlook survey’s prices-  received index, which has turned abruptly positive, rising from minus 33 in November to plus   94 in December and 171 percent in January  That’s the highest value it has taken on since   August 2008   Thus, my sense is that, as the recovery picks up steam and firms become more convinced   that demand increases are going to be sustained, they will feel more confident that they can put   through price increases and have them stick  Given how much ground these firms may feel that   they have to make up, these price increases may move in a fairly nonlinear manner once they   start  Labor costs are not the only things that matter to these firms when it comes to pricing    Thus, looking at wages and unemployment may not be the most important key to understanding   future price pressures  Of course, our policy needs to focus less on what prices and inflation   have done over the last year and focus more on what they’re likely to look like in the coming   year, and on this score I see the risks clearly to the upside   Turning to the national economy, I’ve made little change in my forecast since our   submission in October  I’d been interpreting the summer slowdown as a soft patch, not the start   of a cumulative decline in activity  Thus, acceleration in activity seen in the fourth quarter was   consistent with my outlook  I expect economic growth to be about 3½ percent per year over the   next two years  I believe that the data are consistent with a self-sustaining recovery  I think that   firms are becoming more convinced of that as well  My economic growth forecast is a bit   weaker than the Tealbook, and Philadelphia’s DSGE model suggests that growth may be   stronger than my forecast  Thus, I believe that there are upside risks to my growth forecast, as   January 25–26, 2011 107 of 282              the usual dynamics of an economic recovery could outweigh the drags from household   deleveraging and the housing slump   I also see a somewhat faster decline in the unemployment rate and a faster acceleration in   inflation than the Tealbook  As I’ve said at previous meetings, I am very wary of basing policy   on some notion of an output gap or an employment gap, because both have both conceptual and   measurement problems  One only needs to look at the range of estimates of the natural rate of   unemployment we discussed yesterday and the error bands around those estimates to see that the   unemployment gap measures are not very precisely estimated  Output gaps suffer from the same   measurement issues that the unemployment gap does  Orphanides’s research shows that ex post   revisions of the output gap are of the same order of magnitude as the gap itself, and it’s   particularly hard to measure the gap near cyclical turning points  This is probably one reason the   gap gets little weight in empirical estimates of New Keynesian Phillips curves  Indeed, the   Philadelphia model suggests considerably higher inflation pressures than the Tealbook  Again,   my view is that inflation risks are to the upside in the medium term   I think we need to remember these risks as we contemplate policy in an environment in   which output growth and probably employment growth are likely to be above trend  In my view,   if we focus on the growth rate of output and the growth rate of employment rather than the levels   of gaps, we will have a better chance of staying ahead of the curve rather than falling behind it    Taylor rule formulations based on growth rates, for example, suggest that monetary policy is   about right, and, thus, there’s no need for extended LSAP programs that seek to drive short-term   real rates lower  Given my outlook and my focus on growth rates, I believe we will need to   begin removing policy accommodation considerably sooner than anticipated by the Tealbook    January 25–26, 2011 108 of 282              We need to begin preparing for that time by discussing what our exit path will look like and the   communication strategies we will need to implement it   As a brief aside, I draw the Committee’s attention to yesterday’s handout of our   economic projections  The charts presented on the risks to GDP and inflation have flip-flopped   fairly dramatically since November  GDP and inflation risks were heavily weighted to the   downside in November, and now those risks are marginally weighted to the upside  We should   make sure that the minutes and our statements are consistent with this change in direction, and   I’ll have more to say about that in the policy go-round  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Last fall when we deliberated whether or   not to institute a new round of LSAPs I expressed my misgivings about that strategy  In my   view, the potential costs of such a policy, which I viewed as occurring in the intermediate to   longer term, outweighed what I perceived to be the short-run potential benefits  I still hold that   view   Determining the appropriate timing of when to begin to reverse the path of policy always   poses a challenge for this Committee  By necessity, we have to make this decision with some   degree of uncertainty, given the lagged effects of monetary policy on the economy, the   imprecision and uncertainty surrounding our forecast, and even revisions of data at times  That   part is nothing new  However, I view the risk of getting behind the curve this time as likely to be   January 25–26, 2011 166 of 282              higher than usual  Both the size and composition of our balance sheet complicate our exit   strategy, raising the risk that we won’t be able to respond as rapidly as we should to curtail   potential inflationary pressures  My view is that our focus on the level of output and the level of   unemployment gaps raises the chance that we will not act soon enough  Thus, there are costs   associated with the LSAPs that could loom large in the not-too-distant future   I will repeat the point that I made in the economic go-round  From firms in my District, I   hear a lot of talk about commodity costs, as well as a lot of talk about their reluctance to raise   prices  While in some cases firms are seeing solid profits, many firms perceive their margins as   being squeezed by the rise in costs and they’re starting to consider seriously raising prices  If   those firms believe that they’re far behind the curve in that process, then we could be facing a   time when those price increases may come fairly rapidly  And we may find ourselves in a   position where we have to react both quickly and perhaps aggressively   We talk a lot in this Committee about managing tail risk  It seems that we focus more on   downside tail risks than on the other tail of the distribution  I’m simply pointing out that this is a   risk we face and that we’d better be prepared for managing that risk or managing the outcomes if   that comes to pass  I think President Kocherlakota’s description of three scenarios is a good way   to think about that   In the fall, I thought the potential benefits of the LSAP did not outweigh the potential   costs  I think economic growth began picking up in the third quarter of last year, not in the   fourth—we had a 1 percentage point increase in growth rates from the second quarter to the third   quarter  Deflation risks, as we have all noted, seem to have subsided  I think growth rates are   going to be somewhat above trend for the next two to three years, and I believe that employment   is going to pick up   January 25–26, 2011 167 of 282              However, mine was not the prevailing view in the November meeting, and the   Committee decided to go ahead with the second round of purchases  I accept that  In   considering policy today, I recognize, though, that there are costs to introducing policy volatility    We risk confusing the public about our policy direction if we change too much or too often,   without sufficient justification or conditions to warrant it  I think that source of uncertainty is   something that we should try our best to keep small  I think that is the situation we are in today    So I don’t think it would be prudent to begin curtailing the LSAP program today, even though I   wasn’t in favor of instituting it in the first place   Moreover, I have never been a fan of trying to fine-tune policy when we are using the   short-term interest rate as our policy instrument rather than asset purchases, so I think it would   be a particularly bad idea to convey to the public that we can fine-tune LSAPs  In my view,   LSAP policy should not be viewed as business-as-usual monetary policy  LSAPs are an   unconventional policy tool, which should be reserved for times of economic crisis—when   inflation expectations are falling, when there is a danger of sustained deflation, and when we are   operating at the zero bound   I don’t think this is a policy we should try to fine-tune, because we do not have enough   understanding of the effects that different amounts of purchases will have on the real economy in   order to calibrate an asset purchase program to achieve our objectives  This means, I think, that   once we have instituted a program, then there needs to be a clear change in the outlook to justify   a change in the program  I don’t think that has happened at this point, but I don’t rule it out   either  For example, it is certainly possible that, over the next few months, the economic outlook   will strengthen further, with inflation rising and employment growing at a more robust pace  In   that case, I would like us to be in a position to be able to curtail the LSAP2 program early  Even   January 25–26, 2011 168 of 282              if that doesn’t happen, if the forecast plays out as laid out in the Tealbook, I would not favor   another round of LSAPs if the economy performs under that scenario  In either case, I think we   need to start planning for the eventual end  This means our communications need to be   sufficiently flexible so that we will be in a position to allow the LSAP program to end in June, or   earlier if the outlook calls for it   We should also consider changes in the language that will allow us to implement other   parts of our exit strategy, which may be raising interest rates, curtailing reinvestments in MBS,   or other strategies we might want to consider  Furthermore, stressing economic growth rates,   inflation, and inflation expectations in our description of the economic conditions would help   convey the types of information on which we will be conditioning a change in policy direction   down the road  By continuing to stress the level of unemployment, we risk creating expectations   that this Committee will delay tightening until the level of unemployment reaches some desirable   target  That would make our task even more difficult and make it hard to act in a timely manner   Regarding the language, like President Kocherlakota and President Lacker, I think the   tone of paragraph 1 in alternative B is too negative on the economy and is inconsistent, I believe,   with the kind of language we have used here  In fact, as I noted earlier, the chart showing the   balance of risks in our own forecasts has switched dramatically since November, and I think that   the minutes and our statements need to reflect that change  I don’t think alternative B, which   looks a lot like alternative B from the last meeting, reflects that change  So I would prefer   paragraph 1 of alternative C as a substitute in alternative B  In particular, I think phrases like   “Employers remain reluctant to add to payrolls” are too negative  It would be better to talk about   payroll growth   January 25–26, 2011 169 of 282              In paragraph 2, I would prefer that we de-emphasize the level of unemployment  We   know that unemployment rates lag the economy and that the Committee will need to reduce   policy accommodation before the unemployment rate falls to anything close to an acceptable   level, regardless of what the natural rate is, which we don’t know  If we continue to point out   that the unemployment rate is high, it will be harder for us to explain why we are reversing   course when unemployment is still elevated in many people’s eyes  Instead of saying that the   unemployment rate is currently elevated, I would prefer to say something like, “Currently,   employment is growing, but at a modest pace”  After all, there is a difference between   employment and unemployment rates, though, of course, they are closely related  But the timing   and behavior of unemployment rates and employment have different cyclical properties, and I   think we need to acknowledge that   I am fine with the proposed change in the last sentence of paragraph 3 in alternative B    However, given that we are making a change, I would like to convey more, again, about the   conditioning variables that we will take into account when the time comes  So I would prefer   that we say, “The Committee will continue its practice of regularly reviewing the pace of its   security purchases and the overall size of the asset purchase program in light of incoming   information,” and then add “on inflation, inflation expectations, and output growth  It remains   prepared to adjust the program as needed in the future”  I think that gives a better signal about   what conditioning factors we will be looking at and thinking about   Regarding paragraph 4, I am okay with maintaining the “extended period” language at   this meeting, but I think that we will need to change that language as we prepare for exit  This   might coincide with the time when we decide that we will not continue the LSAP program, and,   obviously, if we let it run until June, we will have to make a decision before June and signal   January 25–26, 2011 170 of 282              whether we are prepared to continue it or discontinue it  So we will have to think earlier about   those sorts of language changes  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Mr Chairman?     But suppose it was a conference and, as Jim said, there were 300 or   400 people there, and the press was there  Would it matter?  If the press was there, which   essentially makes it public, you would probably write your speech for that conference just as you   would write any other speech     I’m asking a question  I wasn’t trying to propose an answer    Thank you, Mr Chairman  My views are a lot like Jim’s  I think part   of what makes policy good is transparency, and the more transparent we can be, the better off we   would be in general  Policies that are controlling can backfire on us  Tom’s point about FRAM   indicates that there are already guidelines in place about what we should and shouldn’t do  I   don’t think we can legislate good judgment here   I would note that this mostly refers to FOMC participants, not staff, whereas the   guidelines in FRAM suggest senior officials—    I’m not accusing anybody, but staff contacts with the private sector and   the media can also create these kinds of issues     I think one of the things that oftentimes gets us into trouble or   misunderstood is when we go off the record  My impression is that the Board, for example,   gives very few on-the-record interviews, and, instead, the discussion is oftentimes on   background    I’m talking about the media or some people who are Fed watchers    My own personal approach is never to say anything to anybody that I   wouldn’t say publicly or haven’t said publicly, for example, in a speech  I think there are lots of   gray areas here  I agree that it would not look good for one of us to speak at a Goldman Sachs   venue, but, at the same time, all of us, I suspect, have spoken at banking conventions sponsored   by a not-for-profit organization, such as the American Bankers Association, but basically the   attendees include clients and donors and funders  Is that acceptable, whereas something else   may not be?  Or what about a university event, where alumni are raising money to support the   institution?  There are lots of cases where it begins to get a little fuzzy, so I’m leery of trying to   legislate that kind of controlling policy     I want to encourage communication  I want to have more communication, not less, and   have more open communication and less behind-the-scenes communication  I think enforcement   is going to be really, really difficult, and, again, I think we just can’t legislate good judgment  I   would prefer that we adopt broader guidelines that apply to everybody and then trust that we will   use our best judgment, rather than adopt an attitude where we sow seeds of suspicion by trying to   control behavior tightly  That’s just my general philosophy  "
9187,2011-03-15,PLOSSER,"  So what would you say about the United Kingdom, then?    The amount of slack versus the inflation rates in what you’d call   underlying core there    Just to follow up, Dennis’s points about both costs of carry and storage   have become important elements in how you think about the actual path of the futures curve    Have you looked at predictive content of the overall shift in the curve as opposed to the level?    Because I thought there was evidence that when the whole curve moves, it tells you something   more than the path, and I think that is what Dennis was getting at  I wonder if you had any   thoughts about that   March 15, 2011 29 of 165               I don’t know whether it’s a random walk or not  We’re talking about   predictability here    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Economic conditions in the Third District   continue to improve, even though some of us were snowed in in January  Manufacturing has   been particularly strong  The general activity index of our Business Outlook Survey hit a seven-  year high in February, surging from 193 in January to 359 in February  The March data, which   will be released this Thursday—so it is embargoed until then—show another strong jump from   359 to 434  This is the highest reading for the general activity index since the early 1980s  The   survey is showing broad strength across the board  The index of new orders in March jumped   from a high level of 237 in February to 403 in March  Indexes for shipments and employment   all continue to be in strong territory and have been rising for about six months now  The future   activity index, which asks questions about activities six months from now, surged very strongly   in March from an already high level  I would caution, though, that the survey was taken before   the tsunami and before the turmoil in Japan, so we would have to temper that interpretation    Nonetheless, it was a very strong reading about expectations going forward  Some contacts   credited global markets as drivers for new demand, and, in fact, in some instances rising global   prices have made local firms more competitive, allowing them to reclaim work previously lost   overseas  Our Beige Book contacts indicate that retail sales, including autos, have been rising on   March 15, 2011 43 of 165              a year-over-year basis  Even though bad weather in January kept buyers away, many auto   dealers used clearance sales in January to boost sales   Labor market conditions are firming in Pennsylvania, where employment has risen at an   annual rate of about 07 percent over the past three months and the unemployment rate has fallen   to 82 percent  The rebenchmarked data indicate that employment levels in the District are   slightly higher than originally reported  Employment growth in New Jersey and Delaware are   not quite as robust, but Delaware, in particular, is a small state, so the readings can be quite   volatile   My staff’s state coincident indicators, which summarize economic developments,   indicate that activity over the past three months has strengthened in Pennsylvania and New   Jersey in particular  The staff’s leading indicators indicate activity in the District is projected to   continue to improve over the next six months  Business contacts remain optimistic about the   future  Many are now saying that business is “good” or “strong”  One electrical machinery   manufacturer told us that he will break ground on a new plant expansion in April  They do   expect exports to be a major source of future revenue going forward   At our last meeting I talked about the emerging strength of increased price pressures    These have continued to develop over the intermeeting period  In February, prices-paid and   prices-received indexes in our manufacturing survey hit their highest levels in three years  The   data from March showed further increases, continuing that trend over the past several months    There is a growing indication that firms have some ability to pass on these prices to customers    In response to a special question in our February survey, more than 57 percent of the   manufacturers said they had already put through price increases since the start of this year  The   most common increase was 3 to 4 percent, but some firms reported very large increases  In   March 15, 2011 44 of 165              response to a different question, nearly 60 percent of all respondents said they planned to   increase prices over the next three months  Given the recent increases in energy and commodity   prices, I expect more firms are going to be willing to test their pricing power, particularly as   concerns about the recovery’s sustainability abate  Thus, I see inflation risks as clearly to the   upside both in our District and in the US economy more generally   I also note that the Tealbook has revised up its forecast of both total and core PCE from   January  So far, inflation expectations have remained anchored, though we need to be vigilant to   make sure they continue to remain so  I would suggest that if the rise in oil and commodity   prices appears to be passed through to other prices, and we thus see a rise in all prices or core   prices, that will occur because monetary policy is accommodative  While this might mean that   there is just a one-time increase in the level of prices as monetary policy allows all prices to rise   with the higher oil prices, it could become more damaging if, in fact, during that transition,   expectations of inflation begin to change  Then our responses would be much more difficult   As the Tealbook alternative scenarios clearly show, the low level of pass-through of large   price increases is contingent upon expectations of inflation being well anchored  The alternative   scenario in which long-run inflation expectations are more sensitive to this persistent rise in   headline inflation is a pretty ugly scenario, with core PCE inflation reaching 3¾ percent in 2013   and remaining there for at least the next two years, the end of the forecast horizon  Economic   growth is significantly lower and the unemployment rate is significantly higher than in the   baseline  I don’t think we should take the possibility of this outcome as trivial  The current   experience in the United Kingdom, and to a lesser extent, the EU, as we were talking about   earlier, where inflation is rising in spite of what appear to be large output gaps, should make us at   least somewhat uncomfortable about relying on these gaps too heavily to control the inflation   March 15, 2011 45 of 165              process for us  After all, as Dave Stockton noted, gaps really do have only a small predictive   content for inflation—not zero, but relatively small—and thus large movements in inflation   remain unexplained by such models   I have made little change to my forecast  The situation in Japan after the devastating   earthquake and tsunami is serious  The nuclear reactor risks have created even more uncertainty    However, at this point, it is difficult to see exactly how this situation is going to resolve itself, or   how it will impact global economic growth and the United States  I do believe Japan has the   capacity to overcome this tragedy and recover  For now, I continue to expect output growth in   the United States to be above trend over the next two years, employment growth to strengthen,   the unemployment rate to move down gradually, and inflation to move toward 2 percent  The   outcome of my forecast is similar to that of the Tealbook, but I have a somewhat steeper policy   path to go along with it  I believe we will need to tighten policy considerably sooner than in the   Tealbook, even though the Tealbook’s revisions have moved the liftoff two quarters earlier than   their January forecast  The Tealbook now has liftoff in the third quarter of 2012  But if we are   to ensure that inflation expectations remain anchored, I think we will need to start reversing   course well before the end of this year, if the forecast plays out as imagined in the Tealbook   Taylor rules based on growth rates, rather than gaps, suggest that monetary policy is   about right now  But as economic growth accelerates this year, policy will need to start   tightening  We need to begin preparing for that time by discussing what our exit path will look   like and communicating that strategy to the markets  We will need to prepare them for the exit   before we implement it  I will have more to say about that in the policy go-round  Thank you,   Mr Chairman    March 15, 2011 46 of 165               Thank you, Mr Chairman  A second round of LSAPs is nearing its   scheduled conclusion in June  As you know, I was not in favor of this policy when it was   implemented last November, and I certainly cannot support another round of purchases  The   current forecasts simply don’t justify any serious consideration of a new round of purchases    The Tealbook suggests the possibility of extending the time frame for the purchases, the tapering   plan  I don’t support a tapering plan  I don’t think that is necessary  The argument for LSAPs is   they work through stock effects and not flow effects, so I’m not quite sure why the argument for   tapering makes a lot of sense in that context  I don’t think the end will be disruptive to markets    We’ve been telling them what we were going to do  Let’s just go ahead and do it and not worry   about it so much  I think the only justification for tapering would be to say that we decided to   cut back on the stock effects and say we were going to go to $40 billion per month, but that   would be the only justification in my mind to change the pace at this point  Thus, I’m assuming   the program will end in June, which means that our April statement will need to signal the   LSAPs will end in June and that no further purchases are anticipated at that time  I don’t think   it’s too soon for us to consider what changes we will need to make in that statement and plan for   them now using appropriate language in today’s statement   Let me make three points about the language of the alternatives we’re considering today    First, the recovery is gaining momentum  I think that was fairly apparent from the discussion   around the table by people’s descriptions of the economy  I think it’s important that we convey   this in our description of economic conditions in paragraph 1 so that the markets will understand   that the LSAPs will end in June as anticipated  You’ll recall that in January some of us felt that   our statement read a little too negatively on the economy, given our forecasts, and indeed, the   Committee did get some criticism along these lines once we released our January statement  I   March 15, 2011 101 of 165              think we should make sure that our statement language is well calibrated to our read on the   current conditions and our forecast  To my mind, the tone of paragraph 1 in alternative B read   better in the Tealbook than it did in this most recent version  But I think actually paragraph 1 in   alternative C is even a better characterization of economic conditions  After all, this Committee,   in terms of its forecast, is still forecasting well above trend growth for the next two years  I think   the one thing that might help in paragraph 1, alternative B, is that I might suggest dropping the   word “somewhat” from the first sentence and suggest “is on a firmer footing” rather than   “somewhat firmer footing”  “Somewhat firmer” seems like there are too many adverbs and   adjectives here to describe what’s going on  Just a thought   Second, as the economy continues to strengthen, I think we will need to begin revising   our policy course later this year, as I suggested earlier  This means our language in paragraph   4—that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the funds rate for   an extended period—is beginning to ring untrue  We should consider the alternative C language   that changes “extended period” to “some time” and “exceptionally low” to just “low” if not at   this meeting, then perhaps at our April meeting  We have to remember that we can change the   language and even raise rates considerably and a policy will remain very accommodative for   some time to come   Third, I strongly support Professor—“Professor”?  He’s still a Professor—Kocherlakota’s   recommendations on paragraph 2  I think we got a quick unanimous read on that; I support that    Paragraph 2 also is a statement about the economy’s performance relative to our mandate  Thus,   I’m a little uneasy about phrasing this in terms of the unemployment rate  After all, our mandate   is about price stability and maximum employment, not about the unemployment rate  They are,   of course, related, but they are different  Moreover, we will need to begin exiting from   March 15, 2011 102 of 165              accommodation well before the unemployment rate is at a level that is acceptable to the average   person  So the language of continuing to stress the unemployment rate as our indicator may   complicate our communications as we plan on exit  I think we need to find an opportunity—if   not today, then in April—to start using mandate-consistent language in this paragraph, talking   about the level of employment or the level of unemployment rather than unemployment rates    Unemployment rates, as we know, lag the economy and lag both employment levels and   unemployment levels   Finally, as I discussed at our January meeting, I think it is extremely important that we   begin planning for our exit from this period of extraordinarily accommodative policy, and I’m   glad we’ll be reopening this discussion in April   In my view, our exit strategy should be thought of as a plan, and it should have the   following desirable characteristics, which I would suggest  First, the plan should be a systematic   one, entailing some degree of commitment to the way we will execute the strategy, since this will   reduce uncertainty in the markets and in the public’s mind  But it also should allow for some   conditionality on the evolution of economic conditions as, in fact, all good monetary policy   should do  Second, the plan should be easy to explain to the public and to market participants,   and we should make every effort that when we decide on the plan, that we, in fact, communicate   it to the public  Third, the plan should be able to return us to a “normal” operating environment   in a timely way, and I think we need to communicate to the markets what that normal is  That is   to say, the plan ought to articulate where we’re going  From my perspective, what I mean by   “normal” is that we’re using the funds rate once again as our policy instrument, running under a   corridor or operating system in which the primary credit rate and the interest rate on excess   reserves are the upper and lower boundaries, respectively, of that corridor  This Committee has   March 15, 2011 103 of 165              not decided on that, but I take that as my notion of what we think is a likely outcome for what’s   normal  But we need to communicate that  I note that if that is the normal plan, then this will   necessitate shrinking the volume of excess reserves by a significant amount to get there, which   will entail selling assets, not just relying on redemptions  And fourth, I would say that we need   to return the composition of our balance sheet predominantly to US Treasury securities   Whatever exit plan we have, it seems to me, needs to get us to those places  This is going   to be a tricky process to unwind from our extraordinary degree of accommodation  Having this   Committee publicly commit to a numerical inflation objective could prove quite helpful to this   process as it will help keep inflation expectations well anchored, which is essential to our success   in exiting, as illustrated in the Tealbook scenario where inflation expectations, in fact, rise; I   talked about that earlier, and that is not a very attractive scenario for us   I think we can think about asset sales in two pieces  I think of there being an underlying   trend of asset sales, at a basically low, modest level, that would go on a continuous basis; I call   those continuing sales  You might also think about a set of conditional sales, sales that would   expand more or less depending on the state of the economy, and, in fact, we might even relate   those to when we choose to make funds rates decisions  Thus, we could establish a modest rate   of selling assets, speed that up as we raise rates, and slow it down when we choose to pause, if   necessary  I don’t want to go into more details of that  The important thing is that by tying our   asset sales to both unconditional and conditional decisions, meaning a steady state of sales and a   set of sales that were related to our target interest rate, they will be state contingent and   dependent on the same factors then that govern our interest rate decisions  I think such a   systematic approach will reduce uncertainty in the markets about our exit plan and commit us to   March 15, 2011 104 of 165              getting back to normal in a timely fashion  I think those are the key elements in my mind that   might make for a good plan   Rather than spell that out in more details now, I’m going to be circulating a memo to the   Committee in a few days with a little more detail about how I’m thinking about that, and I hope   that it will provide some food for thought as we get ready for our April discussion  Thank you,   Mr Chairman    Mr Chairman    I am fine with the suggestion that President Williams made  I think   that’s good  I do think, just to give the staff and others some food for thought, we also use the   phrase in this statement several times, “underlying inflation rate”—is that a code word for   “core”?  And I think as we try to move away from the language of “core,” thinking about how   we use the phrase “underlying inflation” is something that I think we need to give some thought   to in the future    So we might want to think about moving toward language—    Exactly    Yes, just a suggestion  I agree with President Lockhart about the   “subdued” language—it makes me a little nervous  Couldn’t we just say that “Inflation   expectations have remained stable, and measures of underlying inflation have firmed”?    Put it in the parking lot    Well, I suggested that in my memo earlier, so I think it’s a good idea    I think one of the efforts here is to convey the notion that we have   expressed concern about falling inflation  We are confusing rates and levels, and so, while it   may be subdued, it has also stabilized in the sense that we are no longer getting more   disinflation  I guess that is the concept    I prefer “subdued” to “low,” but—    I’m generally very supportive of this  I think transparency is a good   thing, as a general rule  I do share a little bit of the concerns about how this might work in   different regimes with different Chairmen, and I don’t know that I know the answer to that   problem, but I think it’s something to give some thought to   The other thing is, I want to pick up on an observation that Bill made, which I thought is   very interesting  I have often felt and expressed the view that our statements are very confining   at times  Our language is very confining, and I’ve often said I wish I could blow up the   statement every meeting and write a new one so that we don’t feel so constrained about how we   say things  Bill’s observation was the thought that, well, might this be a mechanism where we   can become more flexible in the way we write the statements, and I didn’t hear anybody else say   anything about that  I thought that is an intriguing idea, and I wonder what the subcommittee   had thought about this or what other people might think about that  It was just a reaction   March 15, 2011 139 of 165               Just a quick reaction  I think it’s kind of silly to have them different    It’s going to be hard for people to understand and hard for markets to understand    Much less us keeping track  "
9212,2011-04-26,PLOSSER,"  Yes—a clarification, Brian  I’m looking at figures 17 and 18 on page 3   about the GC repos and the securities lending  You made a comment that part of the problem   was the lack of Treasury collateral in some of these markets, which helps to explain a little bit of   the rise in the securities lending and some of the differences in the repo rates  Is that related at   all to the fact that we are buying most of the Treasuries that are coming out through our purchase   plan, and that we are actually making Treasury collateral scarce in doing this exercise?   April 26–27, 2011 16 of 244               But if you go to the other panel, with the securities lending, since   November there’s been a rather marked increase in securities lending by the Fed  That’s the   background you’re talking about?    Is there any reason to believe that that reaction will be any different this   time than it would be in any other tightening cycle where we reverse?  In most cycles we reverse   course at some point  Is there any reason to believe that’s any more of a concern in this period   than in any other period?   April 26–27, 2011 25 of 244               Thank you, Mr Chairman  I want to thank the staff for their memos on   exit and monetary policy implementation frameworks  I think they hit on most of the important   issues that we need to grapple with as we formulate a strategy   In my view, I think our strategy needs three basic principles  First, I think we need to   articulate a plan to the public telling them what monetary policy framework we are normalizing   to, then offer them a plan about how to get there  Second, the plan should be systematic to the   extent it’s possible, entailing some degree of commitment to the way we’ll execute the strategy    This will also reduce uncertainty in the marketplace  And third, it should allow for some   conditionality on the evolution of economic and financial conditions  Like always, our policy   should be state-contingent   April 26–27, 2011 37 of 244              I am in strong support of the corridor system over the floor system as our normal   operating framework, although I recognize that we will need to operate on something like a floor   system for some time as we exit, given the size of our balance sheet  In my view, the political   risks of operating a policy with a very large balance sheet, of potentially unlimited size, are just   too great  The floor system makes our balance sheet largely a new discretionary instrument, yet   we have almost no theory on how we use this new tool, except perhaps at the zero bound   How big is too big?  What criteria will we use to decide the size of our balance sheet?    Without some constraints imposed on the size and uses of the balance sheet, we will find many   ideas proffered from all over government as to how we should use it to someone’s advantage,   whether it be to reduce government debt or to be a development bank for some grand industrial   or infrastructure policy  I think these risks overwhelm any efficiency gains one could posit that   are associated with the floor system  Besides, the corridor system likely captures the biggest   portion of the efficiency gains, so the marginal benefits of going to a floor system, I think, are   relatively small   The background memo suggests that we don’t need to decide now whether to use a   corridor versus floor system, because we will learn along the way about the calibration between   the IOER and the funds rate  True, but this doesn’t address my concerns  There will be learning,   but I think we need to know where we’re headed and to convey that to the public if we are to   develop an appropriate strategy because, as Bill said, it may affect the pace of sales you choose   and other aspects of your exit strategy  Moreover, clearly signaling that we will be shrinking our   balance sheet to a more normal size would help anchor expectations of inflation by reassuring   the public that we will not let our large balance sheet lead to higher inflation  If we are to   prevent our balance sheet from creating unacceptable inflation down the road, we will have to   April 26–27, 2011 38 of 244              sell assets maybe at a pace more rapidly than some would prefer at this point  Thus, one of the   aspects that we need to communicate is that we will need to be able to signal to the market that   we are prepared to do just that  In the early stages of this crisis, we talked about the speed at   which we cut rates and adjusted policy, and we also talked about the chances that on exit, we   may have to be just as aggressive coming out as we were going in  And we need to make sure   the public understands that we are prepared to do that, if necessary   Getting to a corridor system will require us to shrink our balance sheet within a   reasonable time frame and will require asset sales  If our goal is to return to an all-Treasuries   portfolio, we will need to sell MBS  In general, I believe we should aim to sell assets fairly   quickly but without disrupting the market  We have argued all along that the effect of asset   purchases is through stock effects, not flow effects; thus, I don’t think selling assets will be that   disruptive, nor do I see why there seems to be so much concern about a moderate pace of sales   similar to the pace at which we purchased those assets  Moreover, holding on to assets, which   are a good source of collateral in the financial markets, when there is an appetite and a growing   economy for these types of assets in the marketplace could be more distortionary than supplying   that collateral   Finally, I think that the pace of sales should vary with economic conditions—that is, it   should be state-contingent  Now, I offered one such suggestion on how to do that in my exit   strategy memo—namely, because the public generally understands how our interest rate   decisions reflect the outlook for inflation and growth, we could tie our sales to the interest rate   changes  Let me clarify that I am not suggesting that we use asset sales as a separate policy   instrument, as the staff memo seems to suggest; I believe we should rely on the interest rate as   our primary policy instrument  Instead, I want our sales pace to be responsive to economic   April 26–27, 2011 39 of 244              conditions  Tying the volume of sales to changes in interest rates is just one way of doing that    Actually, the way I think about it, such a strategy eliminates asset sales as a separate   discretionary policy tool, as the sales are triggered by the same criteria as our interest rate   decisions  If economic conditions are such that we want to raise our policy interest rate, then we   should be able to speed up our asset sales, because in such cases economic growth would be   stronger and inflation likely to be rising  Once the balance sheet is normalized, we have full   control over the funds rate, and, obviously, the sales program would come to a halt  I also think   that the alternative of separating these tools and using them independently is dangerous  It risks   having either the interest rate instrument or the balance sheet getting behind the curve in our exit   strategy   I think we have less confidence in exactly the effect on market conditions and interest   rates from our asset sales than we do about the effect of interest rates, so the degree of tightening   we are likely to be achieving with asset sales is highly uncertain at this point  Now, others might   prefer a different method of achieving a state-contingent policy  That’s fine, so long as we   articulate what criteria we will be using for determining that pace of sales  But leaving sales to   be a wholly discretionary decision only adds uncertainty and confusion to the marketplace  And   making the sales completely unresponsive to the economy by putting them on some   predetermined path is likely, as President Bullard suggested, not to be optimal, and it may not   even be very credible  Or if the economy was likely to weaken, this Committee would most   likely choose to slow the pace of sales if they thought that was necessary   We justified the first round of asset purchases as credit easing to help stabilize fragile   financial markets  Financial markets are no longer fragile  Hence, we should begin unwinding   April 26–27, 2011 40 of 244              these purchases and explain that we are doing so not as a tightening move, but as a move toward   normalcy as markets return to normalcy   Let me summarize by highlighting the questions that were submitted in the memo  On   question 1 regarding investments, I do think that the natural first step in exit would be to stop   reinvestments of both agencies and Treasuries  The natural time to do that is in June when the   LSAP2 is completed  I note that the Chairman will have another press briefing in June, and that   will give him the opportunity to fully explain what we are doing and add commentary   On question 2, regarding whether asset sales should be on a predetermined or   preannounced path or actively varied with response to the economic outlook, I do think we need   to announce a plan so the public understands where we are headed and how to get there  I also   think we should vary the pace of sales with market conditions  My guess is that we will do that   anyway  Therefore, we should explain to the public the criteria that we’ll be using  The idea of   tying it to interest rate decisions simply says we are using the same decision for asset sales and   interest rate decisions  If you really believe they are substitutes, you could do them together  If   you really wanted to calibrate the difference, you could raise interest rates at a little lesser pace   and sell assets at a more rapid pace to get the same effect  I’m not as confident that we can   calibrate it that carefully, but you certainly could do that   Regarding the sequencing of actions in question 3, I would not be in favor of delaying   liftoff of the funds rate in favor of asset decisions  I think we should sell assets and raise them   concurrently  The policy rate will remain our instrument of monetary policy even if, practically,   it is the IOER for a while  In my memo, asset sales would simply be a byproduct of the decision,   not an independent decision  The point of asset sales is to return our balance sheet to a more   normal size and composition so that we can run a corridor system   April 26–27, 2011 41 of 244              Finally, question 4—I agree with all the points  We should shrink the SOMA portfolio to   the size necessary to implement our monetary policy framework  I think the framework should   be a corridor system  We should return to an all-Treasuries portfolio, which means we will need   to sell agency securities  We should be transparent and communicate our exit plan, including   how our asset sales will be adjusted in response to changes in economic conditions  Thank you,   Mr Chairman    Well, again, that’s where I was talking about the calibration  If we   were comfortable enough with the calibration, you could choose to split the difference, if you   will  I don’t know that I’m as confident about that calibration, but I would be open to discussing   that  The key, I think, is that we tie the two together, so that they’re not two independent   decisions that we are making in some way; that’s what I was trying to get at    What really matters is your explanation, Narayana    Yes  This is a question both to you, Mr Chairman, and Narayana  If   we think about sales and the IOER–federal funds rate as substitutes, let’s suppose the Taylor rule   says that the funds rate ought to be 2 percent  Assuming that these are really substitutes, if we   April 26–27, 2011 46 of 244              haven’t sold assets—and let’s just say there’s 200 basis points of ease within the portfolio—that   means we need to set the IOER at 4 percent  That means if we don’t sell, we are going to have to   be raising rates faster than we might otherwise choose to do in that environment  Am I   understanding that correctly?    Whew, I’m glad I passed that test  [Laughter]    Well, over four years, right?    Okay    I have just two observations  I think you’re being asked to synthesize a   lot of diverse views, and I understand that  I think your first point was that the asset sales or the   reduction in the balance sheet would depend on economic conditions  I would encourage you to   say that they can either be slowed down or speeded up, because I think the tone of how you say it   will suggest that it’s only likely to go one way  It would be helpful to say that it could go either   faster or slower depending on economic conditions    Up or down    Okay  On the last part, I would recommend against the phrase   “relatively late” because I think that connotes a longer period of time, and it may not be longer  I   would suggest that you consider something like, “Many of the participants agreed that asset sales   would begin after”—just “after”—“initial rate increases”  And “after” can mean it could be   short or it could be long  It just leaves it undefined    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Economic conditions in the Third District   improved moderately over the intermeeting period in all sectors except construction    Employment in our three states increased at an annual rate of 14 percent during the three months   ending in March, comparable to the pace in the nation  The unemployment rate now stands at   84 percent, 04 percentage point below the national rate   Pennsylvania has shown considerably more strength than New Jersey, where the   government sector has been shedding jobs at a very rapid pace  The stress on state and local   budgets is probably the biggest risk at this time in our District’s economy  Large budget deficits   loom  In fiscal year 2012, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities is projecting a budget   April 26–27, 2011 118 of 244              shortfall in Pennsylvania of $42 billion, or about 16 percent of the 2011 fiscal year budget, and a   shortfall of $105 billion for New Jersey, 37 percent of its budget  Delaware’s is more modest—  a shortfall of only $208 million, about 64 percent of its budget   The region’s manufacturing output continues to increase in April, but to no surprise, it   did pull back from its 30-year high, which is what it was in March, to a more moderate pace, but   still one consistent with continuing modest growth  The indexes of new orders, shipments, and   employment also weakened somewhat this month but still point to continued expansion  Exports   account for a little more than 12 percent of manufacturing output in our District  In response to a   special question, 80 percent of the firms said they haven’t experienced supply disruptions from   the recent crisis in Japan or any other international event  Ten percent indicate they were   currently experiencing some problems, and another 10 percent expressed some concern of   possible future effects  This is something we will continue to monitor, but the effects are   modest   In the real estate sector, talking to two very large homebuilders suggests that traffic to   date is up significantly over last year this time, and their sales volumes over the first quarter of   this year are well above what they were last year   We continue to see signs of increasing price pressures on firms who are becoming better   able to pass along their increases to their customers  Although the prices-paid index in our April   survey decreased, it remains at a very, very high level  The prices-received index, though, unlike   the other indexes in April, moved up again; that is eight consecutive months in which the prices-  received index has risen  Firms are continuing to expect that they will be making further price   increases over the course of the second half of the year   April 26–27, 2011 119 of 244              In an environment where policy is very accommodative, the key to assuring that   commodity price increases don’t pass through to general inflation is that inflation expectations   remain well anchored, which in turn depends on the credibility of the Fed to deliver on its price   stability mandate   Core inflation has been accelerating, and the Tealbook has been revising up its forecast    Forward inflation compensation 5 to 10 years ahead has been moving up, and the Tealbook says   that the staff models indicate that the rise is driven mainly by liquidity and inflation in risk   premiums rather than increases in expected inflation  Unfortunately, I don’t take much comfort   in the fact that inflation risk premiums are rising  I read that as an indication that our credibility   may be less stable than I’d like it to be   My forecast has not changed much since January  I revised down slightly my economic   growth for the first half of 2011 because of the weaker consumption data we saw in the first   quarter  But I held the second half of 2011 and 2012 roughly the same  I believe the weakness   we have experienced is due to temporary factors, such as the severe weather we had in January   and February, the initial shock from the sharp rise in oil prices, and some supply disruptions   from the earthquake and tsunami in Japan  Financial markets have taken all that potentially bad   news in stride, suggesting that firmer recovery is shaping up  Earnings continue to be strong,   and firms are doing well  I continue to expect output growth in the United States to be slightly   above trend over the next two years, employment growth to strengthen, and the unemployment   rate to move down  I revised up my inflation forecast for this year but expect some reversal of   that increase next year as oil and commodity prices stabilize or perhaps reverse course   As the economy continues to recover, we will need to begin withdrawing policy   accommodation  Given inflation developments, I think that time may be sooner than what’s   April 26–27, 2011 120 of 244              priced into the federal funds market, which expects the funds rate to increase in the first half of   next year, and very likely sooner than what is in the Tealbook, which assumes no change in the   fed funds rate until the third quarter of next year  My forecast incorporates a steeper policy path,   with a reduction in accommodation beginning sometime in the second half of this year   Our colleague Tom Hoenig has been saying that even after exit begins, policy will remain   very accommodative for some time to come  I think we should make an effort to explain this to   the public and prepare them for the start of normalization  I have also been sympathetic to his   view that moving away from the zero bound could be very beneficial to the functioning of   financial markets and would not amount to significant tightening as policy would continue, as I   said, to be very accommodative  We have a very good opportunity to convey some of these   ideas over the next two meetings—this meeting and in June—and begin to change our language   substantially, because the Chairman will be holding press briefings at which he can be more   expansive than a one-page statement can be  I think we should take advantage of that   opportunity Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Our second round of LSAPs is nearing its   scheduled conclusion in June  I was not in favor of this policy when it was implemented in   November, but I see little to be gained at this point of ending it early  We are almost done   As we discussed last time, I thought it important that our April statement signal that   LSAPs will end in June, and alternative B, paragraph 3, does that  In general, I do prefer the   April 26–27, 2011 183 of 244              language in alternative C, but like President Lacker, I can live with something closer to B    However, I would like the statement to go somewhat further in preparing the public for exit and   giving the Committee more flexibility, so that it can act sooner rather than later, if necessary  I   think this is a good time to begin changing the language  Because the Chairman is having a   press briefing after this meeting and the next meeting, it gives us opportunities to make more-  extensive language changes in the statement than we might feel comfortable doing otherwise    The Chairman will be able to explain what we mean by our changes rather than letting the public   divine what we meant   First, I think we should take the opportunity when the LSAPs end in June to also stop   reinvestments of MBS  We should signal this in the statement by saying the Committee will   complete $600 billion of longer-term Treasury purchases by the end of the quarter, and at that   time intends to end the policy of reinvesting principal payments from securities  The market has   reacted quite benignly to the Treasury sales of MBS  I don’t anticipate such an adverse reaction   to our announcement that investments will end, and it will help prepare the public for our   eventual exit  I think paragraph 4 is becoming more problematic, given the inflation and   inflation expectation numbers  Are inflation trends really subdued?  Are inflation expectations   really stable?  I think we should consider adjusting the language, if not today, then in June  Is   “extended period” consistent with potentially raising the funds rate, as President Kocherlakota   suggested, by year-end?   Even the Tealbook puts a nonnegligible chance of raising rates this year, although the   point forecast suggests a longer period before liftoff  We don’t want to mislead the public, but   paragraph 4, I’m afraid, might do that  Instead, I think we could say, “The Committee will   maintain the target rate of the federal funds rate from 0 to ¼ percent today, and based on its   April 26–27, 2011 184 of 244              outlook for the economy and inflation, anticipates that it will remain low for some time to   come”  This works, because paragraph 2 discusses our outlook for inflation—the fact that we   expect the effects of higher energy and commodity prices to have transitory effects on general   inflation  And paragraph 1 explains that labor market conditions are improving  Because we are   releasing new forecasts at the press briefing, changing the language to refer to projections seems   sensible   I would also note that among the various policy rules in the Tealbook, the so-called   growth rate or first-difference rules suggest that the funds rate should be about 50 basis points   this quarter and 90 basis points by the third quarter  Of course, different rules give different   guidance, and I have argued before why I like something more like the first-difference rule, in   part because of measurement problems, but I won’t repeat those arguments today   A couple of wording choices we talked about last time could be implemented today and   explained during the press conference  I would like us to consider changing paragraph 2 so that   it refers to—and I raised this point last time—“employment” or “unemployment” rather than the   “unemployment rate”  Our mandate is in terms of maximum employment, not the   unemployment rate  Labor force participation rates are a variable we have even less control over   than we do employment  By emphasizing the unemployment rate, we risk giving the idea that   we won’t begin exiting until the unemployment rate is back down to the natural rate  But this is   misleading  I believe we will need to act before the unemployment rate gets back down to a   normal level   I think alternative C’s characterization of where the economy is relative to our dual   mandate—namely, that employment and inflation have moved somewhat closer to the levels that   the Committee judges is mandate consistent—rings truer than paragraph 2 in alternative B,   April 26–27, 2011 185 of 244              which seems to brush aside the recent increases in inflation and inflation forecasts  That is why I   generally prefer alternative C   We also should consider clarifying what we mean by underlying inflation  As President   Lacker was suggesting, we had this conversation last time as well  I think we have some concept   of inflation over the medium run, not just core inflation in mind  So why don’t we say that,   rather than referring to underlying inflation?   I’m also worried that claiming expectations remain stable may not be entirely credible    Indeed, some have argued that, in fact, expectations of inflation have risen, reflecting the abating   concerns about deflation  Five-year, five-year TIPS have risen considerably since last fall, and   so to say that inflation expectations are stable may be a little bit awkward  In fact, if we recall,   we wanted to get them up somewhat since last fall   So I would suggest that the last sentence of paragraph 1 reads something like as follows    “Inflation has picked up in recent months, but longer-term inflation expectations remain within   historical norms, and indicators of inflation over the medium term are subdued”  I think that   language would fit well with the Chairman’s emphasis on our forecast in his press conference,   and he could get away from using underlying inflation    “Inflation has picked up in recent months, but longer-term inflation   expectations remain within historical norms, and indicators of inflation over the medium run are   subdued”    I think communication and transparency are very important policy tools   at this point  This will be especially true as we choreograph our exit of this period of   April 26–27, 2011 186 of 244              accommodation  The changes in language that I am suggesting are some of those I believe that   we might need to implement in the next couple of meetings to prepare the public for the start of   an eventual exit  Thank you, Mr Chairman    “Indicators of inflation over the medium run remain subdued”  As   opposed to “underlying inflation,” and that would play into the forecast language    I’m thinking future  Or you could say, “forecast of inflation over the   medium run”  That’s why this language “underlying inflation” is confusing, because it’s   interpreted as core  What you are really talking about is your predictions of where inflation is   going    Yes, because “underlying” shows up there as well    Mr Chairman?  Can I just make an observation?    It’s about two pieces of the language that are tied together  One is the   issue of what we mean by underlying inflation  That was what I was trying to address  And I   understand what you’re saying  We use it several times, so we’ve got to figure out a way   around, but I think we need to work our way out of that language  And the second is the context   of price stability  I’ve never quite understood exactly what that meant, and I think part of   President Lacker’s effort was to get away from that  I would be happy if we made a commitment   for the staff, as we move through the next set of languages, to try to clean up both of those   concepts in a way that we’re consistent through this, which I think was what your earlier   suggestion was  I think that’s going to be important going forward for us    Can I just say one thought that just occurred to me?    Rather than “recent historical norms,” you could say, “inflation   expectations remain at acceptable levels”  That doesn’t address the volatility of them   necessarily  But maybe that connotes too much    Yes, I withdraw that  I’m sorry  "
9240,2011-06-21,PLOSSER,"  Governor Yellen, we’ve talked a little bit about this, and Philadelphia   made a suggestion a while ago to staff that one of our two-day meetings in the future might be   about such robust policy rules and variations  Using these models as input into that exercise   might be a way to push these things along together, so I would encourage that  That’s a great   idea    Most of what I wanted to say has already been said  I think most of you   remember the conversation a year ago when we talked about inflation dynamics  A lot of the   discussion was about different models that produce different types of inflation; that’s where all   of this got started a little over a year ago, and they’ve made a great effort to pull this together  I   would like to reinforce what Narayana just said, about seeing a summary of these models on a   fairly regular basis  It’s a lot about model uncertainty  We need to understand that we don’t   June 21–22, 2011 28 of 282              know the true models  The second thing I want to tie back into is that there are lots of potential   directions this can lead us and having this work being done in the System allows us to do   potentially a wide range of things, so I want to encourage the production of that information  If   we’re working with multiple models in the System, they will give us a platform as Janet Yellen   said, for thinking about simple rules or robust rules  We’ll learn over time what the Committee   wants to hear and how we’ll best communicate that, but I think this is very good work and will   supplement things that go on in this Committee very well  I want to encourage that process    Thank you, Mr Chairman, I appreciate that  As I said in my memo, I   think we deserve to be as clear as we possibly can about where we are headed  Indeed, if you   think about what “normalization of the balance sheet” means, then if we are on a floor system, or   we don’t specify a corridor system, there is no definition of what normalization means  There is   no level of the balance sheet that is determined  So I think we need more clarity here   I also would argue that in the April minutes we were fairly explicit about it  In the April   minutes we said that monetary policy will “eventually operate through a corridor-type system in   which the federal funds rate trades in the middle of a range, with the IOER rate as the floor and   the discount rate as the ceiling of the range, as opposed to a floor-type system in which a   relatively high level of reserve balances keeps the federal funds rate near the IOER rate”  That   was in the minutes of our last meeting, and by my count, 9 or 10 people spoke about their   preferred system  Eight of them, I believe, preferred a corridor system, and two said we could   wait to decide  I see no reason to keep the public in the dark about this, and I think there are   disadvantages to the floor system, which I want to try to articulate   June 21–22, 2011 32 of 282              Many of us have different reasons for favoring the corridor over the floor  To me, one of   the primary reasons is political risks of operating monetary policy with a very large balance sheet   of potentially unlimited size  Those political risks, I think, are very great  By decoupling the   level of the federal funds rate and the size of the balance sheet, the floor system makes our   balance sheet essentially a new discretionary free parameter, a new tool of policy  We have very   little theory to guide us on how to use that new tool, except perhaps at the zero bound  I stopped   to think about our experience over the past two years as we struggled to determine the   appropriate way to use our balance sheet as a policy instrument, to determine the effectiveness of   that policy, and to understand its transmission mechanism  Because we were at the lower bound   and needed a policy tool, we forged ahead using our judgment, but we didn’t have much   experience to inform that judgment   The floor system puts no constraint on the size of the balance sheet, but we don’t have   much experience to inform that judgment  And without some theory, it seems to me, on which to   determine an optimal size of the balance sheet, and without some constraint imposed on the size   of our balance sheet via an implementation framework, we might find it very difficult to fight   against ideas proffered from others in government as to how we might use that balance sheet to   one sector or another’s advantage  We could be asked to engage in credit allocations rather than   monetary policy  We could be asked to fund government debt to fund government spending    We would have few defenses, because, presumably, the balance sheet is uncorrelated and   unrelated to the delivery of monetary policy  So it would be very difficult for us to say no  This   Committee and Chairman, I think, most likely would surely resist such calls, but can we be as   confident about future Committees?  Given the political whims in the Congress, formalizing such   June 21–22, 2011 33 of 282              a discretionary framework might put our independence at risk  While today we may view such   actions as a tail risk, it would have serious consequences were it to occur   In terms of the efficiency of the floor system, it’s true that under the floor system there is   no opportunity cost of reserves, and banks wouldn’t need to engage in inefficient activities to   economize on reserve balances as they do in a corridor system  But given that we now have the   ability to pay interest on reserves, which reduces the opportunity cost of holding reserves, and,   therefore, reduces the associated inefficiencies, we have reduced the wedge in the inefficiencies   greatly just by paying interest on reserves  As a staff memo from April indicated, there are ways   within a corridor system to minimize these costs further, and to lower the administrative costs on   the Federal Reserve associated with a closer management of the supply of reserves  To my   mind, the risks to the floor system vastly outweigh any potential efficiency gains   Others favor a return to the corridor system for other reasons  It’s more familiar to us,   and several central banks around the world use a corridor system  It also avoids some of the   governance issues we would need to contend with under a floor system in which the IOER rate   would effectively become the policy rate  Here again, the Chairman has pledged to continue   engaging this Committee in setting the IOER rate  But is that enough to bind future chairmen?    We are concerned about the institution here  Does having the decision rights for IOER resting   solely with the Board contravene the Federal Reserve Act’s requirement that the FOMC set   monetary policy?  This is a knotty governance question  Are the advantages of the floor system   truly large enough to justify a review of such governance issues and potentially challenge the   Federal Reserve Act?   For whatever reasons, many Committee members have already discussed their preference   for a corridor system  So why should we want to pull back from our April minutes statement?    June 21–22, 2011 34 of 282              Why not just go ahead and announce that that is our goal?  It tells the public that we will shrink   our balance sheet, and we will shrink it enough to operate in a corridor-like system  What can   we learn during the intervening period?  We can learn something about a floor system because   for some time we’ll be operating on what looks like a floor system, as the balance sheet is very   large  But I’m not sure we would learn anything more that would convince me that the costs are   sufficiently small or the benefits sufficiently large to maintain a floor system  I think delaying   serves no particular purpose  It muddles our intentions  It creates its own source of uncertainty    And so I would argue strongly that we go ahead and commit that a corridor system is going to be   our operating environment going forward, and part of our job is to get us there in a way that is   consistent with the dual mandate    Mr Chairman, can I just make one comment?  One of the concerns   about the floor system that I didn’t mention earlier is that under a floor system, we don’t know   for sure what will happen to the fed funds market, whether or not it will survive, and therefore   whether or not we can keep a rate depending on whether that says an active market when there   are plenty of reserves  I don’t know the answer to that question   June 21–22, 2011 38 of 282               But the volumes are way down    Can I question the word “efficient” here?  What do we mean by that?    What are the criteria to decide what “efficient” is?    I’m a little bit concerned about symmetry here  The Chairman at one   point last year talked about “extended period,” and we gave the example where, in the Greenspan   era, they dropped some language that they changed the very next meeting  Could we be in an   environment where we didn’t want to wait that long—that things would change, and we may   have to move sooner than three months?  I’m a little bit worried about the asymmetry that you   are building into it that might put us at risk of not moving as fast as we might have to    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’m generally supportive  I think this is a   big step forward in informing the public about how we’re thinking about this, and putting this   out as a public document in some form will be very helpful  Obviously, I still prefer a corridor   system  I wish we could make that more explicit  I have one other suggestion in terms of the   timing issues  I’m comfortable with taking them out, but if we take them out, as President Fisher   said, we should also take out the “four to five years” as well as the “few months” or the   “relatively soon thereafter”  Those should come out as well because we may be faster than that   or longer than that  It would be fine with me if all those would come out  I would like to make   one other suggestion, and this is basically for clarity  In paragraph 5 where it says in the last   sentence, “but it could be adjusted in response to material changes,” I would like to see that “be   adjusted up or down,” to be explicit that the Committee could choose to speed up sales or slow   them down—just add “up or down” after “adjusted” to be clear that they understand they could   go both ways    I have a question about the reinvestment policy going forward  The   table on exhibit 4, chart 20, shows that the reinvestment strategy has the same maturity structures   that we have been doing  What are the tradeoffs to thinking about changing the maturity   distribution, skewing it perhaps more toward short-term securities or Treasury bills?  What’s the   thinking about the mixture, the maturity structure of the reinvestments going forward?    What would be the consequences, do you think, in the markets of   skewing that slightly toward shortening the maturity structure a little bit?    Thank you, Mr Chairman  The economic recovery has hit another soft   patch  The near-term economic growth is weaker than I anticipated it would be earlier this year    But so far the recent weak data have not materially changed my view on the path of the recovery   in the intermediate term  I expect both growth to accelerate in the second half of this year and   into next year, a bit above trend, and the unemployment rate to go down gradually   I have for some time argued in this Committee that the shocks that have hit our economy   in this crisis have had important permanent elements to them  As a consequence, I have tried to   argue that the traditional measures of resource slack may be overstated, and that, in fact, there   June 21–22, 2011 175 of 282              were limits to the effectiveness of monetary policy to mitigate some of this fall in potential   output  To that end, I support the Chairman’s proposal to begin characterizing our exit strategy   in public communications, including the postmeeting press conference and his monetary policy   report to the Congress  I would also encourage us to continue our discussion of explicit inflation   objectives as well  The press briefing and testimony format allow for a fuller discussion of such   an objective to help anchor expectations as we exit and to explain how a numerical objective   would help fit into the context of our dual mandate  Explaining the difference between the   inflation objective and the unemployment rate, which is something beyond the control of   monetary policy in the longer term, is both subtle and not easy  Trying to do this in the   statement would be too difficult, but the postmeeting press conferences and briefings are a way   around that   Given the inflation developments and the economic outlook, I am increasingly   uncomfortable with the funds rate sitting at zero  The Taylor rule framework suggests that it is   appropriate that we begin to remove accommodation as inflation accelerates and the   unemployment rate falls, as forecasted last year  Moreover, I am concerned that we are allowing   imbalances to build up in the financial sector because the interest rates are so low  I could easily   see us simultaneously raising the funds rate by 50 basis points when we stop reinvestment  In   discussing the sequence of steps, we shouldn’t give the impression that large time frames can   elapse between our sequencing of events  We should make sure the public understands that even   after we initialize normalization, monetary policy will remain fairly accommodative for some   time to come  To give the Committee more flexibility, and to prepare the public, we need to   seriously consider changing the forward guidance and the reinvestment sometime in the next   couple of meetings, if the current forecast plays out as anticipated   June 21–22, 2011 176 of 282              At this meeting, I can go along with alternative B  I do have two observations about   language  The sentence in the first paragraph referring to “a loss of momentum in the labor   market” strikes me as going somewhat beyond the facts  I fear that phrases like “loss of   momentum” connote to many some indication of a forecast and future path—that is, serial   correlation that may or may not turn out to be the case  The previous sentence in the first   paragraph says that the pace of recovery is slow in the first half of the year, and to me that would   seem to cover any additional observations we need to make about the labor market  I’m not sure   we need that sentence at all; I would just strike it  But if that’s unacceptable, I would prefer to   simply say in the second sentence, “Recent labor market indicators have been somewhat weaker   than anticipated” and drop the word “momentum”   My second observation concerns the language in the last sentence of that paragraph about   “longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable”  I raised this issue last time because at   least some measures of longer-term expectations, if you look at TIPS over the past 10 months,   have actually moved quite a bit, as much as 100 basis points on some measures  Other measures   of longer-term expectations, like the SPF and others, have been more stable, but they have   historically been stable  So I am worried about the connotation of longer-term expectations   remaining stable  I would suggest we replace “have remained stable” with “remain near   historical norms”  That’s all I have, Mr Chairman    Let me get the right piece of paper here  I suggested we could simply   say, “Recent labor market indicators have been somewhat weaker than anticipated”  And that   follows from the previous sentence that says that the economy has been a little weaker than we   anticipated    I think that’s in keeping with President Dudley’s suggestion  We   should just state what the facts are    Well, I was just going to comment, because in the last two meetings, we   have talked about exactly this  When the balance of risk actually rose for both inflation and   output at the last meeting, we resisted reporting that in the statement  I am all in favor of talking   about whether there is a way to systematically communicate this, either through the SEP or what   we publish, but like you, I would be reluctant  to do it on the fly here    One of the things that we want to think about is, when we talk about   expectations, it is fairly vague  It’s not well defined in some sense, and different people look at   different things  Going forward, we might think about how to structure that with a little more   precision, if we can, about what it is we are actually referring to  That’s just a suggestion to   think about improving that language    And they do behave differently sometimes    Just a suggestion  I haven’t got the right wording here, but we could   say, “We will eliminate our holdings of agency securities as promptly as possible while   minimizing the effect on”—saying we want to get these off our portfolio  We don’t want to   disrupt the market, but we are going to do it as promptly as we can without disrupting the   market, some phrase like that     Right  So it’s done quickly, but it’s conditional on—    Mr Chairman, what about the other—is it “two to three” or “about   three”?  "
9264,2011-08-01,PLOSSER,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll try to be brief  My comments generally   fall along the lines of President Kocherlakota’s  I’m fairly comfortable with items 1 through 5  I   think they are standard practice as long as we’re using market prices for those operations  That   seems mostly straightforward, as far as I’m concerned   I think where it gets a little more difficult is in items 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10  In each of those   cases, there’s this presumption that the market is not functioning and needs fixing in some sense,   August 1, 2011 27 of 53              and I think that’s where we’re getting into a little more difficult territory  I agree with President   Williams that parts of this are about liquidity, being a lender of last resort, but I think that   because it’s the Treasury, it is particularly muddled and dangerous territory to be treading  We   have faced negative repo rates before  I’m thinking of item 6 here, and questioning what we   mean by market functioning  In some of these areas that involve more policy choices or changes   in our policy, I’d like the Desk to be a little more explicit about what they mean by market   functioning and to what extent it needs repairing in some sense  That is, do we know what the   right prices might need to be for some of these items?  I think that items 6 and 7 I can live with,   but we need to be very careful   I’m particularly troubled by item 8  I think you have two types of money market mutual   funds, including ones that may be a mixture of various types of assets  If those money market   mutual funds have trouble with Treasuries and liquidity, they can always sell other types of   assets  They don’t need to sell their Treasuries, so I think that that’s not a problem  But for   those money market mutual funds that are all Treasuries, it may run the risk of net asset value   challenges  That’s a different sort of problem, and we may have to address that in different   ways  But I’m very cautious and skeptical of item 8 because I don’t know how we’re going to   tell  We don’t have the authority without 13(3), and we would have the difficulty of creating   moral hazard problems  So I’m deeply worried about that   I am very uncomfortable with item 9  That is basically accommodating—and I think it   would be seen as accommodating—financing the public debt  That’s an FOMC decision and not   a Desk decision  So I think we should be very careful, and I would oppose that, unless the   FOMC decided to go forward with such an operation   August 1, 2011 28 of 53              Item 10 is a sterilized version of item 9  While I’m more comfortable with that than   item 9, it does strike me that the reason for going to engage in some kind of swap would be if the   prices weren’t set on defaulted securities or we thought the prices were wrong  That strikes me   as us engaging in actively managing the prices of defaulted securities relative to nondefaulted   securities, and I think that could be problematic   So with those caveats, those are my views  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Yes, I understand that  I like President Rosengren’s suggestion that   what we really need to be doing is thinking more carefully about money market mutual funds in   general  But I would be careful about going down that road under the current circumstances  "
9288,2011-08-09,PLOSSER,"  Just to follow up with that a little bit  In terms of the people who are   dropping out of the labor force, you mentioned teenagers  What about the 55- to 65-year-olds?    Are there people who have lost their jobs, with a large fraction of them just saying, “Well, I’m   never going to get another job  I’m going to go ahead and take retirement and move out”?    Oh, is that right?    Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Business conditions in the Third District   continue to improve modestly since our last meeting, but the pace of that economic expansion is   slower than earlier in the year  Payroll employment growth for the region remains weak  July   employment data for the states won’t be released until the middle of August, next week   sometime, but in June the unemployment rate for our three states moved up to 84 percent—still   significantly below that of the nation as a whole  Manufacturing activity in the region firmed a   bit in July but remains weaker than we saw earlier in the year  Our BOS general activity index   moved back into positive territory after being at a rate of negative 77 in June  It moved up to   32 in July  The indexes of future activity moved up considerably, indicating more optimism   about future conditions on the part of District manufacturers  One supply shipper I talked to on   Friday said that volumes had fallen off the cliff after early in the year, particularly in May and   June  But she was somewhat encouraged by the last two weeks of July, when actually their   August 9, 2011 51 of 162              volume of shipments was creeping back up again  Although not to the level they’d like to see   them, at least they were moving in the right direction   Turning to the nation, the incoming data have been weaker than I anticipated in June  A   month ago, I expected that most of the temporary effects of the shocks of the winter and spring,   including bad weather, earthquakes, and political turmoil in the Middle East and Europe, were   waning  That was clearly premature  The resurgence of the sovereign debt crisis in Europe and   the debt ceiling debate in the United States have damaged confidence and increased uncertainty,   even as oil prices were stabilizing and industrial activity in Japan was returning to more normal   levels  To add insult to injury, we learned from the latest BEA revisions to output growth that   the recession was deeper and the recovery weaker than we originally thought  Payroll   employment continues to underperform relative to the previous two recoveries, but this is   primarily due to the government sector, which has shed jobs in this cycle  Private-sector   employment, in fact, has been on about the same pace as we saw in similar stages of the past two   recoveries  Despite the below-expected output growth in recent quarters, there are signs the   economy is gradually improving rather than continuing to deteriorate  For example, our research   staff in Philadelphia maintains a high-frequency business conditions index called the ADS index,   which is updated daily as new data become available  This short-term, high-frequency index   began to slide in late 2010 and early 2011  However, beginning in June and into July, that slide   has been reversed and the index is now beginning to gradually rise, suggesting that conditions   are improving, not continuing to deteriorate   The reactions of the financial market, I think, are telling and important, and they appear   to arise from three basic sources  One is the failure of the European Union to deal with their   sovereign debt crisis and that flared up, as we’ve talked about  Another is the deterioration in the   August 9, 2011 52 of 162              debates about US fiscal policy and downgrades  And finally, perhaps more important than   anything, I think, are the BEA revisions to GDP growth  I think that the market is reading in an   assessment that this is telling them something about a reduction in longer-term growth, not just   about cyclical patterns  And with lower potential growth, you would expect the stock market to   respond a lot if they’re discounting a longer stream of lower growth  I don’t know that those are   the right stories  They seem plausible to me  But if that is the correct interpretation of what has   happened and what’s going on, it’s nothing to be very happy about  It’s discouraging and   something that is quite concerning  And yet, it’s not clear at all, if that’s what’s going on,   whether monetary policy can do much about those factors—either the fiscal policy challenges in   Europe or the United States or the reductions in potential GDP growth  We do have the potential   to deal with liquidity problems and crises in the financial markets to retain financial stability    And we should be prepared to adjust those as needed  It is not clear at this point whether   financial markets are truly disrupted or dysfunctional, as they were in 2008, but clearly there is a   lot of volatility   Much of the recent economic commentary is focused on weaker-than-expected real   activity, but we’ve also seen higher inflation than many anticipated  I remain concerned about   recent movements in the economy’s broad-based price measures  Headline inflation and core   inflation measures have been on an upward trend for most of the past year  Core PCE inflation   ran a bit more than 2 percent in the second quarter and appears to be on track for a similar   reading in the third quarter  As the Tealbook notes, we’ve now had three months of upward   revisions in prices for core goods and services  Thus, while we are seeing weaker economic   activity, we are also seeing rising inflation  This is a quite different situation than we faced in   the fall of 2010, when we resumed our asset purchases  At that time, real activity was weakening   August 9, 2011 53 of 162              and inflation was falling, and there were fears of deflation  The recent stabilization and even   retrenchment in the prices for energy and commodities hold a prospect for some reprieve in the   near-term inflation rates  I think we should be careful not to be too sanguine  We have provided   a great deal of monetary accommodation to the economy, and given the stubbornness of the   unemployment rate and the potential for potential GDP to revise downward, the unemployment   rate has been, despite all that, very stubborn in falling  We should be cautious and vigilant that   our previous policies, and perhaps easing actions we might contemplate in the near future, may   translate into a steady rise in inflation over the medium term, even while the unemployment rate   remains elevated  If that were to occur, we would find ourselves in a very, very uncomfortable   predicament   I think that as we contemplate any action today, we should, as Dave Wilcox indicated,   take a longer-term perspective—at least longer term than what the actions of the stock market   have been over the past three or four days  And we must be careful not to leave the impression   that we are reacting to stock market movements  While we may not intend that to be the case, it   could very easily be the result of any actions that we take when we act in the midst of such great   volatility  I would remind everyone of the story that they all know—the famous quote by Paul   Samuelson that the stock market has predicted nine of the past five recessions—and we should   not overreact to the admittedly very tumultuous times in the stock market  I’ll save my other   recommendations for the policy go-round  Thank you, Mr Chairman    I have one question  In the same first paragraph, I was puzzled a little   bit by where we said the pace of recovery appears to reflect “in part,” and we added “although   only”  What does “although only” add to this discussion—what was the purpose of adding that?    Because “in part” is “in part”    Mr Chairman  Excuse me    Can I ask Governor Yellen to read her revised sentence—just to make   sure I got it?    Can I ask a question?  You attached a specific number to the   unemployment rate, but inflation “remains subdued”?    Why—okay  Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I recommend taking no action today, as   proposed in alternative B  I’d prefer the language to be a little bit different, and we’ve already   made one change  I think our goal should be to be careful not to feed a panic by an excessively   negative characterization of the economy, but also not to appear that we have our heads in the   sand and don’t know what’s going on  That’s clearly a delicate balancing act  We need to be   prepared to act in certain circumstances in the future, but we also want to avoid knee-jerk   reactions   My argument for standing pat today is based on five related factors  First of all, I think   it’s too soon to tell the extent to which the disappointing economic data are telling us that the   current weakness is temporary and will soon abate, or alternatively, that the economy has entered   a more persistent regime of slower growth, driven by some combination of headwinds, supply-  side disruptions, and lower potential GDP growth  That scenario of lower GDP growth plays   into what President Bullard said  Europe is in a world where they haven’t seen unemployment   rates below 75 percent for most of the decade  We may be headed for that world as well, and   monetary policy is not the solution to that problem  I don’t think we have enough data in hand at   this point to firmly establish between these alternatives, but clearly the nature of the shock that   we face here should govern, and will guide, the type of response we have  We will always be   uncertain, of course, but we must guard against reacting too quickly when we don’t know  That   leads to my second point, markets have no doubt been volatile, but I’m very dubious of changing   the course of monetary policy at a time when the change could be interpreted as a direct reaction   August 9, 2011 108 of 162              to the turbulence in the stock market, the S&P downgrades, or the policy actions in Europe  It’s   important that financial markets recognize that a systematic approach to achieving our dual   mandate helps policy avoid exacerbating the effects of asset price swings on the economy  Our   credibility would surely suffer if markets perceived us as directly responding to stock market   prices  And whether we say we are or not, I worry that the perception will be there, and the next   time the stock market moves overly aggressively one way or the other, we will be called to   action  Third, I’m very dubious that even more accommodative monetary policy is likely to be a   potent tool that can speed up the renormalization of the economy  As much as I might like it to   be, the evidence seems to be dubious on that front  I think that the portfolio balance effects on   the yield curve that we would be counting on in alternative A policy, or Operation Twist, are   likely to be miniscule  They are easily overwhelmed by actions of investors in flight-to-quality   moves or by shifts in the Treasury supply of securities at various maturities  Fourth, in addition   to being ineffective, further action might actually be bad news  Our near-term zero interest rate   policy is creating distortions in the market and real challenges for banks and money market   mutual funds, not to mention the repo market  As Governor Duke said, banks are turning away   very large deposits because the cost of taking these deposits exceeds any return the bank can   expect to earn on them  At least one money market center bank is charging depositors to keep   larger than their typical amount of funds in the bank  This is an unprecedented action, and we   don’t really know how this will play out  We’ve had a zero interest rate policy now for a long   time, yet economic activity has moved both up and down, and it isn’t clear that further action   will change that pattern  Fifth, monetary policy cannot and should not substitute for fiscal   policy  Fiscal policy in this realm may be more effective than monetary policy in dealing with   some of our concerns  If we overreach and promise more than we can deliver, we will   August 9, 2011 109 of 162              undermine our ability to achieve both our mandates by losing credibility  At the risk of being   somewhat flippant, I will say it anyway  I’m reminded of the old story that, given the path of the   economy, insanity is characterized by repeating the same action over and over and over again,   hoping you will get a different result  So based on these five factors, I prefer to stand pat and   carefully monitor the incoming financial data   You might ask, what might motivate me to reenter in terms of policy?  Well, I think they   both have been alluded to  I certainly think that developments in Europe pose the risk of   significant financial disruptions to the economy  We cannot solve their problems for them, but   we have to act if financial disruptions and dysfunctions in the financial markets spin off from   events in Europe  We need to be prepared to support financial stability and the payment systems,   and we need to do so explicitly for those reasons, not saying that that it will speed up the   necessary structural adjustments in the real economy that we need to work through  To the   extent there are financial strains in dollar funding in Europe, we already have the swap lines in   place  But should that spill over and create dysfunction, I’d be prepared to move and act   aggressively on financial stability  I think we should continue to act if the accumulated data   suggest that the economy is in a protracted period of slow growth and is vulnerable to negative   shocks  And more important, if significantly declining inflation expectations—not just   deflation—were to happen, we might want to act further   Turning to language, I generally supported alternative B  I have some preferences  I   think we removed one sentence that I agree with President Lacker on—“financial conditions”  I   think that the “although only in part” phrase was unnecessary, but I don’t want to hang on that  I   think the tone of the statement could be read as a signal that we have already decided that further   accommodation is needed and will be forthcoming  I think it’s very important we be careful   August 9, 2011 110 of 162              about setting those expectations  I think it’s premature  We can meet in intermeeting periods if   we need to, as President Bullard suggested  I don’t think we want to convey a sense of panic to   the stock market  That would not help them  A voice of stability and reason, I think, is still a   role that we can play   In terms of the change, Mr Chairman—in terms of “extended period”—I am torn there  I   don’t think it will do much good  Since it matches where the market already expects us to be, I   don’t know that providing that date will help  I’m generally, like President Bullard, not in favor   of time-dependent policies—I prefer contingent  In that sense, I think Governor Yellen’s   recommendation is an interesting one, but that would be a huge step  And we run the risk of   confusing the markets and, in fact, even this Committee without making our contingent policies   more explicit and thinking about exactly what those numbers ought to be  I have some sympathy   for moving toward systematic policies like that where we can articulate them, but I think doing it   at this juncture would be risky  But I’m willing to entertain further discussions about that  In   fact, I think that the statement as it is, as I think President Hoenig suggested, will not—I wish,   but I don’t think it will—quell demands, requests, and speculation about QE3  That will be   rampant in the marketplace  I don’t think we will be successful in calming that by this action,   and indeed, we may even be fostering more discussion about it going forward   One more   statement about language  In paragraph 4 of alternative B, where we changed the language to   “promote a stronger pace of economic recovery in a context of price stability,” I don’t like that   language  I would prefer that we just stick to what we’ve said, which is that we will “act as   needed to best foster maximum employment and price stability”  I don’t see a particular need to   change that  Again, it will raise speculation in the marketplace about, what do we mean by that?    August 9, 2011 111 of 162              Are we preparing to do something different?  And I would prefer to stick with the original   language on that  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Well, I think I would respond by saying there would be two pieces to   that  One is why we think the growth is slowing  If I thought that basically we were facing   lower potential growth rates on into the future, I’m not sure monetary policy can do much about   that—the right policy responses are probably different  However, if I thought inflation was   beginning to fall to unacceptably low levels—and President Evans and I could talk about when   that trigger might be met, but certainly deflation would fall into that category—we would talk   about policies where we would want to raise inflationary expectations to prevent that from   happening, which would also help on the side of lowering ex ante real interest rates  So those   would be the ways I would think about  But it would depend on the real side, what we thought   the source of the shock was  How temporary do we believe this is?  If we are moving into a   world, as President Bullard suggests, of a European steady state of low economic growth and a   very high unemployment rate, that’s going to call for a different set of policies   August 9, 2011 112 of 162               I didn’t say the word “risky”  I just said I think we need more   discussion about what that number ought to be  If we want to talk about it in the September   meeting, I’m willing to have that conversation  But I think there’s more uncertainty, it seems to   me, about what we think the path of the unemployment rate’s going to be and what’s appropriate    I think that’s a subject for debate    I’m inclined to, unless I hear something different    Mr Chairman, I have a question    Your proposal for my question about paragraph 4, the language—what   was your—    I need to think about that a little bit    I prefer the old language for paragraph 4, but I’m not sure doing that is   sufficient offset to the “2013” language    I’m sorry to be slow here, but this very difficult  Putting that, along   with the change in paragraph 4, would be an improvement    That’s what I’m struggling with  I’m not sure it would be, Mr   Chairman  "
9314,2011-09-20,PLOSSER,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  Brian, I’d like to get more clarification on   your discussion of the breakevens and probabilities of deflation  A number of things are going   on here, clearly  There are the effects of declining projections of real growth, perhaps, and a lot   of evidence of flight to quality from Europe into safe Treasury securities, all of which potentially   confuse the signals on the breakevens here and how we think about them  So can you talk more   about that—what you really believe these changes in the breakevens might be signaling and how   we can decompose that, if at all?  And I would ask another question about the probabilities of   deflation that have arisen from the TIPS  If I go to, for example, our SPF surveys, those   probabilities really haven’t changed that much  They’re still much closer to 10 percent than to   September 20–21, 2011 9 of 290              the 20 percent in the TIPS, which suggests to me there’s some differential here  I’d like to hear   you talk more about those effects and the interpretations    Thank you, Mr Chairman  We have been asked to address several   questions regarding tools and language to provide further monetary accommodation if and when   it is warranted  However, the tools that would be appropriate depend on the reason for our   wanting to engage in accommodation and, in particular, on the underlying framework that is   guiding our policy decisions  So I can’t fully divorce my discussion from the current economic   environment or our framework  As President Kocherlakota said, being credible is an important   part of an effective monetary policy, but it’s hard to be credible without a clearly articulated   framework  I believe that the risk of financial turmoil, for example, arising from the European   Union has increased, and discussing how the situation might play out and how we might respond   seems more important than attempting to tweak our term structure by a few basis points  But I   will return to that in a later go-round   Let me talk about the various tools that have been raised  Maturity extension programs—  I’m skeptical that balance sheet tools like the maturity extension program are going to do much   to speed the recovery on the real side  Board staff estimates that $400 billion of MEP would   lower long-term yields about 20 basis points and raise two-year yields about 5 basis points  As   has been referred to, Swanson’s study found that Operation Twist of 1960 had a slightly more   moderate effect of a 15 basis point decrease in long rates and a comparable increase in short   rates  However, the impact, even in that study, on corporate rates was only about 2 to 4 basis   points  Why would we think a twist operation this time around would filter through to other   September 20–21, 2011 47 of 290              borrowing rates when it didn’t in the past?  The potential benefit for the real economy will be   small, but there will be cost  Such actions undermine the Fed’s credibility by giving the   impression that we think our policies can have a significant impact on the speed of recovery   when it seems highly unlikely that they can do so  That undermines the credibility that President   Kocherlakota was talking about earlier  This loss of credibility will cost the economy in the long   run when the time comes to unwind these policies in order to control inflation     I have similar views of the LSAP programs being discussed  I think they’ll do little to   speed the recovery as much as we’d like and, indeed, run the risk of destabilizing inflationary   expectations  If we were convinced we were headed into a very serious deflationary period   where deflationary expectations were rising or began to emerge in a serious way, we might   consider asset purchases as a credible way to commit to bringing inflation back up to our goal, as   seems to have been the effect in QE2  At present, I don’t see that risk coming about  Indeed,   inflation continues to rise, forcing the Tealbook to repeatedly revise up its inflation forecast    Given this track record, we should not become too sanguine regarding the medium-term   forecasts of inflation that come out of the Tealbook   What about raising the targeted rate of inflation?  The economics is very clear, as   President Kocherlakota mentioned  At the zero bound, this is a sure way to lower real interest   rates  But many questions, I think, remain  Given how low rates already are, do we think   lowering them more will have much of an impact on growth and employment, the purported goal   of running such a policy?  And would we seriously be able to implement such a policy?  I’m   very open to a robust discussion on this dimension, but on this point, I remain very skeptical    For such a policy to work, it is critically dependent on its credibility  The markets have to   believe we will run such a policy  Are we that credible?  We don’t yet have an explicit   September 20–21, 2011 48 of 290              numerical goal for inflation, yet we think we can credibly raise our target with the public through   its communications?    What actions will we take to reinforce our announcement of a higher inflation goal?    More LSAPs?  Perhaps  Would this be a temporary increase in our inflation goal, or would we   want this to be a permanent increase?  Given the difficulties we have in even forecasting   inflation, why do we think we can manage a temporary increase in our inflation goal?    Alternatively, if we wanted a permanent increase, how do we justify it in terms of our mandate   for price stability, given the fact that we have been saying that 2 percent is the mandate-  consistent number?  How do we calibrate the appropriate level of inflation?  Presumably, we   need to balance the cost of a permanently higher inflation rate with the temporary short-term   benefit such a change in the expectation of inflation might actually bring  And indeed, in my   mind, those benefits from that action are extremely uncertain  They give higher inflation as a   way to get rid of the debt overhang problem  The debt overhang problem raises a whole host of   questions  Distributional effects—at the end of the day, the debt overhang problem is about who   pays  Changing the distribution of losses through inflation is a fiscal policy action, which I think   we should be very cautious about  Other questions revolve around, can we actually speed the   recovery in a process through debt deflation using inflation?  Will inflationary expectations   change in a way to devalue that debt very quickly?  I think those are a host of questions that we   have to grapple with if a higher inflation rate is something that we want to pursue   On language—of course, I’ve been and continue to be a strong advocate of our being   more explicit about our inflation goal  The work that I and some of our colleagues did at the   suggestion of the Chairman earlier this year suggested a way forward  We produced a set of   communications that we thought would allow the Committee to communicate a numerical   September 20–21, 2011 49 of 290              inflation objective and to distinguish such a goal from the employment part of our mandate  This   takes more words of explanation than we can provide in our meeting statements  Thus, I’m   opposed to using the statement language, such as in paragraph 2 of alternative A, to indicate a   numerical goal for inflation and our projected longer-run employment rates  My bet is that the   public and the markets would see this language and conclude that we had a numerical   unemployment goal  President Bullard, in his comments, explains why that’s problematic, both   from a theoretical and a practical perspective  Indeed, we discussed these very issues in our   special meetings on unemployment and DSGE models, both in the past year or so   On paragraph 4 of alternative A, on the trigger policies, I don’t support the trigger policy   language of alternative A  I think it’s very problematic  I’ve long advocated the use of rules as   guidelines to systematic policymaking that we can convey to the public, and there is a long   literature on the benefits of robust rules for monetary policymaking  A rule allows market   participants and the public to infer the likely path of interest rates in response to changes in the   economy  And as I said, the literature on robust rules is informative because it cuts across   different models and talks about the viability of the robustness of various specifications, even   when models may differ  Model uncertainty is a big problem  However, the proposed language   is not a reaction function  Instead, it casts policy in terms of a trigger and differs from a Taylor-  type rule, which calls for a continuous adjustment of our policy rate to deviations of inflation   from target and some sort of real gap  As such, the proposed language does not provide any   information to help the public infer the path of interest rates once tightening may have started    And so the benefits, it seems to me, of articulating a reaction function are very, very limited and   small using this strategy   September 20–21, 2011 50 of 290              The formulation is problematic for other reasons as well  As President Bullard pointed   out, it’s quite difficult to model and understand movements in the unemployment rate, and there   is considerable uncertainty about the level of unemployment over the medium to longer term or   its natural rate  President Kocherlakota mentioned the huge standard errors that would surround   any of our forecasts  The trigger policy appears to be inherently biased toward more   accommodation, since it’s based on actual unemployment rates but only a forecast of the   medium-term inflation changes  Inflation, we know, changes only very slowly  And as I have   mentioned, our forecasts are not very accurate  It conveys to the public that we believe we can   exploit the short-term Phillips curve tradeoff between current unemployment and the medium-  run inflation forecast  I think this ignores the lessons of the ’70s and the dangers that can arise   from that  Moreover, underlying the triggers in alternative A are assumptions about   policymakers’ loss functions  We have never had a discussion about our loss function  It seems   to me that before we develop a framework that relies heavily on that, we should have that   discussion  Our models suggest that putting too much weight on output or unemployment gaps   when setting monetary policy can lead to instability and far worse outcomes for both   employment and inflation  Yet that appears what we run the risk of doing  We simply need a lot   more discussion about what underlies these numbers to understand and communicate our   reaction function in a meaningful way, and I would certainly welcome such a discussion     I believe the alternative of using the SEPs for forward guidance is a much better approach   than calendar dates or triggers or efforts to manipulate short-term markets to convey our forward   guidance  The communications subcommittee circulated a memo on adding our fed funds path   assumptions to the SEPs to give the public information on the expected path of policy  We will   be submitting new forecasts at the next meeting, and I would hope the Committee participants   September 20–21, 2011 51 of 290              would be willing to provide their funds rate path assumptions internally as an experiment  The   Chairman might continue to provide the table of projections as it’s currently formulated at his   press conference in November  But the staff could draft the SEP, including that information on   forward guidance, and circulate it internally  If the Committee is comfortable with this, then we   could publish those in November, or alternatively, it would provide a way forward for our   January meeting—we could then transition away from calendar dates toward our projections of   the SEP as indications of forward guidance  Thank you, Mr Chairman    I would suggest—and I have suggested this before—that I think this is   about communications as much as anything else  And I don’t think the statement is the place to   do that  You’ve given several speeches about why the unemployment SEP number is different  I   think that concept needs to be socialized more widely  I think you and the Vice Chair and others   need to talk about it in speeches, help explain it to the public, so they understand this means   something different before we try to get our policy statement, in which we are confined to very   September 20–21, 2011 52 of 290              few words, to convey that notion  I think that over a period of time, I would certainly become   more comfortable that we could do this and not have it be misinterpreted  In the context of a   policy statement, I think it’s very difficult to do    Moving right along    Yes  Just to follow up on this, I think the situation in Europe is quite   concerning, given the pace at which they seem to be resolving their problems  And we can talk   about a meltdown or implosion of Europe, but it seems to me that one of the things that might   happen is an acceleration in the massive flight to quality that we have been seeing, with the   consequences being, rather than a flight out of quality of the US banks, a huge inflow of cash    How would we react to that, or what would the consequences of that be, short of rapid   depreciation of the euro relative to the dollar and a huge inflow of cash from European   institutions into the United States?  How would that play out, and what would the consequences   be for us, if any?    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Economic conditions in both the Third   District and the nation remain weaker than they were earlier in the year  Not much, though, has   really changed in terms of the outlook since our last meeting  The question is why, and how long   will the slowdown last?  We had thought earlier this year that the weakness would largely be   temporary, but it is certainly turning out to be somewhat more persistent than we thought    Perhaps more relevant is that we have been hit by more shocks since the last meeting, including   September 20–21, 2011 133 of 290              Hurricanes Irene and Lee and the increased likelihood of disorderly resolution to the sovereign   debt crisis in Europe  Many forecasters have revised down their forecasts for 2011, and some   also for 2012, although by a lesser amount  However, there remain a few forecasters who are at   this point predicting out and out recession    In the Third District, manufacturing activity continued to contract in September after a   sharper drop in August  The August drop was undoubtedly affected by the events in Europe and   the debacle over the debt ceiling debate in the United States  The September numbers were   clearly influenced by the hurricanes and the subsequent severe flooding in Pennsylvania and   New Jersey  Thus, I find it very difficult at this point to get a very firm reading on   manufacturing performance in the District, and I remain somewhat uncertain  However, both   indexes for prices paid and for prices received bounced back higher than they had been after the   bad August numbers  Labor markets continue to struggle, with little progress  But there appears   to be a dichotomy in the labor market  My contacts report that the job postings for lower-skilled   workers are finding a plethora of applicants who are either highly qualified or overqualified, or,   on the other hand, not qualified at all, while firms looking to hire a more specialized skill are   having great difficulty finding qualified workers  They have many job openings, and when they   do hire, they tend to hire individuals from other firms rather than out of the unemployed   Business leaders continually report to me, much like President Lacker, uncertainty,   uncertainty, uncertainty—whether it be Europe, whether it be US regulatory reform, whether it   be tax policy, and the list goes on and on and on  They rarely complain to me about a lack of   liquidity or that interest rates are too high for them to conduct their businesses as time goes on    The real estate sector shows few signs of life, as many people note  Sentiment remains subdued   in the District  However, manufacturers do expect a pickup in activity over the next six months,   September 20–21, 2011 134 of 290              and that was a rebound from what we observed in the August survey  In other sectors, activity is   expected to show very slight growth in the near term, and contacts report that they are concerned   about the downward trend in consumer confidence  While their outlook is still positive, it is   dripping with uncertainty  National conditions are similar to those in the District  While we are   seeing weak activity, 12-month inflation rates continue to accelerate  It’s a quite different   situation than we faced in the fall of 2010 when we resumed asset purchases  At that time, real   activity was weakening and inflation was falling   To my mind, the big risk facing the US economy is the potential for a large financial   market shock stemming from Europe  The issue we should be focusing on is what we should do   in the event that that should occur, and I agree with President Rosengren about the importance of   us doing contingency planning and thinking about the consequences of that, should that crisis   arise  This seems to be a much more salient question than how we might lower longer-term   interest rates 10 or 15 or 20 basis points from their already historically low levels   I don’t think it makes much sense for us to try to fine-tune the real side of the economic   recovery at this point  A large shock hit the economy, and with the benchmark revisions, we   know it was even larger than we thought  The Fed responded in our role as lender of last resort   to try to stem the financial instability and in our monetary policy role by reducing interest rates,   easing credit conditions significantly  We have provided and continue to provide a historically   large amount of liquidity and monetary accommodation  Interest rates are near record lows, and   we’ve said they’ll be so for a long time  If our purpose is to provide more certainty and   confidence to the markets, we can best do that by stopping trying to tweak a little to no benefit    We undermine our own credibility and perhaps even the general public’s confidence in us by   giving the public the impression that we react to short-term events with little clear understanding   September 20–21, 2011 135 of 290              or communication of the underlying frameworks that are guiding us  I hope we can continue to   develop a clear framework for our operations in our upcoming meetings  Thank you, Mr   Chairman    I have an empirical question  Pick your number of what you think this   would do to mortgage rates or the mortgage spread—10, 15, 20 basis points  The question I   want to ask is  Based on what’s happened over the last three years, what’s the empirical   evidence about how that will change housing starts, sales of existing homes, or house prices?    What’s the empirical evidence we have as to the effect that that will have on the housing market   measured by the things that we are interested in?  Do we have any estimate for that?  Maybe   that’s a question for Dave    So it’s likely that the players who are going to be able to take advantage   of this maybe won’t be the homeowners and the homebuyers  It’s going to be the traders who   are going to be trying to arbitrage whatever they think we’re going to do between Treasuries and   MBS and other things, and whether or not that’s going to have the effect that we want on the real   economy is questionable    It’s on fire  [Laughter]    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I do not support a change in policy at this   juncture, and therefore, I support alternative C  As President Kocherlakota pointed out, inflation   has moved up, not down, since our last meeting and since last fall, and the unemployment rate   has not worsened  I think we should be cognizant of the risks of fueling a steady rise in inflation   over the medium term, even while the unemployment rate remains elevated  Any action that we   take now is likely to have only marginal impact on growth and employment, and yet it could   make it more difficult for us to address future problems that arise in the financial markets or to   combat deflation should it emerge  It does not make much sense for us to try to calibrate the   speed of economic recovery, and the empirical evidence we have to date during this episode of   the Great Recession suggests that we have very limited ability to do so in any event  As   President Fisher said, we should be spending our time evaluating the emerging risks stemming   from the continuation of the sovereign debt crisis in Europe and how we should respond should   that situation devolve into a full-blown crisis   I will also step out of my usual box and go into the realm of psych-ops that President   Lockhart raised yesterday  We seriously have to ask ourselves as a Committee whether or not   our incessant efforts to “fix the economy”—to little or no effect recently—is reassuring or   September 20–21, 2011 229 of 290              actually lowering confidence  I think the very negative outlook we painted for the economy in   our August statement was too negative, and our actions in that statement came as a negative   shock to consumer confidence  Confidence fell, and markets were surprised at how negative we   were  I don’t think that was a wise decision, and it likely contributed to falling confidence  The   August language was also problematic for me because I think there are better ways to provide   forward guidance than using calendar dates  Yet now that we have the language in the statement,   and we have opted for a fix, it is hard to get it out, and we have to craft a way to get it out, as   many of us have discussed  That suggests we should be very careful in changing language in our   statement, because we tend to live with it for a while, even though we think we don’t  It’s hard   Those concerns lead me to believe that alternative A, at this point, is a particularly   dangerous road to go down  Once we have those numbers enshrined in the statement, it will be   very difficult for us to change them  We have not given sufficient thought to the underlying   mechanisms that give rise to those numbers  I don’t think we have had sufficient debate on the   underlying loss functions or rules that give rise to them  Proceeding with that from one meeting   to the next—engaging in this very quickly—would be a mistake, and we would likely regret it   because we would have trouble getting out of it  In a framework like alternative A, we also have   to be concerned about our credibility  We put a target for 2½ percent inflation as a trigger or a   7 percent unemployment rate—whatever the numbers happen to be, and I’m thinking about   inflation right now as an escape clause—that we would act  We would then have to ask   ourselves very seriously, “While we can all say that today, would we really act?”  Today, year-  over-year headline inflation is almost 38 percent on the CPI and 28 or 29 percent on the PCE    We are not acting  Why are we not acting?  Because we are relying on a forecast that we are   September 20–21, 2011 230 of 290              confident that inflation will fall  But we have been saying inflation will fall and stay low ever   since last fall  Forecasts haven’t been very good  We have to be careful about those forecasts   We don’t have to go back to the 1970s—just look across the Atlantic at the Bank of   England  For nearly two years now, inflation in the United Kingdom has risen from a very low   level to 3 percent, and now inflation is 48 or 49 percent  This has occurred over a little less   than a two-year period  They continually forecast that inflation is going to come down  Yes, it   will come down next time; it will come down next quarter; it will come down the quarter after   that  We keep looking for excuses as to why inflation may or may not be high, and looking at   every excuse except monetary policy  I am worried that relying on forecasts and looking   forward will make it very difficult for us to pull the trigger in such a strategy  We will have   extreme biases toward excessive ease  The Bank of England is facing some severe challenges    Unemployment rates are running at around 8 percent, give or take a little bit from month to   month, and inflation is pushing 5 percent  We do not want to find ourselves there, and yet I think   it is entirely possible There is a lot of slack in the UK, but it hasn’t prevented them from facing   severe inflation problems   Alternative B has its own set of problems  As I said, it is unlikely to be effective at   improving real outcomes  It doesn’t address what I believe are the real risks that this economy   faces right now, and they are not risks within, they are the risks of a financial implosion in   Europe  Alternative B is unlikely to be perceived by those outside the trading floors of Wall   Street as anything but an ineffective measure for the real problems that Main Street faces  When   we take actions that Main Street perceives as ineffective and plays to traders, we undermine our   credibility  It leaves the impression that we are acting because we can, and doing what Wall   Street expects, not because we must  I think we are entirely overreacting to short-term events  I   September 20–21, 2011 231 of 290              agree with President Lockhart’s remarks about pausing, taking stock, and not feeling like we   have to create responses to every intermeeting period’s events  To react to short-term events is a   dangerous way to conduct policy, and we should not do it that way  Our unemployment problem   is a serious problem  It is a devastating problem for many millions of workers  But I think it is a   medium- to longer-term problem that we face that is not easily repaired by short-term fixes and   short-term tools  Those short-term tools, to the extent that we use them to no avail, will create   longer-term problems for us down the road  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Just an observation  In some respects, the moderation of fuel and   energy prices is what’s really driving the moderation of overall inflation at this point    Fuel and energy prices have moderated, period    Would it be inappropriate for the Board to have a meeting or a   conference call so that we are filled in on what the Board staff is thinking in terms of the   liquidity provisions and other things that might arise during such a time?  "
9343,2011-11-01,PLOSSER,"  Thank you, Mr Chairman  I have two less deep, more mundane   questions about the charts that I’d like to see if I understand  Under nominal GDP targeting,   nominal GDP is the sum of real GDP plus the GDP deflator, and yet you’re talking about what’s   going on with the PCE price index  If you’re really targeting nominal GDP, you’re targeting the   GDP deflator implicitly, right?  How in your calculation do you make that translation, and how   do you think about that, again, as another communication device about what we’re doing?    That’s the first question    The second question is sort of related to this  A lot of the level   targeting, whether it be price-level targeting or nominal GDP–level targeting, can be quite   sensitive to where the path begins, whether you start at December ’07 or whether you start at   December 2000 or 2003 or what have you  When we think about targeting the level for   anything, the sensitivity perhaps to that initial condition, how do we think about choosing what   the right initial condition was?  Certainly, December 2007 was the peak of the housing bubble   and perhaps some other things that you might want to think about  And yet if you go back   earlier, as President Lacker has talked about, the inflation rates of 2005 and 2006 were high  I’m   thinking about the sensitivity and how we would think about implementing a policy and   choosing the right initial condition to measure what you think, in fact, the gap is    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I also want to thank the staff for their   excellent set of memos  They are fascinating and interesting, and I appreciate the discussion and   insights they provided  I will structure my comments around the questions that were posed   I view flexible inflation targeting, which combines an explicit commitment to a medium-  run inflation objective with the flexibility to respond to shocks to support economic stability, as   fully consistent with the dual mandate  The dual mandate objectives, price stability and   maximum employment, I believe are generally complementary to one another  Price stability is   both a goal and a means through which monetary policy can contribute to the employment   objective  Thus, I see no fundamental inconsistency with us having an explicit numerical   inflation objective and a dual mandate  Indeed, by having accurate inflation expectations, the   explicit inflation objective gives us more flexibility to act to help mitigate the effects of shocks   on real activity   I am an enthusiastic supporter of monetary policy transparency in viewing   communications with the public about our framework as a further useful step in clarifying our   policy decisionmaking process  The exit statement that we developed earlier in the year was   quite consistent with the earlier steps we have taken toward increased transparency  It would be   very helpful if we tried to formulate a consensus statement on the Committee’s monetary policy   November 1–2, 2011 36 of 282              framework  I suggest that the subcommittee on communications chaired by Governor Yellen be   charged with the task of creating a first draft of such a principles document, which could then be   circulated for review and comments  You will recall that the ad hoc committee on which I   served earlier in the year drafted a document on an explicit numerical inflation objective within   the context of the dual mandate, which we thought was broadly consistent with the description   that the Chairman just gave on flexible inflation targeting  So some progress has already been   made on this initiative, and I think we can build on that foundation and hopefully find a   consensus   As long as we are on communication, I would like to make another suggestion  It is no   secret that I favor a more rules-based approach to policy as both a disciplining device on our own   actions as well as an effective communication tool to the public and the markets  While we are a   long way from agreeing on what an appropriate rule might be, I think we can make progress   down this path by being clear regarding what the variables are that would appear in such a rule    We started down this path when we added to our statement in November 2009 that we   considered inflation, inflation expectations, and resource utilization as key factors that would   influence our policy decisions  That was a good start, but we didn’t do much with it  Indeed,   some might even perceive that the changes in forward guidance we made in August/September   as being at odds with the information in those conditioning variables  What would be helpful is   if we could structure a discussion in this Committee on how we might better articulate the   arguments of such a policy function, and then attempt to describe our decisions on an ongoing   basis in the context of how those variables evolve over time, and thus describing how our   decisions evolve over time in a mutually consistent manner  We wouldn’t have to pin down the   precise reaction function, but we would want to couch our decisions in terms of how those key   November 1–2, 2011 37 of 282              policy variables evolve  This could prove to be a useful communication device going forward,   and in fact, aid our own internal deliberations   Let me turn now to questions 2 and 4  I am much less enthusiastic about the alternative   frameworks—advanced forward guidance, price-level targeting, or nominal GDP targeting—as   discussed in the staff memo  While these frameworks do have logic to them in the context of   some types of models, the benefits of these strategies are highly speculative and very risky from   my perspective   Let me elaborate briefly  As I discussed in our last meeting, I do not support the idea of   providing policy thresholds or triggers as in alternative A1  I am very supportive of taking a   systematic approach to policymaking, and there is a long literature on the benefits of robust rules   for policymaking  However, the triggers tell us little about the Committee’s reaction function    The proposed language doesn’t provide any information to help the public infer the path of   interest rates after such triggers are met, or what policies will do if inflation moves somewhat   above the threshold when the employment rate remains above its threshold  More justification   for the specific thresholds, in fact, requires assumptions about loss functions of the Committee   and an underlying policy rule, neither of which the Committee has discussed in depth   In my view, the best way to do forward guidance at this point is to publish our policy   paths in the SEP, and I very much hope that we will begin that process in January  Increased   transparency about how FOMC participants expect policy to change in light of changes in   economic conditions and the outlook can help the public form expectations about inflation and   future policy  Providing information on FOMC participants’ appropriate policy paths, with their   economic projections, emphasizes that policy is contingent on the evolution of economic   conditions  I believe the results of the trial run of the projections, which we will discuss   November 1–2, 2011 38 of 282              tomorrow, will support this  It isn’t a panacea  It isn’t a solution  We still will have potential   inconsistency problems, because we aren’t revealing how to match up individual forecasts with   particular policy variables  Still, I think in the name of transparency and information and   coherence, it is the right direction to move   The staff memo notes that, in principle, the best choice is to announce and commit to an   optimal policy path under commitment  I understand why this looks desirable, but is such a   policy choice actually feasible for the Committee?  What is the commitment device?  There will   be great temptations to engage in time-inconsistent policies later on, as President Bullard   emphasized in his memo  This underlies the extreme uncertainty associated with the projected   benefits of such approaches that are outlined in the staff memo, since they very much depend on   the credibility of this Committee’s commitment to future actions  Even here I am putting aside   the fact that optimal results are based on a particular loss function, as President Kocherlakota   pointed out in his memo, and on a particular Taylor rule implementation  And as I just said,   neither of those has been discussed at great length in this group   Announcing the policy that we will follow in the future via forward guidance, without   commitment to a time-consistent framework, is a weak commitment device at best  Indeed,   some of the alternatives on the table at this meeting already suggest changing our forward   guidance after just two meetings  In August, we indicated that we thought the outlook would   warrant keeping the funds rate at zero until mid-2013  We reiterated that in September  Now,   alternative A1 suggests that we extend that period to 2014, even though the outlook has actually   improved somewhat since August and September—but not much  We don’t seem to be acting   with much commitment, even in our own language  It is even harder to believe that we have   enough commitment or credibility to follow on a policy path when we discover that it may not be   November 1–2, 2011 39 of 282              optimal at some point in the future  And thus, if we deviate, we risk our credibility  Making   commitments that we or the markets don’t believe we can or will deliver on will not provide the   intended benefits demonstrated in the memo that the staff suggests  And Michael Kiley made   that point in his observations  Without the commitment and the credibility, we don’t get the   benefits   Similarly, for both nominal GDP targeting and price-level targeting, the question is, do   we have enough credibility and commitment to deliver on it?  I, frankly, am very dubious that we   would behave in a time-consistent manner with price-level targeting  Do we really believe that   we would drive inflation down to 1 percent again to make up for overshooting in order to hit our   price-level path?  I don’t believe we would  I don’t think the public will believe it either  Some   might, therefore, argue, although I wouldn’t, that what we need to do then is commit to a higher   level of inflation—4 percent or some higher number—so that we don’t have to go too low to   offset our overshooting  Well, that is certainly an interesting argument  I don’t subscribe to it,   but that would be an important conversation to have in weighing the costs and benefits of a   commitment to a permanently higher inflation rate  But that discussion needs to weigh the long-  term costs and benefits and not just exploit short-term expediencies driven by the problems at the   zero lower bound  That would be a much more long-run discussion of trading off  The question   I think we must ask ourselves, then, is, what framework gives us the best chance of meeting the   level of commitment that is assumed in that chosen framework?  I think that flexible inflation   targeting is likely to be the best that we can deliver on  But there are other potential problems   with some of these frameworks  As I asked the staff, both frameworks depend on some initial   condition, and the degree of undershooting and the target we have depend critically on where   that starting point occurs   November 1–2, 2011 40 of 282              Michael also discussed the issue of measurement error as a concern, particularly with   nominal GDP targeting  The level formulation—that is, targeting a particular level of nominal   GDP—is worse, in my view, than nominal GDP growth targeting  If we underestimate or   overestimate the appropriate level of potential output and misestimate the so-called gap that   needs to be closed, we could make serious policy errors, and those would accumulate over time    Even a growth-rate target relies on some estimate of potential growth, which is subject to   significant measurement error and changes over time  Again, if we overestimate potential   growth, a nominal GDP growth target would lead us astray into being too accommodative, and if   we underestimate potential growth, we would be too tight  To avoid this, we still need to focus   on what is happening to inflation  To me, there seems to be little gain over a flexible inflation   targeting regime  It also means that when our estimate of potential growth changes, as the staff   does, we would need to change our target  This poses serious communications problems at best   and risks credibility and the benefit of any commitment derived from specifying that framework   Finally, it seems to me that switching to a new framework at this time could easily be   viewed by some as an opportunistic way to inflate the economy  In an inflation environment   where fiscal deficits loom large and well-respected economists are advocating inflating our way   out of the problems, changing our framework now risks appearing opportunistic, and that will   undermine our credibility over the long term and undermine the credibility we would need to   actually deliver on the commitments that those frameworks would call for  Undermining our   commitment by appearing opportunistic, by changing our framework, could be undermining the   very benefits that we seek to have  Thus, I would strongly prefer that we concentrate on better   explaining and strengthening our flexible inflation targeting framework that the Committee has   been working toward for the past two decades  This includes an explicit numerical objective,   November 1–2, 2011 41 of 282              explaining why it is consistent with the dual mandate, and publishing our policy paths with the   SEP  Thank you, Mr Chairman    We will watch this with great interest  [Laughter]    Mr Chairman?    I want to follow up with a question that Brian may not be able to   answer, but I’m just curious  If I looked at JPMorgan three years ago, before the crisis, roughly   what percentage would they have had in repo and trading liabilities—just ballpark?  Twice this   or 50 percent more or about the same?    Okay  That’s kind of where I was    I want to turn to the trial run  I want to make a comment and maybe   even ask a question here  One of the things I find interesting about this is the difference in part   between exhibit 1 and exhibit 2  As Loretta pointed out, if you look at exhibit 1, it looks as   though there are huge spreads about what people expect I think it’s important we remember two   things about that  One is that this is appropriate policy and not a forecast  I think that’s   important to understand what we’re doing  But also, as she pointed out in exhibit 2, the modal   forecasts here reveal a somewhat different story than you’d get by just looking at the first chart    And the modal forecasts are much closer to what the Committee has been signaling through its   forms of forward guidance   I think the other thing that’s important to remember about this is that the value of this, as   I see it, is not just as a snapshot in time, but it’s also to watch how this exercise would evolve   every quarter as the economy evolved, and therefore how this shape would evolve  And that’s   part of the information, rather than a point in time  It’s the evolution of that that would be very   revealing, I think, over time  So from my perspective, this could be a very valuable exercise for   the Committee to undertake    I think the question might then be to look at that in the same sort of bar   chart—in other words, looking at the modal numbers on that chart rather than just the spread and   central tendency    Oh, I’m sorry  I misunderstood  I thought you were looking at   panel A    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Economic activity in the Third District has   picked up a bit since our last meeting  And although downside risks remain, I think tail risks   have lessened somewhat, and the risk of recession has diminished  But events in Europe today—  you never know  Wait until tomorrow; something else will happen   Our Business Outlook Survey of regional manufacturing showed a rebound into positive   territory in October after two months of negative readings  The general activity index actually   November 1–2, 2011 164 of 282              rose from minus 30 in August, to minus 17 in September, to plus 8 in October  I think that’s a   remarkable swing in the period of three months, and part of that is related to what I mentioned   here last time—that in October, the survey week was the week of the S&P downgrade of the US   debt, and the week of the September survey was the week of the hurricanes and floods in New   Jersey and western Pennsylvania, which had a dampening effect, so to speak, on the outlook    But consistent with this improvement in general activity, both shipments and orders turned up as   well  Employment readings remain positive, although weaker than they were earlier in the   year—there’s no question about that  We did ask a special question on our October survey about   employment  The good news is that far more firms reported they had increased employment this   year than had cut staffing  Indeed, nearly half—46 percent—had increased employment, and   less than 25 percent had decreased employment  Less-good news was that most of that occurred   in temporary employment   Contacts with directors and the business community echoed many of President   Lockhart’s comments about jobs and challenges  It’s not just mismatch; it’s also the problems   that—whether it be drug testing, which is a very common theme I hear  The other common   theme I heard is work ethic  An employer in the Third District who owns, I think, 60-some-odd   McDonald’s restaurants in southeastern Pennsylvania and New Jersey says passing drug tests,   passing literacy tests, and work ethic are the primary problems he has in hiring people, as far as   he’s concerned  It’s also true in the city  I have an anecdote from my wife, who attended a   meeting in the city of Philadelphia of a group that was engaged in trying to encourage both the   city and businesses in Philadelphia to hire more people  Unemployment in Philadelphia is quite   high, obviously, and our mayor, Mayor Nutter, in responding to this group, said, interestingly,   “We have over 1,000 job openings in the city of Philadelphia, and the problem is not that there   November 1–2, 2011 165 of 282              are not people hiring  One report is that we can’t find enough people who understand that   literacy, work ethic,”—again—“and drug testing are a big impediment to this city actually hiring   people”  He made a very impassioned plea about that, and of course, it turned into a discussion   of education and other things  So I think that’s not an uncommon thing to hear these days among   employers    On the other hand, employers who are hiring high-skilled workers—engineers,   technicians, and computer people—are clamoring for employees  One person told me that when   they hire an engineer, they rarely hire him or her out of the unemployment pool; they’re actually   hiring the engineer from other firms, and that seems to be a very common theme as well   Nevertheless, the weak indicators of employment in our manufacturing survey are   consistent with weakness in labor markets overall  Payroll employment in our three-state region   dropped over 1 percent on an annualized basis in the past three months, compared with nearly a   1 percent increase in the nation  In our District, state and local government downsizing has   played a big role in the reductions in overall jobs   Residential real estate markets remain weak  Market delinquencies and new foreclosures   continued to improve in the second quarter, but coping with the growing inventories of   foreclosures remains a serious problem, especially in New Jersey  According to RealtyTrac, the   foreclosure process for loans foreclosed on during the third quarter averaged 974 days in New   Jersey, compared with 336 days nationally  The long process time in New Jersey stems from the   superior court decision in December 2010 to review bank foreclosure practices, and that was not   lifted until mid-August  In the meantime, most banks stopped filing new foreclosures in New   Jersey, and so we have an unusually high level of foreclosure, which will continue to burden   house prices, particularly in New Jersey, because of this process  In contrast to the residential   November 1–2, 2011 166 of 282              sector, commercial real estate markets seem to have steadied somewhat and even improved   slightly in the region  Indeed, in some submarkets of commercial real estate, rents have risen   and vacancy rates have come down     Retail sales in the region were mixed over the past few months  Our contacts expressed   hopeful optimism for strong holiday sales but weren’t sufficiently convinced to commit much to   building inventories  Car dealers appear to be more optimistic  With supply surges, they have   been able to raise prices and sell cars without promotions  I also have a contact at a very large   New York retailer, and she reports to me that at this large store, retail sales have been   surprisingly good—which is consistent with the data we got—and that they continue to be good   going into October  And they are actually looking for a reasonably positive holiday season    That suggestion is consistent with other traffic on transportation that’s been referred to  I have a   director of a company that both builds and leases railroad cars nationwide  They report that the   demand for railroad cars is very high and leases are high, and they’re raising prices on a fairly   steady basis   The outlook is for continued modest recovery in our District  It’s nothing to get excited   about  They expect slow recovery in activity over the next six months but are not predicting a   recession  Contacts there say that they are waiting for more substantive and persistent signs of   growth before taking on any more risk   On balance, the national economy appears to be weathering the heightened level of real   and financial uncertainty unleashed by the growing fiscal problems in both Europe and the US    The data over the intermeeting period have come in somewhat more positive and are consistent   with our forecast that growth will strengthen after the temporary factors holding back the   economy in the first half of the year  So far, the economy, I think, is showing more resilience in   November 1–2, 2011 167 of 282              the second half than many anticipated  Third-quarter GDP, as many have mentioned, was quite   good relative to the dire expectations of August and early September  Labor market indicators   have stabilized rather than deteriorated as some had feared  Consumer confidence remains low,   but retail sales have been somewhat stronger than expected  And production and investments   continue to grow   Overall, recession risks have receded considerably since our last meeting, but as we   know, the risk and uncertainties remain high  News from Europe has been the dominant driver   of financial markets over the intermeeting period, swamping the effect of Operation Twist, in my   mind, and more-positive underlying data on the domestic economy  The European fiscal   situation remains precarious, but some positive steps have been taken  However, it remains to be   seen, as has been reported, whether it will all hang together in some form or not  In the US, the   “supercommittee” deadline looms large on our fiscal policy, and the outcome of that will also   likely affect consumer and business confidence in the coming months  We’ll need to see   whether that is positive or negative   Nonetheless, my modal forecast is that the economy is poised to grow just slightly above   trend, maybe, from 2012 through 2014  That suggests a growth rate of about 3 percent  With a   moderate pace of growth over that horizon, labor market recovery is going to be gradual, and it’s   going to be painfully slow and unsatisfactory to many people  The unemployment rate will   move down but very, very slowly   I anticipate that headline inflation will pull back a little bit, with about a 2¼ percent   increase in 2012, and then focus around 2 percent from 2013 through 2014  But in my view,   that’s predicated on a somewhat tighter monetary policy than is in the Tealbook forecast  In   November 1–2, 2011 168 of 282              order to keep expectations of inflation well anchored, the Committee will likely need to   commence policy tightening before mid-2013  Thank you, Mr Chairman    In New Jersey, it was 900 days    Thank you, Mr Chairman  This Committee has been aggressive and   creative at fulfilling its dual mandate  Over the past three and a half years, we have reduced the   policy rate from 5¼ percent to 0, where it’s been now for three years  We have purchased nearly   $2 trillion worth of assets on our balance sheet, including MBS  We have targeted spreads  We   have targeted risk premiums  We have targeted assets for moving their prices around  It is hard   for me to imagine that this Committee could be accused of not making every effort in its power   to fulfill our dual mandate     The fact of the matter is that we are all frustrated and disappointed that unemployment   rates remain stubbornly high, and we’re all deeply concerned about that  I think we have to keep   in mind, though, that policy actions by this Committee are not free  They carry costs as well as   benefits, and it is our duty to keep evaluating those costs and benefits of our actions  And I   think, as President Lockhart said yesterday and repeated today, it is troubling that despite our   best efforts and very aggressive efforts, the labor market hasn’t responded in ways that we   normally think it might  That should give us some pause regarding how we think about   proceeding going forward     In thinking about the costs of aggressive action, we need to be concerned that it’s about   the future—it’s not about today  Low interest rates for three years and longer—President   Bullard has expressed concerns about that  But distorting interest rates, twisting curves, and   November 1–2, 2011 218 of 282              targeting asset prices of different classes of assets risk creating distortions, inefficiencies, and   potentially, bubbles down the road that we have no control over or no ability to foresee with   great foresight  That is a risk that we must take as real  President Hoenig for all of last year   cautioned us about those risks—the unknowns that they may carry with them and therefore the   risks for the future  As President Fisher just said, low interest rates punish savers as another   form of distortion   Our policy actions also have risks for the future as well in undermining our own   credibility  I’ve raised this point before  We continue to take actions in an environment where   our actions will not help the unemployment rate or will have very de minimis effects on the   unemployment rate  We undermine our credibility as an institution, and when we need that   credibility, perhaps in the exit, we may suffer from it   And finally, of course, there is the potential risk of inflation down the road  Inflation   may not be in our future in the near term or even maybe in the medium term, but we put   ourselves in a position where managing that future inflation could be extremely difficult  And   undermining our credibility by taking actions that don’t work makes managing that inflation exit   that much more difficult  So these are real costs to our actions today, and we have to place   judgments on how to balance those future costs that are not knowable completely  But we have   to make judgments about those   I am worried that we continue to take actions in ways that have no real coherence to   them  I fully support our conversations yesterday about inflation targeting  I put myself in the   camp of President Kocherlakota—his discussions about systematic policy—and even President   Williams with respect to thinking about more systematic ways of guiding our policy decisions  I   made a suggestion yesterday that this Committee work over time in developing what the   November 1–2, 2011 219 of 282              arguments of that systematic policy ought to be and using those arguments to explain to the   public what our actions are in terms of how those arguments evolve  So I’m very much in favor   of that approach, and I’m very much in favor of not only inflation targeting in articulating our   framework, but also using that framework and potentially the SEPs as a way to provide more   information, more transparency about forward guidance, as opposed to using the calendar    Those would all be steps forward  I was encouraged by our conversation yesterday about that,   and I think those steps will help us mitigate some of the risks that I pointed to—the risks of our   policies down the road   To me, the economy looks, if anything, slightly better, as many people have said, than it   did in August and September when we undertook those actions  The dire prognoses of a lot of   people that we were about to fall off a cliff have not come to pass  That’s not to say they might   not at some future date, but clearly, there’s a little more confidence, I think, that that will not   happen at least in the near term   From my perspective, given our actions in the past two meetings, I am hard pressed to   figure out a justification for further accommodation at this point  I do not believe the maturity   extension program is very effective  I didn’t think it was going to be effective  I was opposed to   it, and I was opposed to the dates  However, the progress we made yesterday and the prospects   that we can strengthen our framework, improve the way we do forward guidance, and push   toward a more systematic approach to policy give me hope that we can manage our way through   this   At this meeting, Mr Chairman, I’m willing to go along with alternative B  I would prefer   that the word “significant” be dropped  I don’t feel terribly strongly about that  Obviously,   there’s a part of me that very much would like to see alternative C, but I am hopeful that some of   November 1–2, 2011 220 of 282              the conversations and progress we made yesterday can translate into a way that will make our   policymaking better and more transparent and help us avoid the kinds of risks that I see of our   policies undertaken in the future  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Just a comment  It’s fine to leave as in the original sentence  However,   in listening to what people said about “significant,” in some sense, the significant risk   domestically, as you point out, has actually mitigated somewhat  What is really true about the   risk is what’s going to happen in Europe  Being more specific—that is the source of the   significant risk, rather than being something else—would be clearer in some way about what   November 1–2, 2011 236 of 282              we’re saying  So that’s just a thought, maybe, for the future  Or maybe instead of saying   “including global financial,” we could say “particularly from global financial markets”  But I   don’t want to gum up the works  "
9384,2011-12-13,PLOSSER,"  To follow up on Richard’s question, one of the things that strikes me   about the dealer survey questions—particularly this one about how is GDP going to be affected   by the European play-out—is it’s not clear to me that the dealers themselves are the right   population to be surveying on the answer to that question  There are other groups, other   economists, and other types of groups in the financial markets and outside the financial markets   that might have something useful to say in response to that  The question I’m asking is  Have   you given any thought to expanding the survey to different groups that might be a little outside   the dealer network, if you will, to broaden the perspective on the types of answers you might get   to at least some of these questions?    I want to follow on this same theme with a little different take    Particularly on the real gross domestic income side, one of the observations that we have is that   certainly over the past four months—and actually longer than that—there have been substantial   December 13, 2011 22 of 198              revisions upward to the establishment survey employment numbers, like 250,000 jobs relative to   the initial estimates  I think the establishment survey goes into calculating initial estimates of   wage income, and so forth, that go into the NIPA accounts  Is there a role for the fact that those   revisions have been so large in recent months?  Does that feed into gross domestic income in a   way that might be consistent with the fact that we are underestimating consumption, or have   been?  They seem to be moving in the same direction  Is there any separate linkage there into the   forecast that we might be concerned about?    I have a second question  Thank you    It was the serial correlation part of it that I was asking about?    A slightly different question  I really appreciate your discussion about   Europe  Who knows whether the sovereigns will be Lucy and pull the ball away from the ECB   once again  We will have to wait and see  But having said all of that, Dave, you mentioned   exports, and you talked a little bit about the asset price changes and the heightened uncertainty  I   would like to see if you can give me a little more quantitative measure of each of those  For   example, if US exports to Europe fell, your standard error of the consequence of that is   probably small relative to perhaps some of the other variables that you are mentioning  Now, I   want to see if I can get you to break down a little bit for me  You’ve marked down the forecast   pretty substantially, and surprisingly a lot compared with what I anticipated  I’m trying to get a   handle on what is the most important channel quantitatively and the magnitude of it  Can you   elaborate a little bit on that?    You have such great anticipation  [Laughter]    So if you took the potential appreciation of dollar—    No  But if you look at your standard error estimates associated with   that forecast, how big is the standard error—what did you say, of two-tenths?    The uncertainty of the mapping    Probably substantially bigger than your point estimate, right?    Yes    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Overall, the economic conditions in the   Third District and the nation have improved somewhat over the intermeeting period  Preliminary   anecdotal reports on activity from our business contacts since late November have been   somewhat encouraging  Several private-sector forecasters revised up their forecasts for fourth-  quarter GDP growth in light of the better-than-expected data   December 13, 2011 34 of 198              Manufacturing activity in the Third District continued to expand in November and   December  Our business outlook survey rebounded into positive territory in October after two   months of negative readings and remained positive in November and now December  The   December readings, which remain confidential until Thursday morning, will come out, and they   indicate a further pickup in the general activity index from the November reading of 36 to 103   in December  The market expectation is for a number like 5, and it’s going to be 103  The new   orders index showed a significant increase  Shipments remain positive as well  Expectations for   future activity, which rebounded significantly in November, increased again in December,   suggesting that business sentiment is turning somewhat more positive   District labor market conditions improved in October, our most recent data for the   District  Employment in our three states grew modestly in October, though at a rate somewhat   slower than the nation, but the unemployment rates moved down in our three states to an average   of 85 percent  In Pennsylvania, the unemployment rate is 81; Delaware, 79; and only New   Jersey, which has a rate of 91, exceeds the national average at this point  Thus, while there are   signs of improvement, I expect we’ll be in a pattern of two steps forward and one step back in   the labor market for some time to come   On the national level, I was encouraged by the relatively strong November employment   report, in particular, the string of upward revisions we’ve seen in the payroll survey over the past   several months  Since July, the upward revisions alone have added 240,000 jobs to payroll   employment  Indeed, analysis of the nonfarm payroll employment revisions by staff at   Philadelphia’s Research Department and the Real-Time Data Research Center has found that   over the period from 1964 through September of 2011 initial estimates of job gains are biased   downward by nearly 18,000 jobs  That is, over the entire sample, the average revision from the   December 13, 2011 35 of 198              initial estimate to the estimate that the BLS releases two months later is 18,000  Moreover, there   appears to be a statistically significant positive bias over the most recent expansionary period  In   particular, from the period July 2009 to September 2011, the average revision to the initial   estimate of job gains is 36,000 jobs per month  This may be a sign that we’re underestimating   the personal income data, too, as I was asking Dave earlier  We probably should take this   possibility into account in our future forecasts  This might explain why consumer spending   seems to have held up better than many of us have expected, given the weak labor markets   My outlook for the national economy really hasn’t changed much over the intermeeting   period  I was a bit more positive than the staff in the last meeting  As I said earlier, I was   somewhat surprised by the further markdown in the Tealbook forecast  The more positive data   suggests to me continued moderate and gradually improving labor market conditions over the   forecast horizon   Although I don’t see inflation as much of a risk in the near term, my inflation outlook is   less sanguine than the Tealbook’s is for some time  I believe there are risks of higher inflation in   the medium term  Inflation has come down in recent months as oil prices have fallen, but   recently, oil prices are back up again, suggesting we may see upward pressure on inflation once   again  The price index in our business outlook survey is coming out on Thursday, and those   price indexes are up as well in December  The prices paid index jumped from 23 to 34, and the   prices received index jumped from 26 to 12  I think this Committee is going to have to be   vigilant in this environment to keep inflation expectations anchored   The European fiscal situation looms large, as we’ve been discussing, as a risk into this   roughly benign outlook, but it isn’t clear to me how the European situation will play out    Financial market ramifications are also highly uncertain  One risk, of course, is that we could   December 13, 2011 36 of 198              have a so-called Lehman-style event where investors pull away from all counterparties and the   markets freeze up  However, it could be that if the situation in Europe worsens, we see a rapid   flight to US Treasuries as a safe haven  This might impose some disruptions, including an   appreciation of the dollar as we’ve been talking about, which would dampen net exports, but that   probably would be quite a different problem than what we saw and experienced in 2008   So far, US financial institutions have been able to access short-term funding markets on   mostly normal terms, and large borrowers in Europe appear to continue to have access to bank   funding  Indeed, one very large US bank with a strong presence in Europe reports that while   European banks are pulling out of some syndicated loans, it has been relatively easy to find US   banks or non-European foreign banks to replace that lost funding  Smaller European borrowers   may have increased problems in securing funding, as European banks continue to try to increase   their capital ratios  However, this may actually increase opportunities for US banks operating   in Europe as they try to increase market share by knocking on doors and taking customers away    We certainly have to remain vigilant to developments in Europe, there’s no question about that    That said, I don’t see a need for us to move preemptively to stave off problems, and the recent   actions taken in Europe give me more hope that the European situation will actually muddle   through and stabilize, and we’ll be able to avoid the most dire outcomes suggested in the   Tealbook’s alternative simulation   My modal forecast for the US is that the economy will continue to grow at a modest   pace with some acceleration to somewhat or slightly above-trend growth in 2012 through 2014    With the moderate pace of growth over the horizon, labor market conditions will gradually   improve  I anticipate that inflation will fall and be around our 2 percent goal over the near term,   but that forecast is predicated on inflation expectations remaining well anchored, which will   December 13, 2011 37 of 198              likely mean that the Committee will need to commence policy tightening well before mid-2013    I remain concerned that we have taken steps that actually create substantial risks of higher   inflation in the medium term if things don’t go just right for us  Thank you, Mr Chairman    They couldn’t afford a coach  [Laughter]    Thank you, Mr Chairman  The recent data suggest that the moderate   economic recovery remains on track  While the European situation poses a risk to this outlook, I   see no evidence to suggest that the Fed should act preemptively to stave off financial market   effects of the European situation beyond what we have done already with the central bank swap   lines  Over the past several years, we have developed many tools that we can use in the event of   a financial crisis, and we must be vigilant and be willing to act as needed  My best guess is that   Europe will muddle through somehow and avoid a full-fledged financial crisis, whose   probability I think remains low  Europeans are likely to do what is necessary to avoid a total   collapse   We continue to provide a large amount of monetary accommodation to support the US   economy as it continues to recover  I see no evidence that trying to push interest rates even   lower will have much effect on what ails this economy or help resolve the European crisis    Trying to tweak our policy for little or no effect seems to risk our credibility  I also fear that our   continued efforts to tweak monetary policy, or to signal that we might do so, can add to the kind   December 13, 2011 93 of 198              of policy uncertainty that so many of us have heard from our business contacts is inhibiting both   investment and hiring   Thus, I can support taking no further action at this time, as in Alternative B  I am not   confident that inflation expectations will remain anchored over the medium term if we keep   trying to increase the degree of accommodation  In my view, we have taken some significant   risks with future inflation  Unless we are extremely mindful of those risks, and are prepared to   act—perhaps aggressively and at the appropriate time and in the face of what may prove to be   substantial political pressure—inflation may prove to be a serious problem at some point down   the road   Regarding language, I am okay with Alternative B language as in the Tealbook  But my   hope is that if we are able to go ahead and publish our policy paths in the SEP in January—as we   will discuss later this afternoon—that we will be able to extricate ourselves from this calendar   date issue as forward guidance in the statement  As you know, I dissented in August in part   because of the use of the calendar date  I didn’t favor this type of communication, since it makes   it less clear that our policy is conditioned on the outlook for the economy  Making the policy   path projection part of the projection exercise is a good way to emphasize the ties between   economic conditions and policy  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I want to start off by thanking Governor   Yellen, Governor Raskin, and President Evans who were on the subcommittee  It has been an   interesting path, to say the least  They’ve put in a lot of work, and I’ve enjoyed working with   them, and it’s been very helpful  Governor Yellen’s opening remarks captured a lot   My own view is that I strongly favor incorporating our projections of appropriate policy   into the SEPs  I view this as a step forward in increased transparency  As Spence indicated, it’s   one that other foreign central banks have taken without particular problems  Increased   transparency about how FOMC participants expect policy to change in light of changes in   economic conditions and the outlook can help the public form expectations about inflation and   future policy  Providing information on FOMC participants’ policy paths with their economic   projections emphasizes that policy is contingent on the evolution of economic conditions  Over   time, in particular, it will help the public understand better the nature of this contingency   I’ve always thought it was odd that we provided forecasts conditioned on appropriate   policy but we didn’t give the public any information about what we assumed appropriate policy   to be  This makes it very difficult for the public to interpret those forecasts  For example, two   participants might have very different growth forecasts, not because they differ on the views   about the underlying dynamics of the economy, but because they’re assuming different policy   paths  The public currently has no information to determine which of those is the case, except   through speeches and other communications that policymakers may engage in  It would   eventually be better if we could match the forecast with the policy paths, but we’re not there yet,   December 13, 2011 127 of 198              and this proposal doesn’t do that  I would be comfortable with that going forward, but that might   be another step   Publishing the policy paths provides greater transparency about the policy actions that   Committee participants see as likely to be appropriate over time in fostering our goals  To me,   the fact that the policy paths will change over time with economic conditions is actually a   strength of the approach, not something to be feared  Indeed, as the policy projections change   over time, I believe it will be pretty clear to the public that these are projections and not pledges   to keep policy on the modal forecast  It will underscore the relationship between current   economic conditions and the current economic outlook  An appropriate policy will give the   public a better understanding of our reaction function over time as they watch these things   evolve   Giving the public a sense of the Committee’s view on appropriate policy in the SEP is a   much better way to convey forward guidance than using calendar dates as we currently do in our   statement or locutions like “considerable period,” or dating back even earlier, “measured pace”    To me, these terms are vague, and the calendar dates suggest that we’re not conditioning on   changes in economic conditions  We are better off giving some quantitative information on the   policy views of the Committee than relying on such vague references   The diversity of views among participants will help convey a sense of confidence bands   about those projections, which I consider a plus, not a minus  As Spence discussed, the Norges   Bank goes much further by providing policy path projections under alternative scenarios with   confidence intervals around them  That might be something we could aspire to do at this point,   but we’d have to do some work to get there from here   December 13, 2011 128 of 198              I do want to emphasize that we should not be thinking of the SEP policy paths as a   separate tool of forward guidance, as some press reports seem to have suggested  The SEP   exercise needs to remain pure  We each submit economic projections conditional on the policy   path that’s in our view appropriate  We should not try to manipulate these policy paths in order   to control the public’s expectations per se  To do so would greatly undermine the credibility of   the SEP exercise and perhaps the credibility of the Committee itself  Should the public interpret   the SEP paths as suggesting more accommodation or less accommodation in the future, so be it    The step of putting out the paths with the SEP is to increase transparency, not really to provide a   separate tool to be manipulated as a policy tool   Going forward, the subcommittee might want to consider some further enhancements    These include showing scatter plots like Loretta showed us in the November briefing, or full   matrices of projections without names—as I suggested—as further steps toward greater   transparency   At this point I’m happy and, indeed, eager to go forward with a mock-up and begin   publishing these data in January  This seems like a natural time since it is the first set of   projections of the year and the Chairman will have an opportunity to explain the purpose    Taking this step at his press conference at the time would be very helpful   On longer-term goals and policy strategies, as most of you know, I’m an enthusiastic   supporter of monetary policy transparency and view communicating with the public about our   framework as a further useful step in clarifying our decisionmaking process  In addition, I   believe that policymaker credibility is an essential part of effective monetary policy, and it’s hard   to be credible without a clearly articulated framework  I strongly support the adoption of the   consensus statement as revised and distributed to the Committee last Friday  As most of you   December 13, 2011 129 of 198              know, it took considerable effort to get to this document—in one sense as much as 15 years  In   another sense, there was an informal committee of presidents that started working even last   January to come up with this strategy, and the subcommittee took up the pen in November to try   to refine it and push it forward   After much deliberation and consultation, some of it more painful than others, we have   ended up with the document that we put before you  This statement involves a number of   compromises on the part of many Committee members, including myself  We’ve all been   willing to make certain compromises because we believe in the greater good that would be   served by articulating to the public our approach to policymaking  It should serve us well not   only in the current environment, but also over the longer run when the economy and monetary   policy return to more normal conditions, hopefully in our lifetime   This document tries, as the Chairman says, to create a big tent, big enough so that it   encompasses the diversity of views in this Committee  It makes important points about our goals   and framework  Because it’s a big tent, there is clearly some ambiguity at points, and there has   to be if we’re going to create the tent big enough  In particular, as Spence noted, it includes an   explicit numerical long-run inflation objective  This will help anchor inflation expectations,   increasing the efficacy of our monetary policy and actually making our exit strategies from   accommodation more effective and more doable   It explains the difference between price stability and maximum employment goals and   why the Committee is able to explicitly set a numerical goal for inflation but has difficultly in   underlining the same explicit objective for maximum employment  It acknowledges that, unlike   longer-run inflation, maximum employment is largely determined by nonmonetary factors and   explains that FOMC participants’ assessments of maximum employment will vary over time and,   December 13, 2011 130 of 198              indeed, are uncertain  Note that some of this variation across participants might reflect different   concepts of maximum employment derived from different approaches to modeling employment    For example, in DSGE models, the metric might correspond to the efficient level of   employment—the level that prevails if all prices were flexible  This efficient level of   employment varies with economic shocks that hit the economy  It differs from the usual NAIRU   concept, and conceptually it differs from the longer-run forecast contained in the SEP  The   beauty of the wording of paragraph 5 is that it provides a big enough tent that both of these   approaches to specifying the maximum employment goal can be thought out in this framework   There are several things in the document I would change if it were my own, but it’s not   my own, and I really don’t want to dwell on those  I feel comfortable that I would be able to   explain my approach to policymaking within the context of the principles laid out in the current   version of the document  I hope that we’ll be able to move forward with this in January, and that   we will be able to include this in the documents that we re-affirm at the annual organizational   meeting each January  After that, it will be incumbent upon us to explain the purpose and the   meaning of these principles in our own speeches and communications with the public  In   particular, we will need to make it clear in our communications that the purpose of affirming   these principles is to better explain our framework  Thank you, Mr Chairman  "
