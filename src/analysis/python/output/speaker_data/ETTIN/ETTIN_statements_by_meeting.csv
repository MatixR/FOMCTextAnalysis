579,1977-12-19,"  Our housing projection is on the high side of most other projections, and it  suggests that, while the housing starts statistics for 1978 will be very close to ’77, it’s about  peaking even now or early in ’78 and will be declining modestly  This view is supported, we  believe, mainly by the funds availability at thrift institutions and other lenders  While deposit  flows have been moderating sharply from the third quarter rate, that third quarter rate was a bit  of an outlier as far as the whole year is concerned  Moreover, we think that those flows to thrift  institutions, as the Bluebook has pointed out, will remain largely [greater than] what we would  expect based on historical rate relationships alone, given changes in ceiling rates that have  occurred in the past and high rates of growth of nominal incomes     Additionally, the amount of repayment of existing mortgages is producing a substantial  cash flow to the thrift institutions that can supplement their deposit flows  Our projection does  call for a considerable reduction in the liquidity of the thrift institutions, but their liquidity is  already very, very high  It also calls for continued, relatively large support from the Federal  Home Loan Banks to the S&Ls, and by FNMA [Fannie Mae] in the secondary mortgage market  acquiring mortgages  But these--the degree of support--is relative to the size of the housing  market in the fund flows--smaller than in past periods of rising interest rates      On the demand side, the most recent statistics, as Mr Zeisel has pointed out,  suggest continuing demand for housing  There is no indication that the price increases in  housing have, as yet, shown much impact on housing demand  Indeed, one can argue that if the  household sector continues to believe that housing is one of the best inflation hedges available,  continued price increases of housing at about the past rates, we believe, should not act as a  considerable dampening on housing demand  There is no indication that we’ve been able to     12/19-20/77 - 50 -         discover, as yet, as to whether resource limitations--in materials, for example--will be adding any  additional buildup in housing prices in 1978  So we think the demand factors are there as well,  given our projections of nominal income    "
691,1978-03-21,"  Yes, $28 billion with original maturities of one year or more matured this   quarter; over half of those have original maturities of four years or more       3/21/78              44 "
755,1978-05-16,"  First of all, the 8-year certificate clearly is a certificate with a lower rate ceiling  than we had been anticipating and for a longer-term [instrument]  We don’t think that would pick  up as much money as, say, raising the ceiling for the existing 4- and 6-year certificates  On the 6- month certificate, we have to admit that we’re working in an area of considerable uncertainty   We’ve never had anything like this; we don’t know how big the impact will be, although we are  reasonably certain that the impact will be larger for thrift institutions than it will be for commercial  banks because of the differential  The cost of the [unintelligible] is directed toward [unintelligible]  funds  Our own judgment had suggested that the 50 basis point increase across the board would be  worth, other things equal, anywhere from 1-3/4 to 2 percentage points of additional growth  Our  best judgment is that this package, other things equal, not adjusted for interest rate changes, would     5/16/78              12  be worth between 1 and 1-1/2 percentage points  It is admittedly the roughest of judgments  because we haven’t had experience with the 6-month certificate    "
813,1978-07-18,  It’s everything except the agencies      Foreign branches and foreign-owned banks operating in the United States are  in the statistics; foreign agencies operating in the United States are not  We hope to revise [the  definition of bank credit] to include those in l979    
838,1978-08-15,"  On the contrary, the delinquency rates declined in the most recent months  I  might also add, Governor Coldwell, that there are demographic reasons that would suggest that the  amount of consumer borrowing should be rising  The baby boomers are between 25 and 35 years  of age and this is the sector that tends to accumulate the most debt as it is acquiring capital assets  and beginning family formations      I don't know the explicit number in the calculations but there has been  increasing criticism of that concept--not only because of how one determines what is full  employment but also because the effect of any given surplus or deficit depends so importantly on  the composition of tax revenues and expenditures  The staff here is trying to develop other  methods of measuring the same thing that the full employment budget surplus or deficit tries to  measure  It is a very complicated issue and we've only made minor progress so far    "
1588,1980-08-12," The only thing I can add to this argument is that the daily pattern of excess reserves historically has been a very poor indicator of the excess reserves for the week Sometimes there's a big buildup in excess early in the statement week and the average will be far away from that because it will drop off later in the week Sometimes it's the exact opposite, as the people taking care of the reserve position in individual institutions are making their own predictions of what the daily pattern in the funds rate will be As for that [recent] period when the excess reserves were very large, there had been similar periods in the past of substantial excess reserves, say on Thursday and Friday, but they had disappeared by the end of the [statement] week So, it's very difficult to predict  No, not to my knowledge There are some drafts of some of the papers, but President Eastburn is right The resources have been diverted for work on the Monetary Control Act  [Statement--see Appendix]  [Coffee break]  We're reasonably confident that that's the trend, because as market rates rise relative to the ceiling rate on passbook  -23-    8/12/80  accounts, we think that's going to slow down It's hard for me to estimate how much that strength in savings deposits is adding to M-1B because the amount of ATS accounts relative to M-1A is relatively small I would say maybe 1/2 percentage point, but that number is pulled out of [the air] The point is that I'd make it on the modest side  That's the reason why the staff places particular emphasis on it  If I may, Governor Wallich, I would point out that to the extent that kind of [positive] ratchet effect would be hitting [velocity] after a sharp run up [of interest rates then], interest rates would be hitting money demand [negatively] Each period with that impact should be shorter and shorter; indeed, the evidence we have is that when it first begin in 1974 it took a little longer than the next round I think the evidence supports that the drop-off [in demand for M1] in the second quarter was very short- lived  We have hard numbers for member banks and estimates and samples for nonmember banks  The ceiling rate for ATS accounts and regular passbook accounts at commercial banks is identical, at 5-1/4 percent One would presume, because our evidence is that everybody is paying the ceiling rate, that it would be unlikely that an ATS account holder would have both an ATS account and a regular savings account It's probably one account To the extent, for whatever reason, that passbook accounts generally have been strong, some of the [depositors] who would be increasing their savings account funds would call their account an ATS account So the measure of those transaction balances would be biased upward  While that's true, I feel less certain that the big run-up in savings may also be [spilling] over into NOWs because we have heard, and have some evidence, that people in fact have a NOW account and a savings account I don't know how much weight to put on it We don't know I am more certain about it for ATS accounts because there is no ceiling differential  My answer, President Corrigan, would depend on how rapidly interest rates rise over the next several months To the extent that market rates do rise, I think there will be some slowing in M2 because market instruments will look somewhat more attractive But I don't think it will make a great difference  Yes, our preliminary estimates suggest that in the week of August 6th there will be an increase in M-1A of over $3 billion I think the market talk may be reflecting Mr Sindlinger, who is expecting an $8 billion increase in the first two weeks  Part of it also is the social security--  Mr Chairman, [some of] those who talked about splitting the difference were talking about the numbers for July to September Just arithmetically, if you do it for the June-to- September figures, you are biasing the numbers a little tighter for the remaining two months of the quarter  Yes  Yes, but given the fact that July itself was stronger for each of the aggregates than the targets adopted the last time--  I don't think so  We'll publish it in a few days  In my view, yes "
1609,1980-08-22," Thank you, Mr Chairman This afternoon we will be publishing an upward revision to the August 6th M-1A that will show an increase from the previous week of--  Can you hear now?  SPEAKER(?) Quite well  All right This afternoon we will be publishing a revision for the week of August 6th, which will show that M-1A was up $97 billion instead of the previously published $82 billion For M-1B we will publish a revised August 6th figure that will be up $104 billion rather than the previously published $89 billion For the week of the 13th, to be published for the first time this afternoon, we will show for M-1A a decline of $36 billion from the upward revised August 6th level and for M-1B a decline of $34 billion from the revised August 6th level  Board Staff estimates based on the preliminary data through August 20th suggest that M-1A in August will rise at a 15 percent [annual] rate and M-1B at a 17-1/4 percent rate Our projection for September for M-1A at this time is for virtually no change; and for M-1B we estimate growth of perhaps between 1 and 2 percent  For the two months, the Board's staff would be looking at about an 8 percent increase as opposed to the ""about 6 percent"" that was targeted by the Committee  10 to 10-1/4  For the week of August 20th, our estimate of the monetary base would be $1587 billion  Unfortunately on this table, I don't have the data prior to August 20th  And that figure is not seasonally adjusted, President Roos  Yes Currency [growth] on the Board estimates has been relatively strong, although somewhat less than projected Currency in July was growing at almost a 12 percent rate and in August at almost a 14 percent rate  In the week of August 6th, it was a very small proportion of the increase Currency only increased $800 million in that week  On the 13th, it declined $400 million to $113 billion Currency has not played a major role  SPEAKER(?) Will you repeat that?  No And not only was it pretty widely spread geographically, it was also spread between member and nonmember banks  These are seasonally adjusted, [in billions of dollars] On the 30th of July, $157164; on the 6th, $157816; on the 13th, $156851 with most of the drop that week being in currency; and on the 20th, $1584  It's a volatile series, yes "
1938,1981-06-17," For April to June  Thank you, Mr Chairman Our current estimate for M-1B shift-adjusted is for a decline of about 43 percent in May and [growth of] around 1 percent in June For the April-June period, where the target was 3 percent or less, our current estimate would be about minus 1-1/2 percent at an annual rate, shift-adjusted That would mean that for the March-to-June period, growth in shift-adjusted M-1B would be about 3-1/2 percent  5-1/2 percent or somewhat less  If that June level held, M-1B would be somewhat below the lower end of its longer-run range Our current estimate for the 10th of June, which will be published this Friday, will only be a couple hundred million above the large reduction that has already been published for the week of June 3rd M2 has also weakened, mainly because of the reduction in M1 We have a 4-1/4 percent rate of growth in May and are anticipating a 6-1/4 percent rate of growth in    6/17/81  June If that June level held, that aggregate, Mr Chairman, would be just above the upper end of its longer-run range M3 has been running considerably stronger, as banks have issued large-denomination CDs in order to accommodate the credit demands that they have been facing M3 in May rose at an 8-1/2 percent rate; in June we're expecting it to rise at a 10-1/2 percent rate That aggregate would continue to be considerably above the upper end of its range On the basis of the June projection, and making various multiplier adjustments, the staff would anticipate that borrowing would fall to a level of about $1800 million If money weakened further in June, borrowing could fall to as low as perhaps $1700 million In the intermeeting period to date virtually every interest rate is below its level at the time of the FOMC meeting and also below the highs for the intermeeting period, of course Corporate rates, for example, are off about 85 basis points since the FOMC meeting and the three-month bill rate is down about 2-1/2 percentage points  We've taken out $180 million in the first four- week period, reflecting the weakness in the monetary aggregates that the Committee was permissive toward, and another $200 million for overshooting borrowings in the first week when there was a very high demand for borrowing That was offset by a multiplier adjustment of about $350 million that went the other way  That's right  Yes  So, essentially, it's $180 million for the weakness in money growth  That's right It's in the first four-week period We've made no adjustments for the second three-week period that starts tomorrow  No  There are no further adjustments  March to June is 3-1/2 percent "
