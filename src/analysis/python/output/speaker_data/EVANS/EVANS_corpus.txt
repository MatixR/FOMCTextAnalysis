  Thank you very much     Dave, your presentation seemed to hit on all the right points with regard to   the forecast  I am reminded, though, that Chicago is no longer the hog butcher capital of the   world  [Laughter]  Still, I have a forecasting question  In the briefing yesterday, you quantified   the financial stress effects on GDP growth that you talked about this morning as about ½   percentage point in the second half of this year and about ½ percentage point in 2008  Having   read the alternative simulations for a number of years, I know it is not uncommon for an   alternative that starts off with financial difficulties to have a small effect on the outlook, then   there is a layering on of the consumer sentiment and it drops off a little more  So I am curious   about sorting out these components with an idea toward, if the policy action were taken as a form   of insurance against these risks, what the early warning signs that those insurance reasons are   really no longer critical would be  Would we quickly see objective measures of the turnaround?    Is consumer sentiment the key?  Presumably, financial conditions would be a little more evident   in their improvement     Thank you, Mr Chairman  To date, economic conditions in the Seventh   District have changed little since our last meeting  We continue to expand at a modest rate, as   reported in the Beige Book two weeks ago  Even after accounting for continuing declines in the   housing sector, most of my contacts thought the national economy had softened  Outside of   housing, they generally reported a modest deceleration rather than an abrupt change in   conditions  Retailers thought that continued high energy prices were holding back consumers,   but demand was not seen as deteriorating sharply  A similar slowing was reported on the hiring   front  For instance, Kelly and Manpower experienced softer demand for temporary workers, but   again this was not characterized as a general pullback in hiring  Many contacts added that   finding skilled workers remained difficult, as President Fisher mentioned   In terms of the business outlook going forward, several directors and other contacts noted   that many in the business community were apprehensive about the prospects for growth  They   were concerned that these worries might soon begin to weigh more heavily on actual spending    For example, in the motor vehicle sector, both Ford and General Motors cautioned that the   August sales numbers overstated the underlying strength in demand for vehicles  They thought   some selective incentive programs had boosted the sales figures  I asked all my contacts about   September 18, 2007 65 of 188    the effects of the turmoil in credit markets  Though it is still early, none of them thought that the   recent financial turbulence was causing creditworthy nonfinancial firms to have unusual   difficulty in finding adequate financing  As several people have said, many business people   suggested that the situation is much better than what they hear from financial commentators on   Wall Street  Of course, we heard many examples of difficulties from financial market contacts,   and several have spoken about that already   Turning to the national outlook, three broad developments since our August meeting have   influenced my views on the economic situation  First, financial conditions have become more   restrictive  Second, the incoming data suggest a greater decline in housing and a somewhat   weaker labor market  Third, inflation prospects have improved to the point where my outyear   projections are within a range that many participants would view as consistent with price   stability  These projections embed a path for the federal funds rate that is similar to the   Greenbook assumption     With regard to financial conditions, I think it is useful to consider the situation relative to   an assessment of a neutral or an equilibrium federal funds rate  Taking into account the slower   growth of structural productivity, a neutral rate is likely between 4½ and 4¾ percent  The   Greenbook-consistent rate is in this range  Until recently, one argument for keeping the target   funds rate at 5¼ percent had been to offset otherwise accommodative conditions  As recently as   June, we had very low risk premiums and ample liquidity for all types of private borrowing,   including large commitments for private equity deals  Now, of course, overall financial   conditions have tightened and in some markets have turned very restrictive  Clearly, this   restrictiveness is a downside for growth  Whether it is as large as ½ percentage point, as the   Greenbook assumes, is uncertain  In any event, the ongoing repricing of risk also adds a good   September 18, 2007 66 of 188    deal of uncertainty to the forecast  You all know it is very difficult to forecast the impact of such   financial turbulence  Recent history and Dave Stockton remind us of this  In the early 1990s,   restrictive credit due to depositories’ capital adequacy problems had a significant impact on real   economic activity  In contrast, in the fall of 1998, we thought financial conditions would   impinge a good deal on the real economy, but 1999 turned out to be a very strong year for   growth  Bottom line—and we all recognize this—we need to be careful how we react to the   current financial situation   Turning more specifically to the outlook for growth, our Chicago forecasts have tended to   be somewhat more optimistic than the Board staff forecast, and we remain so  That said, the   incoming data have been softer than we expected  So we marked down our assessment of   residential investment again, but not as much as the Board staff did—again, and the decline in   payroll employment caused us to lower our near-term outlook somewhat  As long as the   financial difficulties are contained, and that is our working assumption, we expect growth to   return to potential by the second half of 2008, and we have a higher potential output growth rate   than the Board staff  However, I admit that the risks seem weighted to the downside of this   projection     With regard to inflation, the improvement in core PCE inflation earlier this year appears   to have a bit more staying power than we thought it might  If aggregate demand does weaken, as   expected, then there is less risk of inflationary pressures arising from constraints on resource   utilization  Energy prices, though, are a concern  My contacts do not seem to have much   difficulty passing cost increases through to their customers  Overall, however, we have core   PCE inflation edging down to 18 percent next year and remaining near that rate in 2009  I see   September 18, 2007 67 of 188    the risk to this inflation forecast, conditioned on the outlook for growth, as being fairly well   balanced  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Given my outlook for growth and inflation and   my assessment of the neutral federal funds rate, I can readily agree to 50 basis points in cuts on a   cumulative basis  I came into this meeting having a slight preference for alternative C and doing   25 basis points today with an expectation of 25 at the next meeting  I thought that that would take   us to a point at which more data would come out and it would be more likely that we could perhaps   stop at a 4¾ percent fed funds rate  Obviously, if we cut 50 basis points today, and I have no   disagreement with that, I think it is then a little more difficult to stop there  I agree with some of the   previous comments that any action beyond that should be based on incoming data that we don’t   expect  That is kind of difficult from a communication standpoint  But I’m fine with alternative B    In fact, the language is fine   I’d just like to take a minute to talk about risk management  We talked a lot about that in   terms of tail risk and nonlinearities and insurance, and I think this is quite appropriate in the current   environment  But we have to continue to ask, What happens in the more likely event that things   turn out better than these tail events?  That’s why they’re called tail events  So I agree with   Governor Mishkin that we have to be very careful to think about taking them back  If we respond   aggressively to address financial conditions beyond our dual mandate goals, we should be prepared   to retrace that pattern of federal funds rate cuts if conditions calm  With respect to the comments   that Governor Kroszner made about inflation, I think you have to be a little careful  My memory of   ’98 was that we actually had a tightening bias when the Russian default–LTCM came in  We cut   75 basis points  Things got better  By the spring, we were debating whether or not we should   tighten  By the June meeting, we did begin to tighten, and we went up to 6½ percent  My memory   of core CPI in 2000 is that it increased about ¾ percentage point  I think there was some divergence   September 18, 2007 109 of 188    between PCE and CPI over that time period  It is something to keep in mind, but I can support 50   today     Are you saying that the minimum rate is going to be a secret?     I just didn’t realize this was as highly confidential     Thank you, Mr Chairman  It’s a very creative proposal, and I agree   basically with the comments that President Rosengren and Governor Kroszner said about it  It’s   important that the collateral be appropriate and well established, and it’s definitely better if we don’t   have simply a small number of borrowers  It’s also important we know that we hit our funds rate   target because this is, you know, tied to the effective federal funds rate  So if we’re really soft on   that, then it’s going to be an even better opportunity for everyone  But as I think about it, it seems   as though this is an opportunity to narrow the spread to 10 basis points instead of the 50 basis points   that we actually have on the discount window, except for the eligibility requirements  So I can   support this as a temporary facility, but I’m glad that we’re going to have more time to think about   it     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Seventh District economy appears to be   expanding at a moderate rate, similar to what I reported at our last meeting  As we talked with   business contacts, we heard mixed reviews regarding activity across different sectors of the   economy  On the downside, everyone in the construction industry, from builders to suppliers, had   grim assessments, and our contacts with the Detroit Three characterize the vehicle market as   mediocre  Another negative is on the labor front  Our contact at Manpower reported that demand   for temporary workers was down a lot  He said that the current market felt almost as it did in 2001    Kelly’s assessment was not quite so negative, although they did say that some indicators were   October 30-31, 2007 47 of 162    flashing yellow  Of course, the BLS has been showing declines in temp help employment since   early 2006, and most other indicators point to a healthy labor market  Indeed, we continue to hear   about firms trying to cope with shortages of skilled workers  For instance, a couple of heavy-  equipment manufacturers based in Illinois said that they were recruiting engineers from the Detroit   area  That was encouraging  There were other upbeat reports on activity  United Airlines said that   all their markets were quite good, apparently better than President Fisher was reporting earlier    They noted the bookings for business travel, which can be an indicator of business’s more general   willingness to spend, remained strong in October and November  International bookings also were   extremely good  We heard numerous reports of strong export demand—for example, for machine   tool manufacturers and heavy-equipment producers  With regard to the financial situation, I   continue to hear that there is a disconnect between Wall Street and Main Street  Importantly, except   for construction, our contacts do not see nonfinancial firms being constrained by a lack of access to   credit or by the pricing of credit   Turning to the macroeconomy, the news on economic activity that we’ve received over the   past six weeks has been better than the downside scenario that we feared  Indeed, it has been better   than what we had assumed in our baseline forecast in September  Like the Greenbook, we have   raised our outlook for growth in the second half of 2007 about ½ percentage point  Residential   investment does look a bit worse than we thought, but consumption came in a good deal stronger   than we had expected  Also, the incoming news about labor markets, including the revisions to   employment in August, points to continued support to household spending from growth in jobs and   income  Unlike the Greenbook, we marked up the outlook for activity a bit in 2008 and 2009  Our   current projection sees growth recovering to a little above potential in the second half of next year   and in 2009   October 30-31, 2007 48 of 162    With regard to inflation, the incoming price data have been positive, and we have revised   down our forecast for inflation a bit, to about 1¾ percent in 2008 and 2009  I think the risks to this   forecast are two-sided  Some of our statistical models translate the incoming data into quite low   forecasts for inflation in 2009 and 2010 if you take them at face value  But higher costs for energy   and other materials, the weaker dollar, and potential pressures from resource utilization still pose   some risk that inflation will come in higher than we currently are forecasting  For me, the positive   inflation developments are an important ingredient allowing us to focus on risk management  Since   risk-management considerations have played a key role in our policy decisions, it is important to   think about how the risks to the forecast have changed since September  Last time and today, Dave   Stockton cited several downside risks to watch for  an intensified fallout from the problems in   mortgage finance onto housing demand; a substantial drop in consumer sentiment; and a spillover   from financial market disruptions to business spending  These high-cost scenarios are possible, but   I think their likelihood is smaller than they were in September  We have been pessimistic on   housing for a while, and for once, despite Dave Stockton’s warning, I am encouraged that the   Greenbook’s forecast for 2008 has not been marked down materially  It is a small comfort, but just   a bit  The economy outside of housing seems to have entered the fourth quarter with more   momentum than we had thought it would  Importantly, consumption growth has been solid even   though there has been another downtick in sentiment   On the financial front, the Greenbook points to the special Beige Book capital spending   questions and to the senior loan officer survey as signals that we could expect more spillovers to   nonfinancial activity  Tighter standards for C&I loans are definitely news, but they are hardly   surprising  The real news will be next quarter  Looking at previous surveys, we had one bad   quarter in 1998, and then it came down, and then the later tightening was part of the increase in the   October 30-31, 2007 49 of 162    fed funds rate  So I think that the next quarter will be very informative and important  In assessing   how risks have changed, these surveys need to be balanced against the improvements we have seen   in credit markets  While I continue to be concerned about collateral damage from the credit markets   to real activity, I still think the problems in financial markets are likely to remain largely walled off   from the nonfinancial economy  So on balance, the economic outlook has improved, and the risks   of financial contagion have diminished somewhat since September, although they haven’t   disappeared  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Brian, we don’t have a long history of announcing the risk assessments   contemporaneously with the decision, so I’m curious as to your take on the likely response  In   alternative B, section 4, it says that the Committee views the downside risks to economic growth   as the greater policy concern, and I think you said that markets would likely see a funds rate   decline as forthcoming  What has been our experience when we have invoked this type of risk   and what has the actual policy been afterward?       So as I thought about this briefly, it seemed to me as though it’s not   unusual for us to say that, because of the risks of higher inflation, we don’t feel we’d take action   in subsequent meetings for quite some time  But when we have had this type of assessment—I   October 30-31, 2007 85 of 162    think there have been only a couple of opportunities—usually we’ve had a decline pretty quickly   thereafter     Thanks     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I find myself in agreement with so many things   that have been said already, no matter how the conflict may appear  This is a close call  I think it’s   a tough decision  I have, frankly, gone back and forth in thinking about the nuances here  It is the   case that the data have been better than I expected at the time of our September meeting  The ADP   October 30-31, 2007 107 of 162    report this morning sort of continues that  It didn’t have to work out that way, but 106,000 is a   pretty strong number  I’m still trying to figure out exactly how to project that to payroll   employment  The bad news that we have seen in terms of surveys has hardly been surprising, given   our views and what we would have expected in September  So I found myself grappling with many   of the ideas that President Plosser was talking about earlier in terms of data dependence and our   decision and discussion in September  One view is that 50 basis points in September was seen as   enough, and we would be judging our future actions on the basis of deterioration in our forecast—  data that come in worse than that or some information about risks that are hard to quantify but we   thought would be important  I haven’t seen the impetus for that  So that’s one view  Then the   other view is the risk-management perspective  Maybe many people, President Yellen included,   thought that more than 50 was required but only 50 in September was really achievable without   startling markets  So there’s a tension there     Mr Chairman, I really enjoyed your speech in St Louis, when you talked about different   responses to different types of uncertainty  With the sort of standard Brainard response, when the   economy might be changing but we have a lot of uncertainties, we go slowly and we look at it    Juxtaposed against that are other types of risk, such as the financial risks, where things could be   moving much more quickly and we don’t fully appreciate the potency of policy and what we can do   against certain tail risks  In that case, the robust control type of approach suggests that we should do   more; then in the event that we find that policy is very effective, we can reverse it  Of course,   reversing it is important—we talked about that last time, too     It seems to me that we’re close to the limits of initial risk management  That’s how I’ve   thought about this, and I thought that Governor Kohn’s comment that we shouldn’t view this as an   open-ended commitment to risk management was very important  After all, how can you ever   October 30-31, 2007 108 of 162    argue that more insurance won’t help against some catastrophe, some unforeseen tail risk that hasn’t   yet happened?  There is a lot of value to setting a benchmark stopping point for how you would   respond to that tail risk  Then if other evidence intervenes to make you reassess the likelihood of   that tail risk or the cost of it, then there’s reason to do more  But I think there’s value to putting the   benchmark out there  Another way to stop this insurance is if we end up balancing the risk  The   actions taken move our inflation risk up, and we’ve had some concerns about that  I’m actually   pretty comfortable with the inflation risks, and people have reminded me that I’m pushing this   pretty far  I’ve taken more comfort from our ability to forecast inflation than perhaps others   would—it seems to have a pretty reasonable trajectory  But as we continue to move toward more-  accommodative policy in the hopes of addressing a tail risk, I think those risks go up, too   As I looked at table 1 and I struggled with the rate decision, it seemed to me that the balance   of risks was more important, and what got my attention early on was the risk assessment under   alternative A  I thought it was important to project our assessment that risks were a little more   balanced  I can easily imagine that we’ll have reasons to reduce the fed funds rate because we think   that r* is lower, but it’s purely opportunistic to take advantage of that now  We could have done   that several meetings ago, but we can do it opportunistically  So I’m okay with the action of   25 basis points today, and I think that the balanced risk assessment is important  We probably do   need to think about the linkages with our projections; I hadn’t really taken full account of that   myself  That will put me and, I hope, many of us much closer to the views that President Plosser   expressed in terms of data dependence because I think that the risks will be balanced in how the   data continue to roll out in the intermeeting period  So thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I can support both the temporary term auction   facility and the swap lines  I think that the Board and the Open Market Desk have done a   number of things already to try to make it more attractive either to borrow at the window or to   provide additional liquidity, which can help us with these issues in the markets at the end of the   year  I agree with the view that these additional instruments are useful and should help with that   normal functioning  As I understand it, of course, Bill Dudley will still be charged with hitting   our federal funds rate target, and our monetary policy targets will be in place; and as I see it, the   more we do everything that we can to address the year-end problems with these additional   instruments, the more we can have the Federal Open Market Committee focus more squarely on   the macro dual mandate objectives as we look at the economy for maximum employment and   price stability  So I can support this  Thanks     Thanks  Dave, I have two questions, I suppose  The first one is that the   Greenbook GDP forecast has come down a good bit since October  At the same time, the   Greenbook-consistent short-run equilibrium real funds rate was revised down ¾ percentage   December 11, 2007 22 of 138    point  How much independent information is there between these two observations?  I mean, the   equilibrium real funds rate is the rate which, if maintained for some period of time, would get us   back up to potential growth  So the fact that you have marked that down suggests that you   would have a lower real rate  The second question is this  We were expecting the economy to   slow during the current period  Expectations of slowing versus slowing that is revealed in the   data are very important for how we think about the outlook—maybe you said this, but I don’t   recall it  Could you give me an idea of how in the Greenbook your assumptions have evolved   since October with regard to prospective losses due to mortgage foreclosures and the write-  downs that the banks are expected to take or have announced on this?  Do you have some   numbers in mind on how things have changed in that regard and how that might be influencing   your housing outlook?  Thank you     Thank you     As I was looking at the alternative simulations and the credit crunch scenario   and trying to make sense of what financial markets are thinking about in terms of the expected fed   funds rate path, it seems as though you need that credit crunch scenario to get to that type of path,   and that’s not where you are  Then there are also other scenarios that are slightly stronger, which I   think are in line with more Blue Chip types of forecasts, too  So there really is a disconnect in a lot   of this     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Coming out of our October meeting, I   expected a period of subpar growth stretching into the middle of 2008  Since I was anticipating   some soft data, it was not obvious to me that the outlook had worsened until later in the   December 11, 2007 42 of 138    intermeeting period  A lot of the data that we have cited are financial items that are difficult to   assess and are somewhat unusual for the current period  But the incoming information has   caused us to mark down our outlook further, although we don’t see growth declining as far   below potential as in the Greenbook baseline forecast  Although housing continues to weaken,   that by itself did not cause a substantial revision to our outlook  The bigger factor was a   noticeable weakening of consumption  PCE was basically flat in September and October—I   guess dead on arrival  The financial headlines are taking their toll on consumer sentiment, and   higher energy prices are lowering real incomes   It is not clear, however, that we are seeing a major sustained pullback in consumption;   but, of course, that is arguable  The limited information we have about November—motor   vehicle sales and the chain store data—suggest at least modest gains in consumer expenditures  I   realize that the chain store sales could be a bit artificial  I was talking to one of my business   contacts who has a significant presence in retail, and I am accustomed to hearing that, “Well, the   Christmas season is a bit short this year, so that could be a problem”  But I actually caught him   this time saying, “Gee, it’s so long this time that people seem to be losing interest”  [Laughter]    On balance, I think the fundamentals for consumption are still reasonably good     Importantly, although they may be somewhat lagging, the payroll numbers are still   consistent with decent growth in wage income, and the unemployment rate remains low    Elsewhere, foreign growth remains good, which along with the lower dollar should support   continued growth in exports  We have seen some softening in capital spending as well, but the   usual indicators still point to moderate gains in investment  These developments seem   reasonably consistent with what I heard from business contacts  Most of them think that growth   is slowing, and they are more cautious, but I would summarize their views as guarded and not   December 11, 2007 43 of 138    alarmist  Furthermore, many say that their improved inventory control methods are preventing   an inventory cycle from exacerbating the current situation, and they bring this up without my   prompting  So to me their comments do not yet suggest a sharp curtailment in real economic   activity   Of course, the financial markets continue to weigh negatively on the outlook  In my   view, the biggest concerns are the large markdowns on structured securities and the volume of   assets that may be returning to banks’ balance sheets  These effects appear to be larger than the   banks had planned for as of October and could have a significant impact on lending capacity    This is an important downside risk to the real economy, as the Greenbook highlights in many   places  That said, when I talk with my business contacts, there continues to be a disconnect   between the credit conditions they report facing and the turbulence we see in money and credit   markets  Outside of lending for residential and nonresidential construction, my CEO contacts at   nonfinancial firms do not report much change in credit costs or availability  We have heard this   from a number of sources  For example, two of the larger banks in our District said they have   not changed terms to borrowers, and they expressed relatively sanguine views of lending   conditions overall  For the time being, some lenders report offsetting a portion of their higher   funding costs by taking a hit on their interest margins   Credit conditions for construction-related industries are another matter  A major   shopping center developer who has been one of the largest issuers of commercial mortgage-  backed securities indicated that this market has dried up completely  However, the developer has   been able to obtain financing from other traditional sources, such as life insurance companies    He is paying similar interest rates, he says, but the terms include lower loan-to-value ratios  So   there is some credit effect, but he still has access for the moment  That is a bit like what   December 11, 2007 44 of 138    President Lacker was suggesting  He said the switch is not a big deal for him currently, but if it   continues for too long—say, for more than six months or so—it would then weigh more heavily   on his business activity  The evolution of such developments will obviously be an important   thing to watch over the next few meetings  I would just note that I don’t often look at the Duke   University survey of CFOs  But as I looked at it—and I don’t have a great deal of experience—  it did seem to indicate that they had higher spending plans on average from their September   survey for capital expenditures and technology spending  It wasn’t a great bit, but given all the   negative headlines associated with the credit conditions—which are unweighted, whereas these   spending plans are weighted—that was a bit of a surprise     Putting all of this together, we have marked down our current quarter and 2008 real GDP   forecasts 04 percentage point, which is pretty significant  We now have growth next year of   2¼ percent  We expect growth to improve to our assessment of potential thereafter, namely   about 2½ percent  This forecast assumes two policy easings, similar to but sooner than the   Greenbook, and it is shaded toward the “stronger domestic demand” alternative scenario, which   has less financial restraint on PCE and business fixed investment than in the Greenbook baseline   Turning to inflation, our forecast is for PCE inflation to settle in at 18 percent  This   continued favorable projection for inflation is important for my policy views now  We think   resource utilization likely will be about neutral for inflation over this forecast period  Our GDP   projection does not result in appreciable resource slack over the forecast period  Even under the   weaker Greenbook scenario, the GDP gap remains less than ½ percentage point  But there are   upside risks  The most recent data on core prices have been a bit higher  The lower dollar could   put pressure on prices, and my business contacts remain concerned about the cost of energy and   other commodities  Finally, at least by the Board staff calculations, five-year forward TIPS   December 11, 2007 45 of 138    inflation compensation has moved up to the range that it was in during the spring of 2006, a   period when we were more concerned about the inflation outlook  I wouldn’t put too much   weight on this particular inflation expectation development at the moment, but it may be looming   ahead  So I continue to see upside risk to inflation, which if realized would complicate our   policy reaction to developments on the growth and employment side of the ledger  Thank you,   Mr Chairman     Brian, thank you very much for that answer  I have a clarifying question   because I’m not quite sure I caught, in the way you talked about the economic risks in section 4 of   alternative B, how they could be added  One thing that I wanted to ask about is that in section 2   there’s no mention of downside economic risks  At least the five or six times I read it, I couldn’t   find it  That seems different from alternative C and alternative A, and also the October statement, at   least in the balance of risk, mentioned downside risks to growth  Is there a particular message that   we’re thinking about sending with that?  I guess part of the question is that, without some mention   of expected slowing, are we maybe undercutting our November forecast that we published?  It   seems natural that there would be some discussion about how things have slowed relative to what   December 11, 2007 95 of 138    we were expecting  I mean, that might be one way that those forecasts would be interpreted and   used  But I lay that out as a question     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I favor a ¼ point reduction in the fed funds   rate today  As I noted earlier, assuming some ease in policy, my forecast is that the economy   will experience subpar growth stretching into the middle of 2008 but then recover as we move   into 2009 and that inflation will remain contained  Our forecast assumes that the disruptions in   financial markets will generate more-restrictive credit conditions for consumers and businesses   than we have seen to date, though not to the degree assumed in the Greenbook baseline  In light   of my outlook, I think that policy should be somewhat accommodative; and given that I think the   long-run neutral nominal funds rate is somewhere around 4½ to 4¾ percent, I support further   easing  Given our expectations of coming financial restraint, there is a good chance that we will   December 11, 2007 110 of 138    ultimately want to reduce the funds rate 50 basis points, but I prefer to go slower than that and   move down only 25 basis points today   The slowing in consumption that we have recently seen reflects only a couple of months   of data that followed quite strong growth during the summer, and much of that softening may   reflect the transitory jump in gasoline prices  So I don’t think it is clear that we have seen a real   change in the trajectory of consumption  I think the degree of financial spillover built into the   Greenbook baseline is a plausible scenario, but we have not seen such spillover yet  The   pessimistic view is a very forward-looking one, and I applaud forward-looking thinking  I am   not quite there yet, but that is definitely a risk  I hesitate to say that we will know more next   meeting because it is such an obvious thing to say, but I definitely agree with Governor Kohn   that by the end of January we will at least have a better idea of how the TAF funding went and   how much of the recent increase in liquidity demand and related disruptions are transitory end-  of-year problems as opposed to more-fundamental problems that would impinge dramatically on   credit conditions for nonfinancial borrowers  We will also know more about the actual strength   of consumption and investment  Another concern I have about a 50 basis point move today is   that the public might see it as an indication that we have read the incoming news more negatively   than I at least think we should have, so I agree with Presidents Hoenig and Fisher on that  This   would have negative implications for the already fragile state of consumer and market sentiment    But from here to a 4 percent fed funds rate, I think that the inflation risks are acceptable  Beyond   that, I think it depends importantly on inflation developments and also developments in the   economy     In terms of the statement, I prefer alternative B  I like the additional sentence that Brian   was suggesting in section 4 for the balance of risks  But however that comes out, in reading   December 11, 2007 111 of 138    section 2, when I was asking the question, it just seemed to me natural that after “incoming   information suggests that economic growth is slowing” something like “somewhat more than   previously expected” might be helpful, but nobody else has really mentioned that, and I am okay   with that   Finally, on the political concerns, my memory is that we raised the funds rate during the   2000 and 2004 elections, so I am not really concerned about that, although people will wonder    Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I would not have thought to call an   intermeeting videoconference  I tend to think of the in-person meetings as those where we make   the decisions and do the analysis  But since you made us think about it, I agree with your   assessment of the economy  I think that things are noticeably softer  I don’t think there is much   accommodation in place at a funds rate of 4¼ percent  To influence aggregate demand   noticeably we probably need accommodation on the order of what you are talking about, which   is about 100 basis points from a neutral federal funds rate  That range is probably on the order of   4½ to 4¾, so that would put such accommodation at 3½ percent  We have to recognize that   monetary policy, if it is going to have any influence on aggregate demand, is going to do so with   a lag  That is what all our analysis assumes and suggests, and so if we want to influence   aggregate demand to limit midyear weakness, I think we need to take action sooner rather than   later   January 9, 2008 27 of 60    In terms of the data developments that you talked about, one thing that is taking place   right now is that uncertainty is being resolved  The weakness that we are seeing I am currently   interpreting tentatively as sort of an unraveling of things that we haven’t seen so far, not   necessarily a deeper weakness  The December data have been weaker  The employment data   were poor, and the unemployment rate was a lot higher  In constructing my outlook for the   economy in 2008 and beyond, I had been more optimistic than many that consumer spending   would hold up in part because of the positive labor market situation  Taken at face value, the   December employment report puts a crack in that supporting foundation  It is now likely, it   seems to me, that consumer spending will soften with these labor developments   Dave Stockton went through a bit of analysis of the indicators that might lead to a   recession  President Lacker and you, Mr Chairman, mentioned regime-switching as well  I just   want to mention that in Chicago we have been publishing our Chicago Fed National Activity   Index for a number of years  We started out right at the onset of the 2001 recession, as it turns   out  As you know, Mr Chairman, this index is very closely related to your data-rich   environment analysis with Jean Boivin and Stock and Watson  If you do an analysis where you   try to assess these regime-switching events, this indicator has done a fairly good job of picking   that out when it goes below a threshold of, say, minus 07  That is some of the probabilistic   analysis that I did with this back then  If you take some of the developments in the employment   report at face value, I think that this is headed for a probability of recession this year that is   higher than 50 percent  So we have to be a little concerned about that  Anyway, that is the   economic situation that I worry about a good bit   What about inflation?  Clearly there are risks, and the risks are evident  Core inflation   rates are projected to be higher in the near term  Headline inflation has been significantly above   January 9, 2008 28 of 60    core for long enough to make people wonder about underlying inflation, but inflation   expectations have remained contained  With energy prices traversing high levels over a short   time, the possibility of pass-through during a period of economic weakness cannot be dismissed    We also have to be concerned about the reputational cost of inflation going up  But, again, I   agree with you, Mr Chairman, that if we do end up with significantly weaker economic activity,   it would limit the inflation risk   What is hard in this period is balancing the risks of going slowly on monetary policy if   we really think that the risk of a recession is higher  I agree with what you said and Governor   Mishkin’s thinking about being aggressive in the near term to respond to weakening aggregate   demand and then making sure that we take back any excessive accommodation at the appropriate   time  I know that’s hard, but I think that’s what we should do  I would actually favor action   today on the order of 50 basis points because I think that’s about the only way to get to 3½ in a   quick enough period of time by our next meeting  That’s what I would prefer  Anyway, those   are my comments     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I strongly support this recommendation  At   our last videoconference, I was in favor of action at that time  The situation has deteriorated   since then  I think the macroeconomic outlook supports this type of move  As we look at the   data, we are on the edge of a more serious downturn  It is not exactly clear how large that will   be, but we ought to be pricing in at least 100 basis points of accommodation against what I think   of as sort of a medium-term neutral rate of about 4½, and this is a move that takes us there  I   January 21, 2008 10 of 32    think the growth risks are definitely greater, and the real question after this is what it means for   our meeting next week  But I strongly support this      Thank you, Mr Chairman  I have a couple of questions that are somewhat   different  On the labor front, I’m curious if you could offer some thoughts on how deterioration in   the labor market might be coming about—whether or not it would be from the hiring front or the   job-destruction front  As the research literature has evolved over a long time, I think it has moved a   bit away from job destruction playing the key role and more toward reductions in hiring  I wonder   how this informs the way you look at the data  Any insights you have into that would be quite   helpful  Then I wonder if you could just talk a bit more about the interesting memo that was   January 29–30, 2008 33 of 249    distributed on inflation compensation and the implications for expectations  As I read it, it seemed   to indicate that inflation expectations, if anything, were coming down from the five-year forward   but that inflation compensation was higher  So does that mean that the variance of inflation is   higher?  Are people talking about the possibility of disinflation during this period?  I would expect it   to come with that type of compensation  Your thoughts on that would be great     I neglected to say how interesting that memo was  The analysis is really   very good  I look forward to seeing more of it   January 29–30, 2008 34 of 249      That’s what I was focusing on—the mean-preserving nature of that     I guess I was thinking that, if you talk to people, you hear more about the   job destruction aspect, but you don’t hear quite the same information about hiring, except you   might hear more nervousness  That’s all     Thank you, Mr Chairman  My assessment of the national economy is   that we are in the midst of a period of very weak growth and that there is a significant chance of   a serious downturn  The three-month average of our Chicago Fed National Activity Index in   December was minus 067  Historically, by my calculation, such a value has been associated   with a recession about 70 percent of the time  Now, in the Board briefings yesterday and again   today, I noticed that Thomas Laubach’s estimate is 45 percent based on the same data, and that is   certainly large enough for concern   Reports from my business contacts seem broadly consistent with this slow but positive   growth scenario  The most positive news I received was from firms whose international   businesses were strong  As one would expect, the most dire reports were from those in   residential construction and related industries  While I was surprised to hear from the CEO of a   national specialty retail chain that its business over the past 60 days was the worst he has seen in   45 years, much of his business is in housewares and furniture; but he indicated that many other   segments of the retail sector were also struggling  I also spoke with the CEO of General Motors    His outlook was a lot like what President Fisher was just mentioning from other CEOs  They are   looking for slow economic growth overall, and they are concerned about the risk of a serious   downturn  That is not what they are planning on  The industry is clearly facing softer demand,   but his expectation for 2008 as a whole is for only a moderate decline in light motor vehicle   sales, down to a pace of about 15¾ million units  GM’s current production plans are not   premised on recession-level sales, but they are prepared to cut production quickly if they see the   January 29–30, 2008 73 of 249    economy turning down  He also reported that, while the performance of GMAC’s auto loans   currently was okay, the credit quality of prospective buyers—people coming into showrooms—  has declined and that lenders have tightened underwriting standards for those loans  In addition,   if auto loans became more difficult to securitize, it would be a big additional problem    Apparently, so far they are robust, though   Turning to the forecast details, my modal outlook for 2008 is close to that in the   Greenbook  I expect that we will eke out positive growth in the first half of 2008  This   expectation largely reflects the judgment that businesses have not begun to ratchet down   spending plans in the nonlinear fashion that characterizes a recession  My assessment also has   been influenced by some positive developments that we have seen  The most notable ones in my   mind are that UI claims have moved down, that major banks are having some success raising   capital from a variety of sources, and that the orders data today were better  For the second half   of 2008, I see growth increasing toward potential by year-end  This assessment depends   importantly on accommodative monetary policy and expansionary fiscal policy  Our cumulative   actions following this meeting should provide noticeable stimulus to the economy by midyear    Tax rebates should also help somewhat this year  In addition, the financial system should   continue to sort through its difficulties, making further headway in price discovery and repairing   capital positions  So in the absence of further negative developments, growth should improve in   the second half of this year  I then see real GDP rising at a pace a bit above potential in 2009   Although this seems like a plausible projection, it has the feel of threading the needle,   which brings to mind nimbleness, and Governor Kohn is our expert at nimbleness, so I start   thinking about how his nimble fingers will be critical for threading this needle  The downside   risks are large, and the recession scenarios are quite possible  Any of the factors currently   January 29–30, 2008 74 of 249    holding back growth could intensify  For example, a reduction in bank lending capacity could   make financial conditions much more restrictive  This, along with increased business pessimism   and caution, could cause a more pronounced cutback in investment and hiring  Even a   moderately weaker job market would add to the factors already weighing on consumer spending   Now, unfortunately, even while we are dealing with concerns on the growth front, the   inflation picture is difficult and quite uncertain  The inflation outlook will likely be affected by   more crosscurrents than usual  Headline inflation has been quite high, driven largely by   increasingly high energy, food, and commodity prices  Although our best assessment is that   these pressures will come off later this year, these influences have lasted longer than typical and   could well continue to do so  I had calculated the same type of statistics that President Plosser   calculated, but only since 1999  Headline PCE inflation has been running about 04 percentage   point higher than core PCE since that time  This is a source of some concern and cautions us   against relying too heavily on core inflation measures  I don’t think that is a big issue today, but   we need to be thinking about that in our inflation strategy  In addition, core inflation has not   improved as much as I expected  As the Greenbook discusses, the decline during the second   quarter of last year may have reflected technical quirks in the indexes rather than true   improvements in underlying inflation as I had hoped  The weakening US economy is likely to   diminish inflation pressures somewhat in 2008, but it is unclear how big a factor this will be or,   given our projection that growth improves, how long it will last  So I think that inflation risk   will be rising next year  Consequently, recalibration of short-term interest rates will be an   important element of monetary policy in 2009  Looking at the write-up, it seemed to me as   though 10 out of 17 participants had that viewpoint—different timing  Our inflation projection   has core PCE running 21 percent in 2008 and edging off to 2 percent by 2010  In the context of   January 29–30, 2008 75 of 249    what Brian was talking about in terms of slack, we have a higher inflation path and inflation   coming down with a bit of slack  Much of the Committee’s discussion today has suggested that   2 percent is slightly higher than most participants’ benchmarks  For me, the trajectory of my   outlook is satisfactory as long as I see inflation prospects continuing to improve as we move   beyond the end of our current forecast period  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  My question is related to what Governor   Mishkin just asked about  The risk-management analysis was very helpful; it was a very good   addition, and it captures a number of things that we have talked about  One is sort of a quick   policy reversal or the potential for that if things go well  My question is, How do you see the   path of communications likely to evolve?  What is it going to look like?  What will it sound like   if we are thinking about reversing policy, and we get to the bottom, and then we start taking it   back a little more quickly than normal?  A lot of times when we have done this before you heard   the phrase that markets need to be prepared for this and they have to understand it  Would that   somehow get in the way of the stimulus?  I think this gets a bit at what Governor Mishkin was   talking about in terms of expectations  In particular, do you have any thoughts about how the   slope of the yield curve might help inform how people are going to be thinking about this?  Are   we going to move from something that is potentially inverted or flat to a rising yield curve that   January 29–30, 2008 107 of 249    could inform a better outlook, and then raising rates could maybe in a parallel fashion move the   yield curve up?  I am just curious whether that could be helpful for the communications strategy     I’m just curious if, in the path of this simulation, the yield curve behaves   in that fashion or not  This gets at what the mechanism is for the stimulus  Is it to improve   market liquidity, market functioning, long rates, or an expectation of short rates?  If they start   expecting a tightening, is that going to get in the way of something, and so we are going to view   that as more difficult to move at that time?  I think everybody is quite committed to the idea that   we need to do the right type of policy reversal when it is called for, but it is going to be very   difficult to identify in the moment  So the yield curve could help     Thank you     I just wanted to point out that the reason I asked the question about how   you think about the exit strategy is that, since we are putting a lot of discussion weight on the   reversal, it is going to color how you think about the next move potentially, if not today then   another day  So I think it brings the future into the present very quickly     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I favor 50 basis points today  I think that a   3 percent funds rate may be reasonably positioned for the economy given our forecast  That’s the   Greenbook path assumption  That certainly seemed reasonable, and today’s data gave us no   indication that reasonably changed that path  I, like President Geithner, did find it remarkable that   risk-management paths were not really that different either way  Now, surely risks abound, and it’s   tough to capture that in models, and I’m all in favor of humility  I just don’t know which direction   humility argues for in this case—more action or less action  Anyway, those are my preferences    We have talked a good bit about the potential of reversing our policy action sooner than we often   have done in the past  I just think that it’s going to be difficult in the moment  The Bluebook path   that I’ve been looking at has this reversal starting when the unemployment rate is peaking  I think   it’s unknowable that it is actually the peak  There will be a lot of uncertainty, but still, that’s the   situation that we face, and so I sort of accept that  But because of that, I would prefer to be a little   more careful about how far down we go  Three percent could be the bottom of a funds rate cycle    January 29–30, 2008 134 of 249    It’s very difficult to know  From here on out, I’d like to be hopeful for positive news but mindful of   further deterioration that we would certainly act on   In terms of the statement, I guess from some discussions over the weekend, I wasn’t   expecting to hear much movement in that  But the suggestions of President Plosser and President   Yellen seem to make a lot of sense from my standpoint  So I think it would be nice if there were a   little more discussion of that, and I thought President Poole’s suggestion on inflation was also   helpful  Thank you, Mr Chairman     I had an elementary question that Governor Kroszner’s question kicked off    The background briefing was very well written and very clear, which made me think that I   understood things, and I probably don’t  But you used the term “get a rating,” and at other times   you talk about it as if it’s a sufficient statistic and how the agencies were warned that it’s not a   sufficient statistic  There are transition matrices to downgrade, and yet they violated that   themselves because you said that for the ABS, they thought of it as a sufficient statistic themselves    Is a lot of this inherently a multidimensional risk model that’s required for some of these structured-  finance vehicles, whereas for the corporates it’s closer to a single dimensional risk model?     Thank you     President Pianalto asked my question     This discussion stimulated a question that I didn’t anticipate  If we decide   that there is a broker–dealer that we can’t allow to enter into this program and then it ends up not   March 10, 2008 18 of 39    doing very well and going under, is there some type of risk that we are taking on by hastening   that in making that determination?  Do we have the right information to take that action?     The interesting difference is that with the window and the TAF it is   voluntary that you could come in  I suppose this is voluntary, but if we pick out somebody and   say, “You can’t participate,” and if it’s wildly successful—     Okay  Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support the extension of the swap and the term   securities lending facility of up to the $200 billion amount that you’re talking about  This can   improve market functioning, as I understand the discussion; and it targets action to markets with   major liquidity shortfalls, so I think that it is effectively targeting policy to the right place  It has   some risks definitely, but it is important to do something innovative like this  I hope that, after these   March 10, 2008 28 of 39    actions, market conditions might improve somewhat so that ultimately fewer adjustments in the   funds rate might be called for  If so, then it’s possible that the inflation risks that come with those   adjustments might be more limited  That’s not obviously true because the stance of policy depends   on overall accommodation, including in financial markets, but that could be the case  If this works,   as you were alluding to, we will get a lot of information from the auctions and the market conditions   themselves  Removing this might be a lot easier than actually removing the funds rate   accommodation that we talked about as being so important  So targeting this could have another   beneficial effect on policy  I would guess that we would review or at least have some assessment of   how the policy is working at each of the upcoming FOMC meetings, and that would be a natural   time for the Committee to talk about that further  Thank you     Dave, my question is basically about the influence of the financial stress   on the outlook  I was talking to an official at the Bank of Canada last week, and she had an   March 18, 2008 22 of 127    intriguing calibration by which she said that, since last August, they thought that financial stress   for Canada was worth about 25 basis points of restraint at the outset and now they thought it was   more like 50 basis points for their economy, which is doing quite well  I guess the impossible   question is, Have you thought about that type of calculation and how it influences the way we   think about interest rates for your forecast?  The way that I am thinking about this and that   President Lacker and others have thought about this is that we are trying to separate the effects of   standard monetary policy and of the innovative policies  Any separation that affects financial   markets directly helps us think about the more normal calibration of policy  But, of course, with   financial stress we have these add-on effects  So that is why I think that would be interesting     Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Clearly, the incoming data on activity have been   weaker than we expected  I think they point to a downturn in GDP in the first half of the year   similar to that in the Greenbook  While the February CPI report was welcome news, on balance I   think the inflation picture continues to be troubling  I noticed a marked change in the sentiment of   my business contacts this round  Many more are now telling me that the problems on Wall Street   are affecting their financing  Credit availability is now an issue  With regard to borrowing from   banks, these reports seem consistent with the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey  Credit is an   issue for those tapping nonbank sources as well, as in the comments that President Yellen made  As   an example, back in December a major shopping center developer indicated that, even though the   commercial-mortgage-backed security market had dried up, he was still able to obtain financing on   reasonable terms from other sources, such as life insurance companies  Last week he told me that   these sources had dried up, too  He’s now trying to raise equity funding, which he considers very   costly and an unappealing alternative   Many contacts also expressed increased nervousness over the economic situation and its   likely impact on demand for their products  Manpower’s CEO told me that their business had   deteriorated in recent weeks  Some of his clients were trimming staff because of a lower current   demand, and many others were being cautious and cutting back in expectation of future weakening    March 18, 2008 39 of 127    Still, even though restrictive financing and heightened caution are weighing on households and   businesses, there is a sense from my contacts that spending is not collapsing at this point, and   exports of capital equipment in the agricultural sector continue to do well, similar to President   Hoenig’s comments   Another common theme I heard from my contacts is that, while the Fed’s innovative   response has helped, they do not expect that these measures will do a lot to solve the financial   sector’s fundamental problems  I doubt that any of us disagree with that  As one of my directors   put it, “Monetary policy is not enough  We need a solution to the subprime mess  Once that   happens, the contagion will run in reverse”  I believe our innovative policies are helpful for   facilitating market functioning, but they don’t address the root problem  Markets want a firmer   sense of where prices for stressed assets will bottom out and of the magnitude of the portfolio losses   that will be taken by major financial players  Unfortunately, it will take a good deal of time before   these uncertainties will be resolved, and I’m not sure what we can do to speed the process  After all,   a number of these losses are going to stem from mortgage delinquencies that have not yet occurred   and perhaps from homeowners who have not even contemplated that outcome  This means that   financial headwinds likely will be weighing on the real economy for some time, as President Stern   said  I agree with his comments there  The substantial uncertainty over the length and breadth of   this process adds uncertainty to the medium-term outlook for growth  So while I am hopeful that   the economy will begin to recover in the second half of the year, I’m a lot less confident of that   outcome than I’d like to be   Turning to inflation, Friday’s CPI report was about the only good news I heard during the   intermeeting period (I think last time the reports weren’t very good either, President Yellen),   although as the Greenbook Supplement points out, the less favorable translation to PCE prices takes   March 18, 2008 40 of 127    out some of the luster  It’s no surprise that many of my contacts pointed to increasing pressures   from higher costs for food, energy, and other commodity inputs  I also heard numerous reports of   higher costs being passed downstream  One notable case was for wallboard  Even though demand   is weak and the industry had plenty of excess capacity, higher costs for energy inputs were resulting   in the first increase in wallboard prices in 20 months  The director who reported this was concerned   that pricing behavior is moving toward a cost-plus mentality  This is, after all, his industry  If so,   this would have negative implications for inflation expectations  However, I see this as a risk and   not a base case scenario because the resource gaps opening up in the economy should bring inflation   down  Firms will find it difficult to pass through cost increases in an environment of weak demand    Businesses and financial market participants will be aware of this difficulty in passing through   costs, which should help keep down their inflation expectations   That said, even in a weak economy, firms will have only so much room to absorb costs, and   pressures from higher prices for energy and other commodities and for imported goods pose a risk   to the outlook  In addition, while I expect inflation expectations to be contained, there are risks on   this front, too  Some can see a low fed funds rate path, such as that assumed by the Greenbook, as   an indication of a lack of resolve on inflation  I don’t agree with that assessment, but it’s an   increasing risk that we will be running, particularly if the inflation news breaks in the wrong way    Thank you, Mr Chairman     Well, I just want to clarify this because I didn’t get the answer I was   expecting  I don’t think I understood exactly the question about financial stress because I thought   the question was whether we would have to do more with the funds rate to achieve what was in the   Greenbook  Did you mark down your outlook from the Greenbook?  I don’t think I understood     Okay  Got it  Thanks     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support your recommendation  I came in here   thinking that I preferred 50 basis points, but I also recognize that I expected that we would have to   go beyond that after this meeting  So I fully support 75 and the language that you discussed   I just want to take a minute to give my perspective on the discussion earlier about the 1970s   and inflation expectations  I certainly didn’t expect when I came onto the Committee that we would   be lowering rates as much as we have done, and I thought we would be more concerned about   inflation, but this is where we are, and I think it is the appropriate response  Inflation expectations   risk reminds me of Paul Volcker, hero of the Federal Reserve System  Why is that?  He broke   inflation expectations  How did he do that?  Well, when I talked with my colleague, Larry   Christiano, he reminded me that it wasn’t really by reducing money growth  M1 growth increased   during that period, and yet financial conditions were restrictive  There was a big recession  There   was a lot of resource slack, and that was really important for bringing inflation down   I agree  I think we’re in a situation where this is most likely a recession  I expect that it will   reduce pressures on inflation  That’s my forecast  I think it’s consistent with the earlier period, and   it’s hard to know exactly how much it will bring inflation down, but I think that it will lower   inflation  The Greenbook is calling for a recession  They could be wrong, but we’ve been chasing   them down the whole time, and I’d be very surprised if they were wrong   I would like to know where the bottom of the funds rate cycle is  Like financial market   participants who want to know what the value of their mortgage securities is, I’d like to know where   the bottom of the funds rate is  But that is wholly unrealistic at this point  We just don’t know  So   I would be hopeful for eventually something like the Greenbook path assumption  But I support the   recommendation  Combined with our separate attempts to relieve financial market stress, we have   two prongs going, and that is very helpful  Thank you   March 18, 2008 94 of 127     “Edged higher” is an unusual phrase     That is 50 versus 25 in the old days      Thank you, Mr Chairman  The question that I have gets to the   appearance issue, and it is not really about the immediate concerns  To the extent that the   markets are not functioning that well, this could be useful, and so I don’t really have any   disagreement with that  But the facilities that we are talking about currently have a temporary   nature to them  The term auction facility is temporary, although of course the Board could make   it permanent  The term securities lending facility is an expansion of a program  What’s the   permanence of that and the primary dealer credit facility as well?  As we allow other forms of   collateral to be taken, what implications might that have for the future if we try to make these   more permanent?  This is simply a question; I don’t know what the answer is  Do we feel   comfortable with these forms of additional collateral on a permanent, ongoing basis, if we were   to do that; or do we think it would be possible to turn that off?  How costly would it be?       Thank you, Mr Chairman  The Greenbook is aggressive and effective at   portraying the US economy as being in a mild recession  They’ve overcome the statistical   evidence, which often prevents us from forecasting a recession since they are mostly surprises    There’s a nonlinear step-down in the second quarter that begins this recession  So I’m a little   curious as to why you didn’t follow this up by forecasting a jobless recovery  In the last two   recessions, that has been an important element of what followed  I wonder if it is now a feature of   the Great Moderation business cycle  If you look at equilibrium real funds rates, they tend to   bottom out during the period of most troubling joblessness in the aftermath of the recession  So if   we’re going to be relying on a period in which we’re doing something we haven’t done before, like   buying a bit of additional inflation credibility, it will be unusual  I guess my question is why you   made that choice   April 29–30, 2008 32 of 266      Thank you  That’s a fair point     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I was pleasantly surprised that we have not had   any major downside surprises since our March 18 meeting  So while I still recognize the   economy’s downside risks, I’ve become less comfortable about signing onto the Greenbook’s   judgment that a nonlinear step-down in activity currently is in train  On balance, our projection still   looks for weakness in the near term and then has growth picking up as we move through 2008 and   April 29–30, 2008 40 of 266    into 2009  We see a noticeable output gap opening this year but not one as large as in the   Greenbook  Under this forecast, it is possible that some portion of 2008 might eventually be labeled   a recession, but it is not yet conclusive that it will be  Indeed, given the highly unexpected   development that events have proceeded as expected, I think the downside risks to growth have   abated some  Some of the stress in financial markets has been mitigated by our new lending   policies as well as actions by banks in recognizing losses and raising capital  Neither the incoming   data nor the reports from my business contacts seem to be consistent with the bleak downside   scenarios that I feared might transpire after we saw the December employment report early this   year  In this regard, I will simply note a couple of observations from my contacts  A national   shopping mall developer reported that his tenants experienced a small improvement in April retail   sales compared with March  He was not expecting that  Similarly, Manpower indicated a small   improvement in billable hours for temporary workers over the past month and a half, also   unexpected     Now, I am not saying that I will be surprised if the outlook deteriorates further  I am saying   that the likelihood of that event seems to be smaller today than I expected at our last two meetings    Accordingly, I think that current real interest rates are appropriately accommodative relative to the   baseline forecast for economic growth and the risk to that outlook  As seen in chart 6 of the   Bluebook, the real funds rate is essentially zero  Of course, this uses a core PCE measure of   inflation and thus may overstate the true real rate since headline inflation has been consistently   running above this core measure  There is the additional accommodation that is being provided by   the range of new lending facilities we had put in place  The extra accommodation is appropriate to   offset the large degree of restraint still being exerted from financial markets, and our expansion of   the swap lines and the TAF adds to this accommodation  Furthermore, in the event of a nonlinear   April 29–30, 2008 41 of 266    step-down in economic activity, as in the Greenbook forecast, our policy responses can be adjusted   appropriately because we’re well positioned now for that   On the price side, on balance, the recent news has been good  My forecast has core PCE   inflation falling to just under 2 percent in 2010 largely because of the increasing resource slack in   the economy  However, I think there are substantial upside risks to this outlook  All of my business   contacts have noted how high and rising energy and commodity prices are creating cost pressures   that many are passing on to their customers  As Dave Stockton mentioned, with his inflation   catechism, without reviewing the past transcripts I will speculate that we have been projecting a   leveling-out of energy prices since the price of oil was $70 a barrel  Weak domestic demand may   limit the degree to which producers can pass through these higher costs, but it is unlikely to prevent   noticeable increases in some downstream prices  The depreciation of the dollar also imposes risks   even beyond the effects operating through the commodity price channel  Now, I do agree that labor   costs have not been cited as a problem for inflationary pressures, and so that does add somewhat to   trimming out the risks there   Inflation expectations were also an issue  No matter how often we say that core inflation is   a more reliable measure of underlying inflationary tendencies, I find it difficult to believe that the   public’s inflationary expectations will not be affected by large and persistent increases in food and   energy prices  The past five years have been unkind on this score  On average over this time,   higher food and energy prices have pushed total inflation above core about ½ percentage point, and   it is also sizable over the past ten years  Another challenge for inflationary expectations comes from   our policy focus on the downside risks to growth during a time of rising headline inflation  Rightly   or not, this could make the public question our attitudes toward inflation  We are accepting   considerable inflationary risks when we hope that these concerns will disappear quickly with future   April 29–30, 2008 42 of 266    adjustments to policy that have not yet been signaled  How we balance these conflicting risks   should be an important component of our discussion tomorrow  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I have a couple of questions, unfortunately  I   am very sympathetic to your point about how difficult it is to understand what the relationship is   between the equilibrium fed funds rate and where we are with respect to financial stress    Actually, my question is for the Greenbook team—if you could remind me again, within the   Greenbook-consistent measure, how do you deal with these?  You have add factors in your   forecast  Presumably, they’re related to the financial stress  I know that they are acting as if   there is a higher interest rate at work  We also have the role of the lending facilities, which   perhaps have relieved a bit of that stress  I am not quite sure how that plays out here, so if you   could, please clarify that as best you can  Again, in chart 6 there is no role for the inflation   preference, right?  This is all about how long it takes to get back to potential over three years   with this interest rate  The Board staff was very helpful over the weekend, when I asked a   question about chart 7 and the fact that the funds rate took off from a higher level  If you add   that type of analysis in there, it seems as if it comes down a little to what your inflation   preference is  For the 1½ percent inflation rate, you might want to stick where you are; if it’s   April 29–30, 2008 100 of 266    2 percent, you would move down a bit  Again, that is taking it as given that you can interpret   these at face value, if you will   I have another question about the fed funds futures market and Bill Dudley’s chart about   how the dealers seem to have slightly different expectations and whether or not that teases out   anything about what Governor Kohn was talking about, because that’s a very interesting   observation  You know, there is much more weight below the market       Oh  I thought these were the smart guys who really were on top of it     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I, too, favor maintaining the federal funds rate   at 2¼ percent today  The current real interest rate provides accommodative monetary conditions   for an economy that is struggling near recession or is in mild recession  Our lending facilities are   probably doing as much as can be expected to mitigate the serious and necessary financial   adjustments that must be accomplished by the private markets  If the economy takes another   serious leg down, our current funds rate setting is well positioned for us to respond promptly,   appropriately, and aggressively, if circumstances warrant  A pause today affords us a unique   opportunity to wait and see how our recent aggressive actions are influencing the trajectory of   real activity  Since markets are putting substantial weight on a 25 basis point easing today, a   pause will be a relatively small disappointment  As President Plosser pointed out, that was   similar to our March disappointment, which seemed to be all right  I think it is important for us   to understand how the economy will respond to a pause in rate-cutting when it does occur  With   high food, energy, and commodity prices, the extended positive differential of headline inflation   April 29–30, 2008 110 of 266    over core measures risks an increase in the public’s inflation expectations  I agree with President   Plosser’s discussion of relative prices on that front   From a longer-term perspective, which we don’t really talk about very often, I worry   about the asymmetric response of policy to high inflation as opposed to when it is low  When   headline inflation is above core inflation, we take on board the relative price adjustment, and   then we are content, I would guess, to bring inflation down to our perceived inflation targets    But on the downside, when inflation gets low, we become uncomfortable with certain low   inflation settings, and so I fear that we would respond more aggressively, as we did in 2003,   which really was a positive productivity environment  If you have an asymmetric type of   response, you are going to take on board increases in the price level because of that asymmetry    That’s one reason that I am concerned about these types of behaviors  Although I expect   emerging resource slack to temper any adverse inflation developments, the risk is simply   growing in importance with every additional policy easing, compared with the economic risks,   which presumably are abating as we respond to them with such easings   Calibrating the current policy stance against these divergent economic and inflation risks   is important and challenging, as you pointed out yesterday, Mr Chairman  I think that   comparisons to the rate troughs in the previous cycles of recession policy are instructive  The   current real fed funds rate is somewhere in the neighborhood of zero, or it could be lower if you   choose a different way to deflate the funds rate by total inflation  I was very impressed with   Dave Stockton’s response to my question about what types of factors from financial market   stress are embodied in the Greenbook-consistent real interest rate  It seems as though a   tremendous amount of care has been taken to introduce some of these special factors in   innovative ways, and while they may not capture all facets of that, I thought that they did quite a   April 29–30, 2008 111 of 266    good job  So I feel a bit more comfortable in making those comparisons, but I do recognize that   it is a treacherous period     That said, this is about the same place the real funds rate bottomed out during the jobless   recovery with financial headwinds in the 1990–91 recession, and with the data we had in hand at   the time during the disinflation concerns in 2003  Both periods were unique in suggesting a high   degree of accommodation, and the factors that were at work in each of those episodes were   unique  Our attempt to incorporate these factors has been quite useful, and so it’s a reasonable, if   not definitive, comparison  With our current lending facilities addressing financial stress, I think   our current policy accommodation, now at 2¼ percent, is appropriately similar to those episodes   My final observation has to do with these end-of-cycle expectations and what they might   mean for long-term interest rates  If 25 basis points is viewed as additional insurance against   downside risks, I just don’t think this action is significant enough to have much of an effect  We   expect to take back some portion of the aggressive cuts, especially the ones that have been an   attempt to respond to the financial stress  If the financial stress is mitigated to some extent, we   should be expected to take that back  Expectations, as in the fed funds futures market, should   limit the effect of those actions on long-term interest rates  After all, by the expectations   hypothesis, you are going to be averaging these short-term paths into long-term rates  That is   one reason that the Committee injected the language “considerable period” back in 2003, to try   to convince people that we would do this for a longer period of time and affect long-term rates    So if there is an expectation of some type of rebound, these last insurance cuts might not have   that large an effect  Again, I think our lending facilities are better geared for the financial stress    I think we have clearly demonstrated our willingness to provide appropriately   accommodative policies in a timely fashion when the economic situation demanded it  For me,   April 29–30, 2008 112 of 266    the public’s expectation of these actions in that event argues against one further small insurance   move  Because we are concerned about inflation risks and have indicated that we must flexibly   move toward more-neutral policy stances once the economy and financial markets improve, a   pause today is a small down payment on those difficult future actions  In terms of language, if it   came to that, I would be comfortable with the language of alternative B with this particular rate   action  Thank you, Mr Chairman     My primary comment in all of this is related to what President Stern, I think,   said  The way the objectives are worded here is “enhanced monetary policy implementation,” and   April 29–30, 2008 171 of 266    the memo is worded more like, “How do we get our federal funds rate target effectively?” or   something like that  But there is really no discussion that I could find about the transmission of our   policy actions to the economy and to inflation  Under our current regime, we think, quite   confidently, that the short-term federal funds rate prices short-term risk-free assets along the yield   curve all the way up to the Treasuries and then corporates are priced off all of that  I associate that   with Marvin Goodfriend, who taught me that quite some time ago  It’s not money; it’s not liquidity;   it’s not the reserves per se  It would be nice if, for each alternative, there were some discussion that   we are preserving our understanding of the policy transmission mechanism or that we are enhancing   it or whatever  President Lacker mentioned the Bank of England—maybe we could set the policy   rate as they do  The question is, What will the markets do in terms of actively arbitraging   something that helps price these securities?  This may not be an issue for many of these systems, but   until there’s some kind of analysis, I’m not so sure  It’s not just averaging over the maintenance   period, and I think that analysis would be useful       Thank you, Mr Chairman  As I mentioned earlier, I would find some   discussion about the transmission mechanism useful—at what rate we think the markets would   be picking up the price of risk-free yield curves  I think that would help  To the extent that we   can align this with other foreign central bank experiences, we might be able to draw on how they   view that and what the financial market data look like  So I am comfortable with focusing   primarily on options 2 and 5  I was thinking along the lines of President Hoenig, which is that   the Federal Reserve tends to go slowly  Vince isn’t here, but he often reminded us of that    April 29–30, 2008 176 of 266    Option 1 is the easiest one  If we have enough information about it, then that’s fine  I think   that’s all I have      Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’d like to ask a question about inflation and   labor compensation  At the last meeting, many of us, myself included, mentioned that labor   compensation had not been growing very strongly, and we took that as a possible comforting   comment about inflationary pressures not being too strong  That comment was in this presentation   and yesterday’s, too  Now, statistically, isn’t it the case that labor compensation is not really a good   predictor of inflation?  It really tends to lag more  So how should we think about interpreting that   lack of acceleration for inflation expectations and pressures?  Feel free to dispute that     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Most of my contacts continued to report   sluggish domestic demand, and they are not currently seeing any improvement in activity  In   addition, their comments often focused on the substantially higher costs that they are facing for a   wide range of nonlabor inputs  With regard to business activity, much of what we heard about   the District and the national economy was a rehashing of preexisting developments  At our last   meeting, we felt that there was substantial risk of a further softening in second-quarter growth, so   the absence of new news is a positive development  With regard to specific sectors, exporters I   have talked with continue to thrive, and steel producers are doing quite well  But any business   June 24–25, 2008 64 of 253    associated with housing markets is very weak, and the motor vehicle outlook continues to   worsen  All Detroit Three CEOs are expecting light vehicle sales to be less than 15 million units   in 2008   The Seventh District has experienced substantial flooding in recent weeks, particularly in   Iowa  We have been in contact with state officials and numerous businesses  The corn and   soybean crops have experienced significant losses, though the range of estimates is wide  Higher   estimates for lost corn output in Iowa are about 10 percent  That substantial loss would represent   a national crop loss of just about 2 percent  In addition, although there have been transportation   disruptions, especially on the Mississippi, our contacts expect these to be short-lived  So overall,   our sense is that the economic damage seems to be relatively contained, especially in comparison   with the floods in 1993, which hit a much wider geographic area and affected activity for a   longer period of time    Turning to the national picture, the incoming data regarding growth generally have been   positive  Indeed, the string of upward quarterly forecast revisions continues  In particular, I   have been impressed by how much second-quarter GDP growth forecasts have moved up  This   is not to say that we are out of the woods  Clearly, the continued difficulties in the housing and   credit markets as well as the unrelenting increases in energy prices pose important downside   risks to activity  Our Chicago Fed national activity index continues to be in territory I would   characterize as a recession—the three-month moving average is minus 108 this past month    Still, the risk of the adverse feedback loop that concerned us so much clearly seems less likely   today  Importantly, the financial situation seems better  Though conditions are still far from   normal, institutions have had time to cope with bad portfolios, much as President Bullard   mentioned  They have made significant progress in raising capital and have increased provisions   June 24–25, 2008 65 of 253    against losses  I think our lending facilities have helped financial institutions gain time to   facilitate the adjustment process  It seems well beyond our abilities, however, to engineer a   return to “normal financial conditions,” given the extent of financial losses and overbuilding in   housing  With regard to our economic projections, we expect growth this quarter to be similar to   the Greenbook; but unlike the Greenbook, we are looking for the momentum to carry forward to   a better second half of the year  Beyond this year, we think growth will run near potential  This   is based on a fed funds rate path close to that in the futures markets  We are assuming a fed   funds rate of 2½ percent by the fourth quarter and 3¾ percent by the end of 2009   Turning to inflation, a number of factors present a concern for inflation expectations and   our ability to bring inflation down  As I mentioned, my contacts spent a good deal of time   talking about materials cost pressures, and many around the table have talked about those as   well  Many manufacturers were citing large increases in energy and most commodity prices, and   everyone was passing along some portion of these cost increases  I have one anecdote on this    In retail, Crate&Barrel reported on recent buyers’ trips to Asia, saying that prices for items   purchased there would be 15 to 20 percent higher for next year  Finally, wage pressures have   been subdued thus far  Still, econometric analysis by my staff reminded me that wage inflation   tends to follow price inflation not the other way around  So by the time we see wage pressures,   either we are not behind the curve now, or it is “Katie, bar the door!”  It is probably one or the   other  [Laughter]  Indeed, I am concerned that large and persistent changes in costs and in   relative prices of high-profile items, such as energy, could change the inflationary mindset of   businesses and households  The resulting increase in inflation expectations would pose a   difficult challenge for monetary policy  Maybe it will end up being okay; maybe surveys will be   right  But it is a big risk, and that risk is a bit large for my comfort   June 24–25, 2008 66 of 253    Looking ahead, we all see the substantial upside risk to price stability posed by the pass-  through of higher costs and any possible increase in inflation expectations  While I hope I am   wrong, I feel that we may need to accept a somewhat longer period of resource slack than we   would like in order to address these risks and put inflation more firmly on a downward   trajectory  Under our projection for GDP growth, the economy does not close the modest   resource gaps we project will be in place at the end of 2008 until beyond the forecast horizon    Along with a flattening in energy and other commodity prices, such gaps should be sufficient to   contain inflation expectations and bring overall PCE inflation near 2 percent in 2009 and 2010    That is our expectation  But my base case does not have inflation moving below 2 percent until   after 2010, and that is even with more aggressive policy tightening than the Greenbook path     Now, turning to the long-term projections, I think that our forecasts for 2010—or at least   the way that I think about it—do suffer from some difficulties  We would like to mention in the   write-up that, at the end of the period, the range is between 1½ percent and 2 percent, and we can   infer policymakers’ preferences from that  That is one interpretation  Given the inflationary   pressures, that is harder and harder for many people to come up with  I think in some cases it   requires a monetary policy response that is beyond what most people would expect that we could   actually do  So I don’t try to force my inflation forecast into my preferred range if it is too hard    Based upon monetary policy, it is more medium term  So I do tend to favor a longer period  I   am somewhat indifferent between the first and the second options  I don’t really see a lot of   difference, but something that has a five-year forecast I think is useful  Whether or not it has the   fourth year and whether or not it is core PCE or total are less important issues   One argument for this is an interesting body of research, which I have been exposed to   only at conferences—and Jim probably knows it better than most—on learning and whether   June 24–25, 2008 67 of 253    individuals in the economy can learn these rules without a variety of information  Some of the   better papers that I have seen on that remind us that you need more pieces of information than   just what the target is, whether it be 1½ percent or 2 percent  You need some type of contour   when people are learning with simplistic learning rules, like least squares learning  So I think a   bit more contour on the forecast would be helpful  In my mind, that pushes you toward the five   years of forecasting as opposed to a steady state or a five-to-ten-year forecast  I think that’s an   important element  On the trial run, I think we could do it sooner than that, but I know a lot of   staff resources are involved  So I favor sooner rather than later  Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’d like to start by saying that I agree with your   comments yesterday about how we should proceed with the Committee approach and think very   collaboratively about the policies and delicate strategies that we’re facing  Although we disagree on   a number of the elements of the outlook, I think that bringing everything together is a very   important part of this   I have fully endorsed funds rate cuts that we have taken so far in large part as insurance   against tail risks to growth  I think that policy last summer was much too restrictive given what we   were facing and that, along the way, a lot of these cuts have been motivated by tail risks to growth    The funds rate at 2 percent is pretty ample insurance to my mind—more so given the improvement   in the outlook for growth that we’ve seen as second-quarter growth has been marked up so much   and even more so given the inflation risks that we’re facing, the risks to inflation expectations, and   the potentially very low real interest rates that we might be looking at, depending on the measure  If   June 24–25, 2008 104 of 253    we had the opportunity to recalibrate things a bit, I probably would prefer something more like a   2½ percent fed funds rate to be positioned against the different risks that we’re facing, but I   understand that we’re at 2 percent, and no change seems like the right move for today   I do have a few concerns about the way we’re thinking about this, more in the line of risks    One is that, as we take insurance against tail risk, we’re positioning the funds rate against an event   that we think is not the most likely and is negative compared with where we are  Unless and until   that event happens, policy is somewhat accommodative because it hasn’t happened, and we’re   thinking that it is closer to where it ought to be if that should happen  Unless you think that we   haven’t taken out insurance, then I think that we have more accommodation than we might like   The second concern is whether it is possible to be more precise about what we mean by this   tail risk  I mean, it’s really a catch-all  Nobody is very comfortable with all of this  What are the   markers that we could look at for improvement if we could quantify this somehow?  Is it that   financial markets should be functioning better?  I think surely that is the case  Is there a way that we   could describe that?  I’m sure we’ll disagree on many elements of this  Labor market   improvement—we should expect that, if the labor market does better than we were thinking, then   that would tend to bolster consumption spending a bit better in the face of all the shocks that we’re   looking at  So the extent to which the labor market doesn’t continue to deteriorate, at least in line   with some of the recession scenarios and the tail risk scenarios that we were thinking about, is a   potential marker   As we keep pushing out our expectation that the economy is going to weaken—and we’ve   done this a number of times—and if we’re looking at the third quarter being revised up—and I   agree that we’re facing a lot of risks there—but if we start marking that one up, I think that’s a   marker that we have to be concerned about  Obviously, if oil prices and commodity prices were to   June 24–25, 2008 105 of 253    decline and free up purchasing power for consumers, that would help out, too  So these are just   some of the things that come to mind  Is there a way to think about the details a little better, with a   bit less of a SWAG?   Another risk relates to financial markets  Here I’m thinking about the really influential work   of yours, in 1983, on nonmonetary influences on the Great Depression  A lot of the actions that we   have taken are defenses against those types of issues, right?  In the 1930s, when the economy was   doing very badly and banks were failing—I’m telling this to you, and you’ve described it to   everyone—then the knock-on effect was that the banks weren’t there anymore and important   resources for evaluating credit were lost, and so it was more expensive and very difficult to do  We   have some of that going on now, right?  We’ve moved from the banks making mortgages and   holding them to the “originate to distribute” model  Those resources have been dispersed, and now   that securitization market is closed  I heard that very clearly yesterday  Those important resources   aren’t there to originate mortgages, so if we get to the point that buyers are willing to purchase these   houses, that could be a concern   What happens if there’s a true impairment to the financial capital stock, and real resources   aren’t there anymore to help out with this?  We’re probably looking at a reallocation of resources   from that sector of the financial market either back to banks or to somewhere else  But as we see   those resources reallocated and as we think about unemployment being higher, we can talk   ourselves into thinking that a lot of slack is in the economy when, in fact, there may not be so much   slack  At some point it may be slack, and at other times it won’t be, until those resources are   reallocated most efficiently  I think this could reduce potential growth rates and have structural   elements to it, not just cyclical elements  So there’s not a slam-dunk for this  There is just a risk   that an element of that is playing out throughout this, and other factors are superimposed on that    June 24–25, 2008 106 of 253    But it’s something that I worry about  In a robust type of policy development, I think we should be   considering things like that  It’s just the case that, in the current situation that we’re looking at,   there might be a limited role for monetary policy to repair real capital stocks    Another concern is that anytime we’ve engaged in substantial risk-management policies,   there has always been difficulty in taking them back  That’s part of the delicate strategy that you are   referring to, I think  That’s how I heard it  So we have to be very careful  There’s a lot of art to this   clearly, but it would be good if we could offer a few more bright lines about how we’ll approach   that  Still, I certainly agree  I think we need to seek consensus  It’s our role to raise these issues   and then come to the best judgment  So I’m quite comfortable with no change today  I’m quite   comfortable with the language in alternative B, although in the third paragraph we say, “However,   in light of the continued increases in the prices of energy,” and I think it would be better if we didn’t   say “continued”  I think it’s enough to say “the increases”  In part, I don’t know if this is a marker   that, if prices level out, we’d still be comfortable with the inflation risk  I think that there will be a   lagged effect of all the very large increases that we’ve seen for oil as they work their way through    If prices just level out, we still have risks to inflation expectations  So I prefer taking that out    Thank you, Mr Chairman     I’m alluding, without understanding or working out, to a sectoral-shifts   model of unemployment and how that search process could be more difficult  You’re just taking   resources that over some period took a while to allocate to the financial sector and now they have to   be reallocated somewhere else     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I will also try to be brief, in spite of the large   number of questions that were handed out  The short term should be quite easy  On the tactical   issues, I agree with the suggestion of extending the facilities through year-end  They seem to   have worked well  Also, a number of very interesting and important initiatives are ongoing as   well on the CDS over-the-counter market and tri-party repo, and those should help out as well   June 24–25, 2008 180 of 253    On the longer-term issues, I am very happy to hear that you will be giving a speech and   testimony on this, and I will be looking forward to how you lay out those issues  Obviously,   there are large-scale changes in our regulatory environment that are being contemplated  These   happen only every now and then  It is an opportunity to improve or to make a tremendous   mistake if we are not very careful  So I think it, obviously, requires a tremendous amount of   time   People have talked about the various issues, so I won’t dwell on them  I think there have   been a lot of very good comments around the table and speeches that have laid out the important   issues that we are facing  One that I am sure we will have to talk a bit more about is that we   can’t think about this in a static environment  Obviously, the markets are very dynamic  As   soon as we lay out a structure that will help out certain types of institutions, then there is going to   be an opportunity to arbitrage that  We are presumably talking about reducing earnings of a   number of institutions, and so they will be seeking those out  Another way to characterize the   big question—it is nothing new—is how we maintain the incentives for market discipline  Many   of the comments that President Stern and others made about how we think about preparing for   possible resolutions will be very important  So I am looking forward to many more discussions   about this  Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I have a question for Bill Dudley and Sandy   Krieger  I am a bit confused about the discussion of the overcollateralization withdrawal  I   guess I am not sure what the purpose is of the TAF collateral restriction of 50 percent only being   July 24, 2008 8 of 50    for the day of the auction  I don’t recall a robust discussion of that particular detail, and   frankly—maybe this is my fault—that wasn’t my interpretation  When we discussed this with   our directors, who are quite concerned about the safeguards on these loans, we had indicated that   there was a term cushion, which Sandy is now mentioning we need to impose  I guess my   question is, Was this anticipated?  Any discussion of that would be helpful     Thanks, I appreciate that  I do wonder why we didn’t have more of a   robust discussion about that at the time because it seems more than just a detail, given that it was   part of the representations that at least some of us—or at least I—made to our directors  But   thanks     Yes, I did  Thank you  I guess my basic question is, Do we feel   comfortable with the level of collateralization that we are imposing on these programs for the   TAF?  I thought that we were expecting double collateral, and I had thought it was for a longer   period of time, but it was only on the one day  I still don’t understand why it would be important   on one day and not longer than that  But is 25 percent the right number?  I just don’t know how   to think about it  If the people who are the experts at this could offer some discussion and the   appropriate assurances on that, I could certainly feel more comfortable about some of these   exotic proposals  My concern is really that we seem to be doing this very quickly  The rationale   for the choices that we are making is not exactly clear, and if we had a little more clarity, that   would be better     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I am concerned about the credit risk associated   with the term lending here, and I suppose if everybody feels comfortable with it, then that would be   all right  It does seem, though, that the value of these new programs, much as President Stern just   mentioned, seems small  These are temporary facilities exercised under unusual and exigent   circumstances  They are currently anticipated to go away  I would think that we should be having   big value added from additions to these programs  I wonder a bit about how confident we are about   what the market reaction to the introduction of these pretty complicated programs is going to be    Are they going to wonder about what we’re looking at versus what they’re looking at?  These are   supposed to be temporary; but the way we add more to it, it seems as if it’s going to be more   difficult to take this away, at least in terms of the expectations of our borrowers and the markets    We have been doing this as we make comparisons to the ECB and the Bank of England, and they   have been doing this for some time  It sort of suggests that this is something that we’re going to do   July 24, 2008 30 of 50    for a longer period of time  I am not saying that that might not be the right decision ultimately   under the right risk management, but it does seem to be prejudging that a little  Thank you     I would prefer not to be involved in term funding generally without greater   study than we have done so far  But I am confident, with the additional measures that you’re   talking about and the conversations, that we would end up being able to do it appropriately  I would   prefer the 28-day and 84-day separation if that’s operationally possible, but I’m not sure if any   potential adverse signals would somehow be conveyed that way  Frankly, I just don’t understand it   well enough, and this is being done very quickly  Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Bill, at our recent intermeeting call, I wasn’t   expecting the characterization of the financial stresses to sort of backtrack to the point that it   feels like March  Maybe somebody said it was as scary as March  I have noticed in a lot of our   speeches that many have noted that financial conditions have not returned to normal, and I have   always kind of wondered what “normal” would be  With hundreds of billions of dollars of losses   at major financial institutions, I guess I am wondering whether we can reasonably expect that   this distress and adjustment will be alleviated over some reasonably short period of time  We are   12 months in  Isn’t this likely to take 12 more months or longer?  Financial institutions have a   lot to digest  What do you think financial institutions and markets have to do to signal a return to   acceptable functionality?  What are we looking for, and what changes in fundamentals are likely   to occur that would deliver sustainable liquidity improvements?     I think this is a good time to revisit our strategy and what we are thinking   about accomplishing here  It is my understanding that the Chairman has asked you to look at   unusual and exigent circumstances     Thank you       Thank you, Mr Chairman  Regarding a comment that Bill Dudley made   about housing prices, for financial institutions, it’s going to matter a lot whether we’re looking at a   decline from 15 percent to 20 percent or from 15 percent to 30 percent  Housing inventories, unsold   homes, are very high, and I guess I’m wondering again—we have gone over this a few times—what   factors are likely to get housing advancing if it’s not a sharp decline in housing prices?  I’m having a   hard time understanding why the expectation would not be for a relatively sharp decline  I’m   translating the Greenbook/OFHEO numbers to Bill’s numbers, and I’m not sure, but it seems to me   that financial institutions ought to be thinking that a significant adjustment must still be in train if   we’re not expecting demand to pick up all of a sudden  The mortgage origination challenges are   there  Or is this disequilibrium just going to sit there for an extended period of time?     The staff has been way out front in projecting the housing decline, and that   has been very helpful  Is there any dissonance between what Bill said and your pretty substantial   expectation of housing-price declines?     Was it 15 to 20 or 15 to 30?     I agree with that chain and those risks, but what I thought I was hearing from   David was that the staff estimate has in it quite a substantial adjustment process in housing, and then   I would expect financial players to share that assessment     Thank you     They do seem to be taking out a lot of insurance on the downside, right—  like your Merrill Lynch put option?     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Overall there has been little change in the   sentiment of my business contacts since our last meeting  Most are still reporting sluggish domestic   demand with little evidence of any improvement over the near term  On the price front, everyone   continued to cite cost pressures  Manufacturers have long lists of materials cost increases, while   retailers note large increases in wholesale prices of imported consumer goods  Everyone discusses   how they are planning to continue passing these costs along to customers in second-round effects    Undoubtedly weak market conditions will limit their efforts, but I suspect that many will be   successful in raising prices significantly   Turning to the financial situation, to start I should note that I did hear some good reports   with regard to liquidity in Chicago financial markets  A contact at the Chicago Mercantile   Exchange told us that they conducted extensive liquidity reviews for their largest clearing members,   with special scrutiny of firms that had substantial volumes of hard-to-value assets on their books    The clearinghouse was very pleased with the results, finding that these firms had good access to   liquidity     August 5, 2008 39 of 145    Overall, however, my financial conversations this round were relatively downbeat  I did   hear some interesting details, though, about the dynamics of the restructuring of credit   intermediation  With commercial-mortgage-backed securities markets effectively shut down, a   highly rated owner-developer of high-end shopping malls described his increasingly difficult   attempts to find funding for his regular flow of balloon payments on mortgage properties  He has   gone from restrictive loans from life insurance companies to attempting to put together his own   structured-debt securitization  They want to issue bonds backed by the revenues generated from a   pool of their high-quality properties and sell them to major fixed-income investment funds  This is   one example of what economists like Kashyap and Shin estimate will be a reduction of at least   $1 trillion in lending to nonfinancial institutions due to mortgage-related losses at US financial   institutions  It is also an example of how firms are trying to find workarounds for the functions that   intermediaries used to do for them  But such restructuring must be raising the cost of financing in   ways that are not obviously amenable to mitigation through liquidity policies   Turning to the national outlook, the information we have received over the past several   weeks has contained many crosscurrents, but overall our forecast for output growth is little changed   from our June projections  With regard to prices, I am concerned that inflation risks continue to   grow  The most recent news on core prices has not been good  Oil prices may be coming off the   boil, but they are still scalding  Prices are still down only to where they were in May  My   impression from my contact calls is that the ultimate pass-through to final product prices of earlier   increases could take a disconcertingly long period of time  Furthermore, I continue to think that the   current funds rate in conjunction with our enhanced lending facilities represents a quite   accommodative monetary policy stance, even given the disruptions in financial markets  If the   policy path remains as accommodative as futures markets expect, then improvement in inflation will   August 5, 2008 40 of 145    most likely require fortuitous favorable developments in inflation expectations and more restraint   from resource slack than we might have otherwise expected   This brings me to three considerations that I would like to highlight as we evaluate the risk-  management positions underlying our views on appropriate policy and our economic projections    The first factor is that, according to many econometric estimates, the 5¾ to 6 percent unemployment   rate envisioned in the projections would provide only very modest restraint on inflation  In   addition, costly reallocation could lead to less resource slack, perhaps temporarily driving the   NAIRU above 5 percent  You know, when I talk to my staff, they assure me that there are very   good reasons, demographically based, to believe a NAIRU under 5 percent  But I tend to think I’ve   read a few too many papers on policy and policy mistakes where that’s exactly the issue—when you   think the sustainable unemployment rate is lower than it actually is  So that’s a risk, I think     The second factor is that many individuals and businesses see the large relative price   changes in oil, food, and commodities as precursors to more-persistent inflation  Whether or not   their assessments are analytically correct depends on their expectations of our policy response  A   substantive response may be necessary to prevent self-fulfilling price increases and keep inflation   under control  Words can take us only so far     The third consideration is the potential diminishing returns through our efforts to mitigate   distressed financial market conditions  It is my interpretation that our current accommodative   monetary policy and suite of lending facilities are set to mitigate severe downside risks and the   systemic risks that you mentioned earlier, Mr Chairman  This is helpful under the assumption that   reducing liquidity strains will assist financial markets to return to normal operations and prevent a   permanent impairment of our financial infrastructure  But financial conditions seem unlikely to   return to our previous perceptions of normal, at least for some time  Thus, I see a risk that extra   August 5, 2008 41 of 145    accommodation intended to grease the financial wheels could be left in place too long and prove   counterproductive for price stability  Indeed, the old perception of “normal” likely is not the correct   benchmark for us to use in looking for whether we are experiencing structural changes in the   intermediation process in which new liquidity providers are playing enhanced roles in the lending   process and in which risk standards are changing  So when thinking about market functioning, it   would be useful to discuss this within a longer-term framework of what we can feasibly expect from   market functioning and what central bank liquidity has the ability to usefully and appropriately   influence  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  A funny thing happened at my board meeting   the other week  I was all set to prepare them not for a rate change recommendation this time but   for one in the not-too-distant future  By the time I was done, they were asking what the   procedure was for dissenting from my recommendation  So, in fact, they forwarded a   recommendation for an increase this time around   You know, we can disagree over the inflationary consequences of a lot of this, but I think   there is a message from around the table and the public, our directors, and whatnot, that they do   feel that there is a concern about inflation  So I favor alternative C, although I recognize the   reality of today  I am struggling with the fact that we lowered the funds rate rather aggressively,   and things have worked out much better than we expected against the risks that we thought that   we were facing  We could disagree over that as well  I do take the point that uncertainty is very   August 5, 2008 106 of 145    high at the moment  But I think that we will need to increase rates sooner than currently   expected by markets  We are counting on a modest degree of slack and our credibility with the   public to keep inflation and inflation expectations contained while we leave rates on hold  But I   am concerned that there will be only modest inflationary restraint from the slack that we see and   that we may not be able to convince the public that they shouldn’t worry about high headline   inflation   I certainly agree that bank balance sheets were pretty good in 2007, but I am concerned   that headline inflation has been above core inflation for quite a long time  I am not sure our own   balance sheets would reflect that  So by following a wait-and-see strategy, we are accepting a   large baseline inflation risk  In addition, there is an enormous tail risk—that is, a return to much   higher underlying inflation  Also, I was a little concerned to see in the dealer feedback to the   TAF extensions that some market participants think that we will not increase the policy rate as   long as we keep the “unusual and exigent” determination in place  I am not sure that is a good   expectation for them to have  Fundamentally, it is my opinion that there has been a change in the   balance of the economic rationale and risk-management calculus that we used to lower the funds   rate to 2 percent  It is not a huge change, but I think there has been a change  One year on, the   economy has withstood the financial shock in a resilient fashion, especially given the add-on   shock from oil  I don’t know what more we could have hoped for from the vantage point of the   fall of 2007 and the losses that have been taken   I think the odds of preventable negative feedback loops that we took out the last 75 basis   points of insurance against are somewhat smaller than they were five to six months ago  Part of   our earlier logic to appropriately lower rates to a decidedly accommodative policy stance was to   guard against disorderly market conditions that might permanently damage our financial market   August 5, 2008 107 of 145    infrastructure and destroy the financial capital stock in a real, productive sense the way that I   think President Plosser was alluding to  But real forces have unmasked dramatic weaknesses and   faults in our financial system, and markets will be evolving to a new intermediation structure    Our policy can ease transitions only to a degree, but it cannot restore the previous financial status   quo, nor should it be aimed at doing so     During the transition, I would not be surprised if we revisit periods of market volatility as   the disadvantaged players are repeatedly challenged to restructure to the new environment    Counterparties are shying away from previous financial partners, in part because of uncertainty   over the risk–return profiles and the transitioning industry structure  These profiles involve both   liquidity risk and credit risk  I think our lending facilities allow a modest decoupling of the fed   funds rate setting to deal with this  In my view, the balancing of current risks calls for increasing   the funds rate in the range of 50, maybe 75, basis points within some reasonably short period of   time  If events change importantly, I would certainly advocate further adjustments in either   direction, depending on how those risks adjust  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The unfolding financial situation is injecting   enormous uncertainty into the economic outlook and policy picture  Although this analogy is   imperfect, today’s uncertainty reminds me of March 2003  Then, on the eve of the invasion of Iraq,   the FOMC decided that geopolitical uncertainty was so great that the Committee could not   characterize the balance of risks at all in the policy statement  Today, the downside risks to output   are almost too dispersed to characterize  In one or two weeks, we may know better that either the   economy will somehow muddle through or we’re likely to be facing the mother of all credit   crunches  I think that the first outcome would be quite an accomplishment under the circumstances,   but at the moment it’s very hard to say how this will turn out   Nevertheless, we have to offer an opinion  With respect to the economic landscape before   the developments of last weekend, one thing that I kept hearing was that uncertainty and caution in   the business community had increased in recent weeks and that they were causing many firms to   hold back on spending and committing to financial investments  But a number of my contacts   indicated that the weakness was not out of line with their earlier expectations  On the plus side, I   got the impression that, with the exception of housing, there are not many excesses on the real side   of the economy that needed to be worked off  Notably, I did not hear of inventory overhangs or   September 16, 2008 42 of 108    unused capacity, and Manpower even indicated that their clients had been careful not to go   overboard earlier in the hiring cycle, and so we’re not left with bloated workforces  Still, this   sentiment and the incoming data did not paint a pleasant picture with regard to the national outlook    As one of my directors said, turning the common phrase against me, the economic problems that we   are facing appear to be remarkably resilient  Even before last weekend’s events, the economic risks   had increased somewhat  We had the large rise in the unemployment rate, the recent weak   consumption data, and heightened caution by firms  Now, of course, the financial risks have   increased substantially and further threaten the growth outlook  At a minimum, credit standards are   likely to tighten further and crimp spending   I’m not looking forward to putting a forecast together in October  Dave and the Board staff   have my sympathy and respect for doing this each meeting  It’s unfortunate, Dave, that we haven’t   had the time to spend talking about the excellent special memo that you and your staff put together   on gauging the effective stance of policy  I thought that was very helpful  I had on previous   occasions mentioned that it would be nice to have some markers that we could look at, and at least   for me, that was quite helpful  Now, it’s not a large stretch to expect that inflationary pressures will   recede, given what we’re facing  We could see enough weakening in the economic outlook that the   projected slack in the economy will point inflation more clearly down and below 2 percent over the   medium term  Just last week I was still a bit skeptical that these forces would be large enough to   achieve this disinflation  But we need to be forward looking, and that would be how I would mark   my inflation forecast down today   So what does this mean for policy today?  I favor alternative B  In my view, we’ve kept the   policy rate low so that we would not be far from appropriate policies if and when the risks to growth   intensified enough relative to the risks to inflation  So we are well positioned to act if we need to  I   September 16, 2008 43 of 108    agree with President Stern that, if we were to act, we should do something significant on the order   of 50 basis points  But I think we should be seen as making well-calculated moves with the funds   rate, and the current uncertainty is so large that I don’t feel as though we have enough information   to make such calculations today  We will know much more in a couple of weeks, I hope at least   about the changes in underlying financial conditions, and will thus have a better sense of the risks to   both elements of the dual mandate and the associated policy actions  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  It is really just a question  What type of   reaction do we think will be engendered by inserting “closely”?  Everybody understands that we   monitor financial developments very carefully  So we are bringing attention to this  Will there   be a presumption that we are likely to do something intermeeting or something like that?  I am   not saying that is wrong, but it is a question     Just to be clear, we have gone a long way just now from its being a   semantic discussion to whether or not the Committee wants to hint at the possibility of a near-  term action  I do not have a problem with that  In fact, in my comments I suggested that the   resolution of uncertainty might improve in the next couple of weeks, but that seems to be the   principal issue here, which I don’t really recall us discussing in as much detail as we just have     Right  So I fully support that sentiment, and if you find the right wording   that captures it, that’s fine with me     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’d just like to review by asking a question  The   swap lines are very large now  Could we review what could go wrong for our balance sheet in a   September 29, 2008 6 of 16    not-so-pleasant scenario?  Are these actions consistent—and I think they are—with the substantial   deleveraging of the financial system that we’re trying to make take place in an orderly fashion but   we can’t resist the natural forces that have to take place?  Thank you     Well, I suppose you answered my question there  It just seems that, in   looking at the TAF auctions, there are a number of foreign institutions that, because I don’t follow   it, I’m not familiar with, and these are the types of institutions that are borrowing under these   agreements  But I suppose that the foreign central banks are careful with their counterparties     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I was jotting down some of the figures on the   lending facilities and the magnitudes just to see if I had the right ballpark  You know, from the TAF   October 7, 2008 10 of 30    to the TSLF, the primary dealer credit facility, and on down to today’s facility on commercial paper,   and then if you throw in the Treasury program, which is not exactly ours, and the swaps as well, I   get to something like over $3 trillion that is being put out against collateral and to be lent  Is that the   right order of magnitude?  I guess the question I have is whether we have any sense that this is   likely to get to the point of unlocking the lending capacity that’s so important to get the economy   going?     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’d like to say that your own commentary   touched on almost all the issues that I had in front of me  I can support this action  I’m not sure it’s   the ideal time, but I can certainly support this  I agree with you that I think inflationary pressures   will be coming down  I think that we’re looking at significant resource slack  Commodity prices   are coming down, and the prospects for growth are not good at all  I think the only thing keeping us   from calling this a recession is the official people who are in charge of doing that   I don’t want you to misinterpret my question about our balance sheet and the size of what   we’re extending to the markets when I asked about $3 trillion when I added in the Treasury   proposal  Clearly there is a lot of financial stress out there, and I think that we’re facing a very   substantial credit crunch of unusual proportions  I agree that these facilities are attempting to   unlock the lending capacity, as Vice Chairman Geithner mentioned  I think that’s extremely   helpful  I just have concerns—these are very, very large, unprecedented actions—and I’m sure that   everybody else shares them as well  I’m reasonably confident that there’s adequate risk   management in terms of the collateral, but this is certainly something that we all should be   concerned about   You also mentioned the transmission mechanism  I normally don’t think that timing issues   are that important  But when we cut the funds rate tomorrow morning and when the headwinds are   October 7, 2008 20 of 30    still the predominant factor, I just wonder whether or not the economy will notice  I think that   ultimately the liquidity will continue to flow out, and it will have some effect, but I don’t know how   large it will be, and that is a risk  Nevertheless, the opportunity to take a coordinated action with the   foreign central banks that you mentioned is very important, and as President Plosser and you   already mentioned, I’m not sure what this means for future actions, but we’re not very good at being   able to say how the economy is going to go from here  So I can support this action  Thank you, Mr   Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I thought there was some pretty good risk   management described in the memo, but I didn’t really follow or don’t understand exactly the   process by which we would generate a loss through these swap lines  Could you take us through   the state of the world in which we would actually generate a loss?  I raised this question before   with the industrialized countries, and the answer was that because those are very high quality   countries, we don’t really have to worry about that  I understand that they follow pretty   reasonable economic policies during normal times  But what are the safeguards, and what would   be the process by which we would generate a loss?     Okay  But it would be that we have their currency and presumably that   would be a state in which it had depreciated     Thank you, Mr Chairman  In spite of the fact that I am going to validate   what President Fisher said in terms of content, I am reminded of what candidate Ronald Reagan   said in 1980 against George Bush  To paraphrase, “I paid for the plane ticket down here  I’m   going to tell you what I learned”  [Laughter]   Pessimism is running deep, and no one I spoke with this round was immune to the current   economic and financial turmoil  Even contacts who have sworn for months that their prudent   financial management had insulated them from funding difficulties now report being stressed    The speed of the turnaround in sentiment has been breathtaking  Some of these new reports   about changes in financing conditions came from large manufacturing firms that had been doing   well this cycle  For example, John Deere noted that its financing subsidiary was having   difficulty rolling medium-term notes that fund their customer leases  This seems symptomatic of   financial stress because the subsidiary has a large capital cushion with high-value collateral   backing the leases  Caterpillar did have better luck getting such funding but only because it went   to the market during a very brief window when lenders were actively seeking customers with   October 28–29, 2008 72 of 206    high credit quality  I also heard numerous reports of businesses having difficulty renewing long-  standing lending arrangements with their banks; and for those who were able to get new loans,   the terms were typically viewed as unattractive—at least they felt so     Several Chicago directors indicated that businesses were successfully tapping existing   loan commitments and revolving credit, much along the lines that President Yellen just   mentioned  However, this was not greeted enthusiastically by their bankers  In fact, I heard a   very interesting story about a major New York bank CEO who spent some time in Chicago a   couple of years ago  He was calling a large customer to assure him that their credit lines were   good and that they didn’t need to be taken down preemptively  The customer, who is our   chairman, listened politely and then tapped the line anyway  [Laughter]  No wonder banks are   worried about their liquidity position   With regard to nonfinancial developments, reports on both current and expected real   activity have turned uniformly more negative  An abrupt change occurred in September  People   are spooked—sorry—[laughter] and it is showing through to spending  Retail sales are weak  I   have grown accustomed to the inherent pessimism of one of my retail contacts  He has often   said that business has never been weaker in 40 years, but this time he said never in 46 years  I   also heard many reports about how the slowing in demand is worldwide   In my District, the sharp slowdown is evident in the Chicago purchasing managers’   index  In October, it plunged nearly 20 points, to 378, the lowest level since the last recession in   May 2001  This index will be publicly released on Friday  Businesses appear to be responding   to the drop in demand by doing anything and everything they can to cut back spending  Labor   demand is way off  My Manpower contact indicated that even companies that are doing well   had turned cautious about hiring and are trying to squeeze out more productivity  He thought   October 28–29, 2008 73 of 206    that the drop in sentiment could have some extra impact, given that it was occurring during the   annual planning cycle for corporations  The idea was that a lot of harder-to-sell structural   adjustments were being implemented anyway and that CEOs wanted to get these moves done   quickly and have them behind them by early 2009  This is consistent with a range of reports we   have heard that new capital spending is dead in the water or that planned expansions are being   canceled  On a positive note, I think we are seeing the benefits of the structural improvement   and inventory management that has occurred over the last 25 years  My contacts are reporting   some increases in inventories, but they think that so far they have kept stocks under relatively   good control  With prompt production cuts, we may not get the additional downside of a big   inventory swing later in the cycle, perhaps when it is more painful   Turning to the national outlook, our forecast envisions a full-blown recession, roughly on   the scale of the Greenbook  But like everyone else, I have a great deal of uncertainty about this   projection  Things could turn out a lot worse  In contemplating the transmission from recent   financial events to the real economy, there seem to be at least two channels to note  First, there   is the dramatically reduced availability and higher cost of credit  Second, a recessionary   psychology has emerged strongly in households and businesses  With regard to the psychology,   I haven’t spoken with anyone this round who thought there was a good reason to undertake any   kind of discretionary expenditure  Clearly, the self-reinforcing dynamics implied by these and   other reports could generate a deeper downturn than I have written down in my forecast  That’s   a big risk  With regard to the credit channel, the hit to the nonfinancial sector has intensified a   good bit  We clearly are sailing in uncharted waters when it comes to quantifying these effects    The factors identified in the Greenbook highlight the unprecedented nature of the financial   impulses to the economy   October 28–29, 2008 74 of 206    Looking ahead, I expect that the improvement in financial conditions will be somewhat   faster than in the Greenbook  That is my cautious optimism  Still, in our forecast, financial   headwinds weigh substantially on growth throughout 2009 and continue, to a degree, into 2010    Accordingly, substantial resource gaps remain open throughout the projection period  Also, I   expect inflation expectations to decline in this depressed environment  With greater slack, lower   inflation expectations, the reduction in energy and other commodity prices, and the higher value   of the dollar, we are projecting core inflation to move under 2 percent by 2010  And I won’t be   shocked if the Greenbook projection for this to happen in 2009 actually happens  So, on balance,   I think that inflationary risks are low but the downside risks to the economy are very high  Much   as President Fisher indicated, it is much in line with the reports so far  Thank you, Mr   Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  After thinking about this for quite some time,   I cannot convince myself that alternative A is not the right way to go      You were very effective in listing a number of dire circumstances  The   fact that we may challenge the maximum duration of a recession in the postwar period, any   mention of the 1981-82 recession is very frightening, you even mentioned 1975 in terms of the   reduction in confidence, and the 1980 credit crunch also—you were able to do that without any   mention of the 1930s, and that’s quite compelling, I would say     So for the reasons that have been already discussed, the outlook is quite unfavorable, and   I think that this will help improve matters  But as I thought about the concerns that I have, one   concern is whether this will actually be viewed as effective today  I’m not sure about that  The   last time we cut rates, financial stress intervened to swamp any beneficial interpretation of that    Whether that affects our credibility, I think that Don Kohn was very effective in mentioning that   there will be credibility hits in the other direction if we don’t take some action like that  I do   think that eventually things will subside and the beneficial effects of lower policy will be seen    About the dry powder argument, we are not going to have many more actions left after this, but I   October 28–29, 2008 126 of 206    don’t see what the alternatives are other than to go ahead and put this in place  I don’t subscribe   to the view that inflation is likely to be too low, although that is a risk  Inflation concerns, the   financial stress, all of those issues, even taking into account the risk that President Bullard   mentioned the other day, I think speak strongly to the fact that we’re running out of normal   monetary policy options and that fiscal actions are going to be strongly important  So I do favor   alternative A  Thank you      Thank you, Mr Chairman  I, too, would like to add my thanks to the staff   for an excellent set of memos—very good analysis  I would agree with pretty much everyone   that the economic outlook and financial stress warrant further relief for financial conditions, so I   am going to be supporting, ultimately, further quantitative easing as needed  I have to admit that   I am not quite sure what the most effective form of that easing is  It just doesn’t seem obvious to   me  But I certainly embrace your suggestion, Mr Chairman, of continuing the regular briefings,   and when necessary, those should be meetings to affirm certain programs that are on the table  I   agree with all of your comments about how important confidence is   Let me turn to some of the specifics of the questions about the standard policy issues with   the fed funds target  With a deep recession looming and inflation receding, I see no reason to   keep our fed funds powder dry  There is no reasonable uncertainty at this point about the   deepness of the recession or the financial stress, and I think the economy would benefit from   further financial accommodation  Because we can’t really hit our fed funds target because of the   breadth of our lending programs that are on our balance sheet today, I think the damage to the   Treasury repo and money market mutual funds is unavoidable at this point   For our policy actions, I think that we should continue to communicate in terms of our   objectives  In my opinion, this strategy covers most of the issues asked of us  The fed funds rate   will be low for some time under our forecast  I don’t think there is much doubt about that, and   our forecast helped with that  Disinflation risks are part of this outlook, and I think that should   be well understood  We can communicate that in our speaking  If our inflation target were   explicit and we talked about it more—higher future inflation expectations than just, if it were the   case, ½ percent or lower—that would be part of the communication calculus  As things stand,   December 15–16, 2008 63 of 284    our long-term projections may be adequate here, but more explicitness in general would be   helpful  It is interesting to me that alternative A encompasses all of these in relatively muted   language  Frankly, if we are expecting a big impact from that statement, I think we need to   include a bold font typeface, [laughter] because I don’t think it will be picked up necessarily    But I think it is really well done   In terms of the questions on particular interventions, the memos brought forward pretty   clearly that the effect of the interventions depends on the size of the operations and where the   markets are  The memos were very good about talking about individual markets and making me   aware of a number of details, but they were often pretty much in isolation of how they would   flow through to other markets  It is not exactly clear to me how important that segmentation or   separation is to achieve the goals that we are hoping for from those interventions  I suppose in   well-functioning markets you might expect more of those funds to be flowing across those   markets, and so you would be generally providing market liquidity  It would flow around  In the   current situation, with more stress, there probably is more separation  Is that ultimately going to   mean we are more effective?  I am not even sure because there is the added stress that has to be   dealt with  So the particular interventions are not exactly obvious to me, and portfolio   rebalancing could have implications   In one of them, there was a correlation matrix—for a particular size of operation, where   agencies are influenced in one way or Treasuries are influenced—about when we would see   other prices move around  That is possibly a guide to this leakage  But, of course, those are   unconditional correlations, as I understood them, and I am not exactly sure how the exogenous   interventions that we are talking about would translate from those correlations  It is really an   identification problem at some level  My takeaway from that is that I find most comforting the   December 15–16, 2008 64 of 284    quantitative easing additions that improve total market liquidity  It seems to me that the   Treasury and agency purchases are the safest  When we get into credit allocation, we have these   facilities in place, and we will probably need to do more  Mr Chairman, you talked about the   unwinding consequences that the Committee will have to worry about, and I think that they are   also pretty important   Last, on the nonstandard approaches for quantitative easing and what that means for the   Desk, I guess this is a harder problem with the dual governance issues than I had really   anticipated  I would have thought that it was relatively straightforward—once we hit the zero   bound on the funds rate that we would identify that we need to expand the balance sheet  I kind   of like it in terms of the asset side  The Committee could authorize a broad range of what that   would mean  We could reaffirm the existing lending programs—not approve them, for that is   the role of the Board—and point to the important role that they are playing  Our statement could   provide guidance on the sizes, which would pretty much just be a restatement of the existing   sizes of the programs  But we could provide ranges of how the Committee might expect that to   be conducted over the intermeeting period if something arose that required an addition, or we   were being briefed on new programs as they were rolled out, that could be part of it  All of that   said, I accept your good faith approach—the more we talk and the more that we understand this   and are consulted, it should be adequate     In terms of communicating to the public, under the approach that I just mentioned we   would basically state that the fed funds target is essentially zero because of all of the lending   facilities  We’d have some statement about the range of the balance sheet, something that is not   supposed to be so constraining but that would be somewhat helpful  The descriptions of the Fed   lending programs would be part of that—they are well done—and the term sheets, and we would   December 15–16, 2008 65 of 284    reinforce our commitment to the policy mandates that we have in our statements and our   forecasts   So, just to conclude, I think we can go further down the quantitative easing policy path  I   am not really convinced that this is going to do everything that we are hoping, and I am a little   concerned as we get to the point where we have an intense desire to effect more that we might   tend to disagree a little more  But I am confident that we will think it through very carefully    Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I have a question or observation, which is of the   optimistic variety although it presents sort of a challenge  In the medium-term outlook in exhibit 4,   if you focus on 2010, the Greenbook projection has real GDP growing at 24 percent  We’re   beginning to come out of this  The unemployment rate is peaking  If you could implement the   optimal control federal funds rate, it would be bottoming out  Maybe that would mean whatever   quantitative easing credit programs we would be doing would be at their peak and maybe would be   coming off  But it is also the time that the inflation rate is low and continuing to fall  This is going   to be a tension for us as we start thinking about, and we are about to engage in mentioning, the   possibility that inflation could be—well, whatever—lower than ideal  What would you guess the   risks might be around that inflation forecast?  How hard is it going to be for us not to continue to   worry about inflation being low or to communicate that inflation is going to continue to be low even   though things are improving?  Just any kind of advice would be helpful   December 15–16, 2008 123 of 284      Thanks     Thank you, Mr Chairman  As gloomy as our last meeting was,   conditions have deteriorated substantially further since then  Practically all of my contacts   reported that economic events had turned sharply lower once again in the last three to five   weeks  This goes well beyond the auto sector and other parts of the District that have been   struggling for some time  The most optimistic comment from my directors was this, “At least   Iowa is going to hell slower than everywhere else”  [Laughter]  It is tough to follow that   accounting joke, you know—that was good  More seriously, the most optimistic theme I heard   from a number of business contacts went something like this, “We are conserving cash and   furiously cutting costs by year-end  But we hope to pause in the first quarter and take stock of   where conditions appear to be heading  Then, we will act accordingly”  Frankly, I doubt such a   wait-and-see pause in cost-cutting will occur that soon   For the purposes of this meeting and our actions over the next few months, I agree with   the main thrust of the Greenbook projection  We are facing large contractions in the next two   quarters, and I don’t expect to see meaningfully positive growth before the fourth quarter  I   think we need substantial further accommodation after today’s meeting  I see the timing and the   size of those actions for the most part being shaped by the large recessionary forces in train and   the enormous financial headwinds   December 15–16, 2008 142 of 284    The disinflationary forces in play clearly are strong, but currently I do not expect that   they will prove large enough to generate outright deflation  In terms of my earlier question about   the Greenbook forecast—as I understand the way it was put together—if the quantitative easing   helps, monetary policy would be somewhere between the funds rate at zero and the optimal   control  So, in fact, it would be a little better than I first suspected  Inflation would be somewhat   above that path  That might be a useful benchmark to watch for if we are fortunate enough for   the forecast to be that stable, but time will tell   Quantitative easing should also lead to an increase in the monetary base  I don’t know if   there was any lasting conflict between your comments and President Lacker’s, but I think that   what we have contemplated will lead to the base increasing and that will generate expectations   about inflation beyond just Taylor-rule dynamics, I would guess  In fact, there is certainly a lot   of discussion and criticism out there that our balance sheet is going to lead to large inflationary   risks  I don’t share that, given how I think we will unwind the programs  But that certainly   would help, and it would move us in that direction  So I will keep an open mind on deflationary   risk  Thank you, Mr Chairman     May I just ask Bill Dudley if he could describe how he anticipates his   operations would differ between alternative A and alternative B?  How would you do things   differently?     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I certainly agree that more accommodation is   needed  We need to take actions to provide, as best we can, the quantitative easing equivalent of   the optimal control path as discussed in the briefing  I am not sure ultimately how feasible that   will be, but it is a good goal for us over the next few months   Now, in terms of the differences between alternative A and alternative B, as I understood   Bill Dudley, there is no operational difference in these two options  It really comes down to how   we want to communicate with ourselves and also the public  I tend to favor alternative B,   certainly for now, and maybe alternative A later  After all, if the funds rate is going to go to zero   in reality, then alternative A might be the right language  But we will have time to see that  This   is a reasonable sequencing  The action today that we are dropping the funds rate target range   75 to 100 basis points is big, and certainly that will be the first thing that they see in the first line    I think they will continue reading  The language on the conditionality about the funds rate being   exceptionally low is certainly okay today  The language says, “The Committee anticipates that   December 15–16, 2008 179 of 284    weak economic conditions are likely to warrant”  I guess there is some question as to whether or   not we should include the dual mandate here—that disinflationary forces are also part of that  I   could go with the consensus there, but I would just raise that as a question     Regarding the bracketed risk that inflation could decline for a time below optimal rates—  the rates that we think are best—back in 2003 this is what got a tremendous amount of attention    That is another reason that, as people read further, it could have a very large effect  It seems to   be accurate  One way to deal with that would be to allow the minutes to capture that discussion,   at least this time, and perhaps to put it in next time  It depends on the accumulation of how many   of these large noteworthy developments we want in the statement here  I would be even more   comfortable if that type of statement were accompanied by a context such as that we would be   seeking conditions of inflation being around 2 percent  I realize that this may not be the ideal   time to include that without a more extended discussion  But I would be okay with the bracketed   information, if that is the consensus     I think we should probably omit the Treasury purchases if we don’t think that we are   going to do that by March  Certainly, omitting it today is low cost  Given all the information, it   is probably overload     I am okay with the language in the directive  Accompanying the language is all of the   discussion about the collaboration that we have between the Board and the Committee generally,   and so I have a very good feeling about that  I think that it will tend to evolve as this goes on,   whether or not it is maximum thresholds or just changing the composition of all of this  So those   are my preferences  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I ultimately favor an inflation target, but I am   concerned that this may not be the right time  Nevertheless, I am open-minded  First, I do   ultimately favor an explicit inflation guideline  Inflation is a monetary phenomenon  How the   central bank responds to everything around it determines the range of inflation outcomes  Once   inflation fell to a range closer to price stability in the 1990s—as we have already mentioned, we   had this debate in 1995—it seemed reasonable to me as a monetary economist that clarifying our   inflation objective would improve the public’s expectations and the effectiveness of our policies    Because trend growth and natural rates of unemployment are determined by technology and the   structure of the economy, we cannot similarly dictate their steady-state levels  We can and do   provide information on that in our longer-term forecasts   Despite my preference for an explicit guideline, I worry that now might not be a good   time to adopt an explicit target  I can be convinced otherwise, but I think the dangers might   outweigh the likely benefits I think that many would see such a move as overly opportunistic    Our intentions may be questioned, and these criticisms could undermine our credibility  I am not           January 16, 2009 29 of 69  concerned merely about the reaction of political officials who may not understand the value of   clear inflation goals  Earlier this week we hosted a group of academic economists who would   normally be very sympathetic to this suggestion But as the discussion turned to the reported   arguments that adopting an inflation target might help us with our current policy dilemmas, there   was great resistance, and I was really quite surprised  Many thought this was taking advantage   of a crisis without working to build the necessary political consensus  Some also thought it   would make the Fed look out of touch  The debate over inflation targeting is not fresh  As you   mentioned earlier, it is a long-standing debate, and it seems somewhat orthogonal to the financial   crisis At a minimum, there is a mountain of effort and persuasion required to pull this off   successfully Now, any reluctance I have about setting an explicit inflation target is due simply   to the current difficult environment  If we can overcome this—and, Mr Chairman, I would rely   on your judgment there as well that this has reasonable prospects of being successful—I would   favor this proposal   Turning to the other questions circulated to the Committee, I don’t see those as   generating substantial concerns, at least from my standpoint  For example, I don’t believe that   our dual mandate stands in the way of adopting an explicit numerical price objective  Most of   my thinking on this is consistent with quadratic loss function analysis not much different from   the Bluebook discussion before each meeting  The key elements are an output-like gap and an   inflation deviation from target  The policy responses implied by such a loss function have a   partial adjustment of inflation toward its target value  The rate of adjustment will depend on the   size of the output gap in obvious ways  If we adopt an explicit inflation target, we can find   straightforward language to communicate how these adjustments respect our dual mandate   responsibilities, in my opinion             January 16, 2009 30 of 69  How does this affect the conduct of monetary policy?  Well, the loss function approach   indicates that we would balance any conflicts within our dual mandate goals  This is not that   different from the current situation, in which we have implicitly agreed on an inflation range, at   least according to our longer-term forecasts  With regard to financial stability considerations,   most of the time it would be enough to say that policy takes into consideration financial market   pricing and volatility through the way in which they influence the evolution of the economy and,   hence, our dual mandate goals  Of course, there can be regime-switching or nonlinear financial   risks We are certainly experiencing those  In those events, we would need to balance more   considerations For me, this issue does not seem any more relevant for the inflation target   discussion than our other policy goals   In terms of timing, it is probably useful to adopt the medium-term language and try to   define the elastic ways it will be used—that is, in a state-contingent way  I would provide an   average time frame for medium term, such as three to four years  I would then use some   language based on the loss function framework to indicate that the size of the output gap would   tend to influence the actual timing of medium term   Regarding price-level targeting, I am not convinced that it is a better tool for minimizing   the costs associated with inflation and deflation, and the temptation for the Committee not to   follow through when it is uncomfortable to do so would be large  That would be a big credibility   hit On the particular numbers, I would favor using the total PCE index at 2 percent  That seems   to be more likely to avoid zero lower bound issues  I agree with President Plosser  I think just   finding an explicit goal would provide most of the benefits, not so much the number, as long as it   is not too large I would prefer a target around which we behave approximately symmetrically  I   don’t want us to panic over deflation every time we move under the target  Now, my staff has        January 16, 2009 31 of 69  talked to me quite a lot about the fact that optimal policy could imply some asymmetry with   respect to inflation being above and below the target  For example, we might need to be more   aggressive fighting below-target inflation, as we are today, because the costs of a moderate   deviation in that direction could be higher than those of a comparable deviation above the target    In that case, the guiding principle is that optimal policy should seek to equalize pain above and   below target, not the time spent above and below  This is a clever idea, but this equilibrium   relies heavily on rational expectations and full credibility with the public, and I am just a bit   skeptical of that To conclude, my bottom line is that I like an explicit inflation guideline at the   right time  I am not completely sold that this is the right time, but I am open-minded  If you   have a reasonable expectation or assurance that this could be pulled off, I would favor it  Thank   you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I really found this proposal of yours to be very   helpful because my views have been evolving on this  It is much more complicated, difficult, and   interesting than even I guessed  So I think our thinking will evolve on this, and it is an experiment   as you mentioned  I had previously thought that somehow introducing, as President Plosser   mentioned, some type of cap on the size of the balance sheet or some range for that would be useful    But you have certainly convinced me that the size of these programs is going to vary depending on a   number of endogenous developments as well as on what we do  So that is probably not so fruitful   But in terms of the responsibility of this Committee, when we start talking about the exit   strategy for winding down the programs and getting our balance sheet back toward where it was at   the outset, I recognize that this is quite some time forward and we will be lucky when we get to that   point  We need to be thinking about how the balance sheet looks as we exit this, and that is going to   be a real challenge That is why I applaud all of the suggestions about how we look at these                            January 16, 2009 63 of 69  programs with respect to that exit strategy  What we need to do is think about what the due   diligence ought to be as we consider the risk that we are facing for policy  Depending on how this   plays out, there could be capital losses  I do not know how large, but then as we try to wind this   down, we might find that there is a lot more liquidity out there  Our liabilities are larger  We can’t   extinguish that on our own, and that would have price-level implications under certain scenarios that   would be very uncomfortable for us  Now, of course, the Treasury could help us out with issuing   certain notes, but then that gets us into how we are tied to the Treasury, and so that is just more   complicated Still I think that your proposal—for Bill Dudley and the New York Desk to talk about   financial developments and the programs, being as explicit as possible and in a consistent fashion   describing these programs and identifying the key parameters that will help determine whether the   exit strategy is going more favorably or if we are at greater risk—I think that would be very helpful   When we get to the policy discussion on these programs, we could try to come up with some   risk scenarios as benchmarks for things that we fear greatly or things that would go well  These   could be low probability  Obviously, we are thinking that they are low probability  The worst case   would probably be if inflationary expectations rose and the economy were still in the doldrums or   worse  That is not my outlook, but if there was a loss of confidence in the United States relative to   the rest of the world—again, I see that this is low probability—how would that influence what our   balance sheet looks like coming out?  Even if it is a low probability, if it has a really high cost to our   institution, at least being explicit about the risk that we are accepting as a Committee for the Federal   Reserve would serve us very well I am pretty sure that we are headed in directions like this, but I   am just interpreting this now in terms of the due diligence that we might expect if somebody were   supervising an institution like this and what they would be asking us to do  I think that this will   probably evolve, and I found this to be very helpful  Thanks            January 16, 2009 64 of 69   Thank you, Mr Chairman  Is it too early to ask for a few more details on   the swap description that you were talking about?  In the following sense—there was nothing   distributed on this, right?    Okay Because the question that I asked before about the swaps—and I   had been comforted by the answer—is what our loss exposure is when we provide swaps to   foreign central banks They stand behind them, so that is about as good as we have  This is   sounding a little different If I understood what you were talking about, it is that we will be   using them as an agent to provide funding to our troubled institutions, and some discussion about   what guarantees and whatnot would be very helpful               January 27–28, 2009 28 of 267   Is it too early to have some idea what the order of magnitude of the   funding requirements might look like?    I wouldn’t hold you to it, if you are willing to     I have noticed that the astute responders don’t go for that line  [Laughter]    Okay Thank you That is very helpful    I can I was just trying to guess whom you were talking about     May I ask an information question?    President Lacker alluded to two banks that funded their operations at a   very low rate  Was that with the FDIC senior guarantee on their debt?    That is a distortion that is helping them, right?  I am running into that   when I talk to a lot of people  I will come back to that        January 27–28, 2009 58 of 267   Well, that is a distortion    Our problem is that there is one distortion here, and then there is   something else, and then they don’t offset or they do offset, and people are inside or they are not    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I will just make a couple of comments based   on the discussion today When it comes to the TALF, I find that I am of two minds  I do think it   will ultimately be useful for deploying important central bank liquidity in an attempt to provide   more-accommodative conditions  But I am concerned that we are picking winners throughout   this process When you mention that we are going to consider CMBS, I am reminded of the   fellow who came to my office and gave me a presentation  He owns shopping malls, and last fall   he desperately needed funding and still does, but they are not worth very much at the moment    He wanted a program like this, but it wasn’t available—I do not know that it was, anyway  I   have also received phone calls from heavy equipment manufacturers in my District  I know you   have gotten a letter from at least one of them about their finance company financing  For them   the issue is that they are unlucky enough not to have a thrift through the OTS  So they cannot   get the FDIC unsecured-funding temporary guarantee on that, and their assets cannot be funded   that way There are some competitors that have access to this, and they have done very well, and   others that haven’t As we get into this allocation type of decisionmaking, I am not quite sure   how we are going about doing it Is CMBS selected because it is an important market that we   need to keep functioning or because it is going to have a particular macroeconomic effect that is   beneficial?  How does that compare with other sectors and whether they are on our radar screen   or not?  Maybe that was the right decision, but when we select certain types of asset-backed   securities to buy—it is just very difficult           January 27–28, 2009 69 of 267  I also want to agree with many of the comments that President Plosser made with regard   to the programs that we have  The briefing today was very helpful in describing the various   programs  I think we need some additional metrics along the lines of just routine types of   statistics so that we can see and have a better idea  Your familiarity is very great with these, and   ours is not as great I have to admit, as I look at it more, I find that, although I am very   concerned about exit strategy in general, at the moment our balance sheet doesn’t worry me quite   so much   Finally, I want to applaud your comments at the beginning, Mr Chairman, about   discussions with the Treasury and that we, as best we can be, should be allergic to any attempts   to use our balance sheet for long-term financing  I think that is exactly right  I wish you all the   best for all of us [Laughter] I have tried to grapple with the very vague discussions of   aggregator banks, and when I talk to academics, they do not always help me because they resist   the fact that public funds are going to be put into this—they think that it really should be   something that public funding is not a part of   If you pick a very large number that is required to take assets off the balance sheet of   banks—I do not know what the number is, but it is in trillions—and then you think about how   the Treasury is going to fund this, the only way they can do that is by issuing Treasury bonds    Ms Mosser was talking about how $150 billion puts strains on yields  I think you very quickly   come to our balance sheet and how we are able to leverage up, and it even makes sense—   because why do the gross funding through bonds when it is really a net kind of funding against   assets? So it makes a lot of sense, but it causes a lot of trouble  I hope that I am wrong in   thinking about that and that there are very easy ways out of it  But those are some of our   concerns, and they will be very important        January 27–28, 2009 70 of 267   Thank you, Mr Chairman  I will resist the temptation to mark down my   forecast right now  [Laughter] Conversations with my business contacts indicate that the   economic contraction is proceeding with full force  These discussions were very consistent with   the near-term outlook of the Greenbook  There were two noteworthy recurrent themes that I   would like to elaborate on—the rapid pace of job destruction and the large uncertainties that   private-sector decisionmakers face   With regard to job destruction, consistent with the national data, all CEOs I spoke with   indicated that they are in the process of large-scale layoffs and are studying further job cuts    Much as President Fisher referred to with his three drawers, I did not find a left drawer either    The uniformity of these reports is striking The best economic report I received was from John   Deere that agriculture was still holding up well enough that they are going to do okay, they   thought They are cutting only hundreds of jobs  Everybody else is cutting way more  All of   my contacts also say that the easy job eliminations have already been made or are in train    Everyone is now contemplating making more-difficult cuts of valuable core staff  These   cutbacks, if they go through with them, will adversely influence firms’ ability to respond when   we do eventually see the signs of economic recovery  I could go on I had a story about how           January 27–28, 2009 135 of 267  replacement garbage disposals are down 20 percent, which must mean that people are now   washing dishes when their disposal breaks down  But I will stop   Anxiety is the second recurrent theme  Uncertainty and risk aversion are inhibiting   economic and financial activity  Obviously, much of this reflects the inevitable uncertainty   regarding the depth and persistence of the downturn  But as President Lockhart mentioned, I am   also hearing from all quarters that businesses cannot understand the rationale used to undertake   government policy interventions  It is not just businesses  A political leader in Illinois, the   Mayor of Chicago, whom I will quote, tells me that when he runs into homeowners in the city, a   number of them have mentioned that they are wondering where their mortgage relief is coming   from  They are thinking about not paying their mortgage  Without a clearer understanding of   the rules of the game, they will be more cautious and sit on the sidelines, and they are clamoring   for greater clarity When I tried to ask my directors about what they preferred most—we can’t   do more with the funds rate—more policy accommodation or more clarity, they clearly chose   clarity over policy Now, in spite of what I am going to say, I do support our current programs,   but I am reporting on our environment and the challenges that we are facing here     With regard to banks, relatively healthy banks that took TARP money are concerned that   they will be subjected to future government restrictions  Again, as President Fisher mentioned, I   think there is some regret  Many bankers who could have gotten by without TARP injections   took the money because they feared that nonparticipation might be inferred as a signal of   weakness Now they are concerned that the costs could be considerably higher than advertised,   in part because of political pressure for lending mandates in an economic environment that   makes credit quality challenging        January 27–28, 2009 136 of 267  Another uncertainty relates to the configuration of credit policies and potential changes in   them  I talked about this just briefly yesterday  In many cases, our lending facilities and   government guarantees restore funding sources to some parties but disadvantage others who are   outside the safety net protection For example, I have heard from several durable goods   manufacturers who have captive finance companies that provide funding for dealers or   customers  Those who owned a bank or had previously utilized commercial paper funding   thought that the CPFF and the Treasury guarantees have been helpful  But not everyone is in this   position According to those who were excluded, the separating equilibrium imposes higher   costs on them than the previous pooling equilibrium, in which the high costs were shared more   by all of them Similarly, the TALF is expected to be very helpful to some but not others under   the current plans Though our lending programs have been helpful on balance, their differential   effects, unfortunately, open us up to political risks  It is difficult to do the cost–benefit   calculations at the moment, because the TALF hasn’t gotten under way  Once we see how well   that is going, I think we will have a better idea of that   I also hear repeatedly that uncertainty is boosting lending rates and keeping capital sitting   idle on the sidelines Bankers I talked to who have balance sheet capacity are charging higher   credit spreads They all tell me that this change is a return to more normal and prudent   consideration of risk and underwriting So some of that could be what President Yellen’s   borrowers are experiencing as well In fact, in reading through the first report to the Congress of   the Financial Stability Oversight Board, I saw many of these arguments mentioned there as well    So everyone is obviously dealing with this issue   A private equity contact mentioned that he raised a fund of $5 billion this summer—I   think it was supposed to be higher than that—but has not made a single investment yet  Given        January 27–28, 2009 137 of 267  the scarcity of capital and the high level of risk, he says expected returns must be much higher   than before I wasn’t expecting that This obviously implies that capital injections from these   private sources will be very expensive when they are finally deployed  Furthermore, some are   concerned that government actions are hard to predict and add to uncertainty  They bring up   what happened to WaMu’s debt holders  One of our directors explicitly mentioned Governor   Kohn’s testimony about our hopes for private capital injections alongside public injections  I   went back, and it is written very well, but no one could envision that happening without greater   clarity on the rules guiding those interventions   All of these stories feed into our outlook for the national economy  Our forecast for   growth is very similar to the Greenbook’s  Although my gut instinct is now conditioned to   reflexively mark down every forecast I see, cool-headed analysis suggests that risks are a bit   more two-sided around pessimistic outlooks  One reason is that the risks surrounding our   expectations for growth over the next year or two depend a good deal on the effect of the fiscal   stimulus  I think in our forecast we have this helping a bit more than most around the table in the   second half Although I favor fiscal stimulus, I do continue to wonder about the effectiveness of   such large programs and the ability to efficiently target large sums to the intended projects in a   full and timely fashion  Still, I thought we were a bit conservative in estimating their GDP   effects, so the risks to growth over the next couple of years have some upside possibilities   Our inflation outlook is a bit more sanguine than the Greenbook’s  We see inflation   falling only to about 1¼ percent in 2011  We are on the high side  Of course, resource gaps are   expected to be very large and could pull inflation lower than in our forecast  But predicting   inflation expectations seems harder than usual right now  Indeed, there is a remarkable diversity   of views about where inflation is headed  As many of my academic colleagues are quick to point           January 27–28, 2009 138 of 267  out, the substantial liquidity injections and large government deficits pose an important upside   risk to the longer-run inflation outlook  Not only have academics brought up the enormous   liquidity and unpleasant monetarist arithmetic, but so have some of my directors and other   business contacts On the other hand, if agents’ expectations of inflation focus more heavily on   the large resource gaps, we could face significant downside risks as well  So there is a lot to   balance out here President Plosser and President Bullard mentioned this, too  Even Dave   Stockton sort of gave us a pass on the fact that we have a lot to chew through here as to what   could be a reasonable argument  It is hard to know where expectations balance out, but our base   case is that inflation expectations will not decline as much as envisioned in the Greenbook  I   don’t think this really changes the policy implications  We still need the useful monetary policy   accommodation that is really called for in this outlook  Finally, I do support the long-term   forecasts Thank you, Mr Chairman    Let me ask a question  Has anybody conveyed that thought in speeches or   testimony either from you or Governor Kohn, in which case it would be less newsworthy?    All right Thank you    Right I may have said something like that, too; I’m not quite sure  Okay   Thank you I do find myself largely in agreement with the emerging consensus here  In fact, as I   was listening to President Yellen’s comments, I found them to be wholly satisfactory from my   viewpoint I do have a preference for alternative A today  I think obviously what we would like     January 27–28, 2009 185 of 267  to do is to lower the funds rate, but we cannot do that  So we are struggling for the best way to   do that, and we do not have a great way to understand exactly the influence of our credit   programs on that   I ask myself what the value of waiting and seeing is right now  On the one hand, we have   not implemented the TALF, although we have been talking about it for quite some time, and so it   will be useful to have some experience with that and see what the signals are coming from that  I   find myself in agreement with Governor Kohn on this, but I am unsure how it is going to work   out, and so there will probably be some adjustments  Then I ask myself whether we can afford to   wait, given what we are looking at  It does seem as if there is a lot of uncertainty as to fiscal   policy—exactly what the size of it will be and how it will play out  In our own forecast we have   a stronger role than some others, but uncertainty is there  As I looked at alternative A with the   MBS, it mentions that we are not going to complete this until the end of the third quarter, and   that by itself has a great amount of delay  I think that is very pragmatic, and that is the way it   would actually occur I am not quite sure whether the cost of putting that off and announcing it   at our next meeting, if that is the right way to do it, would be that high  There is also the   uncertainty of what the Administration will pursue  As President Bullard and others mentioned,   if there is a proposal for a large aggregator bank coming forward from the Administration, what   will be the size of that?  What are the dimensions of that, and would we need a big action now or   how would that play into it?  There are a lot of uncertainties, and so I just cannot say I know for   sure on that   In terms of the specifics, I did find myself okay with the language on inflation perhaps as   “below rates that best foster economic growth”  But I agree—there is a lot of uncertainty as to   how that will be perceived, but it does seem factually correct that there is some risk  So I would           January 27–28, 2009 186 of 267  be okay with that I suppose we have not really discussed—or have we?—your question, Mr   Chairman, about the sentence whether we anticipate a gradual recovery later this year  It does   seem to me as though in almost every forecast we see economic growth certainly being positive   by the fourth quarter and we hope by the third quarter  I worry a bit that, if we are more   pessimistic in our statement about that, it would seem to be some type of vote of no confidence   in fiscal actions that are forthcoming  It doesn’t seem to be factually incorrect that we are   expecting this, and so I would favor leaving that  Thank you    Mr Chairman, it is the “anticipated”  Couldn’t we just say, “The   economy has weakened further”?    In this case, it doesn’t say “outlook”    That would be okay with me    It is as mild as saying we have stepped from the fourth quarter into the   first quarter, which is going to be a contraction    May I make just one quick point?  President Lacker mentioned that there   was some concern about changes in the inflation long-term projection on a quarter-to-quarter   basis I don’t interpret the distribution that way  It seems to me as though it was probably   importantly influenced by our discussion at the videoconference, and it was a one-off type of           January 27–28, 2009 216 of 267  change I know I changed my forecast from 1¾ to 2 percent  I had previously felt constrained   that 1¾ was pretty much a Committee consensus midpoint, and so I figured we would be acting   that way But now, with more people thinking it was 2, that was how I changed it  I get a sense   that others around the table may have done the same thing    Thank you, Mr Chairman  First, I’d like to say that relative to the fears   for our balance sheet that I expressed ten days ago, I’ve heard a lot of things that have made me    feel much better about this  So I think you’ve done a great job   On the TALF, you mentioned that our goal could expand to $1 trillion  Is that going to   be our decision, or is that going to be part of the Treasury announcement?  And I guess that   interacts with the capital cushion, the haircuts, and how much we’re going to lever  So any light   you could shed on that would be helpful   In looking at the term sheets on the TALF yesterday, somebody pointed out to me that   the haircuts for some loans seemed to be lower than what is charged at the discount window    But maybe those aren’t apples-to-apples comparisons?  It seems that it’s more generous—lower   for the TALF—as I understand it    Okay So at the discount window they’re not rated  So there’s more   uncertainty    It’s just that, as you look at the table, it does get your attention  So maybe   an additional FAQ on that would be helpful           February 7, 2009 25 of 65   So on the TALF expansion, I can guess that my colleagues and everyone   here have gotten a lot of phone calls and correspondence from people who were outside of the   asset classes that have access to it, and as you expand it, I assume that this is only going to grow    So I wonder, will there be discussions, or could we at least have some guidance as to what the   selection process is? And then finally, on the bank preferred stock from TARP I—I’m just not   familiar enough with this—what is the bank reaction to this going to be when we now come at   them and say that, “oh, this is going to be convertible into common stock”?    Will they be happy about that?  I have talked to a lot of bankers who say,   “Look, I didn’t really need this, but it seemed like a good signal at the time”                 February 7, 2009 26 of 65   I thought that autos were higher     Yes, I was That’s why I said it might not be apples to apples              February 7, 2009 27 of 65   Yes Thank you    Will the investors in the aggregator bank be subject to any executive   compensation regulations?    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’d like to congratulate you on being a tough   taskmaster, with having us sit and listen to an hour’s worth of briefings without any questions  I   had seven, but I’m down to three now  [Laughter] And I’ll be jumping around, too, because of   that I’d like to ask a question of Dave Reifschneider first, having to do with exhibit 3 on the   inflation forecast under large-scale asset purchases  Let me mention at the outset that I’ll reveal   later on in this meeting that I’m not overly concerned about inflation, but having seen this chart,   I’m suspicious of this, and it’s in the way that the analysis is done  As I read the Bluebook, it   seems that the unconstrained optimal policy has inflation rising because inflation expectations   rise, and you have inflation expectations depend on errors in the Taylor rule, as I understand it               March 17–18, 2009 40 of 266  So I’m guessing that the model is seeing very accommodative monetary policy and translating   that into increases in inflation expectations, and that’s why inflation is up  Now, I’m going to   guess that you do not have that same effect in these other forecasts    And that makes no sense to me because the whole point is to replicate an   accommodative monetary policy  So I would have come up with some translation of how   accommodative and unusual this is and tried to feed this into it  Success would be when you   come up with a nontraditional policy that matches that the unconstrained outcome, because that’s   what we’re trying to do with the optimal policy My guess is that, if you went back and were   successful, this inflation outlook would have more overshooting, right?  Over 2 percent So I   don’t think we can rely too much on that chart    I like the model analysis  I think it’s very useful, and I think this is just a   limitation, and that’s how everybody should interpret it, because you’re doing a great job on the   unemployment rate here  That sort of tips you off   Let me jump to the balance sheet scenarios, because I looked at those scenarios, but   didn’t see one that, in light of disinflation risk, I would like to see If it were costly to have one        March 17–18, 2009 41 of 266  more, I would drop one of the others instead  The ones that I’d like to see are where the   Committee finds itself in a position where we need to raise rates, but we have a lot of sticky   assets on our balance sheet, we’re not quite sure how to address that, and we don’t get legislative   relief While I do not put a high probability on this scenario, I think it’s important to understand   it What if inflation expectations rose?  I think it would have to be an exogenous increase—   something that is not currently imbedded in my thinking and in the model analysis here—but,   what if?  Certainly a lot of people are out there looking at our balance sheet—I think   incorrectly—but they’re looking at it and saying “something’s going to get out of hand”  So if   we could see a scenario like that, including how we would have to grapple with balancing the   conflicts, it would be very informative  That’s more of a suggestion   Finally, I have a relatively elementary question about the TALF  What is the value-  added of the investor in the middle in this entire transaction?  We’re bringing hedge funds to the   table, and I’ve thought, well, they’re going to help with price discovery to make sure that this   issuance is really right, but I don’t know that that’s really a strong role  There’s a lot of private   capital on the sidelines—according to what everybody tells us—and they’re going to bring a very   small part of it to the transaction  But what they are demanding—I hear from everybody I talk   to—are very high levered rates of return, which hedge funds are typically associated with   delivering This is going to be in relatively low-risk transactions—triple-A  We’re not expecting   to lose on them, but we could   But what does this mean?  We’re hoping this will kick-start a secondary market  It’s that   kick start—I don’t know where that comes from  There’s capital on the sidelines What will   bring it to the table?  I would guess that they would start by looking at this and saying, “Well, the   safest investment has 20 percent rates of return  So from here on out the risk curve, the rates           March 17–18, 2009 42 of 266  should be higher” I’m already hearing from a lot of contacts that this is very expensive, that   they have to deliver this, and they’re not sure if they are going to participate very much   Is the risk–return frontier in some sense being moved up by this program?  Will   competition really bring these returns down?  That’s what we always think, but I don’t know   where competition is going to come from, because it’s on the sidelines  I really have to   understand why it’s on the sidelines and why it will now be forthcoming    Yeah It seems like a hope at the moment  And I’m not opposed to   hoping a lot [Laughter]    Just to clarify—the legacy-asset aspect of this would be within the   currently envisioned $1 trillion?    Is that because of the pricing?    It’s only a bad asset at a high price  If the third-party assessment comes   out at a reasonable price—    Thank you, Mr Chairman  On the asset purchases, my view is that the   hole in aggregate demand is really quite large, and as I look at the figure on the gap between the   optimal policy and the zero bound, I think it’s really stunning, so I’m open to proposals for   substantial purchases In fact, I’m not totally confident in any particular program that we have   proposed, so I favor diversifying Both MBS and Treasuries sounds like a pretty attractive   option from my standpoint  I’m not quite sure how to evaluate the numbers that the Vice Chair   just laid out I know I can’t disagree with him, but I don’t quite know how to calibrate these   other policy measures like in the Greenbook and Bluebook figure  So I’d like to hear more about   that tomorrow, but I’m open-minded   On the accord, it sounds good The way we’ve talked about it is that it’s a long-term   accord Right now we have a lot of assets on our balance sheet that we would like to be able to   get rid of If issuing Fed bills is the way to go, that would be fine  You mentioned that some   might favor a sunset provision  Would that be on the order of three or four years, or 20 years?    It sounds like it’s aimed at getting us out of the current situation, and I   think that’s a good idea But over the next 30 years, our ability to have that authority might be a   problem  In reading your testimony on the 13(3) authority and the grilling that you got, I don’t   recall anybody who thought it was a great idea that the Fed had the authority to undertake this on   their own, and they wouldn’t admit that they knew that this was possible, at least according to   what I had read So I just wonder, would a future accord be a 13(3)-type of activity that causes   us to acquire these assets, and then we’d need to issue bills?  I guess I’m just wondering under   what circumstances we would issue bills   I think the lasting lesson from all of this is that we don’t want to get here again, that we   ought to conduct policy in a way to avoid this Future regulatory changes that might help out are   obviously one way, market discipline is another, and responding to large changes in asset prices   that we don’t understand very well might be another  But keeping the average level of the fed   funds rate at a place where we don’t expect to hit the zero bound again might be much more   attractive now, having gone through this, so that might be something we should talk about at   some point  If along the way you could get an explicit numerical price objective out of this, that   would be quite good And then, lastly, let me ask another question  If the likely take-up on our   TALF for the legacy assets is low, and given the prudent central bank lending that we are doing   (at least according to the people I talk to in the marketplace; they don’t find this very attractive),   is the Treasury going to be satisfied with that?  How are we going to respond to them?    That would be more desirable from a public policy standpoint  Thanks    Thank you, Mr Chairman  The executive summary for my business   reports this round is Things have never been so bad  This view is essentially unchanged from   January; they weren’t happy then either These reports seem to represent a continuation of the   severe contraction rather than additional negative impulses  But that’s not especially comforting,   as this is shaping up to be the worst economic downturn since the 1930s  But President Stern’s   comments did make me feel better about the outlook, so I certainly hope I’m wrong there              March 17–18, 2009 142 of 266  The Greenbook’s presentation of an unconstrained optimal monetary policy response was   striking in my opinion  The size of the policy gap is so large that quibbling over differences in   model specifications and the like seems beside the point  I was contemplating asking Dave   Stockton what it would take to generate inflation—maybe if potential output was less favorable   than we think, that’s how it would happen  But I couldn’t imagine that the answer would change   my opinion because they had one scenario that went some ways towards that already  I think this   gap is representative of the tremendous amount of economic slack that we are facing  If   adequate policy actions are not forthcoming or are not feasible, then larger and longer-lasting   economic costs may be looming  Many of my contacts noted that if the economy did not find a   bottom soon, they would be in for another round of major reductions in productive capacity    They specifically noted the likelihood of cuts in core labor forces and capital infrastructures    These adjustments would be very costly to undo when the economy eventually recovers   The commentary I heard on financial market difficulties suggests that our credit policies   are now fighting against even greater headwinds than before, but it’s unclear how we might   counteract this additional deterioration directly  In addition to continuing concerns about credit   supply, more contacts are noting that the severe contraction is causing the credit quality of   borrowers to deteriorate Ford said that when they’re making auto loans, the banks seemed to be   getting the better-credit-quality buyers at the moment, but they said that their rejections on retail   financing were 50 percent now, which is up 10 percentage points  Federal Reserve, Treasury,   and FDIC programs have eased credit supply conditions somewhat and hopefully will lead to   more improvement, but the reduced creditworthiness looms as a potentially even larger problem   than restrictive credit supply                    March 17–18, 2009 143 of 266  In terms of the likely effectiveness of the TALF, I heard a number of different   perspectives from my contacts  Discover Financial said the current TALF spreads were too wide   to be attractive Nonetheless, they thought the TALF would be a useful backstop  They also said   they would consider using it, especially if investors became willing to accept somewhat smaller   rates of return, that is, low double-digit returns  Investors in the middle of this transaction seem   to be doing very well without really accepting a lot of risk—I’m not sure they’re bringing a lot to   the table, frankly Ford was expecting to place several billion dollars of securities backed by   consumer auto loans with TALF borrowers  They thought this would be quite helpful, but on the   other hand, both Ford and GM indicated that they would like to use the TALF to finance dealer   inventories However, the high cost for credit enhancements to secure a triple-A rating would   make it uneconomical for them to do so   As a central bank, our credit policies are necessarily conservative  They are aimed   primarily at improving credit supply conditions by lending on prudent terms  But what makes   the terms prudent to us results in many issuers seeing the TALF as being too restrictive and on   unattractive terms  I said to one CEO who was complaining of this that, if we were a private   financial company with this pricing policy, we wouldn’t last a week  Indeed, those firms with   access to the TLGP were unanimous in preferring that source of funding to the TALF  Several   of these also advocated expanding the borrowing capacity under the TLGP, and firms without   access to the TLGP were lobbying to get in  Such are the benefits and distortions of our public   programs  So my reading is that the prudent terms for the TALF make it less attractive and   suggest its take-up rate and effectiveness may be limited I’m not advocating changes   necessarily—I’m just reporting that its macroeconomic effectiveness may be smaller than the   economy needs        March 17–18, 2009 144 of 266  Framing the monetary policy discussion with a viewpoint on the national economic   outlook is fairly simple this time  Although I could cite some differences between my forecast   and the Greenbook’s projections, these differences do not change three material observations    First, enormous resource gaps through 2010 for sure will continue to require aggressive   monetary accommodation with nonstandard tools Second, for the foreseeable future,   disinflationary forces seem strong enough that aggressive monetary policy accommodation   would not impose undue risk to our price stability goal  Third, to offset these disinflationary   forces, a sharp rise in inflation expectations would be necessary  I think it would have to be   exogenous It’s not in my forecast  The circumstances by which this would occur are hard to   predict, although commentators point to risks from the expansion of our balance sheet and future   fiscal deficits  I do not expect these will have a quantitatively important impact on inflation   expectations over the next couple of years   Finally, the Greenbook’s baseline is so dismal that, with the unemployment rate headed   to 9½ percent and a substantial disinflation in train, even the most optimistic alternative   scenarios do not see an increase in the fed funds rate before 2013  This is sobering None of us   are accustomed to thinking that a prolonged period of zero short-term interest rates will be   associated with a lack of inflationary pressures  For virtually all of our contemporary monetary   memories, inflation has been above desirable levels in the US  This is an enormous challenge to   our thinking and to our typical approaches to monetary policy strategy  Indeed, the FRB/US   calculations where inflation did overshoot were premised on the idea that these Taylor shocks   would lead to an increase in inflationary expectations  That is, that they are very   accommodative  But we don’t see that in our analysis at the moment           March 17–18, 2009 145 of 266  I began to think about the policymaker who equally weights his or her displeasure on   either NAIRU or output and inflation gaps, which are the underpinnings for the optimal policy in   the Bluebook We’re looking at an output gap in the Greenbook of 8 percentage points, so with   equally weighted displeasure, you ought to be willing to accept inflation that is somewhat higher   than your target Given these large expected output gaps, even a borderline inflation nutter   would be willing to accept a substantial risk of overshooting in the inflation target  So the   bottom line, in my opinion, is that a well-designed program of substantial nontraditional   monetary accommodation, in concert with clearly specified dual mandate goals and reasonable   safeguards, will keep long-term inflation expectations anchored  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Brian, in the Bluebook and yesterday we saw   a chart of how the unemployment rate and the inflation rate would play out under these different   strategies My question is about alternative A, the largest program that we’re considering  Is it   plausible/likely/possible that what we’re looking at here would be enough?  Would the markets   look at this and think that the FOMC has taken actions that it believes, if the outlook doesn’t   deteriorate further, would be enough?    Is it likely that the Committee would be willing to see this as large enough   to put us in a good position and we’d just wait for confirmation of the outlook?  Are we even   close to that?    Thank you    I’ve been listening to this, and I’m sympathetic to the different ways we’d   like to try to characterize a path  I think it’s very difficult  “Ensure” is a strong word  I had   been thinking about maybe something weaker like, “We would expect to see the base grow,”   which is sort of an indicator of how we think things are going, but not the policy rule itself    Perhaps with a clause “conditional on stability in certain lending   facilities”    Thank you, Mr Chairman  As I said yesterday, I think that it’s important   that we do something big, so your combined proposal is closer to that for sure, and I definitely   think that we should diversify our actions  I’m a little concerned that we’re not going to have a   lot of good evidence on how effective these programs are for a few quarters  Maybe we’ll be   able to interpret something from how the yields move around, but they also move around a lot   anyway We like to take credit when they move in the right direction  And then other things   happen I don’t know—it’s very difficult The delays are  It takes time to implement, it takes        March 17–18, 2009 204 of 266  time to have an impact, and it takes time to assess  So as President Yellen indicated, we don’t   have enough confidence to bank on a single nontraditional channel, I prefer doing more of these   I am a little sympathetic both to the discussion about the usefulness of indicating   something about the timing and to the way that Presidents Plosser and Bullard characterized this   in terms of growth rates  What did seem to come out in the discussion that I, at least, was not   aware of, was how we intend to play these purchases out  There are good market reasons for the   way they’re done, and the markets understand that  So finding some way to provide that   information, I think, would be useful  I can see why the growth rate is attractive, but indicating   front-loading or something about the time element seems to be important   We do have an awful lot of programs in place that are intended to be stimulative  There’s   everything that we’ve done, with the TALF increasing, and there’s what the FDIC has done, with   the TLGP I don’t believe that we’ve seen anything in terms of the outlook for what the FDIC   part of this new program, with the Treasury purchasing bad bank assets, would be either, but   presumably that would be stimulative as well  By the time we put all of this in place, we’ve got   a lot that should be helping out  So the question I have is how to quantify what is enough  As   Governor Kohn mentioned, we should be doing everything we can do, so I think the combined   proposal is better Frankly, I don’t understand why we couldn’t improve this to $500 billion in   Treasuries, too We’re a little arbitrary, it seems to me, in terms of the total magnitude   I would like to be able to point to something like our Bluebook analysis—an analysis   where we think that this is as close as possible to our best model-based thinking, on what the   optimal policy response would be to reach the best we can achieve for the unemployment rate,   recognizing that there are outcomes we cannot achieve  The reason for wanting something like   this is, I would like it to be big enough now so that we can shift the hurdle for additional action at           March 17–18, 2009 205 of 266  the next meeting more toward “the outlook has now deteriorated further, and we need some type   of action” Because, at the next meeting, we’re still going to have calls for “What’s next?    What’s next?”  We know how to think about responding in terms of the fed funds rate and where   the target is, but the target for asset purchases is less clear, so that’s why my preference is for   more now so that we can shift that burden I’d be willing to expand the Treasury purchases to   $500 billion, but nobody else has indicated that   Finally, I think that we can spend an awful lot of time trying to get the wording exactly   right so that we’re all happy with it  I think it’s going to be incumbent upon all of us to make   some public comment  When we talk in public, some of these issues will come up, and I think   some of it will naturally be fleshed out if there are residual uncertainties  Obviously, when you   speak, Mr Chairman, you clarify things quite a bit, but there might be some things for the rest of   us to say Thank you    I guess I didn’t indicate that I do prefer alternative A the way it’s written    In terms of the next meeting, the alternative A′ issue could be dealt with by saying something   like “the Committee decided not to change its policies or its programs”   In order to shift the burden, I would like to consider whether there is some language such   that “with today’s action we anticipate” this better outcome in the last sentence  That would help   a little bit there, but it’s just a suggestion    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I have two questions, but first, I want to thank   the staff for a very careful, thorough investigation of the role of inflation expectations in the   simulations, and the simulations in general  I don’t think this is a very important issue for today,   but in terms of the modeling strategy, I was somewhat surprised about the way that you came out   in favor of the adaptive expectations for modeling medium- or long-term inflation expectations    Especially at a time when we’re concerned about the possibilities that our extraordinary   monetary expansions might make some people uncomfortable with the expectations, I thought   that you would at least have a channel in there that we could activate and see how that affects            April 28–29, 2009 44 of 201  things As I say, I don’t think it’s really very important for discussion today, but it will be as we   start going forward on that  I don’t know if you want to comment    Right I appreciate the effort, and I thought it was very well done, very   careful The second question, in terms of the Greenbook analysis—well, the forecast—is if you   could clarify a bit the way that you make assumptions about the credit environment  I know that   you have special factors during this period—you have the principal components from a few   different surveys—and I think that that’s very helpful  It’s not a surprise that I would favor   something like that  I guess the question is, coming through the bank stress test and if there are   concerns that the banks that are going to have to take the additional capital and they’re unhappy   about this and they’d like to get out from under it, it’s not quite clear to me that they will try to   lend a great deal on the basis of the additional capital  It’s sort of insurance against future losses   So we might be facing additional credit squeeze conditions  How important is that for this            April 28–29, 2009 45 of 201  Greenbook forecast?  How is it incorporated as a potential risk?  In thinking about the financial   factors, I know the forecast has exogenous and endogenous components as to how they’ll run   off, but I doubt that it incorporates that type of risk factor  Is that right?    But it does seems likely that, if there were a less-than-positive reaction   and the various spreads started to back up, we would see this in the indicators that you’re looking   at, and that would have a natural type of damping effect on the forecast  So some of it would be   accommodated, and then some would be more judgmental    Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Much as President Yellen said, I think the best   news today seems to be that, for once, the forecast has not deteriorated between FOMC   meetings  In fact, looking at, in the Greenbook, the evolution of the staff forecast, this is about   the only noticeable time that the forecast has improved in the past year  So thanks very much,   Dave and your staff, for that [Laughter]   President Bullard just made a number of very interesting and stimulating comments, and I   want to take just a slight exception I thought that the rap on FRB/US was a bit too tough on the   forecast As I understand it, it is really more the Greenbook  I agree with you that you have to   know what you are trying to use the model for—the question that is being asked  But I am hard-  pressed to think of any model that would predict well during this period  I think that these   models are helpful for verifying our intuition in a disciplined fashion in response to a number of   these issues You pointed out that the Mauskopf–Sim paper was useful, and that used FRB/US   as well So I just wanted to mention that   We have nudged up our forecast a bit, and there is not much distance between our   projections and the Greenbook The broad contours of that outlook seem consistent with what I        April 28–29, 2009 69 of 201  am hearing from my directors and other business contacts  They say that the pace of   deterioration is slowing and report that the most dire scenarios now seem less likely  Some of   them had been close to making some major structural cutbacks but are now postponing those   plans in the hope that they can be avoided completely   A couple of factors seem to underlie the modest improvement in the outlook of business   people One is that credit conditions are somewhat better  This is evident in the spreads and   other data that we looked at earlier—the Greenbook’s financial factors indexes—and in the   rebound in equity markets  Another factor is that, after all the cutting, the economy’s natural   cyclical adjustment process is finally becoming evident  Inventories have been slashed, and   although many firms say that they have more cutting to do, they are at least to the point where   they can imagine having stocks under control  After that, they will need to increase production   to keep up with demand  In addition, in sectors, such as housing, that have had the most excess   capacity, falling prices may be finally helping to stabilize demand     That said, the improvement in tone is a relative one  As President Bullard said, my   conversations with business people are still dominated by reports of further declines in activity   and extremely difficult business environments  Whereas previously they talked as if the bottom   was unimaginably far in the future, now they can see faint signs of its emergence  I suppose in   the Washington area this goes as green shoots  Perhaps in Minneapolis it is referred to as the   spring thaw In Chicago, the Cubs are playing baseball, and it won’t be long before they are   thinking about next year [Laughter]  Anyway, nobody seems to think the bottom is here yet    While businesses feel that the risk may be lower, many still feel as though they are in a battle for   survival, and they are acting accordingly  In our District, with autos and steel and heavily   weighted toward manufacturing, that seems to be the case     April 28–29, 2009 70 of 201  This all seems consistent with our forecast, which, like the Greenbook, projects further   declines in output this spring before fiscal stimulus and the change in inventory dynamics lead to   positive growth in the second half of the year  Absent another round of contracting credit   conditions, this is a reasonable expectation  I hope these forecasts rely on modest credit market   improvements and are not premised on outright rebounds in credit conditions  That seems less   likely, especially given the commentary from Dave Stockton in the question and answer period   I am not especially optimistic that the stress-test results and whatever public capital   injections they necessitate will boost appreciably the supply of bank lending  After all,   additional injections are insurance against higher possible losses  I worry that bankers will spend   more time trying to right-size their balance sheet in order to repay their TARP money, and this   has been mentioned by others as well  On the TALF, we are off to a slow start  There are fears   of further government-imposed restrictions  Clearly, this is a useful backstop for some impaired   ABS markets  It seems less likely to be a stimulus for robust expansion of aggregate demand,   but less of a headwind is a plus at this point   Our inflation forecast has not changed much  We have revised up 2009 a bit to reflect the   incoming data, but we continue to see core PCE inflation coming in at about 1¼ percent in 2010   and 2011 The risks to the inflation outlook have not changed and continue to be significant in   both directions, it seems  The large and persistent resource gaps justify some worry about more-  marked disinflation, but it is not possible to speak in public and avoid hearing that inflation and   inflation expectations are about to increase greatly because of the explosion of our balance sheet   and concerns about monetizing the rising government debt  Perceptions of previous episodes, in   which policy reversed course tentatively, slowly, and even late, haunt these critics; and issues   like the Orphanides gap are also a possible reason for that concern  Everyone has carefully        April 28–29, 2009 71 of 201  discussed the need for a prudent exit strategy to avoid these risks, and I appreciate all the   commentary about more discussion at our June meeting to look at our balance sheet and possible   exit strategies  So there is little more that we can do on this score at the moment, but   maintaining our current policy trajectory might help a bit, given the improved situation today    Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Brian, listening to your presentation and some   of the discussions yesterday, I am a little confused about the way the policy options are   presented I know there will be a discussion about the rate of purchases, but it does seem as   though the policies that we are implementing, as I was talking about with Vice Chairman Dudley   beforehand, have a cliff-like nature to them in the sense that we have a pace for purchases and   then we’re just going to stop under the current implementation by the Desk  The Desk, I   suppose, is charged with the responsibility of inferring a path that the Committee hasn’t really   specified, and it feels very incomplete  We are almost surely locking ourselves into a future   action in order to smooth that cliff-like purchase behavior, which we just haven’t discussed  I   am not saying that I disagree with any of that, but it feels different from the way we have always   talked about the funds rate policy in the past, when we could take an action and choose to not do   that the next time  There seem to be future ramifications from these actions  So do we leave it to   the Desk to infer how to implement the additional, say, $300 billion of Treasury purchases as   opposed to telling them that, in addition, there is a plan that, if this is the entire amount to be   done, it should tail off in some smooth fashion?    But we get all of that from your presentation    Thank you    Just to ask a question—would the Desk interpret alternative A as a greater   pace of purchases or just pushing it out to the end of the plan?    Would it be over the entire currently envisioned purchase time, or would   some of it be pushed beyond that?    I am just asking whether or not further clarification would be required    Well, I’m at a loss to understand how to interpret the market’s    expectation You talk to people in the markets quite a lot  During that conversation, do they                  April 28–29, 2009 126 of 201  understand this path better than everyone else?  I mean, we don’t communicate this in our   statement  I guess the question is, If in our own commentaries we go out in public, would you be   relatively indifferent toward our describing it?  We said we would do $300 billion, and I have   interpreted this that, as we get closer to $300 billion, we would smooth this down and finish up    That is how this reads It’s a $300 billion program  But others in the market have an expectation   that it’s going to go on to another $100 billion or something like that  What is the right amount   of information to communicate?    That dependence suggests a change in the path other than what we’re   currently expecting So as I think about this, there’s an outlook; there’s an option chosen  If the   outlook stays the same, then we’ve said $300 billion, and it could be closed down, not just a   recurrence    Thank you, Mr Chairman  At our last meeting, I favored the large-scale   asset purchase option that was offered to the Committee  In fact, I asked for a little more  The   reason was that I thought that we should get to the most appropriate policy and provide the   support to the economy and the outlook so that we could plausibly stand pat if the outlook   stabilized I thought we should get to the best feasible outcome that we could support, and so at   that time I understood $300 billion to be $300 billion unless the outlook or the markets changed        April 28–29, 2009 141 of 201  or something like that  Coming in, I thought that our action in March was close enough  We   also have the TALF expanding and other support  With those actions, I thought that this pushed   the burden for future policy actions to be based upon something in the outlook that was not   currently anticipated, and in fact, I think the current Greenbook outlook is pretty stable  It has   improved a bit and is consistent with this view   So I favor alternative B, which I interpret as no change in our policy If we decided that   we thought we could do more to improve the outcome and we wanted to do more, I think that we   should find the right level as quickly as possible today on the basis of what we know so that we   can stand pat I worry that meandering policy is not confidence inspiring  When we trigger a   policy action, it should be on the basis of something we have learned about how the economy is   evolving differently than we thought or there is actually news that normally would be interpreted   as requiring that type of action  I am just concerned about how the public is going to gauge our   policy changes in this most complicated environment   Lastly, I do think there is a difference between our large-scale asset purchases as a policy   instrument and our funds rate changes  It is not just future expectations of the fed funds rate    With the funds rate action, when we could do that, we could do it today or tomorrow  Markets   understood that to be implemented by the Desk, and we were in that environment  Markets had   more experience with that, and so they knew how to form expectations about policy, our   response function Now it’s more difficult when it’s unclear and there are reasons that it’s   unclear We don’t always agree exactly on how the transmission mechanism works in general   and especially now But with large-scale asset purchases, it takes up to six months for the action   to be implemented because it takes place over a period of time  We ourselves don’t really have   good expectations of how those programs might change, and the public is even more challenged        April 28–29, 2009 142 of 201  in that way The faster that we can get to the position that we think is best to support the best   outcome that is feasible, the better off we are  So I think that alternative B at the moment is the   right choice Thank you    I kind of like it, too    Well, I had a question that was related to Governor Kohn’s question on   this Do we have a particular attitude towards mark-to-market losses, that is, capital losses,   versus having our net income go to zero?  That was one of the more striking graphs, a very   extreme example  I would have thought that there would be an accounting entry that would   allow us to continue to fund whatever we needed to do, but the political issue seems to be an   important one  It would be well known along the way, so that people would see it coming, but   some of these tools would involve capital losses right away  Would that raise a similar red flag   in terms of our balance sheet?  Would we be worried about that?    My question was really Do any of the reserve management tools have   better attributes than others?                 June 23–24, 2009 50 of 261   We will lose money on them, though, right?  Because presumably the   interest rate we have to pay on the repo is going to be higher than the income that it’s earning    Yes, right, right    Thank you, Mr Chairman  First, I’d like to compliment everyone on the   new audio system, although it picks up the Blackberry noise pretty well, too  On the reserve   management tools, I’ve read your speeches and heard you describe them with quite a lot of   energy We’re looking at quite a number of tools, and yet I wonder how different they are in   terms of their ability to achieve what we want  What I have in mind is that the interest on   reserves tool by itself—especially with the elements that are designed to help the GSEs somehow   earn interest on their reserves—seems powerful enough, so that that should work  But what if,   for some reason, it doesn’t work?  Maybe somebody could describe the elements of the other   markets that we’re expecting to take advantage of that somehow would provide an independent   channel that would help out For example, would the reverse repo market really work very well   in an environment where the banks seem not to be arbitraging the interest on reserves?    As I was thinking about this, it seemed that one attractive feature is that   the money market mutual funds would be potential customers here      Okay So there’s no obvious reason to think that, when the banks are not   taking up these arbitrage opportunities, there’s some underlying feature that also would make the   money market mutual funds somehow reluctant?    Well, they’re not designed to  I’m just trying to think in terms of the risks   that we might face    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ll take the points in the sequence that you   mentioned   On Brian’s and the staff’s facility recommendations, although I long for the day when we   are comfortable with markets to the point of ending 13(3) authority, I’m not bothered by the              June 23–24, 2009 85 of 261  individual programs  I think they’re well put together, and I think the plan, as stated, is a good   one Frankly, I think markets will see the conditional statements in the release as indicating our   willingness to keep the 13(3) authority for a time  I wouldn’t think that they would think we’re   about to ramp it down, but we’ll see And I do think that ending 13(3) will be done   appropriately, it will be positive, it will be a boost, much like the SCAP   On the exit strategies and the reserve management tools, much as President Yellen   indicated, I tend to favor the tools that strengthen the interest on excess reserves mechanism, and   there are a number of those that, put together, should strengthen the arbitrage  Reverse RPs, I   think, are also a good tool If we’re looking to the money market funds as one source of   liquidity, that’s going to sort of alter the commercial paper market, since they’re a big source of   funding there And I just don’t know what the implications are  We’d want to understand   expected dysfunction in that market—as opposed to unexpected dysfunction—to see what we’d   be doing there But reverse RPs are quite good, I think   On the comment that we should try to project complete confidence in our ability to do   this, mostly I agree with that  My first reaction is that you’ve actually talked quite a lot about   exit strategies already And in your Q&A with the Congress, I’m not exactly sure how much of   what you intend to say will be new  Just your saying it is newsworthy of course  [Laughter] But   I’m not quite sure how that will play out  I was very struck by the extreme scenario on net   income which indicated that the balance sheet would be so large that we could find ourselves in a   situation where we are challenged by it—challenged in an optics sense, not in our ability to   create new reserves to pay and fund what we need to do  As we’ve learned through the   introduction of all of our facilities and in using our authorities, there is a risk to the institution at           June 23–24, 2009 86 of 261  some level that we should be mindful of  I should add that I think it is being handled very well   so far   Finally, on the large-scale asset purchases—and I’ll try to be true to not talking about   policy on this The Committee selected a number, for example, for Treasury purchases, of   $300 billion, and I thought that it would be implemented to that number  So if tapering effects   are important for a given time frame, then I would have envisioned going at X dollars per month   for a time, and then within the last one or two months tapering to half of that  That allows the   Committee to revisit it in a timely fashion to say, “Should we extend it?” as President Yellen   suggested, or it could be tapered on to $300 billion  But it would be a policy decision that the   Committee makes  I’ll leave it at that  Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Brian, I just wanted to ask you a question    Taking note of the extremely large range on the inflation forecast for core PCE, is this outside of   historical experience? I don’t mean the history of our projections—we haven’t been doing it that   long But have we seen this kind of range among professional forecasters, even taking note of   the fact that they might want to market their forecasts in a particular way because they’ve got   different jobs than we do?  It seems very large, and, frankly, it challenges your ability to listen to   all of the commentary around the room in an even-keeled way, it seems to me  Well, that’s my   reaction—speaking of shipping [Laughter]    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Over the past several weeks, my key concern   about the outlook has been whether the improvements in the forecast would be sustained  Were   the green shoots hardy enough to survive adverse weather?  The news I’m hearing from my   directors and other business contacts seems tentatively consistent with this improved forecast   now being on a somewhat more solid footing  Before the last meeting, my contacts reported that   activity was still declining, but that the pace of deterioration was slowing  Now, two months   later, they characterize this as a stabilization that is in train  I see these comments as being in   broad agreement with the Greenbook’s assessment of economic activity   My discussion with the US CEO of ArcelorMittal is a good summary of how things are   likely improving in a number of industrial segments  The parent company is the largest steel   producer in the world Last summer, steel prices peaked at over $1,000 a ton, and inventories   were relatively lean throughout the industry  As the recession intensified, inventories climbed   and prices fell Just recently, prices were down to $380 a ton, which, I’m told, just covered   variable costs Since late last year, the firm has cut production sharply and repeatedly  Today   their capacity utilization is about 40 percent, and they are running only two of their nine blast   furnace facilities During this period, steel service centers, which compete by buying steel and   distributing from inventories, have been running down their stocks  About three weeks ago, their   de-stocking process seemed to end, and prices have risen modestly, by about $20 a ton    Currently Mittal sees production, shipments, and inventories all stabilizing  Looking to the   summer, their order books for July are full, and they’re now deciding whether to fire up a third   blast furnace in the middle of July for August production and delivery  To justify this increase to   55 percent capacity, they need sustainable future orders—today’s report seems helpful,        June 23–24, 2009 126 of 261  perhaps—not just the end of de-stocking  Making this judgment about sustainability is difficult,   in part because Mittal’s chief customers today are the non-bankrupt auto companies and other   durable goods producers whose order flow can be chunky  So if GM and Chrysler improve, that   would further support production decisions like this   I’ve heard stories similar to Mittal’s from other contacts  For example, a large,   diversified tool and parts manufacturer said that some of its major customers have completed   their de-stocking cycles, although they have not yet relayed plans to begin rebuilding inventory   levels, so it’s not showing up in higher production yet  In addition, the continued restructuring   process at Chrysler and GM is a positive factor for manufacturing output and particularly in our   District These reports seem consistent with our forecast of slow to modest GDP growth in the   second half of 2009 Still, few businesses are reporting increasing activity, and the decision to   raise production will be a close call for many firms for some time   Another important element solidifying the outlook is the improvement in credit   conditions Clearly, conditions continue to be challenging  Many businesses report that lines of   credit are being reduced and borrowing rates are being adjusted upwards  But even businesses   who say that access to credit is still a problem acknowledge that conditions are not as restrictive   as they were a couple of months ago High-quality firms have found that debt and equity   markets have become quite receptive to new issuances, and the TALF appears to have been both   directly and indirectly beneficial for credit markets, according to participants whom I have talked   to   On the inflation front, I have been somewhat surprised that there has not been more   downward momentum so far  As the Greenbook points out, inflation expectations have not   moved down as expected I did ask my staff to investigate quantitatively what the size of a labor        June 23–24, 2009 127 of 261  reallocation story might be for the natural rate of unemployment  There’s a member of my staff   who has some papers on reallocation, sort of a David Lilien-style measure of dispersion and how   that translates into higher NAIRUs, and she updated that unobserved components model  The   bottom line is that you can get the natural rate to move upwards of about 6 percent, but it’s really   hard to get much more out of that  Even if you went as far as 7 percent, which the data do not   indicate, that’s still quite a large resource gap   I continue to hear a great deal of concern that our expansive provision of liquidity,   large-scale asset purchases, and future federal deficits pose medium- and longer-term risks on the   inflation front I know we can deal with these issues in a variety of ways, as we discussed   yesterday However, many of these programs do have exit costs that are somewhat larger than I   previously thought   Our forecast continues to assume that resource slack and contained inflation expectations   will result in a decline in inflation over the projection period  I do thank Dave for his   clarification this morning  Frankly, I think he was more right than not  I didn’t realize, looking   at the distribution, that there’s a cherry-picking to this—if you take out just the high and just the   low, the range is about ½ to 2 percent  So I think that’s closer to inside the 70 percent  We’re   not expecting as large a decline as is in the Greenbook  We’re looking for core PCE inflation to   be closer to 1½ percent in 2010   Finally, from our January–March meetings to today, there has been a marked reduction in   uncertainty and downside economic risks as I see it, especially downside skews  In March the   abyss scenario weighed heavily on my list of concerns  So I favored what I will refer to as a   robust control approach to policymaking, specifically  Try many programs in substantial size;   give strong credence to their possible success in spite of their uncertain impacts; and hope that           June 23–24, 2009 128 of 261  some or all would provide needed accommodation Of course, we’re not out of the woods yet,   but the likelihood of the abyss scenario has declined notably  In addition, I’ve been surprised by   the reduction in disinflationary risks So to my mind, these are very important developments    They lead me to put less weight on this robust control approach and move more towards the   conventional weighing of the expected effectiveness and cost of these programs, and I do find   myself moving back towards more balanced assessments of the necessary magnitudes for various   nontraditional policies  Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I took some comfort from our discussion   yesterday on reserve management tools, although we had discussions about these before  It does   seem as if these tools are likely to be enough to allow tightening when we need it   Previously I would have thought that we would have to grapple with the problem of   getting our balance sheet in better shape and that markets would see that coming well before we   ever got to a positive federal funds rate  So I guess I’m more persuaded—although the continued   staff analysis will be helpful on this—that it’s likely to be more contemporaneous; that is, when   we decide that we need to tighten, we can bring these tools to bear quickly and may not have to   signal very much in advance I think that’s very helpful, because part of what we’re grappling   with right now is how to position ourselves for doing the tightening a few meetings or several   meetings into the future  I don’t have a firm opinion really on when it’s likely to be the case that   we’ll need to tighten I think it’s pretty far in the future, 2010 maybe     On the large-scale asset purchases, I guess I prefer leaving them the way they are, given   the improvement in the economy  If at the next meeting we think it’s going to be important to        June 23–24, 2009 178 of 261  communicate about a tapering-off strategy—if we are worried about the cliff—I think we   probably need to decide now about how to communicate that  If we wait, then the cliff is going   to be that much closer, and you’re not really going to be able to do this with the existing size So   if you want to maintain the existing size, I think you would need to do that soon, like today   probably But it’s not in the statement   On the inflation forecast, it does seem to me that there’s a pretty wide dispersion of   forecasts for core PCE in 2011, which is not that far away—so the dispersion is a bit unusual  If   you take out the high and the low, then it’s ½ to 2 percent  I hope that the minutes will reflect   this diversity of opinion in a slightly robust fashion, because that debate is taking place out in the   public We all go out and face very difficult questions, and even though we might feel pretty   confident about our outlook for inflation, this dispersion of views is sort of a reality check as to   how we deal with that On inflation forecasts, it does seem like there is substantial resource   slack now It has been a very deep contraction, and so my own forecast is relatively low  Even   if you allow for differences of NAIRUs, it’s a big amount of slack   But there are risks, and we know the theory says that inflation expectations can “take   off” That would be a key element in inflation determination and our forecast  Events somewhat   beyond our control—fiscal pressures and how they are dealt with in the large number of   programs that are coming down the pike, as President Fisher reminded us—and our balance   sheet size are adding to this risk I think what we’ve been doing is appropriate, but it does add to   the risk So I think a lot of it comes down to how much confidence we have in a particular   forecast, and some people are inclined to write a larger number for 2011, and others are inclined   to write down a much smaller number  I kind of prefer to take the middle course, but in this   particular bimodal situation, these opposing forces are difficult  So normally in a situation like           June 23–24, 2009 179 of 261  this, we can fall back on timing  We don’t have to do this today, and in the worst case, we’re   several meetings before the pressure erupts, and, Mr Chairman, you will be providing testimony   soon in your Monetary Policy Report, and that would be a natural way to communicate that  But   it does seem as though these issues have been out there, you’ve been out front in talking about   them  So I just don’t know exactly what the likely impact is going to be from delivering that   message again   So even though the bimodal beliefs are quite different, I prefer the middle course, and so   I do prefer alternative B On the particular issues for the statement, I’m not bothered by the   bracketed statement at the end  I guess if I were going to make the best case, it is that it seems   accurate that we will continue to take careful account of this  We’ve got the reserve   management tools  We’ve just had a meeting where we talked an awful lot about it  So it’s not   inappropriate to raise this now The Chairman and others have talked about exactly this issue,   and probably have used words very similar to this  We say it in public  So what does it mean if   we don’t say it here in the statement but we say it in public?  Well, we can always ask that   question because that’s not an uncommon type of omission  It does seem as if the language in   the second paragraph gets at this middle ground for inflation, because we took out the part saying   something like “inflation could be uncomfortably low,” or whatever the language was indicating   that it could be suboptimal  So I’m comfortable with alternative B    The entire sentence?                 June 23–24, 2009 200 of 261   Thank you, Mr Chairman  I have a broad question that was stimulated by   Brian’s discussion of the improvement in market functioning  I wonder, Brian, if you could just   offer more of a summary opinion on how much better things are in financial markets  How far   are we toward sustainable improvement?  You talked about the end of the government programs               August 11–12, 2009 16 of 165  The Greenbook, as near as I can tell, still has the special financial factor add-ons to that, and I’m   just ultimately going to wonder where we are with that  It’s a little awkward because the   Governors have the responsibility for assessing 13(3) conditions, and yet things feel markedly   different from March 2008 or September 2008 Here we are in August 2009  We have moved   from general market dysfunction to something now that is better, and there is actually some   market differentiation, where some markets are doing substantially better than others  They’re   discriminating—whether or not it is appropriate is the question  So any additional color you   could offer on that would be helpful to me    Thank you, Mr Chairman  A quick question  Brian, in your charts it says   that the TALF is projected to go to $155 billion by the end of next year  Does that include this   extension?  That’s a projection with whatever we are expecting would come from this?    Okay Thank you    Thank you, Mr Chairman  The incoming data have been encouraging   though a bit bumpy  On balance, although the developments over the past several weeks left my   medium-term outlook essentially unchanged, they did give me more confidence  In my view,   this reduced uncertainty strengthens the case for a wait-and-see approach to policy  The reports        August 11–12, 2009 60 of 165  from my directors and business contacts support the improving tenor of recent data releases    Business activity is plausibly stabilizing, albeit at very low levels; and in some sectors where the   contractions have been on a horrific scale, we have even seen a bit of a bounceback     Most of these turnaround cases are in auto-related manufacturing  Arcelor-Mittal Steel is   following through on my earlier report of increasing its online capacity this summer  This   reflects both an auto-related rebound in production and the completion of an inventory-  adjustment cycle at steel service centers  Accordingly, steel prices have moved up off very low   levels And a large-scale manufacturer of relatively small auto parts said that his order flow has   picked up and that the new rate is consistent with the higher level of production currently   scheduled by the OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) for the third quarter  I spoke with   Ford about the effect of the cash-for-clunkers program  They had an interesting story about   which future sales were being stolen by the program  A substantial segment of the clunker trade-  ins have been well-maintained SUVs that are about ten years old and whose owners have good   FICO scores, above 650 This leads Ford to think that, without the program, these people would   have driven their clunkers for another couple of years  So perhaps we are stealing sales from   2010 or beyond, not just the fourth quarter But GM suggested that the payback would be   sooner Also, any uncertain extensions of this program could freeze potential buyers, and so they   seem to indicate that it was very important to have a certain date to this program to fix   everybody’s attention Nevertheless, both Ford and GM suggested that there would be a small   upward adjustment to their current third-quarter plans and then further output increases in the   fourth, and apparently Chrysler news reports are similar to this   Moving to broader economy-wide conditions, labor markets seem to be stabilizing    Obviously, last month’s pause in the unemployment rate’s inevitable continued rise is a welcome                    August 11–12, 2009 61 of 165  sign that moderating forces may be gaining some traction  But labor markets are still weak, and   the predominant view among my business contacts is that companies’ current plans are to   strongly resist rehiring many of their laid-off workers when demand eventually does pick up    They would see anything more than minimal rehiring as undoing the difficult and productive   labor cost-cutting that they had done during the recession  Now, there are reasons to be skeptical   of this talk They probably say it in every cycle, and they have been very aggressive in cutting   employment this time  Still, it does suggest that the unemployment rate could remain stubbornly   high well into the recovery stage of this cycle   With regard to financial conditions, our market contacts say that the extreme tail risks   have dissipated and that this is reflected in more-normal spreads and lending relationships  The   Chicago Mercantile Exchange reported that market depth in euro, dollar, and Treasury futures   has returned to pre-Lehman levels  I did hear that the legacy CMBS TALF has contributed to a   dramatic improvement in liquidity in commercial real estate credit markets  Still, the   fundamentals underlying commercial real estate markets are poor  A number of my contacts   think that many properties are overvalued and that prices are headed for a further fall   Summing up all of the developments, our near-term outlook for growth is a little more   optimistic than the Greenbook’s, but our projections for next year are about the same  As I noted   earlier, my uncertainty over the economic outlook is a bit less than it was at our last meeting   I can’t say the same about my uncertainty over the inflation forecast, and this is perhaps   the most difficult and confusing period we can imagine  Clearly, resource gaps will be an   important factor restraining inflation over the immediate projection period and beyond  I hear   this rationale for disinflationary pressures from many of my business contacts, particularly with   regard to respective labor costs  But many of these very same contacts, and much of the more        August 11–12, 2009 62 of 165  general public, can easily visualize potential inflation pressures coming from the enormous   current growth in narrow money and huge future fiscal deficits  And measures of inflation   expectations have not moved down appreciably with the greater awareness of this coming   resource slack So that is a little surprising to me  Our task as prudent central bankers is to   assure them that we will do what it takes to achieve our price stability goals  And yes,   everybody is doing that But I think we are unlikely to see much relief from this educational   burden for some time to come  We are going to need to talk about this a lot more before we   actually change monetary policy appreciably, I would guess   Despite the risks on both sides, I continue to have a middle ground inflation forecast  By   “middle ground” I mean that I see an uncomfortable balance between these disinflationary forces   from large resource slack and inflation expectations that give notable weight to the large growth   in our balance sheet and concerns that we may be reluctant to make a timely exit from our   programs  This leaves me with a forecast that calls for core PCE inflation to remain near its   current 1½ percent pace over the next couple of years  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I favor a continued wait-and-see approach,   which I think is best captured roughly by alternative B, the revised version  I would make some   observations The modest recovery in GDP is in progress, and the expected peak in the   unemployment rate is six or more months away  The Greenbook and Bluebook measures of our   policy stance suggest to me that they are near policy accommodation stances that close the   resource gaps within three years I know we could hope to do better, but I think we pushed our   nontraditional policies pretty far, and the remaining fruit is hanging pretty high  I agree with   President Stern when he says that sometimes there is just not a lot more that you can do or that   you should consider doing   I interpret the prospective resource slack that we are facing to be large, and this is going   to restrain inflationary influences from economic improvements and low policy rates  I thought   Governor Kohn did an excellent job of discussing the inflation prospects and walking us through   inflation expectations and the resource gap and how they are interacting or how we have to take   account of those It does appear that inflation expectations have remained higher than one might   have expected with this slack That has been important, I think, for the evolution of inflation   That said, we are in uncharted territory with respect to the enormous expansion of our   balance sheet and the public’s reaction to this, and so liquidity growth and historic-sized fiscal   deficits as far as the eye can see are going to present a challenge at least from the public’s   expectations The narrow measures of money that we would look to as very troubling are not yet           August 11–12, 2009 135 of 165  in the broader measures, and I think that that is an important part of what we would be paying   attention to if we saw large inflationary expectations     For me, our current setting of policy seems appropriately accommodative to balance   these risks  Let’s be patient and monitor the situation more  Until something breaks one way or   the other, I would expect this type of policy outcome  When the situation clarifies, we should   make the appropriate judgments  It could be that the downside risk appears and it is quite bad   and we need to do something or the other way around  I do not see the need to signal an   alternative B about future programs     So alternative B, the revised version  I didn’t see the tremendous value in mentioning   tapering off for Treasuries, given the deep market that we have, but that doesn’t seem to be   expressed by others So I am fine with that    Brian, my question is just out of curiosity about something I’ve heard you   say a couple of times  Why do dealers have different opinions on the Fed’s likely   follow-through on our purchases of agency MBS versus the agency debt?  I have read        September 22–23, 2009 11 of 212  commentaries and we’ve taken questions on whether or not we’ll follow through on MBS, but I   haven’t heard the same about the agency debt       Thank you, Mr Chairman  I have two questions  The first is for Bill and the   second one is either for Bill or maybe for Brian Sack  When you presented the simulation results, I had   been conflicted in reading the memo and responding to the fact that the banks were saying, “We’ve got   these excess reserves  We’re really not intending to lend them out”  You did the simulation—I guess   that’s kind of natural to look at the implications of lower short-term rates, and that would presumably be   more accommodative  But I’m wondering if you learn something else from the survey—that there might   be added dysfunction in the lending channel if the banks aren’t looking to lend out excess reserves that   they currently have available to them  Did we learn more about their lack of intention to stimulate the   economy through more lending, or is it pretty much the way we had thought about it before?   And that led me to think about the second question Earlier in the year, we talked a pretty good   amount, I thought, in terms of market segmentation and how effective our various programs would be   depending on how clogged up markets were  Arbitrage kind of disperses funds that we would put into the   financial system, but when it’s more segmented, we have a larger effect  So I guess I’m back to the MBS   question Do you think that that program is more effective in a price sense?  Do we have more segments?   I don’t think we have more segmentation  Do we have less segmentation?  Regarding the rate effects that   we might have estimated early on, would they be smaller now because these are more dispersed?  I think   that’s what President Lacker was trying to get at with Treasuries, but I’m not exactly sure   And then there’s the next part of this question, which you can answer either today or later  Do we   have an idea of what an estimate of the MBS rates will be when we’re done with the LSAP programs if it                                  September 22–23, 2009 38 of 212  were the full $1¼ trillion tapered at the end of the first quarter, and if we did what President Hoenig   suggested, only $1 trillion tapered to the end of the fourth quarter?  What would those rates look like at   the end of the first quarter?  I’m not sure I understand the different implications, or at least our thinking   on that     And the interest rate cut in the model analysis already takes into account some   impediment from the normal type of lending?     Okay Thank you  Do we have an idea about market segmentation?     Well, I was thinking about it differently  You can do the MBS You can do the   Treasuries If they’re segmented, they’re different  If there’s no segmentation, there’s going to be some   arbitrage across the different markets, so it almost doesn’t matter where you dump those funds     But in March we were stymied by the segmentation, I thought  We thought it was   really big, and now things seem different  So I would guess that the estimated effect would be smaller    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Dave, this is probably more of an observation   than a question The alternative scenarios often present very interesting possibilities, and two   that caught my eye this time were, one, the earlier liftoff and, two, greater disinflation  These are   diametrically opposed  On the one hand, early liftoff has the inflation rate going to 28 percent in   2013, whereas greater disinflation has it at 0 percent during that time frame  Looking at the   confidence intervals, they’re both outside of 90 percent during those time periods, so I take it you   don’t see either of those as particularly likely  But I guess the question is  When can we know   that we can take one of these off the table? What type of explanation would you be looking for   there?    Okay Thanks Very well done    Thank you, Mr Chairman  My forecast has not changed materially  I   guess we were a little ahead of the Greenbook  We are still looking for GDP growth to average   about 3 percent over the next six quarters and then pick up to a pace more noticeably above   potential in 2011 Virtually all of my directors and business contacts reported continued   improvement and modest firming of recent positive developments  Clearly, the evidence that the   recovery is underway is getting stronger each month  But many contacts also offered another   more guarded flavor of commentary, probably along the lines of what President Fisher said    Now that the fear of a truly awful outcome has receded, businesses are increasingly coming to   grips with the realization that, even though recovery is under way, it’s likely to be a slow one,   with the unemployment rate remaining high for some time  The weak labor market will weigh   on their customers’ confidence, businesses’ planning, and the strength and momentum of near-  term expansion  This guardedness is a natural reaction to events  By itself, I don’t think it’s an   independent cause for concern, but it’s something to be mindful of   I will just touch quickly on some of the high points from my economic reports  Inventory   restocking is clearly under way and is boosting production  The implications for hiring are   mixed  The business segments that were hardest hit cut employment most deeply, and now we   are bringing back some workers as they increase utilization  But most others who cut less deeply   are not hiring yet  Many business contacts stated that the recovery’s momentum will be most   uncertain in the first half of 2010 following the inventory restocking  Reports of improvements   in financial and credit conditions were widespread  Several contacts involved in commercial real   estate markets even reported substantial progress  All in all, my discussions seemed consistent   with an economy expected to grow for 18 months at a pace of about 3 percent  This tepid growth              September 22–23, 2009 93 of 212  is from the bottom of a very deep recession and leaves the unemployment rate remaining above 9   percent during this phase of the recovery   While there does not seem to be much disagreement over this outlook for the economy, I   continue to be surprised by the lack of agreement over the implications of the resulting measures   of resource slack for inflation So let’s see what I can add here  I think I understand the   arguments implicit in last week’s communications from Presidents Plosser and Lacker on the   Bluebook policy alternatives, as well as some public commentary about resource slack  These   arguments I think of roughly like this  First, theory says inflation is a monetary phenomenon  I   think we all agree with that Second, resource slack has tenuous and arguable implications for   inflation and is measured with great uncertainty  And, finally, many economists reject resource   slack implications because of these concerns   But it’s an enormous leap to ignore entirely all measures of resource slack  Output gaps   are not unique in being unobservable and difficult to measure  Inflation expectations are very   important and are equally unobservable, heterogeneous, and the measures often are in conflict    Just look at variations in liquidity in the TIPS markets for the compensation measures that we   look at If you look carefully at the Michigan survey and think about how the survey participants   respond, there are biases, the data are censored and massaged quite a lot—we know we can’t get   the levels of inflation expectations right, either  As I looked at inflation expectations data in Part   2 of the Greenbook, the Survey of Professional Forecasters had 22 percent for ten years ahead,   Michigan had 29, the TIPS at the five-year five-year had 29  And these are all greater than our   implicit target of 2 percent, but when I look at the charts they have been there for quite some   time  So getting the levels is really tough, and looking at changes in inflation expectations is a   bit of a dodge in the same way that we take the resource slack as given when we look at it           September 22–23, 2009 94 of 212  Now, of course, the signal-to-noise ratios on our measures of resource slack are normally   low; that is, noise is large  But currently all measures of slack are pointing in the same direction   with large magnitudes The unemployment rate is just about 10 percent, so the signal-to-noise   ratio is much better right now  Just as importantly, I think that without the idea of substantial   resource slack, it’s hard to understand what has been happening to inflation and inflation   expectations Hypothetically, if the economy’s need for structural adjustments explains all or   most of the drop in employment and output, then why aren’t inflation expectations very high and   rising?  In that scenario, the enormous growth in the monetary base would mean monetary policy   is extraordinarily accommodative     So something else must be keeping inflation expectations reasonably stable, another   unobservable factor Is our credibility particularly high today?  Our legion of critics doesn’t   believe that And if I believed that resource slack was minimal, and then looked at our balance   sheet, I wouldn’t think so either Although I’m surprised that inflation expectations haven’t   fallen more, I strongly suspect the reason that they have stayed moderate in the face of massive   monetary easing is that the public sees equally massive amounts of resource slack and expects   that slack to eliminate most price pressures   I share in calls for additional language and metrics to express the FOMC’s markers on   inflation pressures  I think that those comments are right on target  Such additional conditions   would help guide us and communicate to the public our ability and resolve to keep inflation and   inflation expectations well behaved  But currently I don’t have any hesitation in including   resource slack in this list of markers  It makes it tougher going back to my alma mater and   talking to my advisors, but—[laughter]   That’s it Thank you        September 22–23, 2009 95 of 212   Thank you, Mr Chairman  I favor alternative B  It seems that this is the   most disparate set of commentary I’ve heard on policy alternatives  It’s a very interesting   meeting, and I hope I can add to that spirit  [Laughter] The economy is beginning the recovery   phase I think the risk profile is better—it’s more balanced  That doesn’t change the fact that it’s   not a very desirable path, as many have pointed out; the unemployment rate is going to remain   high for quite some time  In terms of the inflation outlook, it seems to me that we’re going to be   undershooting our implicit objective, in that we’re likely to stay below, I would say, a   1½ percent inflation rate for some period of time  There is a wide range of risk, as we have said,   and, as President Yellen mentioned, by some estimates of the TIPS inflation compensation   markets, compensation’s up, and that must mean that the variability in inflation is up, higher or   lower I find that quite interesting   Mr Chairman, I agree with you that, viewing the balance of the social costs that we are   facing, those costs seem a little towards the downside  With that in mind, looking at   paragraph 1, my reaction was different from President Plosser’s and more like Governor Kohn’s           September 22–23, 2009 163 of 212  regarding the phrase, “a gradual return to higher levels of resource utilization in a context of   price stability” This seems to me the only place where we can possibly point out that the   unemployment rate will remain high over some period of time  The only other reference to job   loss is with respect to its influence on consumption  We could change “resource utilization” to   something more like “the unemployment rate will gradually decline,” but I’m not anticipating   many people would prefer that type of language  And I view the phrase “in a context of price   stability,” as consistent with the observation that inflation is going to remain below 2 percent for   a couple of years We can disagree on that, but that’s how I view that sentence, so I found it to   be quite good   In terms of policy, I think we’re responding appropriately according to the circumstances    Monetary policy is accommodative  The federal funds rate is about zero, we’ve got our large-  scale asset purchase programs, and there’s no real expectation that the funds rate is going to rise   in the foreseeable future—nine to twelve months, maybe it will be longer  I’m sympathetic to   the arguments that the current path of the recovery is highly undesirable—we’d like a lower   unemployment rate  But I just think that there are limits to our policy effectiveness  I think I am   different from many of the views expressed here  Given the limitations I see in our effectiveness   at this point, I think we’re at a pretty good position, and I don’t think that we can really do that   much more   So I favor alternative B Having heard some of the comments that you made, Mr   Chairman, and that the Vice Chairman made on our exit tools, at the end of the day, I do trust   that our exit tools are going to be sufficient to allow us to embark upon a more restrictive policy   when we deem that appropriate  If we can sell our assets, I think that will work if interest on   reserves doesn’t work        September 22–23, 2009 164 of 212  In terms of MBS, here’s where I’ll be different  I prefer a definitive choice today  I just   don’t see any benefit to postponing what strikes me as the inevitable purchase of $1¼ trillion   after listening to everybody around the table  I would be aghast if we found a way not to do   $1¼ trillion Why not recognize that now, inject a little more certainty into markets on that   score?  I think that, if we leave it open, we are going to struggle with this issue later in terms of   the rate effect We don’t fully appreciate why MBS yields are lower  Is it the stock effect, or is   it the flow effect?  Well, there’s an unfortunate aspect to putting a lot of weight on the flow   effect—as Brian at one point said, maybe it’s 50–50  If it’s 50–50, then, when we are done,   those rates will go back up, because the flow will no longer be there  If we have to look higher   rates in the eye in the first quarter of next year, I think we’re going to be wringing our hands over   it Now, maybe that’s the right thing  I don’t have a problem with being definitive now and then   saying that circumstances are such that we need to apply more accommodation  We did that all   the time with the funds rate, and I just don’t think that these policies ought to be that different    So I would prefer a more definitive choice  Because of that, I guess I’ll make it five and five—I   would take out the “up to” We’ll see how that goes  I would like to complete it as soon as   possible—in the first quarter, and I wouldn’t mind the middle of the first quarter—but that’s a   minority view, I’m sure  I thought that President Plosser’s suggestion on moving the inflation   expectations ahead of resource slack was perfectly acceptable, if there was any appetite for that    Thanks, Mr Chairman    Can I ask just one question?    By using the word “execute” in the same sentence, we’re going to refer to   “executed” for the MBS but “completed” for Treasuries  Any—    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Much as I indicated in our last meeting, the   incoming data and reports from my business contacts continue to reflect an economy that is in   the early stages of a modest recovery from a deep recession  Business activity is expanding, and   we expect that GDP growth will average 3 to 3½ percent over the next year or so  However, my   contacts are expressing a good deal of uncertainty regarding sales and order flows in the first half   of 2010, once the current inventory cycle has largely run its course  In fact, although this is a   swag to me, their reports feel more as though they expect a 2 percent growth rate than my own   2010 projection of 3½ percent   On the positive side, businesses are certainly positioned to accelerate production when   demand finally does improve, as it inevitably will  All industrial segments currently have more   than enough capacity in place to meet their near-term expected sales and order flows  But like   President Fisher, I heard too much commentary from my contacts suggesting that a lack of   sustainable orders and sales developments could spark another wave of cutbacks, and I suppose   your reports actually had those cutbacks in train  This seems like a serious threat  The positive   third-quarter nonfinancial earnings reports were built on cost reductions, not revenue expansions    If fourth-quarter revenue growth continues to be modest, I suspect there is a real possibility of   businesses attempting a repeat of the third quarter  For me, the odds seem tilted toward further   risk aversion on the part of businesses in the first half of 2010   The financial landscape surrounding bank credit also continues to be a headwind for the   outlook This is not a large issue for large, high-quality firms with direct access to capital     November 3–4, 2009 83 of 201  markets  They are able to obtain funding at spreads they consider to be closer to normal  But   small and medium-sized companies that rely on bank credit continue to complain about onerous   terms and an inadequate supply of borrowing options  Have you gone out and spoken to your   local businesses and community bankers lately?  Community and regional bankers respond that   borrowers’ credit quality is substantially worse than these businesses acknowledge, but they also   say that the only way they can improve their capital ratios today is to shrink their assets, much as   President Lacker was talking about Bottom line, there continues to be a modest credit crunch   for small and medium-sized businesses     With regard to inflation, my outlook is unchanged from our last meeting  I continue to   expect that core inflation will be flat to down a bit in 2010–11 but then move up to about   1¾ percent by 2012 As I discussed at length last time, substantial resource slack remains, and I   suppose we will talk more about that at the December meeting, as I understand that agenda    Inflation expectations, as best I can judge, appear to be stable  Longer-dated measures of   expectations derived from surveys, SPF forecasts for the TIPS market continue to run in their   typical ranges, and the stability of these measures stands in contrast to strong countervailing   forces For me, the risk of an outsized medium-term increase in inflation seems small, especially   an increase that threatens price stability  After all, core inflation is running currently well below   my 2 percent guideline for price stability, and the medium-term prospects are for more of the   same  Of course, we will need to listen intently for changing fundamentals that may alter these   risk assessments  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Mr Chairman?    Just so I can understand this a little more clearly, where do the money   market mutual funds enter into that prioritization?  That seems to be where a large pool of funds   might come from    I agree Thank you    Thank you It’s a small question  I am probably parsing this too closely,   but the words that you gave us—in alternative A, you refer to “this exceptionally low range for   the federal funds rate for an extended period,” and, in B, “exceptionally low levels    for an   extended period” My inference on this would be that B accepts the possibility that this might be   a higher funds rate than 0 to ¼, since it is not this exceptionally low I wouldn’t have interpreted   B that way, but—am I parsing too much?    I would guess that the Committee’s interpretation of B is this 0 to ¼ range   for an exceptional period of time  Okay Thanks    Yes, it does It is something only we would recognize as a difference,   because we see A and B [Laughter]    Well, it’s in red    Thank you, Mr Chairman  You know, in the old days it wasn’t uncommon   at this point for the Committee members to begin to say, “I agree with the Chairman,” and have a   pretty quick commentary But since you don’t do it that way, I’ll just say that today I agree with   President Yellen and Governor Kohn  The unemployment rate is headed toward 10 percent or   above Inflation by my forecast is well under-running my inflation guideline of 2 percent  For me   this suggests a low likelihood of a policy switch for some time  Frankly, any tightening of the fed   funds rate, for lack of a better policy tool, before June 2010 seems unlikely to me  It’s not a zero   probability  It seems small  Maybe it will be later, as Governor Kohn said  I personally find it very   difficult to say that, but it could be true  And this is my view of appropriate policy, by the way, not   just a prediction of what the Committee will do  It is a state-contingent viewpoint, and it’s not a   promise   In terms of the statement language, I think that the statement should provide an accurate   description of how we view the risks and the policy markers  I think the list is good  President              November 3–4, 2009 157 of 201  Lacker suggested “very low” resource utilization  That could be okay  Some other possibilities are   “unusually low,” “exceptionally low,” “notably low,” and “historically low”  If the unemployment   rate goes to 8 percent, it’s still going to be pretty low real resource utilization  So I don’t really   think that that has a shocking implication for how policy would change   But that said, our statement is only one form of communication  You do testimony  Others   do that We have speeches  And small changes in language generate phone calls from a number of   people who used to be on the Board asking, “What does this mean in terms of exceptionally low or   just low or something like that?”  So there are a lot of different ways that we communicate  I think   that the statement should be descriptive  I don’t think it should necessarily be proscriptive or even   prescriptive  If the events and the risks change and change quickly, policy can change   In summary, Mr Chairman, I think that policy is likely to stay— at low rates for an   extended period  I agree with alternative B    I’m having a hard time appreciating in some precise way what we mean   by the risk in terms of this language  I understand that markets react to every change that we   make, and then sometimes the reaction is undone  Sometimes it changes things  But I am of the   opinion that, when we have a pretty good approach to monetary policy, we are pretty forthright   in describing what we are doing Markets somehow figure out what we are doing, and these are   well within the lines in terms of those types of changes    Then, you go out and somebody talks and somebody really important   talks and it gets clarified  When people rely extraordinarily on the statement, then we begin to   feel locked in    Thank you Brian, actually you began to answer my question on the   primary dealers  I realize, after listening to and seeing presentations like this, I didn’t really   know who the survey respondents were  Is it really bank economists?  I thought this was more   financial market participants  I guess the question is  If it is bank economists, is it really that   different from, say, the Blue Chip or NABE or something like that?    Do you have any idea if it’s consistent from time to time, or do they mix it   up?    Something about President Plosser’s question made me think about   stigma  Jim, you mentioned this, too  If you were a bank, and you had these term deposits, and   then something happened and you went to the window—which is just a normal type of thing—                          December 15–16, 2009 40 of 247  would you be worried? In the old days, if we were worried about arbitrage, then the supervisor   would make a phone call  It seems that we would have to be very clear in mentioning that it   would still be okay to access the window under the right conditions, and that you wouldn’t get a   call from the supervisor  Or, if they’re worried about that, then they might just not bid on the   term deposits, and it doesn’t amount to anything  It might be a little tricky    Right That’s why it’s okay Of course, they still don’t borrow  At some   point, Jim mentioned that stigma is our friend—I wrote that down—or at least that it could help   us with something But we think that stigma will make this arbitrage go away  It’s just   something to think about    Thank you, Mr Chairman  Once again, my outlook and business reports   have not changed very much over the intermeeting period  Most of my contacts currently are   seeing continued modest improvement in their businesses, but firms continue to be nervous about   prospects for the first half of 2010, and they’re not making major new commitments right now    That said, some are in the process of making marginal adjustments  The temp firms said that   they have now had three months of decent gains in orders, mostly for low-wage, light-industrial   workers Typically this is the first segment of their business to come back after a recession, and   there were scattered reports from other contacts about some modest rehiring, though it is too   early to see how meaningful these might be  Largely, it is the biggest cutters of employment that   are rehiring right now On balance, most reports indicate that businesses have largely completed   the employment and capacity reductions associated with right-sizing their operations for what           December 15–16, 2009 65 of 247  they expect, and when signals point more clearly to a sustainable upturn in the economy, they   appear ready to make more definite commitments to ramp up production  By the way, no one   raised the specter of uncertainty over government legislation currently being contemplated, but if   I asked them later, and I did sometimes, they said yes, but it was not the first thing on their   minds   Financial conditions seem to have eased further in a number of markets  Risk aversion   continues to decline, and there are increasing reports of previously sidelined capital moving in   the markets in search of higher returns  Not surprisingly, the chorus of concerns regarding   frothiness in financial exuberance seems to be growing, and I think you heard about this in   Berlin, according to news reports, Mr Chairman  Although these warnings seem premature, a   couple of them were interesting  For example, my private equity director has noted several times   that at least a few recent deals have included some of the troublesome features that we saw   during the last boom  interest rate toggles, light covenant provisions, and funding for dividend   recaps In exuberant times, these lax provisions came bundled together  In recent deals only   single provisions have been included Still, he says he didn’t expect to see any of these so soon    In banking, however, there has been no change in the ongoing complaints and debates  Small   businesses say credit is overly tight, while bankers worry about creditworthiness, managerial   ability, and examiners’ reactions to new lending   This divergence between conditions in capital markets and bank credit serves as a   reminder that monetary policy is a blunt tool  Monetary accommodation will flow to where it   can obtain the best return, and it is difficult to predict when it will reach particular sectors    Currently the liquidity is going to capital markets, and while it is helping banks shore up their   balance sheets, it is not clearly finding its way into new bank lending     December 15–16, 2009 66 of 247  Turning to the outlook, business and household caution and restrictive bank credit will   continue to be headwinds, but I expect these to abate more as we move through next year    Overall, my forecast for real economic activity is about unchanged from last round, and we are   looking for GDP growth rates over the next year and a half similar to those in the Greenbook    With regard to prices, resource slack remains large, and inflation trends are still well below my   guideline of 2 percent At the same time, inflation expectations have remained within their   recent ranges  So my forecast for inflation is about the same as last round, with core PCE   inflation flattened down a bit in 2010 to 2011 but then moving up to about 1¾ percent in 2012    Thank you, Mr Chairman    Thank you, Mr Chairman  I, too, support alternative B  I think the   continued monetary policy accommodation is appropriate  The unemployment rate is at   10 percent, and core inflation is below my guideline of 2 percent   I agree with the economic markers that are listed in the paragraph on inflation—the rates   will remain low for an extended period of time due to low rates of resource utilization, subdued   inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations, and I do put substantial weight on all three of   those   I was fascinated to hear Governor Kohn’s discussion of real rates and how the natural   real rate might be low for some period of time  That did stand in contrast to President Plosser’s   discussion about how policy really might need to chase the real rate up  As Don discussed,   there’s a need to replace consumption expenditures and other types of investment, and I believe   that, inherent in Charlie’s commentary, he did not have that same type of need  Really, this is   just resource slack finding its way into a real rate discussion  I think it bodes well for us to have   a robust discussion of these issues and recognize that it finds its way into a number of different   market indicators  I tend to side a little bit more with Governor Kohn on this for that reason   Although the unemployment rate is 10 percent and is expected to improve only slowly—   that’s the bad side—I still believe that a funds rate at about zero plus our large balance sheet is   about as much as we can do and as much as we should do  I heard President’s Yellen’s very   good point about how we need to be patient—if we’d instead been able to adjust policy in a more   accommodative fashion, then we’d be able to rebound a little bit more quickly, but because we   can’t do that, this is a reminder that we need to be patient in this attitude I agree with that   I do think that the first-order effect of our large-scale asset purchases last spring was a   nonlinear change in confidence that changed the tone for the way the economy was going  I        December 15–16, 2009 127 of 247  think it’s probably very hard to come up with meaningful stimulative effects out of that, but at   any rate, I do believe that we will need to recalibrate policy in a number of ways in 2010   I support the winding down of our lending facilities, as stated in alternative B  I support   generally redeeming the MBS and agency debt as they mature as a very light way to head   towards getting our balance sheet in the right direction  I don’t think that that will be a move   that’s too accelerated towards restrictive policy  And I support the continued preparations that   you have described in thinking about our exit strategy  Thank you, Mr Chairman    Haven’t we already announced these dates tentatively?    I guess the question is the perception would be if you sort of ratify some   dates but not the others is that a signal that—    There’s not a long list of people already?    All right  I’m a little reluctant to intervene so early because I have a   series of rants that I could go on [Laughter] And I apologize for that   Regarding your question, Mr Chairman, I think you put your finger on one of the things   that bothered me  But, first off, I thought this was a terrific set of papers, and, they’re very   helpful as we think about these issues  I think the papers expose a number of Committee        December 15–16, 2009 160 of 247  members to a different type of discussion, one that economists tend to have, which you may or   may not like, but, at any rate, this is what we do   I thought the Philadelphia–Richmond critique of statistical gap measures and New   Keynesian models was just a little too mechanical and didn’t represent how we actually use these   measures in this room  They had the example of a beneficial productivity shock and a   sticky-price model If everybody followed that, their analysis says that, after a positive   productivity shock we’ll get a positive statistical output gap  We’ll see that output goes up, but   the trend is going to be smoother and so it’s positive, while, in fact, what is actually taking place   is that potential is a lot higher and output only went up by this much  So it’s a negative type of   gap And if all we’re looking at is the output gap, as Mike properly noted, we’re going to   mechanically make a mistake   But the question is Have we ever gone through this?  We have  The Greenspan Fed   lived through this during the second half of the 1990s  The debate between irrational exuberance   and a once-in-a-generation productivity acceleration was squarely put on the table in those   discussions, and, in the end, the productivity argument carried the day, and policy did not   erroneously tighten How did we end up there?  Well, Chairman Greenspan and the Committee   dismissed looking only at single measures  I’m sorry Dave Stockton isn’t here, because that was   very uncomfortable as Chairman Greenspan would say, “Phillips curve—no, no, no, we don’t   want to look at that Capacity, no, no, no”  And nobody could quite figure out exactly which   resource slack measure he wanted to look at, but he was looking at resource slack  He used other   information beyond the comparison of actual output with a simple trend  So if we think about   the productivity shock example in the Philadelphia–Richmond memo, in a sticky-price model,   because output cannot expand to potential, labor input is going to fall  This comes out of all the        December 15–16, 2009 161 of 247  model simulations  Ellen McGrattan has papers where you see that from this type of shock  So   labor slack is negative   What about inflation signals?  A positive statistical gap relative to a linear trend would   call for upward price pressure, so we’d be worried about inflation picking up But in fact, in the   model, the true output gap is negative and there’s downward pressure on inflation because   marginal costs are lower  So, indeed, in the second half of the 1990s, we saw a good deal of   such downward cost factors We were paying attention, and we did not get caught up in just this   single output gap measure  Fundamentally, we scratch our heads when we have different   measures that don’t line up  That’s a real-time warning, and we try to reconcile these conflicting   signals We look at our models and our assumptions more closely  Just think about how the   Greenbook gives us a good view on structural productivity—each Greenbook, which is more   often than we really need it because it doesn’t change that much—but still, that’s quite good    And then there’s other anecdotal information  Chairman Greenspan kept saying—and I know I   didn’t understand it when he first said it—that we heard plenty of business reports of higher   productivity and earnings analysts’ five-year-ahead forecast smoothed were telling us something   and that turned out to be right So the bottom line is that we lived through an example that’s like   the most troubling example in the paper, and I think we passed it  So that was pretty good    Could I make a comment?    This is a line of commentary that I don’t always follow, that the gap is   somehow a special variable, an endogenous variable  In the context of writing down an   equilibrium model, you could write—I’m pretty sure this is true—the equilibrium decision rules,   which are a function of the relevant state variables, which could be transformed so that the   output gap captures that part of it  That would say that, given our policy response function   parameters, this is how everything responds to the gap, and we’re following through on it  So it   requires art to know how we should be responding to those things, but it’s not prima facie wrong    When we say the output gap looks like this and so I think that policy   ought to respond in this fashion because disinflationary forces are going to change things a little   bit, there’s nothing in that that is in principle against the model, and we’re the central bank in the   middle of that model        December 15–16, 2009 166 of 247   Okay Then I didn’t understand your comment about when we talk about   output gaps    I would guess it does    Well, let me just say that I agree with many things that Mike just said,   and, in fact, in the specification that Justiniano and Primiceri  write down, the output gap is not a     December 15–16, 2009 172 of 247  fundamental  It’s a constructed variable, and it’s really the marginal cost pricing, as Jeff   mentioned, that is going to be fundamental for how firms are setting prices  So that’s absolutely   right It’s also in the language that we as economic researchers are comfortable with, and we can   lay it out and understand it quite well  Part of what we’re getting into is how we communicate   with other people and with the public, and resource slack tends to be a pretty good proxy in a   number of cases, so I think that’s why we keep coming back to it  These memos are right to   point out the cases where we are going to be misled by that, and then the question is  How do we   defend against that?  I think our track record is pretty good  We always need to be reminded of   this, and getting the models better would be great     You are setting the standard     Thank you, Mr Chairman  It’s a surprisingly difficult topic, and I thought   the memos were very helpful  When you said we should be brief, I felt a little like somebody   who is resubmitting a paper to a journal editor and has been told to cut 5 or 10 pages  I can   assure you I have done my best but— [Laughter]   We have many tools, and this wide array of novel and untested tools raises many issues    Complexity leads to difficulties in communicating our policy strategy to the public and perhaps   to ourselves  Complexity also has execution risks  Uncertainty exists regarding the   effectiveness of these tools, and so we should seek robustly powerful tools, and having more   choices leads to more-difficult consensus building  Now, at some level there is a near economic   equivalence among some of these tools, and I agree with President Bullard’s comments on that    Each tool puts pressure on remaining reserves and so increases the opportunity cost of lending   the remaining reserves to borrowers outside the reserve market  So there is a near   indeterminacy, it seems to me, in the best choice of policy tools, which means we could really   talk endlessly to no real conclusion on this  It is going to depend a lot on our preferences for   January 26–27, 2010 77 of 260    these  I think we need additional criteria to choose, and actually the presentation talked about   some additional criteria  I would say that simplicity, communicability, effectiveness, and   robustness are the criteria, and the ability to facilitate consensus-building should be an important   element there  I doubt that my preferences will entirely deliver on these scores, but they are   worthy objectives   My first observation is to agree that interest on excess reserves, the rate that we pay, can   be effective for tightening credit conditions  I do wonder how well this works in terms of   building a consensus  I think the evidence is mixed actually  To some, a virtue of using the   IOER rate alone is that no preparations for draining reserves are necessary, so a longer   evaluation of economic conditions is possible  To others, the downside might be that there is no   commitment to beginning the tightening process after we have provided unprecedented levels of   accommodation, and so you don’t have that commitment  Which is more important is probably   in the eye of the individual policymaker at this point  My conclusion, though, is that a heavy   emphasis on the IOER rate as the main policy tool makes sense  However, because of the   uncertainty surrounding the use of this tool alone, there seems to be a good case for employing   more tools in preparation to making IOER most effective   I think that robust tools seem important  Belts, suspenders, and four-leaf clovers are in   order, and so my preferred approach is, I guess, the early drain scenario  Use a number of tools   to drain reserves in advance of the most explicit tightening phase regarding short-term interest   rates  The analysis indicates that the funds rate is unlikely to increase above our 0 to 25 basis   point range, with excess reserves above, I would say, $500 billion, although that is subject to   uncertainty  We can prepare a reserves path for a baseline economic scenario in which we begin   tightening the funds rate and the IOER rate in the future  This is getting at what Governor Kohn   January 26–27, 2010 78 of 260    was asking, I believe, in terms of lead times for how long it takes for the reserve-draining tools to   hit that $500 billion  For best planning purposes, I would think about picking an expected date   for our tightening  This is the hard and controversial part, which I think is low on the consensus-  building aspect  We should get the reserves to this $500 billion using all reserve-draining   mechanisms, although I would save asset sales for later and sequence them so that they hit this   cumulative amount by the expected date   So this is a plan  You know, August 2010 is feasible, according to the table  That seems   too early, but how does it do in terms of state-contingencies?  Well, if the economic situation is   appropriate on the chosen date, then we’re in business  We can begin raising the IOER rate  The   fed funds and other short-term rates should follow immediately because we have prepared that  I   think it would be more robust  It’s more likely  If the tightening is needed sooner than date C,   well, if Governor Mishkin were here, I think he would say, “Use IOER, baby,” [laughter]   because that tool by itself would probably be enough, and so that increases the robustness  Then,   of course, if we hit this date before the economic situation is right, then either we slow the drain   if we had seen it coming, we march in place for a while, or we reverse course even if   accommodation is needed; I hope not   What are the overall drawbacks?  Well, draining reserves according to this baseline plan   is neither simple nor easy to communicate  Combinations of tools inevitably complicate matters    Using IOER alone might avoid this  So that’s the simplicity argument  We are unlikely to agree   fully on a time path  That is the really difficult part in all of this  We are kind of sidestepping   that issue, or we all agree that it is not imminent and that is not a key part of what we are talking   about  But the advantages are the robustness of this approach and the consensus-building, if we   could agree on the date  We begin to prepare for more-restrictive policies, but we do so in a way   January 26–27, 2010 79 of 260    that is likely to maintain maximum accommodation while the economy continues to need it  I   think we would see only small tightening effects as we start off with the reserve draining, and we   are that much closer to effective tightening  So the bottom line—I think it is important to   calculate the lead times needed for this, and that will be important   On the odds and ends, I agree with Governor Kohn’s comments about the primary credit   rate and the TAF, and ultimately a long-run balance sheet of all Treasuries would be preferred    Thank you, Mr Chairman      Thank you, Mr Chairman  As I listened to the presentation, I found   myself sort of stuck on exhibit 6, nonfarm business productivity, and I kept staring at that chart   because, however you put it, my takeaway was that it seems as if hiring is inevitable  Actual   productivity is higher than structural  If we are going to get economic growth, we are going to   have to get this hiring  And I just would like to point out at this time that I have not been able to   talk to anybody who will move off the proposition they will not be hiring until—and then they   won’t tell me exactly when  This is a big risk, isn’t it?  I mean, how do you feel about these   implications?     Yes, back at home I have dubbed this the “inevitability hypothesis”  The   recovery is inevitable, and it will happen  Thank you very much     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The incoming data in my business report seem   consistent with the basic contour of the moderate recovery that we have been expecting since last   fall  Although no one has experienced a breakout in demand, most manufacturers are reporting   increases in orders  In the District, the Chicago purchasing managers’ index, which will be   January 26–27, 2010 133 of 260    publicly released on Friday, continued to rise in January to a new level of 615  That is an   increase of 15½ points over the last four months  However, construction-related activities   continue at the very low levels they experienced at the trough of the recession   Labor market developments have been mixed  In line with Dan’s macro storyline, the   good news is that temporary-help employment is increasing significantly  This segment tends to   lead permanent hiring in the early stages of a recovery  Both Manpower and Kelly report that   demand for temp workers continued to rise smartly in January  They say these increases are in   line with typical recoveries, much like the industry’s experience in 1994, just before overall   employment started to take off  Still, most employers remain cautious, even when booking   temporary services  Rather than ordering additional temp workers a week or two in advance, as   is the usual practice, clients have been sending in last-minute orders when they actually need to   increase production  And as I suggested in my question, the other common refrain is that   businesses are all saying that they will do more with less  Few firms are planning further layoffs,   but almost all of them say that they are very hesitant to hire on a permanent basis   Like President Plosser’s, my staff has studied unemployment durations during recessions,   and their analysis raises further concerns  I would say that the recovery in the labor market will   be sluggish  So I am less optimistic than Charlie was  Even after adjusting for demographic   trends and the severity of the downturn, the average duration of unemployment spells is   extremely high, and my staff also says that about half of this may be due to the extension of UI   benefits  The rate at which people find jobs tends to fall a good deal as spells lengthen  Workers   are less likely to be good matches for the jobs that are available  Their labor force attachment   weakens, and their skills deteriorate  Consequently, many of the unemployed are likely to be   without jobs for quite some time  For these long-term unemployed, the adjustment process back   January 26–27, 2010 134 of 260    to a more steady-state duration was long in the 1974–75 downturn, it was longer in the 1982–83   downturn, and today they have even further to go than in those cycles  Now, I suppose lower   wages might speed this adjustment  That would be the normal type of response  But in any   event, income growth, consumer confidence, and demand will likely suffer   Turning to financial conditions, my directors and business contacts report that the   availability of credit continues to increase  For example, some hedge funds that had previously   experienced reductions in bank credit lines are now getting calls offering substantially larger   lines at low spreads  Worries about price exuberance do seem premature, though  Still, spreads   in bond markets have fallen to the point where traders we talked to expressed concerns that some   risk premiums are being pushed too low  In other conversations, many people, like my directors,   mention that there is cash on the sidelines waiting to be deployed  But, frankly, when I asked   them for examples of what they were talking about, I was kind of underwhelmed  There is an   impression that there are these funds ready to flow in, but it is hard to tell exactly where they are   coming from or where they will be going  We have received some positive commentary   regarding small improvements in CRE financing  Some CRE loans are being restructured    Often the values are being written down significantly, but at least the problems are beginning to   be addressed   There is not much new to report about the inflation outlook, I would say  Wage increases   are small or non-existent  My manufacturing contacts did not express strong concerns over   higher commodity prices at the moment   In terms of the forecast, our outlook is pretty much where it has been for the last three or   four meetings  We see GDP growth being about 3½ percent this year, increasing to the 4 and   January 26–27, 2010 135 of 260    4½ percent range in 2011 and 2012  And we’re expecting slightly lower core inflation this year   and then some gradual pickup to about 1¾ to 2 percent by 2012   Now, I might regret this type of comment, but President Plosser brought up an interesting   point, and I have written down here, “I would like to have more discussion”  That is the possible   regretful part  [Laughter]  The idea that taking out shelter might be an important indicator of   underlying inflationary pressures does seem to come up every cycle one way or another  Either   shelter is too high or it’s too low  And I think Charlie is right to say that we don’t want to get   involved in taking out these price elements in each argument  But I would say that focusing on   total PCE or headline inflation is not going to be a panacea, as we might think  We would then   have to start focusing on medium-term projections for inflation, and we’re simply going to   disagree on how to go about doing that  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support alternative B, but I would like to   mention that, in his commentary, Bill English used the phrase “Committee members might be   dissatisfied with the outlook” to say that we might prefer alternative A  I think that almost   everybody is dissatisfied with the outlook, and this was voiced by Governor Kohn and President   Bullard in commentary about how this obviously isn’t the optimal monetary policy path  But I’ll   pause on that and just say that I am not quite sure what optimal is  It’s becoming increasingly   apparent to me that we never had a chance to keep the unemployment rate below 10 percent    The options that we considered in March—it would be nice to have a “lessons learned” session at   the appropriate time—there wasn’t capacity in the MBS purchases apparently  We are finding   that out now, and so I am not quite sure how we would have tried to accomplish a better   outcome  But that said, this is what we have     Today, I think the “extended period” language still seems correct  When I think about   this—and I will even say this when people push me—I think it means six months  That is three   to four meetings  From the March meeting plus six months takes us to September 2010 at the   earliest that there would be a tightening  All else being equal, I just don’t see that  So I am   comfortable with “extended period”  The TIPS five-year, five-year-forward uptick is   noteworthy, but the fundamentals to me still strongly suggest that inflation is going to be below   our own guidelines for the next three years  So, bottom line, I think any tightening prior to   September 2010 is unlikely, and it is probably much longer   January 26–27, 2010 193 of 260    Now, I do think that we need to map out our strategy for any reserve draining, the lead   times, and that might be helpful for building a consensus, as I was talking about before, but it’s   not necessary today  On the holdings–purchases language, I have a preference for “purchases,”   not to change things too much  I don’t think we get that much out of it  And on the TAF issue,   it’s probably a coin flip  I think the optionality argument wins  I don’t think we have anything   to prove with pre-commitment today, but it could go either way  Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I have two distinct questions, and one of them   is on the RCA  In part my comments are somewhat sympathetic with President Lacker’s, I think    For those of us who are not really sure, it’s a very confusing issue  I don’t want to give up on the   funds rate spread per se  I guess you could say, “If we wanted the funds rate to be firm at 25   basis points, we should drain reserves”  That’s a little further than I would think we would want   to take this   From a first-order standpoint, it seems to me that the GSEs have a bunch of funds  In the   first-order effect, they are lying dormant, and they’re not allocated, and maybe they’re getting   five basis points or maybe they’re not getting anything  In this proposal, those dormant funds,   on which they’re getting five basis points from a bank, then get placed with the Fed and earn the   IOER rate  The GSEs then get part of that surplus  That’s not allocative for credit  That’s just   giving the GSEs a gift   March 16, 2010 18 of 146    The paragraph on what the implications are for other financial markets depends on that   constraint not being slack  So those funds just stay in the same place  I don’t think that this has   any real effect  That’s really my question  Is it allocative?  On top of that, I was surprised by the   commentary that this is going to make the brokered market seem more idiosyncratic  I thought it   meant that the brokered market would give us a better idea of what the marginal investor cost   actually would be  I wasn’t expecting that  Is that off base?     I just don’t see that channel between markets in your analysis  That was   my basic point  It seems to me like the competitive channel is blocked because the funds rate   channel is still largely a slack constraint  Maybe as interest rates go up, it would tend to bite a   little bit more     If people want to borrow these funds, why don’t they go to the GSEs and   offer 10 basis points?     Okay  Let me move on to my second question  It has to do with Brian   Sack’s discussion  I think I heard you say the survey of the dealers on the effect of our MBS   purchases had changed from 60 basis points to 10 basis points now, and I don’t think I heard that   there was a change in the path of purchases  Does that mean that they just had a very bad guess   initially?  If that’s the case, are there other aspects of our analysis where this would have some   implications for how we estimate the effects of our LSAPs?  The staff estimate of the effect is   80 basis points for the entire program and, if we adopt a Treasury redemption strategy, 20 basis   points  Does that change our thinking on that at all?   March 16, 2010 20 of 146      Thank you, Mr Chairman  The economic recovery continues to progress   modestly  Our contacts indicate that business conditions are improving gradually  Most   manufacturers report increases in orders  The inventory cycle accounts for much of this, and   businesses expect this rebuilding will largely be completed during the first half of the year  The   March 16, 2010 54 of 146    usual post-recession surge in sales associated with pent-up demand for consumer durables and   capital goods has not materialized to date  A lack of confidence and restrictive credit appears to   be trumping the desire to make up for spending bloodied by the downturn  Accordingly, all of   the businesses I spoke with remain conservative in their medium-term outlooks for growth  By   sector, commodity-related industries are doing somewhat better, but construction-related   businesses are still scraping along the bottom   With restrained expectations, very few firms are planning robust increases in workforces   or capacity  For example, Caterpillar laid off 37,000 workers during the recession  Now it is   bringing back 7,000 of them, and it does not expect to return to the previous workforce levels   within the foreseeable future  In a similar vein, United Airlines has seen a pickup in business   travel because companies are sending their sales people back on the road again, but United has   reduced its overall capacity   In terms of the forecast, we agree with the Greenbook’s assessment that the balance of   the incoming data has been a touch weaker than anticipated, but only by enough to shave a   couple of tenths off of the outlook for economic growth in 2010  We see GDP increasing in the   range of 3 to 3½ percent this year and 4 to 4½ percent for the next two years  The decline in the   unemployment rate was a bit of unanticipated good news, and we carried a lower rate forward in   our projection   There’s not much new to say with regard to the inflation outlook either  The significant   resource slack in the economy is exerting downward pressure on pricing  My contacts said that   planned wage increases are still small or nonexistent, and scattered reports of higher materials   costs do not appear to have had much effect on end-user prices  But the TIPS and survey data   still indicate that inflation expectations are pretty well anchored  Accordingly, we’re continuing   March 16, 2010 55 of 146    to expect only a slight further drop in core inflation this year and then some gradual pickup to   about 1¾ percent by 2012  So the implication seems to be that strong accommodation remains   an important element of this outlook  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  My view hasn’t changed since the last   meeting  Substantial monetary policy accommodation is still appropriate  Alternative B   captures this need as well as other factors that justify this policy stance   I don’t favor including a sentence in paragraph 2 on inflation  It seems a little odd to me    I don’t think it would be well understood  “The Committee expects that over time and with   appropriate monetary policy, inflation will run at rates consistent with price stability”  This is   usually a phrase that we use when inflation expectations are too high  If we use this sentence   today, it requires that everybody understand that we’re below our inflation target, so the   appropriate policy would be to goose things a little bit  I just think it would cause confusion   March 16, 2010 110 of 146    The sequencing in alternative C and C′ is intriguing, and I certainly accept putting this off   until April for a full robust discussion  But I have to admit, with the enormous accommodation   that we have in place, appropriately, I think it’s essential to have in mind the dynamic plan for   where monetary policy is going  I just can’t really accept alternative B repeatedly without   having in mind some idea of what future monetary policy actions are going to be, in this context    I think it’s critical to think about future policy tightening in the context of a baseline outlook, in   terms of the models that we’re presented with—our best efforts, such as FRB/US, the Greenbook   analyses, and FOMC central tendency projections  I favor thinking about them seriously  And   that’s what we have for looking into the policy future   Assuming that these forecasts basically hold—they’re in the ballpark—this is what we’re   expecting  We’re expecting unemployment to move only slowly—the unemployment rate might   break through 8 percent sometime in 2011, if the Bluebook’s chart 7 is correct; in terms of   economic growth, we’re not sure about what the sources of growth are going to be, but I think   it’ll be stronger than labor markets alone suggest, though we’ll still have a sizable resource gap;   core inflation is expected to be about 1½ percent at the end of 2011—maybe medium-term   inflation expectations would have a slightly higher range for 2012—but that’s the situation that   we’ll be in   I won’t venture into the April sequencing discussion now, but chart 7 in the Bluebook   implies that the funds rate will be zero at the end of 2012  Although I don’t trust this model   analysis completely, other things could happen  This is sobering to me  And I guess my   question would be  Which analyses suggest something different than this?  We all have fears of   risks  At the moment I can’t see them that clearly  So I can imagine, much as President   Rosengren indicated, that alternative B will be appropriate for an extended period  And I’m a   March 16, 2010 111 of 146    little concerned that once we signal that the alternative C preparations are appropriate, there’s   going to be a lot of momentum  I think President Lacker was capturing that when he said   something like, “Even as we have this sequencing, the ‘extended period’ language might still be   appropriate”  I think containing that momentum is going to be tough  Once we start, the train   keeps running and the next thing we know we’ll be talking about tightening  If we could   separate it as well as President Lacker and President Bullard were suggesting, then I’d find that   pretty acceptable  But I am kind of concerned about that  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’m sure I recall Governor Kohn saying at one   meeting—it was a meeting where there was a lot of diversity of opinion, and people had very   strong views on those diverse opinions—that the Committee participants should come to the   meeting with more of an open mind than sometimes we do   I don’t think he was asking that we   be wishy-washy in coming in with our views  I think he meant that we should be thoughtful, and   April 27–28, 2010 44 of 206                   today, at best, I think I am going to offer some thoughts  I’m not quite sure I’m going to offer   any golden nuggets   My first reaction is that we need accommodative monetary policy  That’s going to be   important, and I think it’s going to be important for quite some time  We need to follow our dual   mandate and respond to our objectives to keep the unemployment rate lower and inflation at our   guidelines  So I wouldn’t push for asset sales, if I thought that they would harm the economy or   our achievement of these objectives  But I will say—and these are the thoughts—that, like   President Kocherlakota, I fear asset sales less than some of the estimates in the Gagnon, Sack, et   al, paper and some of the FRB/US estimates  I think the work was really good, and I think that   the nature of this type of work leads to a lot of uncertainty  A lot of research requires a   tremendous amount of vetting, and at best we’re at a very early stage, I think, of this   To give you my preferences, I, not surprisingly, agree with Governor Kohn in preferring   option 2  After we begin to raise interest rates, then we embark upon asset sales  I would like to   state with some clarity and explicitness what the sales plan would be at that point—“at x dollars   per month pace”—where we review that every six months  I think that that plan is going to be an   important element of that   Having said that, let me just express some of the discomforts I have with the issues that   we’re facing here  First is the perceptions problem that I think we face  I’ve talked with an   awful lot of financial economists and macroeconomists at very good universities about our large-  scale asset purchases and the issues that we face  They’re highly respected, and I would say that   many of them have balanced views going into the discussion  It’s not the usual crank suspects   that one might run into  [Laughter]  I talked to a wide variety  And it is surprising to me the   number of people who mention that the size of our balance sheet is very large, and that that could   April 27–28, 2010 45 of 206                   likely lead to problems, and that the composition is veering way towards credit allocation, and   that could be a big problem  It leaves the impression on these people’s minds that there’s a bias   towards inflation  I always try to explain to them that, at the point when the banks begin to lend   out the excess reserves, that’s when we might run into a problem  But they continue to believe   that we are set up to fail on our inflation objectives  And I think communication and education   are unlikely to change this, because they start off knowing an awful lot about these issues  So I   think we have to deal with this in a risk-management framework  The perceptions are going to   be out there, and it’s going to be difficult to budge smart people off of that, no matter how much   we disagree  To me, that means that we need strong discipline and an explicit plan with respect   to the asset sales  That’s why I emphasized “when we do it”  It might be later than a lot of   people would think, but when we do it, we should be very clear, and we should stick to it, which   should help mitigate some of this risk   I’ve also got some comments on our willingness to counter such perception risks by   selling assets  It might depend on the cost of the sales if we were to embark on them  If we do   begin to sell assets, how large will the increase in yields be?  And would that lead us to want to   defer these sales longer than we really ought to?  So what is the size of the term premium if we   were to increase sales? I think the answer is debatable  I think that the Gagnon, Sack, et al paper   lays that out with many, many good estimates, but there’s very wide range there  I really think   this is an important issue  This might be in the top five of all of the critical decisions the   Bernanke FOMC makes in your entire tenure, that is, the large-scale asset purchases  Hard to   imagine, right?  So many different possibilities for a list like that  Are we facing a 1937-style   risk if we go too soon?  Or are we facing a 1970s-style risk for inflation going up when the   unemployment rate remains higher than we would like?  I want to know a lot more about the   April 27–28, 2010 46 of 206                   kinds of estimates that Joe and Brian came up with and what alternate views are from a critical   vetting perspective, as we would get at conferences and journals  I think that’s really going to be   fundamental, because at some point, when we actually face this, we’re still going to be tempted   to put this off  The initial estimate for the term premium was 80 basis points  Then, the   discounting of that gets us down to the 30 or 35  But that’s a big number, and it sort of leads you   to want to think about inaction  I could go into some reasons why I’d like to think about some   different numbers there, but I think my estimates are that they might be a little lower   Having said that, I think we’re facing complexity risk with everything that we’re doing    At a minimum, I think that any reasonable observer of the following issues would agree that the   FOMC faces remarkably complex issues with respect to large-scale asset sales  One, there’s a   wide disparity in academic and expert views, as I just mentioned, with respect to the implications   of these asset purchases  Two, there are highly technical econometric and theoretical arguments   about why the term premium size would be a certain size, when it goes up, and when it goes   down  Three, I agree with President Kocherlakota  I think these are new arguments with respect   to the second tool of monetary policy being large-scale asset purchases and open market   operations  We haven’t been talking about that in this Committee  The premise of the paper is   that it’s a bona fide tool at any point in time  Why haven’t we been using that, if it’s really   effective?  I think we should evaluate that more carefully   I think complexity suggests the reluctance, again, to push back on some of these issues,   so that we might think, “These are big effects; let’s be careful, let’s go very slowly”  And I agree   that we might need to do more  I think this leads us to your envelope theorem comment, Mr   Chairman, meaning that, if there’s an inaction bias, the corollary is that it ups the ante on the   April 27–28, 2010 47 of 206                   importance of getting the funds rate and all of the other tools right  Again, I do favor option 2  I   think there are all of these issues that are going to cause us discomfort later on   You asked for comments on Treasury redemptions  I’m completely ambivalent about   that  On the one hand, I’d like to get started—yes, do it  On the other hand, it’s tightening—no,   that’s probably not the right thing to do  I’ll leave that up to others   Did you ask whether or not we should make a statement in the minutes or the FOMC   statement?     Okay     Okay  If we say too much, it could be a bombshell, if it’s in the minutes   rather than the statement     I wonder if Bill Dudley could just elaborate a bit   You mentioned the   dollar funding issues  What’s the channel that that might transpire from?  Back in 2008,   European banks were trying to finance dollar assets and they needed dollars   April 27–28, 2010 77 of 206                     But I would have thought these were euro funding issues     Okay  So it’s general risk aversion     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’m going to refrain from discarding my   prepared remarks, just because of the Greek situation  I do have a relatively upbeat report, but it   does seem that tail uncertainty refuses to go away  In the short time since our last meeting, the   data have come in about as we expected, perhaps even a little stronger  It’s looking more and   more as if we’ve turned the corner  Unfortunately, the neighborhood is still pretty depressed   I have been hearing relatively upbeat reports from most of my contacts for several   months now  Consistent with moderately improving growth, these have become stronger and   more broad-based  Of course, uncertainty and wariness remains, but this seems to be abating   somewhat  For some time, many contacts have been concerned that economic growth would   falter once we were through the inventory upswing  Now most are reporting decent orders into   the second half of the year  Perhaps this reflects an initial release of pent-up demand  For   example, several directors reported companies were starting to spend on IT projects that had   been put on hold because of the downturn and uncertainty over the recovery  And the recent   strength in consumer spending is consistent with households beginning to make some purchases   that they had delayed during the recession  Nonetheless, many business contacts remain wary   over the sustainability of demand, much as you were mentioning with regard to the Dallas   directors   With regard to some specific reports, the improvement in our District is reflected in the   Chicago Purchasing Managers Index, which will be released this Friday  The index jumped   5 points to 638, its highest level in five years  Some of the strongest reports we heard came   from the heavy equipment manufacturers, which had seen robust export and agricultural demand    Caterpillar increased its projection for sales growth in 2010 from 17 percent to 40 percent  The   April 27–28, 2010 104 of 206                   company is also bringing back 3,000 US workers who were laid off during the recession  John   Deere, similarly, reported a large increase in employment callbacks  Those are good signs   Another positive sign of improving labor markets is the strength of the temporary help   business  Those firms are seeing solid increases in billable hours and job placements, and, by   industry and worker segments, gains are proceeding sequentially, as they would expect in a   sustainable recovery  Of course, there’s still a huge amount of slack in labor markets  Many   firms advertising for workers have been inundated with responses  For instance, Allstate   Insurance recently opened a new call center in San Antonio and received more than   7,000 applicants for 600 available jobs  Unfortunately, many of those who applied lacked the   requisite skills   In credit markets, bank lending to small- and medium-sized businesses continues to be   weak  We still hear about frustrated firms who say they have good prospects but can’t find   loans  We get that from our advisory council contacts—the bankers always tell us that it’s the   lack of creditworthy borrowers, as President Lacker mentioned, and it’s a very consistent story    We did hear some interesting stories of private equity and hedge funds trying to take advantage   of the high margins created by banks’ reluctance to lend  They are entering deals to buy loans   and the high-yield debt of middle-market businesses  Their sense is that this will represent a   good profit opportunity for the next year or so  It’s hard to know how much lending capacity   such investors can really add, but these stories are consistent with others we hear of money that   had been on the sidelines coming back into the game, so financial market functioning seems to   be much better   On Vice Chairman Dudley’s comment about regulatory reform and the rating agencies   thinking about downgrading large financial institutions, I just wonder about that  It seems like   April 27–28, 2010 105 of 206                   one can think of the assistance from “too big to fail” as an option contract, and the question is  Is   it in the money at the moment, or is it out of the money?  And it seems like it’s out of the money,   so I wouldn’t think that they should downgrade them at the moment   I’ll turn now to the GDP forecast  The incoming data indicate, as they have for some   time, that the recovery seems to be progressing about in line with expectations, namely, we’re   most likely seeing a moderate rebound as opposed to a sharp bounceback  Overall, our   economic growth forecast is about the same as the Greenbook’s   My forecast for inflation has come down a bit more  The recent drop in inflation to very   low numbers seems to reflect the significant effect of slack on pricing  From conversations with   McDonald’s to Caterpillar, corporations talk about successfully managing future costs down    They have negotiating power, and slack is a powerful element in their ability to get concessions    What are they going to do with margins, and are they actually going to pass that along to prices?    Okay—I don’t know; stay tuned  Inflation expectations have been remarkably stable, given the   actual disinflation we’ve experienced over the past 18 months  Perhaps this reflects the usual   inertia in expectations, or perhaps it reflects the fact that the very large amount of slack is being   offset by the effect of the dramatic expansion of our balance sheet and on hidden inflation risks    I can’t tell which at the moment  Over the projection period, my forecast assumes that inflation   expectations will not move appreciably, either up or down  Unlike the Greenbook, we forecast   inflation to rise somewhat over the next couple of years  Nevertheless, even in my projection,   inflation at the end of 2012 is below the 2 percent mark that I view as being consistent with price   stability  This should give us room to keep policy accommodative for “quite some time,” or   whatever language we use to express another expected six months  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I generally have no change in my policy   recommendation  I favor alternative B as written, which I take to be without paragraph 4 on the   Treasury redemptions issue  I support your proposal to continue to study the Treasury   April 27–28, 2010 161 of 206                   redemptions—a very important issue  I take this position because my inflation outlook continues   to envision underrunning my version of price stability for—I’d say ”some time,” but that means   ”less than six months”—a very long period of time [laughter]  In addition, the unemployment   rate is high, and there’s a tremendous amount of slack out there  I think the US economy is   performing better today, so that’s a good sign, but I am growing increasingly concerned about   the international risks  It’s difficult to see how that ends well, so, on balance, I think this   continues to be a good time to wait and monitor the situation   Because my comments were so brief, I wanted to take a moment to comment on what   President Bullard said—I thought he raised a number of very interesting issues  I didn’t write   down all your proposed language changes, but I did have two thoughts  One is on the question   about the Taylor rule and the fact that we’re at the zero bound  The staff has done a lot of very   innovative things in trying to assess the implications of our asset purchase programs  It seems to   me there’s a possibility to take our 80 basis point estimate of the quantitative easing effect on   longer-term Treasuries and ask, “Well, if I wanted to create a synthetic funds rate, what would   that mean?”  You know, five to one is a pretty conservative estimate of the effect of the federal   funds rate on longer-term rates, if it were based on a monetary policy shock, and that would   translate into 400 basis points on the funds rate  During the period when the funds rate is at zero,   such a synthetic funds rate would look a little bit more like the Taylor rule, if that were a   reasonable thing to do  So I think that could be an interesting approach for puzzling through   these things   On the “extended period” language, I continue to think that it’s a guideline  A lot of us   have gone out and indicated the state-contingency of that language, and that message seems to be   coming across—for example, President Yellen commented that markets seem to be responding   April 27–28, 2010 162 of 206                   to news beyond the six-month horizon—so that indicates that they are thinking that there is that   contingency  President Bullard had suggested adding more state-contingency, along the lines of   the language in alternative A  In principle, I like being more explicit, I like putting markers out   there  But I just worry—I’m not optimistic that the Fed and market watchers would get that right   if we tried to make that type of change  I don’t think they’d get it right initially, and, over the   longer term, it might get caught up in some of the confusion over the European situation  So   while I can be sympathetic to that, I like the “extended period” language  Thank you, Mr   Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I wanted to ask a slightly different question   about the outlook in Europe  With all of the austerity measures for Southern Europe, it looks as   May 9, 2010 27 of 42             if it would be very difficult for Europe to avoid a recession  For example, what’s the chance that   Germany can avoid a recession, given that they export so much to the rest of Europe?  And if   we’re going to talk about the ECB sterilizing, which short-term interest rates are going to be   driven up in Europe?  I’d say it’s probably the stronger sovereign debt  If anybody on the staff   could give us an idea of what our increasing risk is there, and how it affects the US, that would   be appreciated      Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support giving you the authority for the   swap lines  I’m really concerned that Europe is likely to be on fire by our June meeting  I’m   worried that the Asian response is not going to be as helpful as everybody would like and that we   might have more serious trade discussions about what the appropriate exchange rate values will   be for some of those trading partners  I’m not sure if I heard it correctly, but if we’re talking   about swaps on the order of $150 billion or so, and if that’s feasible and it would have a   beneficial effect, then that seems to be an extremely reasonable and acceptable degree of risk,   and I clearly support that  Thank you     I only mentioned that because I think somebody mentioned a number like   that, but that’s fine     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Brian, I think you implied that this will be a   change in policy and it would be a surprise in financial markets  Could you discuss a little bit   more how markets have formed expectations regarding how we will deal with our Treasury   holdings and that they will be rolled over?  I don’t believe we’ve really discussed this explicitly   in our FOMC statements  It’s an element of our policy decisions, and the discussion seems a bit   incomplete relative to our previous decisions  This is something that we’re going to be grappling   with for some time     Thank you, Mr Chairman  If it weren’t for the communication issues   about what it might signal for monetary policy, I’d tend to think that redeeming Treasuries alone   June 22–23, 2010 38 of 213             would have relatively small effects, and I’d tend to favor doing something like that to get our   balance sheet down  But that’s not the case—there are communication issues   I think it would have been nice if, along the way, we had known that it was okay to make   technical adjustments in the size of our balance sheet—in some of these components, in   relatively small dollar amounts—over, say, a six-month period; we’re obviously struggling with   a whole number of these issues  You know, I’m the kind of person where, within certain bands,   small adjustments don’t bother me  The markets apparently are going after nickels and so on, so   that a small change matters a lot to them  But we’re going to struggle with this with the term   deposit facilities, the $9 billion of coupon swaps, and other things that are going to come along,   and it’s always going to have an effect of a couple of basis points  It would be nice if we could   have somehow communicated that there’s a range of noisy adjustments that are going to be   natural for us to do   However, it does have implications about what it means for tightening, and so I don’t   think there’s much of a reward here  As President Lockhart mentioned, the risk is larger than I   would like, and the dual mandate issues say to me that we need to maintain accommodation  So   I tend to favor option 1—roll over the Treasuries and keep the monetary policy accommodation    I certainly would not object to reinvesting in shorter-maturity Treasuries  But I would go ahead   and roll them over  Thank you     Yes, I wouldn’t do that     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’d like to add my compliments to the staff on   the Tealbook and the financial stability memos  I thought they were really terrific, and I think   they’ll help sharpen the focus of our discussions going forward   The data in my business reports indicate that the recovery is continuing at the moderate   pace we’ve expected for some time now  To me, it seems likely that the unevenness in some of   the recent monthly data is symptomatic of this moderate pace  I think it’s too early to infer much   more than that, but the uncertainty is high  Labor market improvements will be gradual for the   foreseeable future, and the continued weakness in the jobs picture could weigh on household and   business sentiment for some time   Regarding inflation, the data currently suggest that the pull from disinflationary forces is   somewhat stronger than the anchor from stable inflation expectations—that’s a slight change in   my perspective  Because inflation is projected to underrun my 2 percent inflation goal over the   medium term, according to FOMC central tendencies, it’s difficult for me to imagine altering our   current accommodative policy stance over the next six months or so, and certainly not in a   material fashion   Turning to my business reports, and in line with my assessment of the economic outlook,   most comments fit into a “more of the same” theme  Ford and GM both reported good results   recently  Incentives are not high  Inventories are lean, and the current 115 million unit sales   pace appears to be profitable  The steel industry continues to bring more capacity back on line    Smaller industrial segments that are indicative of future activity, like industrial packaging and   strapping materials, continue to improve at a strong rate, but, while capital equipment is selling   well, business sentiment about cap-ex spending remains weak   June 22–23, 2010 87 of 213             I will just pause and mention that I asked all of my manufacturing contacts whether they   saw something in Europe that was materially different recently, and it just seems as if it’s much   too early to tell, not surprisingly  But I did get from them a sense that there’s still good   momentum in their business activity in Europe  So it might take several months before we see   anything in the data   The pace of employment growth continues to be slow, and I didn’t hear any particularly   interesting new news about labor markets this round  I was going to stop there, but I just want to   point out that a lot of people have mentioned already that they talked to businesspeople who say   that they’re nervous about Europe and they’re not going to hire  They’ve been saying they   weren’t going to hire for some time  So we’re already at the zero bound, it seems, for hiring—  it’s hard for that to get worse   The financial reports from our Chicago market contacts seem roughly consistent with the   financial stability memos  Funding availability is increased for the better quality borrowers and   market segments  One contact noted having maybe a dozen bidders for CRE deals he was   putting together, whereas, four or five months ago, investors would have laughed his proposals   out of the room  Most of these deals are on conservative terms for properties with stable cash   flows  New construction loans, in contrast, are very difficult to obtain  We did hear a number of   comments regarding some pullback on risk and leverage since May  For example, some dealers   are unwilling to buy for inventory in their marketmaking capacity, and some hedge funds are   buying CDS protection and put options as a way of limiting downside risks  However, on the   plus side, obligations of nonfinancial firms were not particularly stressed in May   Turning to the international situation, the increasing emphasis on austerity programs in   Europe presents some unique challenges for the US outlook and policymaking  I thought the   June 22–23, 2010 88 of 213             international memos and risk scenarios were very helpful for thinking through that this time    When you consider straight import–export multipliers, it’s hard to come up with major effects on   US growth  But, at conferences I attended recently overseas, the European and other foreign   central bankers I spoke with seemed pretty complacent about the prospects of demand from the   US providing important support for continued export growth worldwide  I’d tell them it seems   hard to imagine that the American consumer will return to its 15-year run of stimulating world   growth, but their reaction was either puzzlement or denial of such prospects  So I am concerned   that foreign policymakers are underestimating the effects that their belt tightening will have on   their domestic economies  Of course, the larger risk would be a further deterioration in   international financial markets, as the chart show and financial stability memos discussed  But,   for the moment, these are mostly just tail risks  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I agree with alternative B, and I am fine with   the coupon swaps  I’d like to agree with President Bullard—I think that he has a good point on   including the size of our balance sheet as a tool of monetary policy in paragraph 3  It does seem   that we’ve spent a lot of time talking about a second tool of policy aimed at term premiums, and   language indicating that the Committee has injected a large amount of liquidity through LSAPs   and will maintain our target rate for the federal funds rate would be accurate in describing what   our tools are  It may be difficult to do, though   Given our collective outlook and policy objectives, I continue to believe that substantial   monetary policy accommodation will be appropriate for a good while, so I agree with the   “extended period” language  I take this stance, however, mindful of the many policy risks that   we face  In particular, although I put little weight on some issues at the moment, it does seem   that it would be proper due diligence to consider some criticisms about earlier periods of highly   accommodative policy and ask if we’re sufficiently insulated from adverse outcomes this time   around  Specifically, I’m thinking about John Taylor’s arguments that policy remained too   accommodative during the 2003–2006 period, which contributed to financial markets’ failing to   price risks adequately  Are these same risks relevant today?  What actions would best safeguard   against them?   Although our forecasts are underrunning our objectives, as you mentioned, Mr   Chairman—and as did many others—it seems natural to me that many are uncomfortable with   our now 18-month-old policy of a zero federal funds rate and a pretty large balance sheet  As   President Hoenig mentioned, the recovery is on, economic growth is okay, though it’s not robust,   and zero seems like a very low interest rate for us to be targeting  But there is a bit of déjà vu of   the earlier period right now  We again have large-scale joblessness, and maybe some further job   June 22–23, 2010 152 of 213             losses coming—who knows?—even though economic growth has picked up  Indeed, one reply   to Taylor’s 2003 criticisms is that policy at that time does not look as accommodative if one   focuses on Taylor rules that use labor data, like the unemployment rate, instead of output gap   data, which he has emphasized   How about today?  Well, in the Tealbook, the labor-market-based optimal control rules   may have the funds rate negative until 2013, so the labor market is contributing to that  And it’s   possible, as others have mentioned, that there are structural elements to the high unemployment   rate now and the labor market difficulties  But even abstracting from that, looking at the output-  based Taylor rules, they point to continued very low, zero funds rates for an extended period,   into 2012  And, as I’ve mentioned at other times, there are many other indicators of resource   slack  So the downtrend in the inflation numbers is not consistent, in my mind, with us having   experienced a large drop in potential output  Slack in labor and product markets currently is   sufficient to outweigh the anchor of inflation expectations at the moment   My point simply is this  The projected output and inflation paths corroborate the labor   market justification for our policy stance, in my opinion  And it’s hard to see the same forces   building that John Taylor spoke of in that earlier period, 2003–2006  So I think that   accommodation is a robustly appropriate policy at the moment   I certainly agree with your observations, Mr Chairman, that our policy choices should be   symmetric with regard to our dual mandate goals  I’ve said before, as Governor Kohn   mentioned, that I would prefer a policy with an even lower interest rate, if that were possible—  it’s not  And I do worry about the argument concerning diminishing returns for some of our   policy actions  I think that if we considered more large-scale asset purchases, we ought to talk   June 22–23, 2010 153 of 213             about that issue  For example, would we be stimulating certain sectors of the economy, which   already are struggling, like housing?  How would we deal with that?    Finally, I think the forward-looking language falls into this category, too  There’s only   so much we could get out of extending the “extended period” language  In theory, yes, but, in   practice, I’m doubtful—I agree with President Bullard’s comments in that regard  Thank you,   Mr Chairman     I assumed you were not liking the word “strengthened”     Okay     Thank you, Mr Chairman  After reviewing the recent data and insights   from my business contacts, I still believe the US economic recovery is continuing, but the near-  term and medium-term economic growth prospects seem very modest  Yes, I can recount   several positives from my business reports  Revenues at heavy equipment manufacturers, Deere   and Caterpillar, have risen sharply on the strength of foreign demand, especially from emerging   markets  Manufacturing segments with exposures to the auto sector have also rebounded well,   although overall sales and production levels are well below previous business cycle peaks    Corporate America is flying more business travelers overseas again to support strong activity,   and the European financial crisis continues to recede  Indeed, Europe’s growth prospects have   not cratered as I had feared   But there are clear signs of heightened uncertainty and waning momentum in the US    One manufacturing supplier with a broad business base described how non-auto-related   customers were pulling back in the last two months  This is especially evident in those products   related to cap-ex that they believe are early indicators of trend shifts  With the continuing   corporate emphasis on productivity gains, businesses are quick to mention that the hurdle for   meaningful hiring is very high  As one CEO stated, “While firms might increase hours, hiring   new workers is just a totally different proposition”    In my directors’ phone call last week, the mood was grim  One of our great hopes is for   banks to begin lending out their vast reserves to fund growing activity, but all I hear from   August 10, 2010 58 of 160             bankers is that businesses and consumers are pulling back on their activities  My large bank   director complained that the psychology of the general economy is poor  Consequently, it   doesn’t seem that increased bank lending is going to happen any time soon  Similarly, although   the big temporary employment firms headquartered in our District report that their business has   held up fairly well, they say that client firms are increasingly cautious about the uncertain   economic outlook  Another CEO put it this way  “It all comes back to jobs”   In light of these developments, I have no substantial disagreements regarding the outlook   presented in the Tealbook  With each passing meeting, it is becoming all too clear that the   modest pace of economic recovery will be too slow to return the labor market to anything close   to normalcy by 2012  With the unemployment rate projected to be 7½ to 8 percent in 2012,   we’re falling far short of our objectives for the real economy  Remember, this is the third   anniversary of when this all began, this very meeting—we’ll be five years on in 2012   I recognize that there are caveats  Some unemployment is likely structural and requires   costly reallocation across industries, skills, and regions  This reallocation may be particularly   important for sectors like housing, which grew to unsustainable levels  Associated capital   reallocation could lower overall potential output  Still, these structural factors seem relatively   small compared with the current level of unemployment   The other disturbing policy development is that we are underrunning our inflation   objective  Mr Chairman, on this subject the Committee is in a difficult situation, because we do   not have a uniform view on an explicit numerical inflation objective  That has been already   voiced this morning  Nevertheless, by my reckoning, with the Tealbook’s core PCE inflation   projection of 1 percent in 2012, we’re failing by a full percentage point; that is, I have 2 percent   as my price stability goal  If an inflation rate of 1 percent is not a problem, as some have   August 10, 2010 59 of 160             indicated, then, by symmetry, we should feel the same way about an inflation rate of 3 percent  I   somehow doubt that that’s the case   We’re failing on both dimensions of the dual mandate  We face both unemployment that   is too high and inflation that is too low  This is not a new development due to recent weak   data—that’s my assessment  It’s a growing realization of the dilemma we face, in my opinion    The state of affairs should focus us squarely on what more we can do to stimulate demand  For   me, given the lack of conflict between our dual objectives, it’s hard to see why we wouldn’t want   to take some significant and meaningful additional measures  But I’ll hold off saying more until   the policy go-round  Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  My views on the pace of the recovery have   not changed radically  I have not materially altered my outlook, but, after quite a bit of thought,   I have come to the judgment that our monetary policy response is woefully inadequate for the   economic situation that we face  Consequently, I’ve come to favor a far more aggressive version   of alternative A that would include substantial additional purchases of Treasury securities   In order to use my time most effectively, I won’t go into any details on the wording of   alternative A, since I suspect it’s not a live option today  Instead, I will explain my reasoning,   which is basically this  The staff’s forecast for 2012 has the unemployment rate at 76 percent   and core inflation at 1 percent  As you mentioned, Mr Chairman, that’s a same-sided miss for   August 10, 2010 104 of 160             policy, and I think that’s very bad  Maybe my gut can persuade me that the staff forecast is a bit   too pessimistic, but hard quantitative analysis does not  Any optimism in my forecast relies too   heavily on unobserved inflation expectations remaining firm in the face of low actual inflation   and a general presumption that a more robust recovery ought to be inevitable given all of the   slack we see  The Tealbook analysis, which is state of the art, apparently unrivaled, has   incorporated both of these factors and more  I’ve come to the conclusion that anyone who takes   this forecast seriously must either (1) expect more monetary stimulus or (2) think that the Fed is   out of policy options  I think the public already understands how unacceptable the situation is    That’s certainly my inference from outreach discussions with businesses and the public   But let me be explicit within the terms of the economic analysis of our briefing   documents  I refer you to the exhibit on page 3 of Tealbook, Part B, the constrained versus   unconstrained monetary policy  I don’t think anybody can study this and not see “policy failure”   written all over it  The exhibit shows that if monetary policy were unconstrained by the zero   bound, we could lower 2012 unemployment by over a percentage point relative to the baseline   and put core inflation on a higher trajectory that comes closer to my price stability objective of   2 percent  Previous policy materials argued that this unconstrained policy path could be   approximated by an appropriate program of quantitative easing  I think this is what we should   aim for   In order to justify not acting, it seems necessary to view this analysis as wrong,   uninformative, or not actionable  Let’s consider these  What if the class of models underlying   this analysis is wrong?  We had an extended discussion of that possibility last year when we   talked about alternative approaches to inflation forecasting  However, my take-away from those   discussions was that there are currently no credible alternatives that can compete with this   August 10, 2010 105 of 160             analysis  Everyone would welcome alternatives that can confront the data on an equal footing   with a model like FRB/US  Where are they?  If this is wrong, what model is right?  I find this   analysis credible   What if this analysis is uninformative because the policymaker’s objective function   underlying the optimal policy simulations is misspecified?  The analysis weights employment   and inflation objectives equally  I think that makes sense, but even if a quasi-inflation nutter put   four times more weight on inflation, an inflation rate of 3 percent in 2012 would contribute as   much discomfort as the projected 7½ percent unemployment rate  And our current 95 percent   unemployment rate causes as much discomfort as a 4 percent inflation rate  We talk about   deflation  If inflation were zero, it contributes the same discomfort as if inflation were 4 percent    I believe this analysis passes the conservative central banker’s sniff test   Finally, and most importantly  What if there are no implementable policy alternatives   that can deliver the Tealbook’s unconstrained policy scenario, which is a thought experiment that   allows negative interest rates?  I’ve struggled with this  Although I have expressed reservations   about diminishing returns from our quantitative easing policies before, our dual mandate failures   are too large to ignore even what may be small improvements  If we take further aggressive   actions on asset purchases and state our commitment to improving the employment and inflation   trajectories, I suspect that investors will take at least some steps to seek higher returns, steps that   will improve performance on both parts of our dual mandate  For example, banks will more   quickly get to the point where they put less weight on recession-like perceptions of lending risk   and begin to lend out their excess reserves   In order to stop short of using more large-scale asset purchases of Treasuries, I would   have to put substantial weight on the combined possibility that doing so would (1) lead to   August 10, 2010 106 of 160             sustained inflation rising as far above 2 percent as we are currently below that target now and (2)   provide no improvement in the unemployment trajectory   I’m not aware of a credible quantitative analysis that delivers such a prediction  I suspect   that any outcome that brings inflation back to 2 percent will feature significantly increased levels   of bank lending, which would be very good for our employment objective  If money growth is   finally going to get inflation back to our target, broader monetary aggregates must increase, and   that would include bank lending   I’ve already used up a lot of time  If I had more time, I’d raise two other issues  One is   quasi-price-level targeting under these circumstances  The other is the need for a heightened role   for macro prudential regulation in this environment with large-scale asset purchases—that’s very   important  But I don’t have that time  So, in sum, I favor an aggressively enhanced version of   alternative A with substantial large-scale asset purchases of Treasury securities in addition to the   current elements of alternative A  Thank you, Mr Chairman     I don’t want to belabor this point, but I had the same reaction when I   looked at the minutes, and then I remembered, “Oh, yeah, that’s a members’ paragraph, always   has been”  Then I reminded myself that, in order to get certain views into the minutes, I needed   to express those views in the context of the outlook or the inflation discussions, focusing on the   merits of what the particular arguments were  I would think that those are the types of   September 21, 2010 7 of 151             participant comments that could be most readily incorporated  It’s really only at the end, where   you say, “But you know, in my opinion, X is what we ought to do”  So I think what you’ve   described is quite workable, Mr Chairman     Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The economy continues to grow, but the pace   of expansion is inadequate to meaningfully reduce the rolls of the unemployed at anything but a   glacial pace  With inflation significantly underrunning price stability, it takes quite a bit of   fortitude to muster a cheery disposition and discuss this outlook in public   At our directors’ meeting last week, my staff had that task  Our forecast had contours   much like the Tealbook—weak economic growth in the second half of this year, but an   inevitable pickup, with stronger growth rates of 3½ and 4½ percent in coming years  As one   director said, “If someone presented me with an industrial business plan that was premised on a   rosy national outlook like this, I would throw him out of the room”  All heads nodded in unison   September 21, 2010 54 of 151             I’m not saying that our captains of industry are right to be skeptical of such a growth   path, but their pessimism represents a significant headwind  Despite their gloomy view of the   outlook, our business contacts do continue to report modest growth of their own businesses—not   much different from last time—but they have no intention of doing any serious hiring  At best,   they are recalling some laid-off workers  For example, Caterpillar laid off 16,000 US workers   during the recession  Even though it reports robust sales since the start of the recovery, it has   rehired only 3,000  CDW, a discount computer retailer owned by a private equity firm, laid off   200 workers during the recession  Now its sales are at a higher rate than before the crisis, but it   has hired back only 25 of these workers  It seems a safe bet that small businesses are doing the   same  Businesses continue to fiercely defend their plans and point to substantial gains in   productivity as vindication  But much of this is due to aggressive cost-cutting rather than the   introduction of new technologies  In other words, they previously had substantial inefficiencies   in place, and the recession pushed them to get back on the efficient production frontier  Better   late than never, but this hardly seems to bode well for further strong future productivity gains   I would like to finish up by talking about two important issues  The first is about the way   that extreme consumer and business risk aversion have put us in what can be described as a   liquidity trap; the second is the extent to which so-called structural factors can be thought to   explain our very high unemployment rate   On liquidity traps, as I have noted, businesses appear to be very cautious in their outlook    The same is true for households, which are displaying enormous degrees of risk aversion due to   staggering employment risk, trillions of dollars of lost wealth, and debt levels that were chosen   when fundamentals appeared better but are burdensome today  Households have significantly   raised their saving rates, even though retail interest rates are effectively zero  Businesses are   September 21, 2010 55 of 151             content to post hefty profits on the strength of unprecedented cost-cutting rather than growing the   top line  Very conservative attitudes reign  Firms are sitting on their cash, and very few are   planning to expand workforces   Although it is trivial to get business contacts to rail against the uncertainties generated by   Washington, most that I’ve talked to can easily be coaxed into admitting that stronger demand   conditions would quickly change their plans  This is what is meant by a liquidity trap  Even   with short-term nominal rates at zero, the supply of savings exceeds the demand for investment    The real interest rate needs to be lower to adjust that  The modern liquidity trap literature   indicates that aggressive monetary accommodation that lifts inflation expectations and reduces   real interest rates can stimulate current demand  I think those are the policies we need to   consider  Indeed, in the absence of aggressive actions, the factors driving high risk aversion   could well stifle a meaningful recovery, keep unemployment high, and reinforce disinflationary   pressures   A second important issue is the extent to which today’s very high rate of unemployment   merely reflects a substantially higher natural rate that cannot be ameliorated by monetary policy    There are several reasons why the natural rate of unemployment has likely risen over the last   couple of years—for example, extra-long extended UI benefits, lower mobility due to   homeowners who are under water, and eroded skills due to long spells of unemployment  These   factors all suggest at least a temporarily higher natural rate  On the basis of the recent   improvements in the job openings data, some have suggested that there is little that monetary   policy can do about the current level of unemployment  It is due to skills mismatch  We have   already discussed this today  As noted in a recent Cleveland Fed piece, some of the apparent   September 21, 2010 56 of 151             conflict between unemployment and vacancy data may just be timing  We have seen such loops   in the Beveridge curve before, and that goes to President Yellen’s comments as well   But even if you take the job openings data at face value, I don’t think they support the   conclusion that the natural rate has risen to the vicinity of 96 percent  A simple stable   Beveridge curve based on a constant-returns Cobb-Douglas matching function—I guess this is   the geeky stuff, right, Jim?—estimated on pre-crisis data, captures very well the unemployment-  vacancy relationship through the end of last year  This is consistent with the increase in   unemployment being primarily due to a cyclical fall in labor demand rather than an increase in   mismatch or other structural factors  One might interpret this year’s increase in vacancies   without a corresponding improvement in unemployment as a shift in the Beveridge curve due to   a drop in the efficiency parameter and the matching function, but that doesn’t mean we are   anywhere near the new normal level of unemployment   Rather, making some plausible assumptions, my staff estimates that the typical level of   unemployment associated with a Beveridge curve passing through recent data is likely to be   about 7 percent  They can get a little bit higher—I think that’s the University of Chicago   influence that my staff has there  This is a figure that incorporates the effect of the temporary UI   extensions  I think that’s high, and I’m not suggesting that 7 percent is a good estimate of the   current natural rate  As I said, there are reasons to discount some of the improvement in vacancy   data  And most other attempts to quantify the current level of the natural rate come out lower,   like the Board staff’s recent adjustments  But even if one takes the vacancy data at face value   and accepts that the natural rate has risen to 7 percent, that still leaves a very large margin of   slack relative to the unemployment rate  Given this wide margin of slack, and the fact that we   September 21, 2010 57 of 151             are substantially underrunning our inflation target, I think it’s important for us to consider what   additional measures we can take to boost aggregate demand  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I wholeheartedly support your suggestion that   we make progress on developing a framework to deliver more accommodative monetary policy   September 21, 2010 82 of 151             if the Committee decides that that’s appropriate  From my comments in August and earlier   today, as well as my proposal for a state-contingent price level objective, it should be clear that I   believe the current situation should be analyzed as an economy that’s stuck in a bona fide   liquidity trap  With the federal funds rate approximately zero and the level of excess reserves   already at $1 trillion, only very special monetary policies are likely to be effective, in my   judgment  Consequently, although there is much for me to like in the language of alternatives   A1 and A2, I worry that another $500 billion of LSAPs, by themselves, won’t be sufficient, but   I’m happy to study that more and understand it better   Let me explain briefly my viewpoints on this  As I look at the optimal policy response   generated in the FRB/US charts on page 3 of Tealbook Part B, it looks as if the unemployment   rate could fall to 6¼ percent by the end of 2012, if the real federal funds rate were headed for   about minus 4 or minus 5 percent at the end of 2011  We can’t have negative nominal rates, but   an increase in short-term inflation expectations to nearly 3 or 4 percent would get us close to   such a negative real rate  This is where I can hear coughing and gnashing of teeth and calls for   the Spanish Inquisition  Nevertheless, this is the logic of the liquidity trap analysis  Saving is   too high, investment of all types, including employment, is too low, and nominal interest rates   cannot move appreciably lower to correct the excess supply of savings  Additional purchases of   Treasuries alone may merely swell excess reserves  At best, portfolio-balance effects from   further purchases will lower long rates only modestly, not enough to give a significant boost to   economic activity, in my opinion  Studying the liquidity trap literature has convinced me that a   policy to achieve a state-contingent price level objective is probably the most effective means   available to us   September 21, 2010 83 of 151             I circulated the skeletal framework of a proposal  For the sake of brevity, I will simply   point out three attributes of a price level objective as I see it  First, in announcing a target path   for which inflation has already underrun the path, markets should begin to price in an expectation   of higher inflation, and thus real rates will decline  The larger the price gap is, the larger will be   the decline in real rates  If the market response is delayed, the inflation deficit will increase, and   the eventual decline in real rates will be even larger   Second, a firm, resolute, and credible commitment to the state-contingent price level   objective has big benefits  If markets believe in our commitment to respond to an increasing   inflation deficit, they will understand the risks they face if they fail to price these actions sooner   rather than later  If markets understand our explicit commitment to exit this policy, future   inflation expectations will converge to our ultimate price stability objective, which I put at   2 percent   Third, in the context of a price level objective, additional purchases of Treasury securities   can play an important role in signaling the Committee’s commitment to achieving the price level   objective  So I think we should do both  Also, by clearly laying out the rationale for exiting our   state-contingent objective, we present the case for why the public should not fear that we may be   monetizing the debt  I personally believe that risk is overblown, but this policy is a strong   mitigant to that risk  That’s my summary, in brief, of the price level objective proposal  There’s   much more in the document that I circulated   I recognize that a proper foundation for such a policy action today has not been laid, so   let me point out some language in the current alternatives that seems challenging to me  In   alternative B, we continue to include the phrase, “The Committee anticipates a gradual return to   higher levels of resource utilization in the context of price stability, although the pace of   September 21, 2010 84 of 151             economic recovery is likely to be modest in the near term”  Does “context of price stability”   mean that we will be within a close neighborhood of 1¾ to 2 percent within a few quarters, a few   years, or does it mean that we won’t overshoot 2 percent?  I think this sentence has become   increasingly inoperative  I don’t really know how to interpret or speak about it in public  I think   taking out “in the context of price stability” would help, although I recognize that that probably   leaves other problems behind   I also think it’s clearly time to point out that inflation is underrunning our notion of price   stability  To the extent that the Committee is not at a consensus on this price stability, is it   because our inflation projections differ, or is it our definitions of price stability that differ?  I   have said 2 percent  President Lacker earlier said 1½ percent  That’s consistent with the way   we’ve talked about this in the past  In the past, we’ve had the luxury of finessing this issue   because it didn’t matter too much, but I think today it matters  So I worry about that   The Tealbook discussion of alternative B also says that market participants have   indicated a strong desire for greater clarity about the threshold for action  I agree that that’s   important  I think we need to be more explicit, and the language here—“additional   accommodation”—seems kind of vague, so I’m not quite sure what the reaction will be   Finally, I have a point on A1  I’m talking about this because you mentioned this as a   potential mockup of what we could be looking at  I’m troubled by the analysis of the language   in A1 focusing on explicitly mentioning that inflation is running below our mandate of 2 percent   or a bit less  I simply don’t believe this could be a game-changer that would reduce real interest   rates enough  I think it would be poorly received if our announcement suggested much greater   emphasis on inflation alone and, thus, diminished our dual mandate focus, which includes   September 21, 2010 85 of 151             employment  I know Bill talked about that a little bit  Communicating that confidently will be   very important and difficult   In sum, I think we need an aggressive monetary policy response that has a real hope of   reducing real interest rates enough to overcome the excess saving and risk aversion that   characterizes liquidity-trapped economies  I strongly agree with your suggestion that we study   this more  Thank you very much, Mr Chairman     I wanted to say Teutonic     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ve stated my views at previous meetings, so   perhaps I can keep my remarks today brief   We should adopt a framework that will last throughout the current period, which I think of   as a liquidity trap  That probably means it should last until the unemployment rate is in the 6 to   6½ percent range  I think a new framework can help a lot  I think it could help today  I think it’s   risky to remain complacent about the current situation, but I won’t go into that too much today  We   could use this framework to help increase accommodation soon  I believe being explicit about our   October 15, 2010 23 of 62             dual mandate objectives is always preferred  But given our current situation, I would say it’s as   important now as ever  Therefore, on question 1, I continue to prefer option 3, a state-contingent   price-level objective; for maximum effectiveness in hitting both elements of our dual mandate, we   would target a specified price level  Once we reach that price level, we would clearly revert to a   2 percent inflation target, in which future misses on either side of 2 percent would be bygones—that   would be option 2  I know this is viewed as a communications challenge  I’ve found that, at least   among academics who hear about this, they seem to get it pretty quickly  I think we could work   hard and regularly to enhance understanding of it among the public  I won’t downplay the   challenge, but I think it’s doable  If we were to adopt option 2, we’d leave open the possibility of   choosing option 3—price-level targeting—next year if the situation continues to be unsatisfactory    I’d be concerned that we’d have to do that   Turning to questions 2 and 3, we need to construct additional policy actions to be consistent   with the chosen framework  I think we should start with more LSAPs  I’m not sure I appropriately   grasp the distinctions between “shock and awe” and a flexible approach  Let me just describe my   preference  I would prefer to start with a total volume of asset purchases calibrated to be on the   order of a 100 basis point cut in the funds rate  Using the staff’s rule of thumb, this would be about   $700 billion  I’d announce the overall level of purchases now and say that they would be expected   to be completed by May 2011  Then, we’d review events at each meeting  We’d want to take some   time to see how the overall purchase announcements affect the economy  As we get closer to the   May 2011 completion, we’d begin to comment on any further actions that would be necessary   This would be difficult for everybody to understand  But if we have a framework that   indicates very clearly what our objectives are, that would help a lot—for example, if we had a   price-level target, or even an inflation target at 2 percent, or whatever number was agreeable, that   October 15, 2010 24 of 62             would be helpful  That would provide forward guidance about what our future actions are likely to   be and presumably about the LSAP path  I don’t think option 1 would help us at all in that regard—  it would make it more difficult   For question number 4, I think the statements are good structures  Statement 3 is the closest   to the option that I prefer; I think it needs slight wording edits, but I won’t go into that now  I think   the language on the dual mandate is important as long as it is our legislated mandate  I don’t know   how we get around that   Finally, I acknowledge that communicating what we’re doing will be challenging, but I   don’t think it’s impossible  I would suggest some kind of press conference following the   announcement as long as we have a framework, and you, Mr Chairman, could clearly state what   the sense of the Committee was and that it was relatively narrow—that is, not too divergent  I think   a framework would help  I think speeches can help, as can technical reports  Thank you, Mr   Chairman     Could I ask a question?  Vice Chairman Yellen—     Governor Yellen  Oh, in this Committee—     Regarding your subcommittee, I think it would be useful to refresh our   understanding of the blackout period  I understand that it goes until Friday—it might have even   gone through the weekend originally—but I think that many of us have run afoul of Friday   because of things like conferences  For example, I have the greatest respect for former Governor   Kohn, but even he could run afoul of this because of some speech that he was asked to give in   Europe  So that would be one topic for your committee—just refreshing that understanding and   maybe having a light tap on the wrist for certain types of things like that   Here’s another issue  To the extent that we’re clearer on what our objectives are and on   the framework that we’re using, a lot of these discussions become less important or newsworthy,   so that’s something to consider     There’s a more trivial explanation than that   November 2–3, 2010 35 of 238               When you fill this out, it says if you disagree, please explain why  The   only way you can explain or provide any color is to disagree  [Laughter]  So it’s biased towards   saying that you disagree     Yes, you could  I think I encouraged my staff to do that this time     Mr Chairman, could I just ask a question?     President Plosser, I didn’t hear—what was the inflation objective you   stated?     Oh, I thought you did     Yes, okay  Thank you     I’m very glad that’s on the record  [Laughter]   November 2–3, 2010 57 of 238               Thank you, Mr Chairman  I should forgo trying to defend my golf game,   because it shares the same property as Warren Buffett’s jet—it’s indefensible  [Laughter]   My economic outlook has not changed appreciably  I see the US economy as mired in a   liquidity trap of immense proportions  Nothing from my business and community reports   contradicts this view  There were two virtually unanimous themes I heard from businesspeople    First, earnings are good, but they are driven almost entirely by bottom-line cost-cutting, not top-  line growth  Second, I am viewed almost as impertinent when I ask about future hiring plans—  no business, large or small, reported any meaningful hiring plans at any relevant horizon    Although the recovery continues, it is weak, and there are currently no clear indicators of   building forward momentum  The single most important factor in my projections for firmer   growth in 2011 and beyond is the sheer inevitability of such a recovery  After all, how much   longer can the economy run with pent-up demands going unfulfilled and only replacement   demands being met?   November 2–3, 2010 66 of 238             But to achieve stronger growth, we need to see more from the consumer  One   manufacturer articulated the mood perfectly when he asked, “How much longer can my business   and industrial segment continue to grow three times faster than consumer demand?”  As I sort   through the impediments facing the economy, this type of real-world business observation seems   exactly right in putting more weight on inadequate aggregate demand than on regulation, unusual   labor market frictions, or other such factors   In the balance of my remarks I’d like to focus on the inflation situation, and I want to do   this in the spirit of a policy viewpoint that puts primary weight on our price stability mandate;   that is, I want to try to channel the views of what Mervyn King has called a quasi-inflation   nutter  Such a person would say that the Fed has a dual mandate to promote maximum   sustainable growth and price stability but sees achieving price stability—reasonably low and   stable inflation—as the best way of ensuring maximum sustainable growth  This rhetoric has   often seemed quite reasonable during a variety of periods when I’ve been observing the FOMC   in action   Within this context, I want to make three points  First, I take it as given that monetary   policy is fully responsible for the trajectory of inflation—inflation is a monetary phenomenon    We are accountable for whether inflation is too high or too low or just right  Most of us have   indicated that “just right” is somewhere in the neighborhood of 2 percent  So inflation of 3 or   4 percent would be a monetary policy failure that monetary policy would have to respond to    And inflation of 1 percent, even if it’s stable, also would be a failure that monetary policy would   have to respond to   Second, my outlook is for continued low inflation, low enough that monetary policy has   an obligation to address it  The Tealbook forecast of core PCE inflation of 1 percent for 2012 is   November 2–3, 2010 67 of 238             highly credible, in my opinion  I know this is a controversial statement for some, but indicators   of future inflationary pressures must put a heavy weight on resource slack  I just don’t see any   alternative credible explanations for our recent experience  Consider that, back in October 2007,   the central tendency of our projections for core PCE inflation in 2010—that is, this year—was   16 to 19 percent  Today we expect 2010 inflation to come in substantially lower, at about   1 percent  What has happened since those 2007 projections were constructed?  The federal funds   rate has been slashed from over 4 percent to 0  Everything else equal, doesn’t that lead to greater   inflationary pressures, not lower?  Our monetary base and our balance sheet have exploded in an   unprecedented and unexpected way  Doesn’t that, too, lead to greater inflationary pressures, not   lower?  To me, it seems inescapable that the real reason we have experienced lower inflation is   that we have suffered through a financial crisis, and a great recession, with an unemployment   rate that is still 96 percent  With substantial resource slack persisting into the future, inflation is   very likely to be too low for too long  And, remember, that inflation projection must be a result   of our monetary policy—inflation is a monetary phenomenon, as I said in my first point   Third, even in the role of a quasi-inflation nutter, I can argue that the current low-  inflation outlook is detrimental to supporting sustainable economic growth  This is an argument   that President Rosengren made earlier  I take this view in part because I take our inflation   objective to be 2 percent—that’s what most of us have said, and that’s, at least, what the public   has expected, judging by most measures of inflation expectations  When inflation is lower than   households and businesses previously expected, ex post real interest rates are higher  This   contributes to restrictive financial conditions that impede growth  For example, there is a large   and wide spectrum of fixed-rate consumer debt that was undertaken with an expectation of   inflation rates higher than 1 percent  Those payments have a higher real burden now, implying a   November 2–3, 2010 68 of 238             higher probability of default, and default and bankruptcy have real costs  Of course, there are   other channels by which having an inflation path closer to our perceived objective would be   beneficial for economic growth  So, again, 2012 core PCE inflation of 1 to 1¼ percent, no   matter how stable, ranks as monetary policy falling down on the job   Finally, I’d like to make a couple of points on the problems caused by our lack of a   shared understanding of our goals  It is our job to argue over inflation projections  I have my   perspective, and others have their views  We argue to get better policy decisions, and that’s a   virtue  But we likely also disagree over the objectives for inflation—that’s one reason that, when   President Plosser was talking, I thought I heard something, and I wanted to make sure if I did  If   some of us say 2 percent but others say 1 percent, or 1½ percent, we have a consistency problem;   it’s not wrong, it’s just confusing  Here’s an example  If we’re on a road trip from here to the   West Coast, it’s one thing to question what the last several exit signs actually said about whether   we’re on course or not  But if some on the bus think we’re headed for LA and others think   Seattle, we sound incompetent and lose a great deal of credibility  I don’t get on a bus if I think   the driver doesn’t know where we’re going   Unless we can anchor the Committee’s understanding of what monetary policy is seeking   to accomplish, I don’t understand how we can do our jobs, when we are surely not being   transparent  Now, apparently, almost all foreign central banks think like this  I asked my staff to   review the attendee list at this year’s Jackson Hole conference—Tom has expanded the number   of central banks that attend by quite a lot this past year  My staff says that, of the ones we could   track down—and we couldn’t find Malawi and a couple of others—only two banks failed to have   an explicit numerical guideline for their nominal responsibilities, either for inflation or an   November 2–3, 2010 69 of 238             exchange rate peg  Those central banks are the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan—and I’m   troubled by that  Thank you, Mr Chairman      Thank you, Mr Chairman  I had a question about the wording in   alternative A and the intention there  In paragraph 4, you have some forward guidance, and in   November 2–3, 2010 130 of 238             particular the phrase, “the Committee continues to anticipate that, with such a policy stance,   inflation in the intermediate term will not exceed levels consistent with its mandate”  What is   the intention of this type of phrase?  What’s your expectation?  What are we trying to convey   there?  Does this mean that, as inflation begins to rise to the mandate level, there would be a   presumption that it would never go over by a tenth, or what?  That’s the issue that I have—the   public’s and our interpretation of this       So are you supposed to rise smoothly and not overshoot at all, or would it   allow some overshooting?     That’s not today’s push     Well, I just wanted to ask a question and offer a reaction to something that   has come up at the last several meetings  I second the proposal of characterizing what optimal   policy is in some way that we could better appreciate  President Bullard was absolutely correct   when he pointed out that, after a big shock, optimal policy could well lead to fairly substantial   gaps, or however you want to describe this outcome  But it’s also the case that bad policy would   lead to gaps like that, too, and we need to understand why the current situation should be   characterized as optimal and not simply bad  [Laughter]  I mean, there is just a presumption   here     I second the proposal for clarity on all of these objectives     Thank you, Mr Chairman  On the whole, I favor greater monetary policy   accommodation to reduce our dual mandate losses  The inflation outlook greatly underruns my   assessment of our mandate-consistent objective, and resource slack is much too large  We need   to provide monetary conditions that support a clear downward trajectory for unemployment   sooner than what is in the current outlook  I favor additional quantitative easing along the lines   described in alternative B  I might ultimately prefer a larger figure than the $600 billion in   alternative B, but the stated intention to adjust the program as needed provides sufficient scope   for adequate additional actions  I would not really favor any language like “up to”—if anything,   I might favor “at least” $600 billion   Having said this, I have a number of concerns about our strategy going forward  My   bottom line is that we can do better by providing greater clarity about our intentions  There is   reason to be skeptical that the magnitude of $600 billion in Treasury purchases will have a large   effect on long rates, and others have spoken on that  Although, Mr Chairman, you made an   excellent case last night, my own view is that LSAPs would be a more effective policy tool if   they were combined with clearer communication regarding future monetary policy  Real interest   rates will decline further if the public clearly understands that the LSAPs represent part of a   concerted plan to get inflation at least up to our objective  Communicating our policy goals   November 2–3, 2010 162 of 238             would also clarify the conditionality of our “extended period” of low interest rates  This   communication task would be much easier if we had an explicit inflation objective  Knowing   our target, the public and markets could make credible inferences on their own about how long   we will need to keep interest rates low  We then would not need to use complex language such   as that in alternative A   I continue to see big downsides to the status quo approach to describing our objectives  I   worry that our qualitative descriptions only paper over significant differences in objectives  In   the not too distant future, this qualitative approach will lead to much misunderstanding on the   part of the public  Those of us who were around for the communication subcommittees over the   last 10 years remember how difficult it was to construct a qualitative statement that survived the   stress tests we imposed on them   Let me use the current statement as an example of such problems  Consider the phrase   “the unemployment rate is elevated”  First off, frankly, this seems a touch clueless to me at   96 percent, but I’m not going to talk about it anymore  Imagine how this language is likely to   evolve over time  If unemployment goes to double digits, which modifier of “elevated” becomes   appropriate?  “Really” elevated?  Next, what about when unemployment falls to 78 percent?    Will it still be “elevated?”  I think so  This is a tougher call  If it’s simply high, does that mean   it’s less important?  How will changes in modifiers be interpreted?  It’s going to be an issue  I   think a reasonable statement would be one that expresses dissatisfaction with the lack of   substantial evidence of a downward trajectory for unemployment over the next 12 months; I   haven’t studied it, but that sounds more like the earlier language, as President Lockhart just   mentioned   November 2–3, 2010 163 of 238             I also am nervous about the statement of flexible review in paragraph 5 of alternative B,   in which the Committee will regularly review the pace and size of its purchases and “will adjust   the program as needed to best foster maximum employment and price stability”  I agree with the   intent, but I simply don’t know how the public can draw meaningful inferences about our   reaction function from this statement without more clarity on our inflation and unemployment   objectives  And our differences of opinion have already been raised numerous times this   morning   Finally, if you give any consideration to the view that today’s situation is both   extraordinary and unacceptable, I don’t see how the “go slow” approach of Bill Brainard could   be viewed as optimal or even best—I’m referring to some of the thoughts that you expressed last   night, Mr Chairman  Our misses are large  As I mentioned earlier, I think that bad policy would   also lead to large misses  There’s great uncertainty about the effectiveness of our policy tools   and whether they will enable us to begin the process of adjustment back to a better equilibrium   Some people have used the term “geeky”—I prefer to call this “super rocket science”    [Laughter]  The optimal control dynamics are screaming for robust approaches, that is, large,   decisive actions in the face of potentially impotent tools  But I understand that the truly large   actions are not on the table today  The reason I earlier poked at the language in alternative A that   discussed inflation rising to our mandate levels is my concern about take-back risk, or smaller   versions of 1937 risk  For our policies to be effective, the public is going to have to expect that   we’re going to be easing for some time; that inflation is going to be returning to where it ought to   be; and that maybe we might even overshoot a little bit  We can’t fine-tune that type of thing  I   think it will be a big problem for us to get the economy moving towards escape velocity if the   November 2–3, 2010 164 of 238             public worries greatly that a risk-averse Fed will not follow through with adequate actions to   meet the dual mandate    In closing, I think your arguments, Mr Chairman, for $600 billion in LSAPs are very   strong  It does have a little bit of a threading-the-needle feel to me, and I would much prefer to   be more aggressive  Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  On balance, the outlook for economic growth   seems a bit better than at our last meeting  I have been heartened by a few more optimistic   signals from the incoming data and from my business and community contacts  In addition, I   think the prospect of greater near-term fiscal stimulus is a positive development and helps reduce   uncertainty somewhat   Still, in my discussions with contacts, their positive comments continue to have a   somewhat special and one-off tone, as opposed to reflecting expectations of sustained stronger   December 14, 2010 43 of 127             growth  Automakers expect industry sales next year to be about a million units higher than in   2010, a healthy increase, but perhaps a plateau unless accompanied by a more pronounced   improvement in household balance sheets and income prospects  And, currently, adding workers   is not a priority for the auto sector  Heavy equipment manufacturers are benefiting from global   demand for commodities and agricultural products  But, again, even in this sector that’s doing so   well, their hiring intentions are minimal  Clearly, the economic recovery is continuing, but I   expect we will be dogged into mid-2011 by concerns over whether or not the economy is   achieving escape velocity   Specifically, escape velocity would ensure a self-sustaining growth path that moves us   more assuredly towards our objectives for inflation and employment without a continuing strong   push from policy  Still, I think the economy and policy have made progress since I began   expressing stronger concerns last August, although the feasibility of the firewall around Spain in   Nathan’s discussion seemed troubling to me   Turning to inflation, I agree with the Tealbook’s analysis that transient price movements   probably overstate the degree of disinflation over the past several months and that the current   underlying trend in core PCE inflation is likely closer to 1 percent  Of course, because monetary   policy acts with considerable lags regarding inflation, we always need to look at what the   forward-looking inflation indicators are pointing to  Here’s my list  First, considerable research   has pointed to the inconvenient fact that statistical inflation forecasts have trouble beating a   simple random walk forecast  If you accept this finding, then you would say today’s low   inflation experience is likely to be around for the forecastable future  Personally, I don’t find   random walk forecasts to be a constructive perspective when monetary policy is either very   December 14, 2010 44 of 127             restrictive or highly accommodative, but this finding has been mentioned often in the past, and   today it implies very low inflation pressures   Second, are we currently seeing cost pressures that might be forward indicators of higher   inflation?  Commodity costs have been in the news a lot  I recently met with a unique set of   experts on commodities when I paid a visit to the headquarters of Caterpillar in Peoria  This is a   large manufacturing company whose business today is thriving on high global commodity prices   and the incentives for increased mining that go with those price signals, so they’re really tuned   into the commodity price picture  They’re producing a lot of big machines that people are   buying and shipping around the world  Nevertheless, their business forecasts for US inflation   are quite low  They believe resource slack will prevent high commodity prices from bleeding   into our top-line inflation numbers  In addition, it is difficult to see any general upward   inflationary pressure coming from labor costs in the current environment  After all, unit labor   costs have been falling, and unemployment is high, although the coal compensation component   seems to be rising  I thought that was one of Dave’s best jokes     That is austere  Finally, what about inflation expectations?  Survey   measures of inflation continue to be low  TIPS break-even rates and inflation swaps have risen   over the past several months  Still, the TIPS increases have only retraced the declines that   occurred last spring and summer, and back in April before the TIPS decline, the Greenbook—it   was a Greenbook back then—had a core PCE inflation forecast of 09 percent in 2010 and   beyond  So, ultimate inflation pressures were quite similar  In sum, the risks of unacceptably   higher inflation are small over the relevant policy horizon, and I certainly agree with your   comments, Mr Chairman, that we could address any unexpected and damaging inflation   December 14, 2010 45 of 127             developments quickly should they occur  However, at the moment I’m much more concerned   that inflation will continue to run below mandate-consistent levels  In fact, it would be a very   positive development if inflation rose more quickly, at least to 2 percent   I just wanted to mention that I disagreed with Governor Warsh’s characterization of the   rise in inflation at the last meeting that he referred to as the nominal revenue channel  You   know, that’s more money illusion, and this finding that higher inflation would be beneficial   comes out of fully optimizing models where there is no money illusion  By lowering real rates,   such a development would help us to do better on our employment objective  It would change   opportunity costs, and it is difficult to imagine strongly sustained higher inflation without growth   in broad monetary aggregates, bank lending, and growth more generally  So, as of now, in my   judgment, the pace of economic recovery and inflation outlook continues to be too weak to be   consistent with our mandates for the relevant forecast horizon, but things are better today  Thank   you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support alternative B  Nothing has changed   sufficiently since our November meeting to suggest any other course of action  Inflation is too   far below our mandate and resource slack remains very large, and I don’t see either of these   conditions changing very soon  Risk aversion is still holding back spending  Businesses   continue to accumulate cash rather than undertake expansionary investment activities or increase   staffing  Households remain cautious in their spending plans and are further reducing debt   Lower real interest rates would reduce incentives to save and expand demand  However,   we can’t get there now through lower nominal rates because of the zero lower bound  We   continue to be mired in what I refer to as a liquidity trap  Reducing real rates now would require   inflation moving up closer to our mandate levels  It is disappointing that longer-term Treasury   rates have risen so much since we last met, but it seems clear that these increases reflect   nonmonetary events as well as reduced expectations for monetary accommodation  Others have   spoken on this, so I’ll let those comments stand  It seems clear that reducing our intended   Treasury purchases now would only add to these negative influences in an unhelpful manner  So   I do support alternative B   December 14, 2010 92 of 127             With the risks that we face and the magnitude of our shortfalls, it will be important to   continue evaluating our current programs and policies  So I certainly agree with other comments   on this matter  As I look at 2011, I see we have several tools that could provide additional   monetary accommodation if that proved to be necessary, and we are using two of them now  I   think the most powerful one is the FOMC’s commitment to keep short-term interest rates low for   an “extended period” of time  Stating that commitment more explicitly with a likely calendar   date could be a helpful boost, if that were necessary, as in alternative A  A second tool is our   larger balance sheet  It also signals a firm commitment to low interest rates as necessary relative   to our dual mandate objectives  We can add a third tool  Strengthening our commitment to an   explicit inflation objective would be an additional instrument to signal the future path of policy    President Plosser’s concerns about too much emphasis on the unemployment rate could be   addressed in part by stating our inflation objective more explicitly  I think it would be easier for   us to navigate how much weight we’re putting on those two channels  We would still disagree,   perhaps, on where we stand, but I think that that would be, on balance, beneficial  And fourth, it   would be helpful to be willing to entertain having inflation at times come in slightly above our   mandate  This would be a natural feature of an unbiased policy based on symmetric losses about   our inflation objective   I personally worry a bit about the language that has been used—“our goal is 2 percent or   a bit less”—which perhaps suggests that 2 percent is a ceiling on inflation, and that could add   additional policy cost  I’m just not sure how people are interpreting that, and it bothers me a bit    I think it would be useful to discuss that at some point  The Tealbook box on policy   commitment and discretion is instructive on this issue about inflation rising a bit above 2 percent   for a period of time  When policy commits to achieving its goals by keeping interest rates low   December 14, 2010 93 of 127             for an “extended period” and allowing inflation to go very modestly above the 2 percent   objective, while not exceeding 2½ percent, the growth and inflation outcomes are better in those   economic analyses   Finally, a number of people have mentioned political risks, and I agree that those exist    Will we be afraid to take further actions due to this criticism?  I think this cuts both ways, and   I’m not really sure how to evaluate these concerns about policy risk  I prefer to think about it on   the merits of what the economy needs and take the heat that we’re supposed to take when that’s   the best action   All that said, I find alternative B to be an acceptable policy today, although I think it has   a stiffer dose of hope than I really prefer  Thank you, Mr Chairman     In the house price example, it’s pretty easy  I usually just say that I’ve   seen a number of analyses from the private sector where many people are calling for a further   price decline of 10 percent or whatever, and I would assume that’s unobjectionable     Could you remind us what the forces in EDO are that would have the   unemployment rate move around the way that President Lacker is talking about?  I just don’t   recall     Whenever we talk about structural unemployment—I realize that there are   different definitions that probably are relevant to this—it seems to me that it’s inevitably about   the limits of monetary policy  There are at least a couple of different views that one could take    One is that you might think that monetary policy is not capable of improving the unemployment   rate at any time, in other words, unconditionally that is not really appropriate for monetary   policy  If that’s your viewpoint, this discussion really is not very important at all, because these   issues never come up  Or you could take the view that unemployment is amenable to changes in   monetary policy  I take that view  And you could worry about ineffectual attempts to reduce the   unemployment rate through monetary policy, that is, the case where monetary policy gets to the   point where it can’t reduce the unemployment rate without somehow spurring more inflation  I   would say that’s a very important issue, and that’s how I interpret these analyses  If there’s   another perspective, I’m not quite sure what that perspective would be, and I’d enjoy some   discussion of it   My best assessment of these excellent and very broad analyses is that the contributions of   mismatch are relatively small compared with the 94 percent unemployment rate, which would   imply that there’s still room for monetary policy  Another point that seems to come out of this, if   I understood it correctly, is that mismatch is relatively transitory  We brought this issue up as a   potential obstacle to effective monetary policy actions, and if it were something that is   permanent or at least persistent, that would be troubling  But it seems that, as the unemployment   rate begins to go down, it’s likely that this mismatch is going to decline, too, so the structural   unemployment rate will go down  Following that course, I don’t think it would have substantial   inflationary effects if we were quite accommodative for quite some time  If mismatch is higher,   January 25–26, 2011 34 of 282              then we should expect to see inflation higher  That’s a test for us, and we could respond   appropriately   In terms of the analysis, I do have one question, and I’d enjoy hearing your perspectives   on it  I noted that there was not a lot about dispersion in wage growth  There’s structural   unemployment, and then there are wages, and the questions are how wages might respond and   what role monetary policy could have in that  If mismatch were a big deal—with some   industries doing poorly, and other industries doing well but struggling to find qualified   workers—I might have thought that would show up in wage growth dispersion and that there’d   be some sectors where things are pretty strong, so we’d see big differences in wage growth   across industries  But my staff showed me data that says dispersion is lower than normal  Do   you have any thoughts or comments about that?     I wanted to pick up on something very interesting that President   Kocherlakota raised and that ties in to some commentary that President Fisher has made before    Narayana started off by talking about whether or not something is invariant to a monetary policy   intervention  As I have understood President Fisher’s comments, businesspeople are very   concerned about new regulations, health care reform, and so on, in part because they don’t know   exactly how much that is going to cost  I have heard this from them myself  These higher labor   January 25–26, 2011 43 of 282              costs induce them to change their production processes, in part to go towards a higher-skilled and   higher-wage worker  That’s part of a capital–labor choice, and it depends on relative prices   My thought is that something that is perhaps not invariant to monetary policy is wages    There’s a lot of resource slack out there, a lot of people unemployed  And if wages were lower,   that would be an offset to these business costs, right?  I tried to engage my directors on this point   at our last meeting  I acknowledged the commentary about higher business costs and asked what   if real wages were 20 percent lower—I purposely chose an outlandish number  Interestingly,   they just refused to engage in that discussion  Instead, in their commentary, they talked about   demand effects, saying that they really are not comfortable that the demand is going to be there    So I think that unemployment that is attributable to firms’ concerns about higher business costs   is potentially amenable to monetary policy, in the sense that a hike in prices in an environment of   sticky wages could lower real wages  I agree completely the question is  What is invariant to   policy?  And I think that if you think about this more carefully, there are a lot of things that can   be affected by policy     My own view is that we’ve been in a liquidity trap, and we’re stuck at this   interest rate, so higher inflation is one aspect that would lead to a solution     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Many of my business contacts started off   saying that things weren’t that much different from our last call  As we talked further, it usually   became clear that their attitudes continued to improve this month  My inference is that their   businesses are picking up in line with their rising expectations  For example, manufacturers have   been doing well recently and are saying they expect that to continue  The Chicago purchasing   managers’ survey rose sharply in December and picked up further in January to its highest level   in more than 20 years—that result will be released January 31  More firms appear to be   expecting increases in demand and laying the groundwork to expand production when the time   comes  ArcelorMittal reported record sales to steel service centers who are building inventory in   anticipation of demand, and this is coming on top of a good base of orders from automakers and   other original equipment manufacturers   Many firms remain reluctant to make permanent additions to workforces  However, the   CEO of Manpower told me that many of their client firms have asked them to be ready to supply   more temps in the next few months  The clients are expecting a burst of demand, but they are   uncertain about the timing, and, when it does materialize, they expect to have a hard time hiring   workers quickly enough by themselves  He also mentioned that a number of firms have   openings that they are taking longer than usual to fill  These companies feel that there are a lot   of good people out there right now, and, with demand not fully recovered, they can afford to wait   January 25–26, 2011 100 of 282              and make sure they get the best person  This is probably consistent with the results that we saw   yesterday on the drop in recruiting intensity   With regard to costs, although there is talk about higher commodity prices, few of the   increases are being transmitted into higher prices for final goods and services at the moment    Manufacturing CEOs that I spoke with suggested that their planning for these cost increases was   still adequate to avoid outsized price increases  They do devote considerable resources to   managing these costs, and, at the moment, they think things are okay   US steel manufacturers are trying to decide how much capacity to bring back online    This is a difficult decision, given foreign competition  Foreign orders today would hit the market   in six to eight weeks, about the same length of time as domestic capacity would take to ramp up,   so, if it came at the same time, that would be bad for prices, in their view  Looking ahead, these   forces are a potential dampening factor for currently high steel prices  Pass-through is also an   issue  One of our financial contacts noted that hedge funds are shorting firms that are exposed to   commodity price increases on the assumption that they lack the pricing power to pass these   higher costs on to customers  We’ll see   I see the anecdotes as being consistent with the incoming data, which show that activity is   on a better upward trajectory right now  I hope this momentum will build into more consistently   solid growth than we saw in the first year and a half of the recovery  We need it, because we’ve   got a long way to go   The Board and Bank staff analyses on labor markets summarized yesterday have been   helpful in honing my thinking about current resource gaps  Undoubtedly, the baseline for   unemployment has risen some, but there continues to be substantial slack in labor markets  And   January 25–26, 2011 101 of 282              if monetary policy can help ameliorate this unsatisfactorily slow decline in unemployment, that’s   our policy job, in my judgment   Turning to the outlook, our forecast for economic growth and inflation and the rationales   underlying them are broadly similar to the Tealbook’s  With regard to growth, I’m more   optimistic today than I was at our last meeting, but I need to see several more months of   consistently better data—say, running through the spring—to be pretty confident that we’ve   experienced the sustainable step-up in growth that’s in our forecast   With regard to inflation, our forecast has it rising some over time but still coming in   under 1½ percent in 2013  Our battery of statistical approaches to forecasting inflation continues   to point primarily at further declines or, at most, flat inflation at a low level  However, we   decided to go with an inflation projection that rises somewhat over time on the basis of what   appear to be inflation expectations that return towards a mandate-consistent level  That’s what   we need, but it still seems a touch speculative to me  We’ll actually have to see underlying   inflation move up in line with these forecasts in order to have confidence in these expectational   effects  In light of these forecasts, I see only a small risk that we’ll face an unpleasant conflict   between our employment and inflation goals over the foreseeable future  Thank you, Mr   Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I want to start by talking about the Chicago   Bears  I was going to try to link this point somehow to President Fisher’s discussion of the   Texas Aggies the last time, but, instead, I’m going to link it to paragraph 1  I’ve been in Chicago   now for almost 20 years, and I’ve reluctantly come to embrace the Bears  This year, the Bears   really weren’t that great of a team—the fundamentals weren’t really that good  But, somehow,   things picked up, and they made the playoffs, and they made the championship game  Then,   with all of the buzz in town, people got excited  And if you lost your discipline, you could sort   of convince yourself that the Bears were really quite good  [Laughter]  And, you know, they   were quite good  However, they ran into a team that beat them, and that’s because the   fundamentals really were not as good as everybody had come to believe  And I think that the   economy is a little bit like that  We’ve had some good numbers recently  That’s very helpful,   but the fundamentals are not quite as strong as we’d like  So I’d prefer paragraph 1 in alternative   B as it is written—it’s closer, certainly, to the way I view things   Mr Chairman, I support alternative B, and I view it as having several essential elements    Let me elaborate on my reasoning  As I first began articulating in the summer of 2010, I   continue to hold the view that the US economy requires aggressive monetary policy   accommodation in order to be confident that we will escape our current liquidity trap conditions    These conditions emerged following a recession of historic proportions, an unusually rapid fall in   underlying inflation, and a financial crisis that erased $11 trillion of net wealth at current count    These lost funds represent savings that households were banking on for future consumption and   things such as college and retirement needs  I think the growth in the US economy will be   restrained by these losses for some time  The fundamentals are still sort of weak  Under your   leadership, Mr Chairman, our subsequent policies have been very helpful for improving the   January 25–26, 2011 163 of 282              economy’s trajectory, and I fully supported them, and I agree with President Bullard’s   assessment of the asset purchase programs, although, of course, others can disagree about that   However, my preferred policy course would have added an explicit and potentially   substantial policy boost by adopting a state-contingent price-level target  Such a   communications tool would still add a welcome commitment that our accommodation will not be   withdrawn prematurely—and I think we’re going to be talking about this all year long  Still, our   additional communications regarding mandate-consistent inflation objectives have been a   welcome step in that direction  In my view, our current approach is a pragmatic, second-best   policy  For me, it’s a compromise that I can embrace as long as the economic and inflation data   continue to improve along the lines that we’re expecting and we move towards our mandated   goals, and as long as our policy accommodation is not withdrawn prematurely   I recently stated publicly, while I was on a panel with Mike Woodford at the American   Economic Association meetings in Denver, my view that our $600 billion of asset purchases   helped to reinforce our policy statement that short-term nominal interest rates will remain   exceptionally low for an extended period of time—that’s what our FOMC statement says  It was   a great pleasure to have Governor Yellen in the audience  Professor Woodford, of course, has   also advocated price-level targeting  During the discussion, he agreed that committing to   keeping rates exceptionally low was important, and, to his mind, more important than the actual   asset purchases themselves  Therefore, I think this continues to be a combination that has some   attraction within the economics profession and is a mainstream view of the current US   situation, although it is not necessarily widely accepted   The other essential element is the target scale for our asset purchases  My reading of the   data continues to be that it is too early to make a judgment about whether $600 billion or more or   January 25–26, 2011 164 of 282              less is appropriate  Directional improvements in economic data have been very welcome  More   improvement is needed through the spring to add confidence to this assessment  I won’t be   surprised if the Committee’s ultimate judgment is for a total asset purchase of $600 billion—as I   already stated, the more critical judgment is to keep short-term rates exceptionally low for an   extended period  I currently believe this will be important until actual data for broad-based,   underlying, and sustainable inflation are coming in at at least 1½ percent year over year  If   President Kocherlakota is right and we do get that kind of reading on inflation, I really don’t   disagree with his views on that scenario—but I view getting that reading as less likely  In any   case, the data will come in, and, as they play out, we’ll evaluate our strategy   In terms of commodity prices, there are certainly risks, and we’ve faced them before  It   seems to me that the analysis suggests that commodity prices don’t impart that much pressure on   inflation  Let me give you an odd example  Before our board meeting last Thursday, Dan   Sullivan came to me and said, “You know, we’ve got this inflation dashboard that a couple of   our directors wanted us to put together, and it looks at different indicators  And right now,   commodity prices are flashing red”  I said, “Oh, that’s surprising  I didn’t know that inflation   would be rising”  And he said, “No, no, no, no  The commodity price indicator is indicating   lower than average inflationary pressures”  That’s totally counterintuitive, right?  Let me tell   you how this works  We use an analytical approach that tries to convey the additional   information contained in the commodity price indicator, that is, “additional” relative to the   history of inflation  Well, in a regression that looks at past inflation, those data are signaling low   inflationary pressures  When you tell the program to look at commodity prices, it basically says,   “Thanks for calling”  In other words, it doesn’t add anything, because it just can’t overcome the   disinflationary effects  Of course, we can have different views on the type of analysis, and   January 25–26, 2011 165 of 282              outcomes can differ  For example, the outcome was different in 2008, when we were somewhat   worried about commodity prices  Even I started worrying about commodity prices in August   2008, and inflation ended up falling  Now, if you like to put weight on Phillips curves, this   analysis is not a hard thing to embrace, because unemployment went up—a lot of slack was   created—and inflation went down  If you don’t like to look at resource gaps, then it’s even more   puzzling that inflation fell, but that’s not for me to talk about   So, on that basis I think that if inflation gets up to 1½ percent, then we’ll have to start   worrying about it  And, of course, we have to monitor it—no doubt about that  We also have to   look at the labor market trajectory and have confidence that it’s trending towards a path that can   plausibly be characterized as consistent with our mandate  I agree that a couple of strong jobs   reports would help add that confidence  So, Mr Chairman, I support alternative B and the   important elements therein  Thank you     Jim has got a good point  I’m not quite sure how to define this  There   must be financial industry councils that the New York Fed or other Reserve Banks have, and you   talk to them, maybe with more Fed people there  But if it’s not open to the public, I’m not quite   sure exactly how that’s different from the private meeting with a financial firm’s clients  I think   a little more definition of the examples that we’re contemplating would be very, very helpful     I’ve never done that, but I think there are probably some examples that we   all have shared where there might have been a dinner that felt a little uncomfortable     Well, what about talking to 30 CEOs before every FOMC meeting?     Oh, you don’t have a conversation with them?     Well, you could talk to financial firms, too     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I want to thank the subcommittee for putting   in a lot of hard work on a very difficult subject  I did write a fairly detailed response to the   subcommittee, so anything that’s in that response but that I don’t bring up in this discussion still   applies  I also appreciate the perspective that Tom brought to bear from FRAM  That accords   pretty well with what I would have hoped that we already had in place, so I agree with that   At times, I’ve thought that the reason we sometimes see questionable things from Fed   staff in the newspaper could be that there is just not sufficient training for all of the staff and that   we aren’t always very clear about what the security guidelines mean  I know that, for   information security and ethics training and so on, we have online guides and even certification   exercises, so maybe we could do something like that every year on this issue  At any rate, I think   that training could help, and FRAM is already on point on a lot of the issues   I agree with Jim and Charlie and others in thinking that we need to communicate a lot   more  I think we’ve been undertaking very difficult monetary policies that are hard to explain    During a very difficult period, they’re susceptible to being picked apart, fairly and unfairly  We   need to make sure we have a policy in place that allows us to go out and explain, as best we all   can, what we’re trying to accomplish and why it’s the right policy  So, if we go down a   January 25–26, 2011 212 of 282              particular path that ends up putting a lot of restrictions on how we’re supposed to talk, and so on,   it will work against enhanced communication   As Charlie Plosser said, it’s really hard to legislate good judgment, so we’re counting on   everybody to use their best judgment  I’m not optimistic that we’re going to be very successful   if we try to write the guidelines down in a legalistic fashion  I think we need access to the kinds   of parties, such as the financial sector, whom we’re concerned about  I agree that talking to a   closed meeting of financial clients is inappropriate, and we need to be careful about that  But   when I talk to people in the financial sector, if I ask the right questions and know what to probe   for, I come away with something pretty useful for what we’re doing  I don’t think it’s enough to   count on New York and the Board of Governors to have a monopoly on that information without   our having our own independent perspective  So we need to figure out how to do that   I think having more examples of the bad choices would be helpful  At the moment, I’ve   just got a bunch of straw men on my list, and I don’t know if I should be very upset because it’s   so proscriptive, or if instead I completely agree about talking or not talking to that particular   group  I guess we don’t really want to name the particular individual who might be responsible   for a lot of this whole discussion  Is it bad that we talk to certain people quite often?  I felt   uncomfortable after I saw something that this person distributed to his clients, and I stopped   agreeing to do that type of phone call for quite some time—even without the rules  Sometimes   financial groups have invited me to speak and, to assure me that it’s appropriate for a Fed official   to do this, they’ve said, “Don Kohn came and talked to us”  I know Don has good judgment   about these things  I know that he also knows how to talk to people and not say things he   shouldn’t say  [Laughter]     Yes, that’s exactly it  Don once told me, “The minutes come out   tomorrow  I always read the minutes very carefully, because that reminds me of the language in   which we talk about various things”  Do the rest of us do that before we talk to a group?  I know   I don’t  I think The Wall Street Journal is particularly effective at getting certain messages out,   so we need to be careful about how restrictive we might be—I can talk to a whole bunch of   people and not get any press   I think informal guidelines would be better than strict ones, and I, personally, speak   openly anyway when I talk to people  So I don’t think I am giving different messages to   different people  I just say what I want  If I thought that the rules were pretty proscriptive and   difficult, I might be tempted to regularly post my observations on how I thought things were   going and have it in a nice place on a website  That may or may not be in line with what you are   actually trying to get across, but it would be in the spirit of communicating very openly to   everybody     Could I just add to your point on the formal versus the informal policy?  I   don’t think it’s as easy as just sort of saying, “I call it formal  You call it informal”  I can   imagine somebody saying, “Well, a formal policy is one where there’s some kind of audit trail,   where there’s some check against what you’re actually doing”  And I think that’s where we   would trip up     Well, okay  But, if it ends up being something that is an audit trail like   our internal audit or something like that, then it’s going to take on a very different nature, and I   think we’ll end up tripping over the little things  It’s one of the things auditors do—they say,   “Here’s a list of what you say you do, and here’s what you actually did, so you missed on a   bunch of things”  That could be embarrassing     Thank you, Mr Chairman  In reading the Tealbook discussion of the   inflation projection, I wasn’t surprised, but it does rely heavily on resource slack  Maybe it’s the   fact that the section on resource utilization immediately precedes the inflation discussion that   reminds us of that  I know that many around the table are uncomfortable with this type of   inflation forecasting, and I know that some have suggested that we focus a little more attention   on growth rates  You don’t emphasize growth rates so much for inflation determination  Would   you care to discuss the evidence and provide a little bit of a guide as to how we might think   about that?     Thank you, Mr Chairman  By most accounts, the economy has improved   over the intermeeting period  The commentary I received from my business contacts this round   was quite good  I can’t even recall anyone bringing up concerns over regulatory uncertainties or   other such annoyances   Most sectors reported increasing momentum in line with or even a bit better than their   earlier business plans  Overall, my reports from business contacts seem consistent with my   January forecast, which had GDP growing at about a 4 percent rate over 2011 to 2012    However, I continue to hear plenty of caveats around these good reports  For example, although   no one has seen it yet, many contacts were concerned that higher energy prices might become a   drag on demand, as President Rosengren mentioned  Nevertheless, the good news outweighed   the bad, and I now feel more confident about my earlier strong outlook   My manufacturing contacts were particularly upbeat  Automakers are increasing output,   and home appliance production is still doing surprisingly well  Heavy equipment manufacturers   are benefiting from robust replacement demand, even for construction equipment  Here, though,   is one of those caveats that temper my enthusiasm  One story I heard was that in order to raise   cash during the downturn, many construction and equipment leasing companies sold their   equipment to firms operating overseas  Think of this as eating your seed corn  Now they are   buying new equipment to restore their capacity  This is a good development, but it is most likely   a short-run rebound effect rather than a signal of a more fundamental strengthening in the   domestic construction industry   Clearly, the strength in manufacturing is generating strong demand for steel    ArcelorMittal is running its current US capacity just about flat out, and they are in the process   March 15, 2011 37 of 165              of bringing one of their three remaining idle blast furnaces back into production  Steel producers   complain that iron ore prices are outrageous  At the same time they’re pretty satisfied with their   ability to raise prices to their customers  Of course, this means steel users are all complaining   about costs  It’s often hard to get these manufacturers to say how much of the cost they are able   to pass on to their customers, but I got the impression that many are taking some hits to their   margins  Ford was explicit about this, noting both that they were facing higher commodity   prices and that the competition was driving the vehicle transactions prices lower  Also, other   than the obvious direct effects on gasoline and the like, I heard few reports of downstream price   pressures emanating from the pass-through of higher energy costs   I also am not hearing of any cost pressures from wages  Indeed, most current indicators   suggest substantial restraint  Because you’ve all seen the reports, I’ll simply say, “Madison,   Wisconsin”  Another example is the recent Caterpillar labor negotiations  Caterpillar signed a   contract with the UAW that gives them negligible labor cost increases for the next six years  I’m   pretty sure that if we go back to the previous episodes like the 1970s when inflation rose well   above our goals, price increases were strongly reinforced by sizable wage pressures  Those   channels are absent today   Of course, even though current wage growth is weak, the labor market clearly has   improved over the past few months  This is an important piece of good news that we had been   waiting for, but the extent of improvement is still difficult to read  Larger payroll employment   gains are welcome, but they are still modest relative to the declines during the recession  On the   other hand, the dramatic and continued reductions in the unemployment rate have clearly been   greater than we expected  It would be especially encouraging if these improvements in the   household data reflected a step-up in hiring  However, most of the drop in the unemployment   March 15, 2011 38 of 165              rate over the past few months was due to a decline in transitions of workers from employment to   unemployment  In other words, the flow into unemployment dropped because of fewer job   separations, and Dave Stockton mentioned that job losers are down  But the flow out of   unemployment and into employment has not improved significantly—not yet  This is consistent   with the story from JOLTS, so the two surveys, payroll and household, are consistent  Layoffs   are down, but hiring has yet to pick up in a meaningful way  It is also in line with conversations   from my business contacts who still don’t report robust hiring plans  While there has been an   improvement, I don’t think we’re looking yet at a vibrant labor market with robust hiring   More generally, I continue to believe that there still is substantial slack in labor and most   product markets, in addition to the factors I just talked about  I would also note that the   Tealbook’s revised assumptions on labor input only subtracted a few tenths off of the GDP gap,   and with unemployment and vacancies both falling, the Beveridge curve is clearly looping back,   as you suggested it would at earlier meetings, Mr Chairman  This reinforces my take-away from   our discussion last meeting  I don’t think we saw any evidence then that the bulk of the increase   in unemployment was structural  Various estimates all suggested that monetary policy could   reduce slack   This assessment of resource slack also continues to be an important downward influence   on our inflation outlook  As an offsetting factor, the downside tail risks on inflation expectations   appear to have fallen substantially  So inflation expectations may have a firmer upside anchor,   and while I don’t think cost pass-through will be large, we do expect some effects similar to   those built into the Tealbook for many of the reasons that I mentioned in the memo that I   circulated to the Committee   March 15, 2011 39 of 165              For a variety of reasons we have moved our inflation forecast up a couple of tenths  We   now see core PCE reaching the 1½ percent range in 2013; that would still be well below the   2 percent rate that I think is consistent with our price stability mandate  Until core, median, and   trimmed mean measures of underlying inflation reach 1½ percent on a year-over-year basis, I   don’t see how we can feel confident that we have escaped the zero-lower-bound risks of the   current unpleasantness  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I favor alternative B  The editing suggestions   seem fine with me   The outlook is improved  Underlying inflation continues to be low, so I expect to support   completing our $600 billion of purchases until we’re finished in June  I have a preference for no   tapering of the program   There is a clear risk for policy and our credibility if inflation expectations were to   increase substantially  I think we all understand and agree on that  I did take a little additional   comfort from Brian Sack’s report that indicated that the one-year forward inflation breakevens   have only increased a touch once you start looking two years and out, and so most of the shift   has been in the near term  But we need to keep the inflation expectations risk front and center,   so I wholeheartedly agree that we should monitor that   Still, I think resource slack is important, and I welcome President Kocherlakota’s   insightful comments about slack estimates from the simplest New Keynesian models  I am a   March 15, 2011 98 of 165              little skeptical about the sturdiness of these conclusions, and I think he used the term “reliable   measures”  I’d like to see more on that, I agree with that assessment   Inflation dynamics from the simplest New Keynesian models don’t seem to match the   data  It actually takes quite a lot of work in order to introduce mechanisms like that, and, in fact,   some New Keynesian models that don’t have enough of the inflation dynamics embedded in   them likely have mean reversion baked into their inflation forecast  If they don’t have enough   inflation persistence, and then they see data that show a drop in inflation, they’re going to see   that inflation goes back up, and 2 percent is probably what’s baked into that model  So I’m   really not sure what confidence we should have coming out of those types of models unless the   match of the model with the data is reasonable  I think that’s something that we have to   understand  In the DSGE versions that we use in Chicago, we put a lot of emphasis on the   channels that help induce more inertial inflation dynamics, and I would say, like Jeff Fuhrer’s   research has emphasized on this, it’s a very important feature  I’d like to see similar slack   assessments coming from models that match the data better, and in the memo that I circulated on   commodity prices, I had a line in there that alluded to this  I think there’s risk in putting too   much weight on theoretical constructs that don’t really describe the data nearly well enough  I’m   not quite sure how much emphasis we should put on that   In terms of policy going forward, the Tealbook has the assumption that the interest rate   takeoff will occur in mid-2012  Yes, that could happen; I could see that that could be acceptable   even with my outlook and concerns  I still expect that core PCE inflation at that time is going to   be 1½ percent or less, so I’m a little nervous about that, but if the facts change, I will change my   opinion on that   March 15, 2011 99 of 165              Thinking about exit strategy, I can even imagine a reverse tapering of our $600 billion   asset purchase, along the lines that Presidents Kocherlakota and Bullard have previously   mentioned, that might take place before the rate liftoff  I’d just like to understand the   possibilities there a little bit more, so in the discussion that we have about exit strategy, perhaps a   little more emphasis on that than what the consensus was over a year ago   Putting it all together, given the outlook and the inflation risks that we face and the slack   estimates that I think are appropriate, I am comfortable with alternative B, Mr Chairman     I learned from President Bullard last time     We have research evidence on that from the Chicago Fed  Jonas Fisher   and Marty Eichenbaum did work looking at exactly that type of GMM Euler equation, and it   doesn’t do very well unless you add more dynamics to that, but we could go back and look at   that more carefully     Mr Chairman, can I offer a comment on that?     This is a very serious change, and I’m not sure I understand it  The   language on the unemployment rate is very familiar; we all understand it  We have spent a lot of   time talking about what a natural rate of unemployment is, and we have talked about structural   unemployment  So we sort of understand 5, 5½ percent, whatever your favorite number is    Now, with the new language, we are talking about the level of unemployment  How many   millions of people are unemployed today, and do we have an idea of how many million   unemployed it will have to be so that it will no longer be “elevated,” but it will be “improving”?    What is the right number when we get to an acceptable level?  Is it zero million unemployed?  I   March 15, 2011 123 of 165              just don’t know the answers to these questions, but with all of the time we spent trying to educate   people on the natural rate, we might have to do that on the levels     I agree with Jim in the sense that I think this is a great idea to have the   press conferences  It is good to get the Chairman out front with the right message  If the   blackout ended so that we could have a Friday conference, that would be great  If push comes to   March 15, 2011 145 of 165              shove, I guess I wouldn’t be horribly opposed to keeping the blackout period the way it is right   now  But I do think it would be of benefit; I don’t think that the risk is that great     I thought you started out the discussion saying we were only talking about   the press conferences after the two-day meetings  And you weren’t going to talk about anything   else  Now, you may have indicated something that was sympathetic toward that, but—   March 15, 2011 147 of 165                Thank you, Mr Chairman, and thanks to the staff for a couple of very nice   memos, which were very helpful in thinking about these issues   I find that I can’t completely separate my current assessment of appropriate monetary   policy in discussing the exit strategies here, but I’ll try to do that  I think it is important that   however we go about approaching this, we want to continue to focus on our policy goals and the   loss function that we’ll be facing and make the appropriate choices in that way  With that in   mind, a couple of the—“principles” is too strong a word, but—things that I’m thinking about are   that I favor an approach that allows for considerable patience in our initial steps toward   tightening  I think we want to have the opportunity that, if we start embarking upon this and   things happen differently than we are expecting with the economy and inflation, we haven’t   committed ourselves to a path that is too difficult  We want to maintain flexibility, and we want   to have flexibility in both directions because, again, things can happen  We want to maintain   optionality in each direction  Now, fortunately, I think that both of the options described in the   staff memos can allow for this flexibility, and I simply point to the fact that they have calibrated   options 1 and 2 to have about the same amount of policy restraint imposed along the way  So I   don’t find myself in wild disagreement with either approach   I do continue to modestly favor option 1, which would entail increasing the federal funds   rate before we embark on asset sales, but the way that I tend to think about monetary policy is   perhaps a little too simplistically, given the complexities that we have right now  I tend to think   of it in terms of the single dimension of our policy restraint, and I think I can map a lot of what   you’re talking about into that dimension   I do worry a little bit when we talk about how the funds rate is a familiar tool, we’ve used   it before, and everybody understands that  I think that’s certainly true when we’re able to put   April 26–27, 2011 60 of 244              pressure on reserves the way we always have in the past  But as soon as we start wondering   about whether or not our reserve draining tools will actually be as effective as we think and   whatnot, we’re going to be relying on arbitrage between interest on excess reserves and the funds   rate  And while in theory that should work, in practice I’m not quite sure how all that will play   out  If we find that we start off on that path and, it is not working out, there will be credibility   risks, but at any rate, that’s the approach I favor   On the four questions, yes, I think the first step should be to stop reinvesting  I think of   this more in terms of the signaling effect that we get from that because of the unique feature of   redemptions versus sales  I think the Treasuries could be reinvested if the balance sheet, the size   of it and its composition, was satisfactory, along the lines that President Lacker was suggesting    We ultimately want to end up with a Treasury balance sheet, and so if that works, that’s fine   In terms of actively varying the pace of asset sales, that’s not my first choice  I would   use the reserve draining tools  But if the state of monetary policy required a quicker restraint,   then we’d want to consider upping asset sales faster  Ultimately, that could be a point of   compromise between the different views   In terms of sequencing, I think option 1 is best in my opinion, so that would be sales   later—again, making sure that the response to the ultimate stance of monetary policy is really   important  And I agree with all of the last three statements as well     Thank you, Mr Chairman  My business contacts continue to report good   economic fundamentals, similar to our March meeting  Despite the projected first-quarter GDP   growth rate of 17 percent, there were very few indications of slower momentum in growth  My   manufacturing contacts continue to be upbeat  Only the auto sector suggested a temporary   slowing in growth prospects due to the supply chain disruptions from the Japanese difficulties    Labor markets are continuing to improve  With regard to pricing, there are many reports of first-  round price increases due to higher energy and commodity costs  At the moment, second-round   effects seem minimal   Turning to the national outlook, I had been relatively optimistic about economic growth   prospects  At our previous meetings this year, I indicated that I expected GDP to grow about   4 percent in 2011 and 2012  We don’t appear to be seeing that kind of pace in the first half of   April 26–27, 2011 104 of 244              this year, but as of today, I don’t see a fundamental change in economic momentum  So I think   the 4 percent mark is a good projection for the second half of 2011 and for 2012  That puts us   broadly in line with the Tealbook   That said, this is the second time we are facing a period of sluggish growth following the   trough of the 2008–09 recession  Suppose first-quarter GDP growth comes in at the Tealbook’s   17 percent projection  I’d see that as a reminder that achieving escape velocity from our   liquidity-trap conditions is still not a slam dunk  We shouldn’t forget that a successful launch   must still overcome a number of significant headwinds  Households have lost a lot of net worth   and now face a hit to purchasing power from higher gasoline prices  Both of these limit the   scope for a sustainable pop in consumer spending  Housing’s contribution to this recovery is   AWOL, and nonresidential construction isn’t doing much better  And state and local   governments are still trimming expenditures and payrolls  Indeed, listing these headwinds also is   a reminder of why we are writing down 4 percent growth numbers instead of the 5-plus numbers   that we’d like to see following a very deep hole from the recession   In terms of inflation, the US economy is being hit by substantial relative price changes   from global economic forces with respect to food, energy, and commodity prices  We likely are   going to see some larger quarterly numbers for inflation in the first half of the year, but the key   question centers on the medium term  What PCE inflation are we likely to see in 2012 and   beyond?  Clearly, we do have a large amount of monetary accommodation in place, which makes   many nervous about rising inflation  However, it would be quite unusual for inflationary   momentum to build in the absence of rising labor costs and wages  I know there are   disagreements around the table, but I still see the evidence favoring the view that a substantial   April 26–27, 2011 105 of 244              degree of resource slack is holding back inflationary pressures  I think it’s important to defend   this view vigorously, and I’d like to do that now  [Laughter]   Theoretical and empirical research objections have been leveled at this kind of analysis    These often note the unobserved nature of output gaps and resource slack  By my reckoning,   Presidents Plosser, Kocherlakota, Lacker, and Bullard have spoken on this issue, and I suppose I   should add President Fisher after today’s reminder  In addition, President Lacker has often   voiced skepticism of numerous statistical relationships between observable variables and   inflation  As I understand the context of such comments, these correlations are uninformative for   policy due to the endogeneity of the variables  There is a literature on this   I would like to report some results from my staff’s work with DSGE models that attempt   to pin down the exogenous factors that are influencing inflation dynamics  In the policy debate   over statistical correlations, economic structure, and truly exogenous factors, this is a clearly   useful way to proceed  It is in line with the research program articulated by Lucas, Sargent, and   others   The Chicago research model builds on my 2005 Journal of Political Economy article   with Christiano and Eichenbaum, and if you like the discipline of peer-reviewed work, you have   to love this one because we spent over five years in that review process  [Laughter]  The   Chicago model is estimated on data over the period from 1987 to 2008 and has many desirable   attributes that allow it to describe quite well the quarter-to-quarter movements in macroeconomic   data  Here is the recent policy development  The model has been surprised by the increase in   core inflation over the past six months  The forecast error for core inflation relative to what we   thought six months ago is about ¼ percentage point higher on a year-over-year basis  Coming   over two quarters, that’s a substantial increase  In studying the model’s results, it seems to be   April 26–27, 2011 106 of 244              struggling with the apparent softer growth in productivity as well as the increase in core   inflation   What factors account for these developments?  In the model, part of the rise in inflation   reflects announcement effects of our continued accommodative forward guidance for monetary   policy  That was an objective of our asset purchase program  In addition, the Chicago model   sees four other exogenous factors as important in explaining these observations  The first factor   is that a small, adverse, neutral technology shock has hit the economy  In the model, this will   reduce output and productivity growth and increase inflation  This is a potentially troubling   shock because it imparts inflation persistence  That is, it has staying power, and I was nervous   when the staff showed me this development   The second factor captures an exogenous increase in households’ willingness to supply   labor and is also persistent  In the model, this increases both hours and output while productivity   falls due to diminishing returns in production  But here, inflation is lower, due to lower marginal   costs  The net effect of these first two shocks leaves productivity growth lower, as the data have   shown recently  The initial rise in inflation is somewhat smaller when both factors are accounted   for  The technology shock was up; the labor supply shock was down   The last two exogenous factors that the model finds important in explaining the data are   transitory shocks to the markups on prices and wages  These shocks boost core inflation but   have only a temporary effect  These are the types of shocks that give rise to commentary in past   Tealbooks, like  “We think the movement down or up in core inflation was temporary and   unrelated to resource slack or other fundamentals”   Our final model analysis finds a substantial and constructive role for these transitory   shocks  So, summing across all of these recent developments has interesting implications for the   April 26–27, 2011 107 of 244              time path of the Chicago DSGE model’s inflation forecast  The model’s projection for core   inflation over the four quarters of 2011 is higher at 16 percent  But core inflation falls to a bit   under 10 percent in 2012 and 2013   What’s my bottom line here from the DSGE model?  My staff’s analysis of the   exogenous factors indicates that a good portion of the recent run-up in core inflation is likely to   be transitory, and I didn’t refer to resource slack or output gaps once  The model analysis is in   terms of exogenous factors  Changes in pricing pressures work through variations in marginal   costs, a fundamental economic concept  That recent inflation developments are most likely   transitory is also a robust finding from analysis of recent inflation and term structure data  That   is, this conclusion is also supported by a modern finance model we run that produces inflation   forecasts from no-arbitrage affine models of the term structure of interest rates   These implied inflation forecasts also revised up a good deal in the near term, but they   are only up a tenth or two in 2012 and still just reach 14 percent by 2013  This is analysis of   market data with state-of-the-art term structure finance modeling  This model allows for   feedback from energy prices to core but finds that feedback to be very small, which is also   consistent with the alternative but complementary VAR evidence I discussed at our March   meeting  Furthermore, this assessment also aligns well with our standard battery of Stock-and-  Watson-style statistical models, which continue to forecast very low core inflation throughout   the projection period  As it turns out, the endogeneity issue didn’t disturb the result as it aligns   with the structural model analysis   We in Chicago have searched high and low for research-quality evidence on the nature of   the inflation persistence over our projection period using a variety of state-of-the-art models    Taking into account recent developments, it continues to be exceedingly difficult to find   April 26–27, 2011 108 of 244              analytical research-based evidence that inflation is about to overshoot our target over the   medium term  Consequently, I feel quite comfortable that my views, which lean strongly toward   continued substantial accommodation, are well within the mainstream of modern   macroeconomic and monetary research  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Mr Chairman, can I say something?     No—the reason I mentioned slack is that there’s not an output gap in that   model  I mean, slack is when you put it into the Woodford-type of style, and you talk about the   different type of market equilibrium  We can construct a slack variable; that’s a concept that we   did for the inflation dynamics  But per se, marginal cost is really the relevant thing  So you have   to work pretty hard to come up with a concept that looks like a Woodford slack variable  But the   object that you would work on to get at what you are talking about—which is a valid experiment,   I’m not denying that—would be to pump different shocks in there     I was trying to skip that additional assumption, which often is at the heart   of what people are objecting to, which is, it’s not observable  But we can talk about this more  I   April 26–27, 2011 135 of 244              understand that we’re going to have some discussions about DSGE models at upcoming   meetings as well     Maybe I shouldn’t have been surprised  Maybe I should have studied this   a little more carefully, but in alternative B, there’s new language relative to what was put in the   Tealbook; in paragraph 2  “Other commodities have pushed up inflation in recent months”  I   noticed in your analysis you referred to it as headline inflation  It seems like a noticeable change   in our assessment     Paragraph 2  We say, “measures of underlying inflation continue to be   somewhat low” and then we say that increases in energy prices have pushed up inflation in   recent months  Then we’re going to say “and a decline in inflation to rates consistent with” our   April 26–27, 2011 175 of 244              mandate  So we’re now talking about inflation being too high relative to our mandate, whereas   we’ve had an extended discussion about inflation being low relative to our mandate  It seems it   needs some modifier like “headline inflation” or “near-term inflation” or something     Inflation is a general rise in all prices, and we’re pointing to a relative   price increase as moving inflation  So I think it’s a very subtle point     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support alternative B  I support the   announced $600 billion of additional asset purchases  I support maintaining the “extended   period” language  I broadly agree with the Tealbook’s policy assumption, basically, which is a   fairly extended accommodation  In making this recommendation, I continue to focus on our   dual-mandate goals for the economy  Whether you look at real GDP, nominal GDP, or   April 26–27, 2011 193 of 244              employment, we continue to be far below levels that I associate with a well-functioning economy   related to pre-recession levels  I think that we are still pretty far below that   Because President Plosser keeps mentioning the unemployment rate in the context of the   statement, I always remember what Chairman Greenspan and Don Kohn used to say  When you   talk about unemployment, the measures are pretty variable; they move around month to month in   ways that require a lot of understanding  The labor force also moves around a lot  But   something about taking the ratio of those cleans this out, and the unemployment rate is a fairly   stable measure  It doesn’t move around very much  I think you are asking for more explaining if   you move away from that the unemployment rate; I’m not bothered by the unemployment rate at   all   In terms of inflation, I would just like to make a side comment for the record, because   President Fisher yesterday mentioned again this language like, “Our policies have been   monetizing the debt”  And I just want to be very clear on the record that I disagree completely   with that characterization  I think that monetizing the debt is when you permanently replace debt   with money  Our discussion yesterday was all about the fact how that is not going to be a   permanent replacement, and so I just think that is a mischaracterization of our policies   Now, for inflation  I guess I didn’t study the new language carefully enough over the   weekend, but I do have some sympathies to this idea that inflation has been higher, and we do   need to acknowledge that  One thing I have learned from going out and talking to the public is   that we need to acknowledge what they, and in fact, we are all experiencing  So I’m sympathetic   to that  But the current paragraph 2 has got this, you know—down, up, underlying inflation,   somewhat low, and then we refer to commodity prices as having pushed up “inflation”  I just   think that in talking about this—even as I heard Bill English describe this, he sort of slipped in   April 26–27, 2011 194 of 244              “headline inflation” when he mentioned that—it needs a modifier  As it stands, it has the   opportunity to rebrand what we mean when we talk about inflation if we don’t have that   modifier  Inflation is a general rise in all prices, and I don’t think we’ve got that uniformity in   price increases at the moment  And, our forecast that you are going to talk about, Mr Chairman,   shows the central tendencies up in 2011, but in 2012, and then rising in 2013  So it is not just   that we are going to decline to rates consistent, but we’re going to go down, and then we are   going to go up, and we’re below that  I’m sympathetic to trying to get this right  I would, in   fact, be willing to talk about the entire path  And while you can do that during your press   conference, this is new territory, and the statement will be out there  I am nervous about that  I   don’t believe medium-term inflation is too high  I think we are in fact below the mandate  I   think this is a very notable change in language, and so I want to be very careful on that  Thank   you, Mr Chairman     Well, I appreciate that, and I think one characterization is this permanent   placement  But, overall, I think inflation is really low, and so the fact that we move to a different   operating procedure where maybe we contemplate a floor where more of it would be   permanent—I mean, this is not a partnership with the Treasury; this is not Zimbabwe or anything   like that or hyperinflation, period  And to even talk about monetizing the debt—I mean,   April 26–27, 2011 195 of 244              President Fisher has used words like “dangerous” out in the public, and I think this is not helpful    So, yes, I would disagree with that characterization     No  I said inflation was a general increase in all prices  I didn’t state it in   the negative way that you did   April 26–27, 2011 196 of 244                I just think inflation is a monetary phenomenon  And whether or not we   generate a higher increase in all prices, it comes down to the policy assumption that we have   here  Our medium-term inflation forecast is for something lower than that  This doesn’t look   like inflation to me  Most of our models have a single price index  We don’t even talk about   uniformity of prices  That’s just my assessment     I agree with your characterization, Mr Chairman  It’s really the last part,   where it mentions a decline in inflation to rates consistent with the Federal Reserve’s mandate,   that made me think differently about it  If you drop that one along the lines of President   Kocherlakota, I do not have a problem with the “pushed up inflation in recent months”  That’s   just fine     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I want to thank all of the staff that contributed   to this project  I agree that it’s a great example of collaboration  I’ve heard accounts of how   things are going in Chicago, and I think that it’s been very exciting that people have been   working so well together   June 21–22, 2011 21 of 282              I’m very sympathetic to the comments that President Bullard just made, and it makes me   think about what the role of judgment is in so much of our analysis, and on the occasion of Dave   Stockton’s last meeting, I think it is right to think about how important judgment is  As I think   about how the staff forecast is put together, there are a lot of different analyses that need to be   taken into account in order to put together the type of forecast that’s very difficult to get out of a   model, even one as flexible as FRB/US or one like the DSGE models  But I think that the   FRB/US model and the DSGE models can help inform how those analyses and forecasts evolve,   if not quarter by quarter, then over time, and to get the story  What I like so much about the   DSGE models, at least in terms of how we think about it in our Bank, is that they tell a story   about how things are playing out in the economy  There’s really a beginning and a middle and   an end to this story  There’s a beginning that starts off with the exogenous impulse, the shock,   however you want to characterize it  There’s a middle  There’s the propagation that the model   grinds out  And there’s an end as the economy goes through the transition to the longer-term   resting point  I think it’s very valuable to understand some of the stories that these models can   tell, and I agree with Jim that it may not generate the best forecast, but it helps us with better   policy thinking   Getting to my question, here’s an example that I’m thinking we might struggle with over   the coming meetings or longer  Coming through the expansion in the middle of the past decade,   we saw strong growth, and we thought that that was associated with higher potential output, a   higher level of output  Then we get to the Great Recession, and we have these shocks, financial   in nature, and other factors, which led to a dramatic recession, and now the models are telling us   there’s a big gap  But I think we’re going to be wondering, if we haven’t already, what about the   1970s?  What about policymaking during that time period, when policy was highly   June 21–22, 2011 22 of 282              accommodative for a long period of time?  Was it to achieve something that ultimately wasn’t   achievable, a higher growth rate?  Athanasios Orphanides and others have looked at that period   and seen that potential output wasn’t as high as we thought  I think these models can help   inform how the current story may or may not play out  I understand that our measures of the   output gap are highly uncertain, but for each of those uncertain estimates, the model will tell a   different story as to what those shocks are that led to a lower level of potential output beginning   in the middle of the past decade  I think that these kinds of analyses can help us with that  We’ll   probably have to continue to innovate on the models, but I wonder if you have a reaction to that     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support these principles in general  I do   agree with President Rosengren’s suggestions about taking out the timing  On item 3, I caved on   that one  I didn’t like it, but I couldn’t find better words than that  I suppose “next” is pretty   June 21–22, 2011 51 of 282              good on that link  I think in general the sequencing here is quite good  I didn’t like any tight   links between certain actions  They were stronger than I’d liked, and the conditionality is very   appropriate here  I can fully support this     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The incoming data clearly show a reduction in   the recovery’s already modest momentum  In particular, the revisions to income, weak jobs and   claims numbers in May, and the softness in second-quarter consumer spending throw cold water   on my previously more optimistic forecast for a strengthening in aggregate demand  At this time   it’s hard to tell how persistent this weakness will be  My business contacts say their own   businesses are still doing well  Indeed, several large manufacturers, like Caterpillar and Deere,   continue to register very strong sales   June 21–22, 2011 136 of 282              Like the Boston outlook, our baseline scenario is that economic growth will inevitably   pick up to average about a 3¾ percent pace in the second half of this year and in 2012  These   rates are down three or four tenths from our last projection  Nevertheless it’s easier to see the   downside risks to the forecast than the upside potential  An important ingredient in my 3½ to   4 percent recovery rate is stronger consumer expenditures  Such pickup requires more robust job   growth to kick spending into a higher gear  The labor market, though, is a continuing risk  I   only heard a few firms talking about hiring more permanent workers  My contacts basically   repeated their mantra  Businesses will continue to emphasize productivity gains and keep labor   costs flexible  Translation  No robust hiring is planned   More generally, uncertainty is substantial  Businesses have become more concerned   about the economic landscape, but things are still only at the worrying stage, so the actual   impediment to growth remains small for the moment  Substantial problems due to a financial   distress cascade in Europe are still seen by nonfinancial firms as a vague tail risk  The US   budget debate is also adding to the climate of uncertainty and caution  To summarize my   feelings about economic growth, writing down a forecast of 3¾ percent over the next 18 months   continues to be a nice intellectual exercise in the power of positive thinking  [Laughter]   With regard to inflation, I admit that a case can be made that today there is more reason   to worry that underlying inflation could be headed higher  After all, we’ve had the recent   increase in core inflation piled on top of the already higher overall index  But I would like to   stop at this point and, in line with President Williams, defend what I’m talking about in terms of   underlying inflation  Recently in the press and other places, it seems like it’s almost a dirty word   to mention the core CPI or underlying inflation  To me, underlying inflation is the component of   total inflation that’s persistent and useful for forecasting inflation over the medium term  I agree   June 21–22, 2011 137 of 282              that this is a pretty common concept in so many other things that we do for forecasting the real   economy, like core orders and things like that  My view is that the core and median CPI, PCE,   and trimmed mean fit this characterization, and they’re very helpful for forecasting inflation   We convened our academic advisory council last week, and many of the participants   were uncomfortable with our assessment that inflation expectations remained well anchored, and   disconcertingly, even the most ardent efficient marketer among them didn’t think we could rely   on financial market data or other such indicators to provide reliable forewarning that inflation   was going to take off  This viewpoint I find maddeningly short on actionable state-contingent   triggers  People just throw up their hands and don’t really help me think about what we should   be looking at, no matter how hard I press them   Having noted these inflation worries, the recent higher inflation data have caused most of   our inflation models to revise up a bit, but nearly all still generate forecasts for total inflation   well below 2 percent in 2013  Interestingly, the model that focuses most squarely on financial   market data, the one that uses the term structure of Treasury interest rates, has a noticeable   bump-up in core inflation to 1¾ percent in 2011, but then sees core inflation coming down to   1¼ percent by 2013  I’m sure that these dynamics would be the same for other measures of   underlying inflation, such as the median and trimmed mean measures  This model builds an   overall inflation forecast by adding in expected price changes for food and energy, and that   analysis projects total PCE inflation over the medium term will be well below my 2 percent goal    I just do not see the medium-term risk to inflation as accelerating, as others have mentioned    Indeed, the model’s 2013 inflation projection is a bit below its previous forecast  This reflects   the decline in nominal interest rates we’ve seen in this period, as well as TIPS breakevens,   inflation swaps, and inflation caps  They all suggest that financial markets are not expecting an   June 21–22, 2011 138 of 282              outbreak of inflation  After putting all of our model and anecdotal information together, we   submitted a forecast that has both overall and core inflation coming down to about 1½ percent in   2012 and staying there in 2013  Now, there are upside risks to this inflation forecast, but   inflation continues to be below what I think of as our goal, 2 percent over the medium term, and   I think that we should be symmetric in our attitudes toward these policy losses  After all, I think   of 2 percent as a goal, not a catastrophe or a ceiling  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’ve always assumed that this was the time to   ask a question about the optimal policy chart that’s in the second part of the Tealbook because   we don’t do it at other times  One thing raised in our discussion of DSGE models yesterday is   the possibility of using that type of analysis to do an optimal policy exercise, which we might be   more comfortable with  But until then, we have FRB/US, with which I am also pretty   comfortable  This time I notice that the inflation projection with the funds rate constant is not   really different than the counterfactual in which the funds rate is allowed to be negative  While   there doesn’t seem to be much discrepancy in these paths, I will note that the core inflation path   is a lot higher than the Tealbook extended forecast  First, I was curious as to why that’s the case     I think this optimal unemployment rate path is lower than what the   extended Tealbook forecast is, right?  Is that what you’re saying?     That’s the interesting feature of this particular simulation, it seems to me    And yet the inflation path is about a quarter to a half a point higher than in the Tealbook and still   at about 2 percent     Okay  Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Well, it’s tempting to say I agree with   alternative B, but I will say that I thought Governor Tarullo articulated a very good point   yesterday  This recovery has been marred by sputtering and pauses, and it seems to me that   we’ve never achieved escape velocity  It is reasonable to wait and see today, and so I can   support alternative B, but like President Rosengren, I think it is reasonable to consider next steps   if we are, again, surprised by economic slowing  That’s one reason why I was so interested in   the FRB/US simulation under the alternative policy  At first blush I couldn’t figure out why the   inflation path was higher than what the extended Tealbook had, but then, of course, it is an   optimal policy response  When I first looked at it, I thought that the policy path was about the   same, but, no, upon Dave Reifschneider’s response and looking more carefully, I see that it has   more accommodation, and with that additional accommodation what we get from this modeling   exercise is 2 percent core PCE inflation  Well, that’s on target by most of our assessments  So I   June 21–22, 2011 185 of 282              thought that was good  Now, as Dave Reifschneider mentioned, one of the reasons why you get   that—and what makes the unemployment rate path better—is that we preannounce, in a rational   expectations sense, that policy is going to be accommodative for that extended period of time,   which is longer than what we’re saying in the Tealbook extension, and that anticipated   accommodation has a benefit for the economy and how it plays out  So I think that’s something   to at least think about as we do this   Our goals are price stability and to support maximum sustainable employment, and   monetary policy has been very responsive throughout this downturn to the economy and the   financial situation, even though I know there are lots of complaints about how this has   proceeded  But now as things are beginning to change and the risks are more two sided, I think   we have to seriously consider what we mean when we say that for inflation we have an objective   of about 2 percent  What do we mean as we begin to flirt with 2 percent?  And I really think that   2 percent should not be viewed as a ceiling and that if we were to breach the target, it would not   be a particularly bad outcome  We have had inflation well below that objective for a long period   of time, and I think that, just as we have not been unduly concerned about lower inflation, we   should not be predisposed against something perhaps above 2 percent, as long as inflation   expectations are reasonable, as long as they’re anchored, and as long as the longer-term and   medium-term paths are okay  In that regard, I think we need to be careful in how we talk about   that, and much more clarity would be very helpful  If we’re confronted with another pause, we   would be overly risk averse if we were to simply stand pat  So I do, like President Rosengren,   have sympathies with the way that policy is described in alternative A, where we get the benefits   of mentioning that the funds rate could be held low into 2012  We could very well end up there   anyway; we might as well enjoy the benefit of that   June 21–22, 2011 186 of 282              In terms of the wording of the statement, I like explicit references to the labor market, our   objective as stated, in terms of maximum employment  It seems to me “loss of momentum” is   fairly accurate, and I would prefer leaving that  Thank you, Mr Chairman     It’s a framework, not an action     Thank you, Mr Chairman, and thanks to everyone who contributed   memos to this discussion  I found each of them to be quite useful   Regarding the potential policy responses discussed by Bill and Brian in their memo, I do   not have any concerns about actions 1 through 5  I continue to support the current authorization    As long as our actions with regard to defaulted securities incorporate current market pricing and   appropriate haircuts, these policies can be consistent with sound monetary policy   I am a little nervous about actions 6 and 7  I think we have to be very careful in   describing why we would be undertaking these actions  For example, action 6 would essentially   have us, as I refer to it, “lease” our SOMA Treasuries in order to alleviate negative T-bill or repo   rates  I think it’s vitally important that this not be confused with a shift in monetary policy that   August 1, 2011 33 of 53              looks like the beginning of an exit strategy  After all, that is one of the options  Similarly,   action 7 would have us increase liquidity in a way that some might confuse with QE3, if we were   to do something like that  I think the key point I’m making is a simple one  Although these   actions might be appropriate, we would need to be exceptionally clear in our communications  It   sounds obvious, but it’s natural to have trouble with that  Also, because these actions would be   to support market functioning beyond our normal federal funds policy instrument, I’m nervous   that these actions might be perceived erroneously as another market bailout for privileged   institutions  To undertake these actions, I would hope that substantial communications would   convey the FOMC’s belief that these actions are vitally important to continue meeting our dual-  mandate responsibilities   Regarding action 8, support for money market funds, I think the hurdle for this action   should be quite high also  I agree with President Rosengren’s comments that we should study   this industry very carefully and think about the right way to respond  Invoking 13(3) authority   shines the spotlight ever brighter on our nonstandard policy actions  I am nervous about the   invocation of “inappropriate prices,” which the memo indicated  I do think this is a cleaner issue   for Treasuries than at any other time we’ve responded recently with regard to other programs    So maybe it’s workable, but it is a little nerve racking  Again, I think the hurdle for this should   be a judgment that our standard monetary policy responsibilities for employment and price   stability justify this   I think actions 9 and 10 also seem like a bit of a stretch  Without more discussion,   expanding our balance sheet would, again, perhaps look like QE3  I’m not saying I’m opposed   to that, and I’m not saying I favor it; I just think it requires discussion  CUSIP swaps may be   ingenious, and we are uniquely positioned to bear those risks as the central bank, but it could   August 1, 2011 34 of 53              look like we’re too intimately involved in funding the Treasury in that situation  So that makes   me a little nervous  It might be okay, but we ought to discuss that   Finally, I think in general, we need to have many more discussions to understand the   myriad implications from actions like these  We know our monetary responsibilities with regard   to the dual mandate, but we don’t have the same type of agreement with regard to financial   stability, especially when there are conflicts with that  So I hope that we don’t have to take these   actions as quickly as was contemplated by this memo and that we have the time to think about   them more carefully  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  The economic news since our last meeting has   been dreadful, and it is becoming more and more difficult to ignore the large cracks that have   emerged in our monetary policy framework  Accordingly, it’s almost impossible for me to   present my economic reports in a business-as-usual manner  I suppose that’s like   Governor Tarullo—going first in a sympathetic fashion  And my comments are based on   economic developments that largely preceded the events of Monday and last Friday  So I hope I   am not overreacting, as President Fisher was suggesting   The weak incoming data indicate that it’s highly unlikely that the US economy, in the   foreseeable future, will achieve anything like a launch velocity, so I certainly agree with   Governor Tarullo’s comments  For me, the single most significant number was the downward   revision to first-quarter GDP growth to 04 percent  It now looks as though growth began   August 9, 2011 46 of 162              slowing in the second half of 2010  It seems to me that’s before the emergence of the various   temporary factors that we’ve been pointing to as explanations for weaker growth in the first half   of this year  Most of our business and financial contacts are very concerned about continued   weakness, both here and globally  Again, that’s before Friday and Monday  Many expect a   considerable period of below-trend economic growth  They’re quite concerned about what   seems to be a broad decline in the confidence of almost everyone they deal with, spanning both   the household and business sectors  Some of the pessimism appears to be a reaction to the   difficulties in Europe, and some has been a reaction to the messy political fight over the debt   ceiling in the United States, which presumably has been reinforced by the S&P downgrade of   US Treasury debt  And on the part of businesses, the recurring stalls in final demand seem to   repeatedly validate their aversion to making significant forward commitments of resources that   would result in new hiring or the expansion of capacity   I suppose there must be some good news somewhere, or else the economy would be in a   full-fledged downturn at this point  The Detroit Three automakers are enjoying a better profit   environment, which is driven by a markedly lower cost structure, substantially improved sales   relative to the depths of the recession, and strong retail prices that have been made possible by   price discipline, better inventory control, and the competitive disadvantages accruing to their   Japanese competitors  However, the importance of cyclical demand is not lost on the   automakers  GM and Ford have already marked down their sales forecasts for 2012 by about   half a million units  Auto production plans that remain amenable to changing, like those for the   fourth quarter, currently are being reassessed in light of economic developments  Obviously, this   includes making contingency plans in the event a new recession emerges, which at least one of   them views as a significant possibility  I got a similar message from the big temporary   August 9, 2011 47 of 162              employment firms  They saw some modest softening of demand in the second half of July, but   so far nothing too far out of line with normal patterns  Their main complaint continues to be that   their clients remain extremely cautious about starting significant new projects  Furthermore,   they note that many firms are nervous about the outlook and are currently able to pull back on   hiring on very short notice  Recent developments also suggest that inflation risks over the   medium term continue to recede  My reasons for this assessment are unchanged—well known   from past meetings—and, I believe, stronger given recent developments and greater forward-  looking risks  I continue to believe that inflation over the medium term will underrun our   mandate-consistent inflation objective   I said there were large cracks in our monetary policy framework  The essence of my   argument is somewhat simple  Our legally mandated responsibilities are to provide monetary   conditions to support price stability and maximum employment  During less conventional times,   our standard, Taylor-like approach to policymaking has served us well with respect to these dual   mandate responsibilities  This has been true even when inflation and unemployment were   unsatisfactory but still within their more normal ranges  And Mr Chairman, it is my lasting   opinion that no one could have navigated the Federal Reserve and the US economy through the   recent period of crisis any better than you did  But today’s challenges are still severe  A   standard way to score our policy performance on our composite responsibilities is to use a policy   loss function like the one the Tealbook, Book B, uses in its optimal policy simulations  The next   three sentences are somewhat tedious  [Laughter]  The simulations put equal weight on squared   deviations in inflation from 2 percent, and the unemployment rate from the effective NAIRU,   with an Okun’s law coefficient of ½  That’s equivalent to putting weights of 1 on the squared   inflation gap and ¼ on the deviation in output from potential  So I think that’s somewhat   August 9, 2011 48 of 162              conservative in the central banker camp—¼ on an output gap relative to 1 on inflation  With this   context, here’s the simplest statement of our current policy crisis  Today’s 9 percent   unemployment policy loss is equivalent to an inflation crisis on the order of 5 percent  Does   anyone believe we would be sitting on our hands waiting for inflation to come down from such   an elevated level as 5 percent?  I don’t think so  I think we should have the same attitude toward   an unemployment rate of 9 percent  The fact that we don’t express that same revulsion exposes   the very large cracks in our dual mandate policy framework, and I think we really need to discuss   that more  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Although it might be standard to say that   another meeting’s worth of data might resolve uncertainty, the most recent NIPA revisions have   answered enough of these questions for me  Without substantial clarification of our policy   intentions in line with our dual mandate responsibilities, I think there’s a distinctly high   probability that we will continually revisit these periods of anemic growth without ever escaping   the current malaise  Consequently, I favor a strong indication today of additional   accommodation  I think alternative A is certainly a plausible demonstration of that    Alternative B doesn’t do that  I am quite attracted to the suggestion that you’re making today   and to Governor Yellen’s proposal  So let me talk about a few things in that regard   Governor Yellen says that she would entertain this accommodative monetary policy to   better center our inflation forecast at 2 percent, which is our objective  I would do more  I   believe clarifying our policy framework in order to better achieve our dual mandate                                                    4 The material distributed by Ms Smith is appended to this transcript (appendix 4)   August 9, 2011 97 of 162              responsibilities would help provide further policy accommodation, at least along the lines   suggested in Eggertsson and Woodford, and this helps by defining that as extending through   mid-2013  What is clarity?  Conducting monetary policy in accordance with our dual mandate   should mean that as long as high unemployment is generating an extraordinary policy loss, the   FOMC is willing to provide very large amounts of accommodation and tolerate medium-term   inflation substantially above 2 percent  I want to thank President Hoenig for listening to me   earlier, and I certainly take your point     As I mentioned earlier, a 9 percent unemployment rate against a very   conservative natural rate of 6 percent generates a policy loss that is as large as if inflation were   running at 5 percent against a 2 percent objective  But my stronger point is this  We talk and act   as if 2 percent is an almost unacceptable inflation rate and a ceiling that limits further policy   accommodation  A couple of examples  First, the common view seems to be that we will   consider further LSAPs and more only if the risk of deflation is significant  I’m glad there’s a   floor, but the ceiling is too low  Second, in an interview the other day, Don Kohn—for whom I   have the highest regard—spoke in the following way  He said that additional quantitative easing   might be appropriate if inflation keeps coming down  His option for QE3 was handcuffed by an   inflation ceiling that’s too low in my opinion  Today’s medium-term inflation pressures are   overstated  I do not see how this ceiling-like framework is consistent with our dual mandate   responsibilities, at least not if the ceiling is 2 percent  Our objective can be 2 percent  We   should average that, but it shouldn’t be our ceiling   In favoring alternative A, I’m attracted to the additional commitment—defining   “extended period” to be at least mid-2013  I certainly support that  I suspect that we would have   August 9, 2011 98 of 162              ended up there anyway  So we should reap the benefit of reducing the uncertainty  I’m also   quite attracted to the additional language that Governor Yellen used in terms of stating that this   could be appropriate as long as the unemployment rate is above 7½ percent  But again—and I   don’t have the exact language—regarding “as long as medium-term inflation is subdued,” I   would agree with that if we understood better that “subdued” could include 2½ percent in the   current environment or even 3 percent  But I do like that type of language   I think we need to avoid signaling that we’re AWOL, and so I agree with your   suggestion, Mr Chairman  One thing that does seem missing in the current formulation of   alternative B, as I understand it, is that it doesn’t include the characterization that the downside   risks have increased, and I wonder how that would be interpreted  I really think that should be   included  Alternative A has language like that as well as, frankly, I think, a better description of   the temporary factors  I would have been happy to take paragraphs 1 and 2 from alternative A,   but I’m quite happy to support your suggestion, Mr Chairman  Thank you     If I could just ask a question, because I know that President Bullard   mentioned that an unemployment trigger of 7½ percent could be super risky, and I thought you   mentioned it this way earlier, President Plosser  Governor Yellen’s proposal has jointly with the   unemployment rate trigger the admonition that inflationary pressures ought to be—and we can   disagree over what it is—subdued or some number  In pointing to unemployment, do you have   in mind some risk beyond the inflationary risk?     As long as you’ve got the inflation safeguard—I mean, I could say   6 percent unemployment  And as soon as inflation got up to like 2¼ percent, that would come   out of that conditionality  So I’m not quite sure that’s such an issue     No reference to mid-2013?   August 9, 2011 120 of 162                Mr Chairman—     I could not  I mean, it just seems clear that we would simply be   postponing that very discussion until September, when we would have the very same outcome    And so I could not support that     We really should let everybody else have an opportunity     Were we working on Governor Yellen’s language?     I’m sorry, I don’t know what we’re talking about  This is critical to me     I’m sorry, we’re on alternative B?     But still “through mid-2013”?  It’s the date that matters      Come on, you can’t say empty     Mr Chairman, can I just say that a number of people have preferred   alternative A?  I mean, if you’re going to take three dissents—     Well, I remember hearing John Taylor, or maybe he wrote it down in his   blog somewhere, say that he disagrees with that characterization  Now, I don’t agree with how   he described it, but at some point he said that output is only in there to capture inflationary   pressures and things like that  So there is tremendous disagreement     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Let me say at the outset that I generally agree   with all of your opening comments on flexible inflation targeting  I think if we were very clear   on exactly what that conveys, that would go a long way toward helping with the current   situation   The premise of this discussion today is, what should the Fed do if more monetary   accommodation is called for but the fed funds rate is stuck at the zero lower bound?  There are   two key channels for transmitting more accommodation, and they’ve been discussed already at   great length  The first is to use our balance sheet and work the portfolio-balance effects  The   LSAPs, the MEP, and the RMEP all work that way  The second is to provide greater forward   guidance on an accommodative monetary policy stance  We can do this by signaling a larger   amount of monetary accommodation over a longer period of time  Strong accommodation would   be to keep short-term policy rates at zero for an admittedly uncomfortably long period of time    This lowers real interest rates owing to higher inflationary expectations  I would say that given   nominal rigidities in labor markets, higher inflation for a time likely would facilitate better   matching and hiring as well   But one of the big problems—and it’s been alluded to by Presidents Bullard,   Kocherlakota, and Plosser—is the time-consistency problem of promising to have more inflation   September 20–21, 2011 72 of 290              than what our perceived inflation objective is  Central bankers will withdraw accommodation   prematurely because they don’t like higher inflation, even modestly above a longer-run target    And of course, external criticism feeds this response, and it’s very difficult to counterbalance   those influences  Now, logically, these perceptions among the public make our current policy   stance more restrictive because there’s more of a probability attached to the possibility that we   might raise rates prematurely  So an additional tool to provide added accommodation would be   greater clarity of our forward intentions  Stating economic triggers for a state-contingent policy   response can help us  Doing this in conjunction with a maturity extension program or asset   purchases would strengthen the commitment to persistent accommodation  I have a different   view than President Bullard on this  I think that that would actually be successful in helping   display credibility   The Board staff’s analyses provide compelling evidence that further accommodation can   be delivered with reasonable safeguards and acceptable risks, in my opinion  FRB/US and other   Board models are the only reasonable macro models that are available to help us to sort through   this at the moment  These models incorporate both sensible, modern macroeconomic analyses   and empirically reasonable matches between the model and the data  Simplistic real business   cycle or New Keynesian structures that can’t explain basic features of quarterly or annual macro   data can’t be called upon for guidance here  Our Fed DSGE project is making good progress,   but it’s not far enough along to provide alternative answers in those frameworks, and we need to   make decisions sooner than we’re going to be making progress on those DSGE models   President Bullard mentioned a New Keynesian model with search by Ravenna and   Walsh  I confess not to have been familiar with this paper, and it’s got a labor market and so   that’s good, but as macroeconomists, we tend not to be troubled by the fact that we don’t have   September 20–21, 2011 73 of 290              labor markets in these models  Charlie and other early contributors to real business cycle theory   didn’t worry a lot about particular details; that’s part of the art of it  When I asked the staff to   look at this model, they summarized it this way  The Ravenna and Walsh model is not an   empirically credible basis on which to base the actual conduct of monetary policy  I say this   because the article’s policy prescriptions are driven almost entirely by an empirically implausible   factor  In particular, the model says essentially that the high levels of unemployment we   currently see are due to workers having magically become much more powerful in their wage   negotiations with employers  They’re able to bid the wage up to a high level; they’re thrown out   of work; the unemployment rate is high—that’s a key feature in the model’s supply structure    It’s not necessary to point out how ridiculous that sounds in the current period  We understand   these factors about supply effects in these models, and I don’t believe these influences are   relevant for today’s 91 percent unemployment rate  We talked about it in January, and I don’t   think we made a lot of progress here  The way to artfully interpret FRB/US and other models   that may or may not have a complicated labor market is to think through those types of factors   and whether or not they sound reasonable today  To me, they don’t   The analyses from FRB/US and company provide a wide variety of comforting risk   assessments associated with a forward guidance that’s based upon unemployment and inflation   triggers  I won’t repeat those presentations  I found them to provide strong support for these   positions  The caveats are well known and can be taken into account, and Mr Chairman, I   thought that you were exactly on target when you opened up by saying that this is sort of like   having in our statement something like, “Well, it’s going to be this way until the Red Sox win   the pennant”  We could go further  We could do it and say “until the Chicago Cubs win the   World Series”  [Laughter]   September 20–21, 2011 74 of 290                Well, we have the inflation trigger, which is the safeguard against that    So if structural unemployment is higher than most of us think and I’m wrong about the labor   market assessment earlier, then strong monetary accommodation will lead to medium-term   inflation pressures sooner than I expect  The role of the inflation trigger is to provide a good   safeguard against this adverse outcome  If longer-term inflation expectations become   unanchored, we will see evidence of this from financial market data and surveys  In addition,   medium-term inflation will move up more quickly than I expect  Again, the role of the inflation   trigger is to provide a good safeguard against this adverse outcome   After reviewing the analyses, I continue to feel that a reasonable and aggressive set of   triggers, if it was a decision today, would be 7 percent for unemployment and 3 percent for   medium-term inflation  With an inflation objective of 2 percent, I think that 3 percent inflation is   a reasonable statement of symmetric preferences around our objective  Having said this, I agree   with President Kocherlakota that it’s very important for the leadership of the Committee, if we   were to go this route, to clearly communicate what our intentions are about inflation and inflation   above our objective, what it means for flexible inflation targeting  Just using that phrase might   not be enough  And in fact, I think that the concerns that President Bullard has about the   worrisome zero inflation equilibrium would also be mitigated by the leadership speaking about   intentions toward higher inflation because that would be a move away from that equilibrium   Turning to the specific questions and just to finish up, let me reorder them according to   my preferences  First, I think it would be most effective to continue providing some form of   aggressive forward guidance  The use of “mid-2013” was helpful in the context of wanting to   provide more accommodation, which last meeting I did  Providing economic triggers like the   September 20–21, 2011 75 of 290              unemployment rate and medium-term inflation is the better way—by adding a more credible   commitment  Level targeting might be best, although I think the benefits of aggressive triggers   with inflation safeguards may be close to the benefits of level targeting  Second, announcing   complementary purchases that aim to reduce long-maturity term premiums can provide powerful   support to the forward guidance  I find the MEP approach to add acceptable accommodation at   the outset; the reinvestment is a good addition, too, but these may not be enough  In the event   that no meaningful progress is made in moving closer to hitting the triggers, adding further asset   purchases would increase the level of accommodation  And with enough forward guidance,   perhaps President Bullard’s pace of purchases program would be appropriate at that later time    Third, I think that reducing IOER as much as is feasible would help a bit, too  It would be useful   at the margin to provide disincentives for financial institutions that currently prefer cash over   lending   On the particular questions related to monetary policy communications, I support   providing more-explicit, quantitative information about the Committee’s longer-run objective for   inflation and its projection of the level to which the unemployment rate will converge  And I can   think of no reason to preclude discussions of the unemployment rate—or the output gap, if that   was preferred—as they are critical objects for making monetary policy, and we need to be   transparent  I approve of the general idea of providing information about the Committee’s   reaction function, like the economic and inflation triggers I discussed earlier and in August, and I   find the language in alternative A, paragraphs 2 and 4, to be quite appealing  Thank you, Mr   Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  After reviewing the messages from my   directors and business contacts, I think the best way to characterize their commentary is that the   September 20–21, 2011 145 of 290              US economy is treading water at the moment  No one I speak with disagrees with the view that   the economy is largely moving sideways relative to trend growth  As of now, none see their own   businesses dropping off as if the economy were in recession  Manpower Employment Services   noted that its July and August business was volatile—down and then up a bit  Most of   Manpower’s clients are experiencing flat or, at most, small increases in revenue, and some are   making contingency plans to cut back on their workforces in case the economy deteriorates    Other contacts noted similar contingency planning  One of my region’s best-performing large   manufacturers with a globally diversified business line described the current situation by saying,   “The ice keeps getting thinner  We expect things will be fine unless the ice breaks”  It sounds   like nice theater, but here’s the scary part  The company has instructed all of its units to mock up   plans for a 30 percent reduction in capital expenditure spending if it finds it needs to pull the   trigger  To recount the recent fundamentals succinctly, developments in Europe and   Washington, weak US economic data, and the associated volatility and net declines in US   equity markets all have had negative effects on household and business confidence  Cyclically   sensitive industries, like autos, are expressing substantial concern over the drop in consumer   sentiment and the potential for a falloff in demand in the fourth quarter   In financial markets, several contacts noted how things today feel eerily as they did in   2008 before Lehman went down, and one can hardly blame them, considering the risk to   financial institutions in Europe, highlighted most recently by the funding stresses faced by the   French banks over the past couple of weeks  One contact noted the widely held expectation that   the US economy is in for a long slog but no double dip  However, they are concerned that this   forecast couldn’t hold up to the financial contagion that would result from further significant   stresses on some big European banks  Of course, substantial progress has been made  Since   September 20–21, 2011 146 of 290              2009, US banks are better capitalized and have greater liquidity cushions, and the risks from   excessive leverage have fallen in some sectors  For example, our financial contacts tell us that   hedge funds have been reducing leverage for some time  Consequently, the recent equity market   declines did not experience any amplification effect from forced sales to meet their debt   obligations  Instead, recent equity sales likely reflected greater pessimism in general about the   economic situation—greater economic risk, for sure, but less leverage risk  That’s what our   contacts suggest   Finally, a different parallel to 2008 is the concern over inflation pressures  Like today’s   situation, back in 2008, there were substantial concerns over the risks of continued higher   inflation  Indeed, my directors and I, in August 2008, voted for an increase in the discount rate   in order to reduce those inflationary pressures  In my opinion, that turned out not to be the right   move  Inflation concerns evaporated quickly with the economic downturn and commensurate   with the decline in actual inflation  Today, with the currently weak business outlook, the pass-  through of earlier high materials costs into prices is waning  At this point, let me take the   opportunity—President Lacker made the comment about how output gaps and resource slack in   our models depend importantly not just on how you would detrend these objects but also on a   comparison with the efficient flex-price equilibrium  No?     No, no  Exactly  That’s what I’m saying  They do not rely on   detrending     They instead rely on comparisons with the flex-price equilibrium     Okay  Right  Our DSGE model obeys that type of definition—the   Woodford definition  But here’s the important thing  It sounds as though we don’t quite know   what we’re doing when we talk about resource slack  That’s not right  It fundamentally comes   down to, what do you think are the sources of the shocks that hit the economy?  In the flex-price   equilibrium, it’s going to depend on whether or not you think they are technology shocks, so that   in the efficient equilibrium, output is a lot lower in a potential output—or flex-price   equilibrium—sense or whether you think that demand is lower, and it’s not the case that potential   output is lower  So if you think that the most recent downturn and impediments to growth are   due to technology shocks or higher wage bargaining on the part of workers that leads to higher   wages and then to a higher unemployment rate, that would in fact lead to thinking that there’s not   as much resource slack and there would be more inflationary pressures  But if you take the view   that they are demand shocks, as our Chicago DSGE model does in fact find, then there’s a lot of   resource slack—indeed, there’s a ton of resource slack as they continue to update that model—  and inflationary pressures are lowered  Again, it’s a difference of opinion on what the driving   forces are for the current period   To sum up, here’s my simple view on our current macro forecasting exercises  The   economy is performing pretty poorly right now  There’s no meaningful difference between   today’s world and one that has the NBER’s “bad housekeeping seal” of being labeled as in   recession  One typical response during periods of economic weakness, like we face today, is to   spend a lot of time trying to figure out whether or not the economy is falling into a recession    That effort just isn’t necessary at this point  Whether growth is going negative or slightly   positive is not the issue  Even a continuation of modest positive growth will leave us with large   resource gaps, appropriately defined, for an unacceptable period of time  I continue to agree   September 20–21, 2011 148 of 290              with the Tealbook’s assessment that substantial slack will result in inflation over the medium   term coming in under my interpretation of our objective—namely, 2 percent  Thank you,   Mr Chairman     I could be wrong, but this seems to be a relatively new development in our   statement, right?  Because we used to use the term “underlying inflation,” and underlying   inflation had a connotation of a little more ambiguity for good or bad, right?  I mean, we have all   cherry-picked at times, “I’ve been saying 12 months  Now I’m going to roll into the 3-month   window because that’s what I think is more indicative of our pressures”  And when we took out   the underlying measure concept, we bought into this other problem, which is that we really ought   to be talking about inflation over the medium term, with the emphasis on forecasting  We ought   to think more carefully about how to deal with this  I agree with that     But “underlying inflation” is helpful for that, and it’s also more related   September 20–21, 2011 195 of 290                Yes     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I want to thank President Lacker and others   for their sobering comments about the 1970s  I don’t think anybody here can conduct monetary   policy without at least being concerned about any parallels to the 1970s and that difficult period   in which the Fed didn’t perform as ably as anyone would have hoped  That said, I believe that   today, this period, will be as important for the United States as the 1930s were  The   responsibilities of the Federal Reserve are as important today as they were in 1930s  This gives   me great pause  The 1930s Fed has been vociferously criticized, and I don’t think that this is a   time for monetary policy in a business-as-usual mode  We have to think differently than that   Normally, monetary policy can act within sS bands and achieve good outcomes with   normal policy responses that are within these bands  Whenever policy is normally within these   channels, you can follow a Taylor rule  You can follow the same type of policy process that   President Bullard talks about in terms of having a bias for policy and a continuation basis  But   times are very different now  In 2008 and 2009, we blew through those sS bands  At the zero   lower bound, we did all kinds of additional liquidity programs like the TALF, QE1, and QE2   Milton Friedman said that short-term interest rates of zero are a sign of restrictive   monetary policy  That’s what we’re facing at the moment  There’s an excess demand for safe   assets  I think we have liquidity trap conditions, which are inhibiting the accommodative stance   of policy that we’d like to say that we have but, in fact, we don’t  Since most of the public,   however, disagrees with this Friedman characterization—that our policy is restrictive today—we   have a tough mountain to climb, but we should climb that mountain   The effects of policy accommodation are currently held back by the time-consistency   dilemma of conservative central bankers  I talked about this yesterday  Many around this table   will earnestly talk about inflation risks and have the effect of damping the expectation that policy   September 20–21, 2011 234 of 290              can be truly accommodative into 2013 and beyond  For policy to be truly accommodative, I   think we need a clear and transparent commitment to forward guidance  I commented yesterday   about how the usefulness of economic markers related to the unemployment rate, with inflation   safeguards, would help dramatically to achieve that type of clarity  Yes, I think we should have   more clarification on the language that we introduced at our last meeting in terms of mid-2013    It wasn’t totally satisfactory  I don’t think anybody would disagree with that, but we need   clarification of that in line with what our objectives really are   Mr Chairman, yesterday you spoke very well about flexible inflation targeting, but I   think that details really matter there, and we have different views about how we think about   flexible inflation targeting around this table  I don’t think it’s well understood  I agree with   President Kocherlakota’s suggestion that we need the leadership of the Committee to speak   publicly about this  I think that you and the Vice Chairs should craft the most aggressive   characterization of flexible inflation targeting as we can do  That’s very important  I gave a   speech recently where I used the colorful phrase that we should act as if our hair were on fire   because of the fact that the unemployment rate was very high  I did that, in part, to clarify and   amplify the key operating requirements that are part of flexible inflation targeting  I thought that   was just a natural way to help describe what that really means because it’s not out there enough   Many times in the last two days we’ve made comments about how fragile our FOMC   statement is and that it can’t really bear the burden of including a few additional safeguards   because the public won’t understand it  I disagree with that at least in the following sense  I   think that the Chairman, especially the Chairman, should craft a speech or testimony in which he   describes exactly what we mean by these important policy options, and then they find their way   into the statement in a way that is well understood by the public when they first see them  That’s   September 20–21, 2011 235 of 290              how important changes in language have often been introduced, which suggests that, in fact, we   could introduce those types of communication vehicles  It does require more than just   introducing it to the statement  It requires a lot of additional work, but there’s time to do that   work within a short period of time   The discussion at this meeting reinforces for me that our current policy development is a   journey  I recognize that we won’t get to the conclusion that I favor today, but we have to   continue to make further progress today  I prefer, not surprisingly, alternative A with   paragraphs 2 and 4  Frankly, if I had an ideal policy characterization of this, I would say that we   could tolerate short-term deviations of inflation from our target up to 3 percent, and the   unemployment rate threshold of 6½ percent would also be very reasonable, according to my   reading of the policy memos  Whether or not we choose LSAPs or a maturity extension program   is less critical to me  It’s more about the commitment to having an accommodative policy  So I   am fine with just doing the MEP as described in alternative B  I think we should expect to make   progress toward hitting these thresholds, and if setbacks were to occur and progress wasn’t made   in a reasonable period of time, then we should respond with more policy accommodation    However, we’ve got inflation safeguards in the framework that I prefer  If medium-term   inflation—it’s a forecast, but that’s how we have to think about inflation—were to go above 3   percent, then we would think about winding down that type of accommodation  If people don’t   like using the unemployment rate in there, there are other reasonable measures that could be put   in there  We have talked about resource slack and about output gaps, but a lot of times one   reason why we talk about unemployment is because people are nervous about saying the output   gap because of the uncertainty  There’s going to be uncertainty, but we have to be able to point   September 20–21, 2011 236 of 290              to something  If you don’t like unemployment, we could use the employment-to-population   ratio  I don’t see why that can’t be achieved   I can accept that more discussion is required before we can entertain the types of actions   like those we’ve discussed today  I look forward to additional discussions about policy   frameworks, state contingent as they might be  I think that the state exists where we should   undertake these  Alt B today can be acceptable to me  It’s very important that as long as we   make progress today toward more accommodation, I can support this  If the journey stops   prematurely or aborts, I’m not sure I could support that given the extraordinary needs that the   economy faces, and so I think November will be a very important discussion   In terms of additional particulars, in alternative B the discussion about MBS purchases is   fine  On the inflation in the first paragraph, you could go either way on this  It is true that this   should be a factual discussion about developments of inflation, and sometimes it’s just not how   you would like it to be, but you have to acknowledge that, and you have to get that right in the   second paragraph where you’re talking about the forward-looking expectation for inflation We   have to make a choice there, but we’re going to have to live with it  That’s everything  Thank   you, Mr Chairman       Thank you, Mr Chairman  I’m not sure I was prepared for every one of   those questions, but I certainly appreciate them  Before I simply answer the routine questions,   I’d like to put some of this material in context  My first reaction to the outstanding staff memos   November 1–2, 2011 26 of 282              is extremely positive  As President Bullard said, I’m a big fan  I thought that was a great   presentation, great answers to the questions   I’m happy to see that there are policy approaches available to us that should produce   economic outcomes that are vastly preferred to our current outlook, and as you just mentioned,   Mr Chairman, it’s easy to see why there’s a growing clamor among an impressive variety of   outside experts calling for more aggressive action, like Christy Romer, Mike Woodford, Ken   Rogoff, the staff at Goldman Sachs, et cetera   Outsiders have an easier time advocating these prescriptions  For us insiders, details   matter for the implementation  But before we can even consider technical details, I think the first   major issue to grapple with is this  Has our current policy framework limited our effectiveness   because it’s not properly understood by the Committee in its fullness or by the public, or because   we disagree on the particulars of our framework?  I personally think this is a concern  I   mentioned this back in August when I said I thought that there were cracks emerging in our   policy framework  I won’t belabor this issue  I’ve given two speeches on the dual mandate and   my interpretation of its implications for our policymaking   I don’t believe we all agree on what flexible inflation targeting means and we simply   disagree over many details of our policy objectives  Last week President Kocherlakota offered   an informative and welcome memo on the dual mandate  I disagree with his preferences, but I   welcome the information revelation on these fundamental issues   Here’s my first takeaway message  Our standard policy framework—one that glosses   over the details of what we mean by flexible inflation targeting within our dual mandate   responsibilities—usually works when the real economy and inflation pressures are within 1 or   November 1–2, 2011 27 of 282              maybe 2 percentage points of our goals  But when our policy differences burst into the open, as   they have given today’s extreme economic circumstances, this ambiguity is not constructive   My second message is that today we need to adopt a more explicit framework  Even a   complete articulation of our standard approach is unlikely to address the full range of relevant   risk that the economy and monetary policy currently face  This is of enormous importance     To highlight the potential value of these alternative policy frameworks, I want to focus a   bit on risk-management considerations related to our current economic problems  Since the   spring and summer of 2010, it has become more and more apparent that our macroeconomic   problems are much larger than we had been planning for  There are essentially two story lines   that are used to account for the aberrantly slow growth and high unemployment following the   Great Recession, and I’d like to pick up on one of the themes that President Bullard was   mentioning in terms of how we could get into trouble with some of these approaches   The first story line I refer to as the “structural impediments” scenario  In this scenario,   the Great Recession was accompanied by an acute period of structural change, labor mismatch,   job-killing uncertainties, and excessive regulatory burdens  As best I can tell, this scenario   consists of lots of conjectures about economic outcomes and potential equilibriums  I would like   to be able to point to macro simulation evidence from empirically relevant general equilibrium   models studied by research economists that support this scenario, but I’m not aware of these   studies  I don’t know where to look, and I’d be happy for anybody to add in a literature list  The   links to the relevant economic literature are unclear to me, at least  Nevertheless, in this story   line, the role for additional monetary accommodation is modest, at best  We are up against a   supply constraint that monetary policy can’t fix  In this scenario, we should be guarding against   a repeat of the 1970s  We should thus revert to what I refer to as “business as usual” monetary   November 1–2, 2011 28 of 282              policies  Accordingly, it’s probably time to begin considering removing excess accommodation   before inflation rises above target and inflation expectations become unhinged   The second story line I referred to as the “liquidity trap” scenario  In this scenario, short-  term risk-free rates are zero  Actual real rates are modestly negative, but the real natural rate of   interest is strikingly negative  This is due to an abundance of risk aversion, extreme patience,   and deleveraging, and these attitudes are unlikely to disappear any time soon  In this scenario,   we’re in the aftermath of an enormous Reinhart–Rogoff financial crisis, and the resulting drags   on demand are exceedingly large and persistent  The clear and present danger here is that we   repeat the experiences of the US in the 1930s or Japan over the past 20 years  Liquidity traps   have been studied in general equilibrium models by Paul Krugman, Gauti Eggertson, and Mike   Woodford, and also recently by Iván Werning in a continuous-time framework  The conclusions   from this literature indicate that there are monetary policy prescriptions that can vastly improve   outcomes in such an event     I think the evidence strongly favors the liquidity trap scenario  That’s my opinion  But   rather than putting all of our eggs in one theoretical basket, let’s consider the case where we   don’t know which scenario is really the one we face today  This leads me to think more about a   robust risk-management approach to the dilemma that these two scenarios present  If both are   possible, but we don’t know which one we face, how can we avoid risking a repeat of either the   1970s or the 1930s?  Because I put high weight on liquidity trap theories, put me down as being   sympathetic to nominal GDP targeting  I was actually not supposed to say that [laughter], but   anyway I edited that out  The problem is that policies that are optimal for the liquidity trap   scenario would generate high inflation if the structural impediment scenario actually was true  I   think that’s what President Bullard was alluding to  Conversely, policies that are optimal for the   November 1–2, 2011 29 of 282              structural impediment scenario would leave the economy mired in depression and deflation if   applied during a liquidity trap scenario   Fortunately, even amidst these two extreme scenarios, there is a middle-ground policy   approach  A relatively robust policy approach would be to sharpen forward guidance in two   directions  First, ensure state-contingent accommodative policies as long as unemployment is   somewhat above its natural rate  But second, include an additional safeguard that policy will   pull back if inflation rises above a threshold that would signal the economy is running into   supply constraints, such as those in the structural impediment scenario   In my opinion, the inflation safeguard threshold needs to be substantially above our   inflation objective, and I’ve said in public perhaps 3 percent  Ken Rogoff has suggested   4 percent, 4 to 6 percent, he even said, and, frankly, Governor Bernanke suggested to Japan also   a very large number when he was offering advice   This guidance is consistent with the most recent liquidity trap research by MIT Professor   Iván Werning, which shows that improved economic performance during a liquidity trap requires   allowing inflation to run higher than the inflation target  In addition, establishing credible   expectations of these events likely requires overshooting the efficient output level and creating   an output boom, reversing the resource gap once the natural rate of interest returns to positive   territory, and there were many simulations that had those characteristics that Michael was talking   about  Under this trigger threshold policy, if the liquidity trap scenario is indeed true, then the   massive degree of resource slack in the economy means such an output boom could perhaps be   achieved without putting excessive pressure on productive resources  On the negative side, if the   structural impediment scenario was instead true, inflation will rise more quickly and without any   real-side improvements  In such an adverse situation, the inflation safeguard triggers an exit   November 1–2, 2011 30 of 282              from non-evident excessive policy accommodation before inflation expectations become   unhinged   Accordingly, under either scenario, liquidity trap or structural impediments, this policy   keeps long-term inflation expectations firm  In my opinion, applying this trigger threshold risk-  management approach to our current economic situation is really just an embodiment of what I   see as our broader flexible inflation-targeting framework  The benefits of this policy draw me to   the structure in alternative A1 with the paragraph 4″ option in the Tealbook  However, as I   mentioned before, I prefer a 3 percent medium-term inflation trigger instead of the 2½ percent   one mentioned there   According to the logic of the liquidity trap theory, we risk being mired for an   unacceptably long period in recession-like circumstances unless we are willing to voluntarily   embrace and commit to a higher inflation rate than our medium-term objective, at least for a   time  It is against central bankers’ DNA to discuss and acknowledge this, but we should not risk   an outcome like the US in the 1930s or Japan today  Three percent just isn’t such a big number   that we should resist it the way the 1930s Fed adhered to the gold standard   Now, to quickly wrap up with regard to the specific questions posed to the Committee, I   agree that the flexible inflation-targeting framework described in the memo is consistent with the   Federal Reserve’s dual mandate  I also think we should enunciate such a framework, and that it   would be helpful for the Committee to be explicit in articulating these principles   To reach a consensus statement, of course, we need to agree on an explicit numerical   target for our inflation objective, and also what that target means operationally  After all, we   should be confident that our choice of inflation target and operating procedure are jointly   consistent with an exceedingly low probability of hitting the zero lower bound over the next   November 1–2, 2011 31 of 282              20 years  We’ve hit it twice in the past 10 years, in my opinion  I answered the second question   extensively  Yes, I think the Committee’s best choice is to announce and commit to the optimal   policy path under commitment   Finally, I believe that nominal income targeting is a close cousin to the economic   thresholds policies  It is simply bigger and less prescriptive regarding the composition of growth   and inflation  I expect that additional forward guidance combined with further asset purchases   would either increase growth or generate inflation, or both, but just in case, a bigger   communications bazooka is needed  I would prepare the groundwork for introducing nominal   income targeting if it’s needed  Thank you, Mr Chairman     No, I thought it was good  [Laughter]     Yes, I think you’re right  I understand that, and in fact, I spent a little   more time reading Friedman and Schwartz and The Great Contraction, and at the end of that   lovely chapter, they had this section on why monetary policy was so inept  And I remember   back to the lovely Milton Friedman celebration of his 90th birthday party where you gave a   speech where—with Milton Friedman in the front row, attentive as always after a very long night   before and that morning and afternoon—you assured him that the Federal Reserve had, indeed,   caused mischief in the ’30s, and that we wouldn’t do it again   November 1–2, 2011 32 of 282              I looked at that chapter, and I totally agree with you that you have been faithful to that    During the contraction, there were policies that should have been taken that were not, that could   have prevented deflation and the Depression  I agree with that  I think we could do more,   though  That’s all I’m saying  Thank you     Could I ask a clarifying question?     President Bullard, you often had mentioned the Benhabib–Schmitt-Grohé   paper—and I have to admit that the half-life of my understanding of those analyses is usually   less than a full meeting length when I ask my staff about that—but I thought that that relied on a   Taylor-rule monetary policy, doesn’t it ?      But we’ve been running balance sheet policies and we’re also at the zero   lower bound, so obviously we’re still running that type of policy  Isn’t that the kind of thing that   would tend to break that equilibrium?     I mean, usually there’s some threshold     I didn’t want to get into too much     I thought you spoke Norwegian       Thank you, Mr Chairman  My assessment of the economic outlook has   not changed meaningfully over the past few meetings  I do not see any evidence that the US   economy is poised to achieve escape velocity anytime soon  We’ve experienced periods when   the balance of the incoming data had been negative  More recently, the news has been somewhat   better  I made it a point not to overreact to the weaker monthly data we saw this summer, and so   I’m not overreacting to the more positive numbers we’ve seen of late  The best-case outlook   seems to be simply muddling along  The recent, more positive data are still only indicative of an   economy that’s just treading water  The 2½ percent growth rates we’re looking at over the near   term are just not enough to make meaningful headway into the substantial resource gaps we see   in the economy today   Commentary from my business contacts continues to support this assessment  Indeed,   there really wasn’t that much new in their reports this round  Overall, most say things are   moving sideways at this time  They just don’t see the demand in place to justify expanding   workforces or capacity  Many of my contacts said they were demanding contingency plans from   their staffs to slash expenditures 5 to 30 percent if needed, and I continue to hear many say they   are making plans to promptly cut spending at the first sign of a downturn in demand  These are   November 1–2, 2011 148 of 282              hardly the plans of business leaders who are contemplating an acceleration in their activities  I   expect more of the same  The ups and downs in the national data did show through in our   contacts’ commentaries about the automotive industry  The OEMs and their suppliers are   expecting continuing modest improvement in auto sales and production, but they don’t see things   taking off, either   Everyone continues to be concerned about Europe  This report seems stale  The reports   from my staff, who talk to people in the Chicago markets—the report seemed stale on Friday, but   it seems a little fresh today  Prior to last week’s announcement, the financial-sector contacts said   that uncertainty and caution were freezing up some markets  That said, there was little evidence   of panic  Our contacts also said that they would view any European debt package with some   skepticism  They seem to be on target with that one  They question the Europeans’ ability to   execute whatever immediate plans they come up with, as well as the prospects for a longer-term   resolution given the impediments to growth in the region   Turning to the macro outlook for the US, our growth forecast is similar to the   Tealbook’s  We also think that the reductions the Board staff has made to potential output are   plausible, and these reductions are not small  They cut nearly 3 percent from the level you   would get by simply extrapolating forward a modest 2½ percent growth trend from the beginning   of the recession—not as much as the 5½ percent growth that President Williams was talking   about  But even with this substantial reduction in potential, we’re still looking at large output   gaps and growth forecasts that leave resource utilization at very low levels throughout the   projection period    To sum up, all of the incoming data and anecdotal reports point to an economy that’s just   sputtering along  We’re generating growth, but it falls far short of the pace we need given the   November 1–2, 2011 149 of 282              size of the resource gaps that must be closed  With regard to the two scenarios I discussed this   morning, in my opinion, the US economy is entangled in a liquidity trap with amplification   from a large Reinhart–Rogoff financial crisis  We could be staring at a lost decade, the way   President Williams was suggesting from his comments on Japan  Even if this is only an   exaggerated risk—I don’t think it is—if we fail to take further actions, owing to credibility risks,   we end up with about as much credibility as the Bank of Japan has, I worry  Like President   Rosengren, I worry about too slow, incremental policies  I think we need to continue to add   more accommodation  There are alternatives in the Tealbook, A1 and A2, and I’m   uncomfortable with stasis  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  Today I support further actions by the   Committee to provide additional significant monetary accommodation  I am not arguing that   economic conditions have deteriorated further and thus require this additional action  I am   arguing that the progression of adding stimulus needs to continue  In my assessment, there are   significant benefits to credibly solidifying expectations that policy will continue to be   extraordinarily accommodative as long as conditions warrant  I spoke about the risk-  management benefits at length yesterday, and I hope that the record properly reflects those   comments here as well in the interest of time   As I’ve stated here and in public, I interpret our dual-mandate responsibilities to be   closely associated with minimizing a quadratic policy loss function, which puts equal weights on   price stability and maximum employment as captured by unemployment deviations from a pretty   conservative and time-varying natural rate  Given such a loss function, the staff analysis shows   clear value in strengthening our forward guidance  I agree with President Rosengren very much   There are also considerations not captured by the staff analysis that I think add to the case   for further accommodation  Some of this came up yesterday  The longer we go with very high   unemployment and output far below its potential, the more we risk actually eroding that   potential  President Williams mentioned the supply effects the Japanese perceive  Some of the   reductions that we have already made to our estimates of potential are due to decreased capital   deepening that is actually a fallout of weak demand suppressing capital investment   Mr Chairman, your speeches have highlighted the corrosive effects of long-term   unemployment, and Governor Tarullo did a great job of explaining how we may be on the cusp   November 1–2, 2011 207 of 282              of finally significantly raising the natural rate of unemployment  I think those considerations add   some urgency to this situation   In favoring more policy accommodation in the form of certain variations of alternative A,   I expect that I will be outside the consensus policy decision today  Since July 2010, I’ve   advocated aggressive forms of additional policy accommodation  I argued for state-contingent   price-level targeting in the fall of 2010  I was pleased to support QE2 as a further substantial   step along the way, and I hoped that that would be enough  In August of this year, I argued for a   version of the trigger threshold strategy similar to the language in alt A1, paragraph 4″    Yesterday’s discussion clearly indicates that, at least for now, I’m outside of the Committee’s   consensus regarding such policy clarifications of our “mid-2013” forward guidance—that is, if in   fact there is a consensus regarding interpreting and clarifying “mid-2013”  We’re going to have   to deal with that soon  It’s not really optional   In any event, it’s my judgment that we need another substantial step toward additional   accommodation in order to solidify expectations  Accordingly, I favor alternative A1, with a   variation of paragraph 4″ included  I think that our exceptionally low range for the federal funds   rate will be appropriate, at least as long as the unemployment rate exceeds 7 percent or unless   medium-term PCE inflation exceeds 3 percent and longer-term inflation expectations become   unanchored  Just to be clear, my preferred strategy for delivering additional accommodation in   the most credible fashion would be to pursue additional asset purchases regularly at subsequent   meetings until the outlook for hitting either of these thresholds increased commensurately with   these additional actions   November 1–2, 2011 208 of 282              As I said, Mr Chairman, on the basis of yesterday’s commentaries, I expect that my   policy position is simply too far outside the consensus, and I cannot support alternative B today    Thank you     I would clearly support MBS  I think that that would be very helpful for   the housing market  And I also would say that if a consensus was to emerge—which I am not   anticipating—that some sort of asset purchasing today could be adopted, then I could be   prepared to support that     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I support this resolution today  I think that   it’s a relatively small action given everything that’s going on  As Vice Chairman Dudley just   mentioned, I’m not sure if this will solve the stigma problem, but we can find out  Showing   coordination with the other G-7 central banks is helpful in the current situation  Having listened   to the discussion from President Fisher and President Rosengren, I am a little nervous about the   discount rate alignment  It might be worth thinking through more carefully whether or not   reducing the discount rate to 50 basis points would be a good idea to align it with the overall   borrowing incentives associated with this swap  Trying to avoid any appearance that we’re   attempting to skirt disclosure requirements might be helpful, but that’s for the Board to decide,   obviously  Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  There have been several notable   developments since our last meeting, but they have not fundamentally changed the basic outlook    First, economic growth over the next few years still seems unlikely to be strong enough to make   sufficient progress on reducing resource gaps  And, second, inflation seems most likely to run   below 2 percent, what most of us would consider price stability  If monetary policy were as   extraordinarily overaccommodative as some say, inflation and inflation expectations should be   much, much higher, especially in the aftermath of the large relative price shocks earlier this year   Let me repeat the familiar list of headwinds  Households are deleveraging  Median   income has fallen 7 percent in the past 10 years, and on top of this decline, future income   December 13, 2011 47 of 198              prospects are poor  Overall net wealth has greatly diminished since the financial downturn    State and local governments have tightened their budgets dramatically, so that public-sector   employment has fallen substantially  And, of course, the housing market continues to struggle   with excess supply and the weight of the foreclosure crisis   Put this all together and it is clear to me that the American consumer will not be the   engine of growth for the US economy, much less the global economy  In this context, some of   the recent developments in labor markets have been a little surprising  I hope that the significant   drop in the unemployment rate is a harbinger of further good news, but there are serious reasons   to doubt that  Half of the decline in the unemployment rate last month was due to a drop in labor   force participation to a level even further below its long-run trend  Consequently, overall labor   market slack probably didn’t fall by as much as a four-tenths drop in the unemployment rate   would normally indicate  I can’t argue with the Tealbook’s assessment that the labor data are   consistent with a lower potential GDP than we previously estimated  I wouldn’t go nearly as far   as President Bullard was just suggesting  But even after accounting for these adjustments, there   still appears to be a massive output gap   Next, consider the darkening economic clouds that are settling in over Europe  Twenty   years after the Maastricht Treaty, Europe has apparently decided to address their imbalances   crisis with Maastricht, version 20  Stronger and arguably more enforceable fiscal guidelines   with penalties for recalcitrants will lead to greater austerity and a deeper recession in Europe    They have announced no fiscal transfers from the strong to the weak economies  In the United   States, a variety of automatic fiscal stabilizers dampen the blows that individual states take   during downturns  And there appears to be no credible mechanism to redress the trade   imbalances that exist among the euro countries  Germany has a large trade surplus, and the   December 13, 2011 48 of 198              periphery countries have trade deficits  These trade imbalances are far more important, at least   for Spain and Italy  Without some other adjustment mechanism, the only way for the deficit   countries to improve their competitiveness is through wage cuts, which are not likely to happen   without a significant recession  This was the same challenge countries faced while on the gold   standard in the 1930s  Without better prospects for economic growth in Spain and Italy, this is   unlikely to end well for Europe or the United States  After considering all of these issues and   more, we see the US output gap and the unemployment rate staying high through at least 2014,   like the Tealbook does   Meanwhile, price pressures continue to decline pretty much as most forecasts anticipated   they would  The oil and commodity price increases that caused the jump in relative prices earlier   this year have run their course, and in many cases are reversing, given the weaker outlook for   global growth  In line with this, several of my contacts noted that their input costs were running   below the forecast they had made earlier in the year  Contacts also had little concern with labor   costs  While there are a few hot occupations—I often hear that certain kinds of engineers are in   great demand—firms do not foresee big wage increases for the vast majority of their workers    We even hear scattered reports of nominal wage cuts, including for some in the public sector    This seems consistent with the recent average hourly earnings and ECI data, which have come in   pretty soft lately  Given these developments and inflation expectations that remain at the bottom   of their recent ranges, I expect inflation to come in below 2 percent over the forecast horizon   When I put together our economic growth and inflation projections, I don’t see much that   has changed for me with regard to the big picture  And in fact, listening to some of the   commentary and the questions about the Tealbook, I was reminded that the modal complaint   about the FOMC forecast during this entire time has been that we were overly optimistic, and we   December 13, 2011 49 of 198              appear to be willing to repeat more of that, at least as I interpreted the questioning  I agree with   President Williams’s analysis that it seems that uncertainty is more due to demand than supply,   although I had not reviewed that evidence  That was nice to see  I think we are still left with   work to do on the policy front to improve growth prospects in the US  Thank you, Mr   Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I continue to not support Alternative B, as in   the November meeting  I support some version of Alternative A  The particular version is not   very important today, and I will just repeat my comments from last time that my preference   would be to clarify our forward guidance through conditional economic thresholds with an   inflation safeguard, and then perhaps, if that did not improve matters enough, do additional MBS   as in Alternative A  I come to this, again, because of our dual mandate responsibilities, which   are what the Congress charges us with  In fact, I think that is extremely good for the US   economy, American consumers, businesses, and everyone involved   What helps me think about this best is John Taylor’s seminal work in 1979, his   Econometrica piece on optimal monetary policy in a rational expectations model  In that   analysis, he takes a quadratic loss function for monetary policy with an output gap and inflation,   and he maps out different weights on the output gap, and he is able to map out the policy   frontier, which is associated with the optimal responses there  That is totally consistent with   meeting the objectives of policy—hitting your inflation goal as well as keeping output gaps   approximately zero on average  That delivers a good range of low variability for inflation and   low variability for output gaps  As I look at the type of analysis that he does, I am led to favor a   more conservative weight on the output gap—that is, a lower weight than 1 on the output gap,   December 13, 2011 96 of 198              relative to Taylor’s model, but a weight that would be consistent with a unit weight on   unemployment deviations—equal weight on unemployment and inflation   Having said this, if you apply this level of economic rigor and discipline to describing the   policy strategy, our current outlook is very far from our objectives  With current monetary   policy accommodation in place, inflation in 2013 will be under our 2 percent objective and   unemployment will be, as I see it, 2 percentage points above the sustainable unemployment rate,   which I take to be a very conservative 6 percent  It could actually be lower than that, but it is   2 percentage points above  That is another conservative choice  We have to be forward-looking    Until our inflation forecast is pressing the upper tolerance of our inflation objective, I don’t think   this is even a conflicted choice for policymakers, given the unemployment situation and resource   slack  I favor more accommodation  I cannot support Alternative B     I want to close by taking note that I saw in today’s Wall Street Journal that Allan Meltzer   was quoted, and he said that more inflation is coming  I, frankly, don’t know where this type of   prediction comes from  There is no theory attached to it, other than perhaps that the Fed’s   balance sheet is very large  But there is no mechanism laid out for inflation determination, and it   would help me sort through some of the problems that we have if there was more of a discussion   about those theories  Thank you, Mr Chairman     He has been predicting it since longer than that  [Laughter]     Thank you very much, Mr Chairman  I would similarly like to thank my   subcommittee colleagues for their great comments and the great work, and Spence, Loretta, and   Andy for working so hard on this  We probably have some more work ahead of us at some point   on other issues   Let me start with the communication of the longer-run goals and the policy strategy  I   agree with so many things that President Plosser laid out  It strikes me that this document   describing our long-run goals and strategies offers me, certainly, but I think all of us, an   opportunity to describe the policy loss function that we are thinking about, with the weights on it   and how it works—what I was describing this morning  This allows me that ability to do that    December 13, 2011 150 of 198              We are going to have some disagreements, and it is not really the remit of this Committee to   come down with exactly what the loss function is and what the weights are and all of that  We   will have to work through that   This document did have many compromises  There was some language that I saw in the   earlier document that I liked, but others didn’t  There were some things that appeared at other   times that others liked and I didn’t, and I compromised, and this is very useful  It will serve us   well, and we can all explain our views well with this   I was quite taken with President Lacker’s description of how he is thinking about this,   and I agreed with virtually everything that you said  The maximum employment concept is a   difficult one  If I understood it correctly, I do agree that we will use a model framework  We   will use different models perhaps, and Charlie was saying the same thing when he was talking   about New Keynesian models  I believe that we will bring the discipline of different economic   frameworks to bear on what we mean by this concept, and if there are ambiguities at the outset,   further research will help us narrow our differences or sharpen the way that we talk with each   other  We will bring the research community into this, too  I can imagine some conferences that   will spring out of this  Did this really help the FOMC?  The Romers, undoubtedly, will want to   have a part in that  They read the minutes before we do  Well, I mean—[laughter]—quite   quickly   I am optimistic  I have heard a number of good things here, and the annual adoption   process of this will be something that will sharpen our focus after we do this one or two years    As we run into certain issues, that will naturally lead to a further assessment of how it works and   what can be clarified, and will provide scrutiny  I fully support the way it is crafted now   December 13, 2011 151 of 198              On the policy projections, these will be very helpful  As President Plosser said,   appropriate policy, we have known, is highly artful  If you worked in the Federal Reserve   System before you came to this table, you somehow grew accustomed to the wisdom of what   Mike Prell or Don Kohn or people before that dreamed up  We can all have different policy   assumptions, and they are appropriate  But the public doesn’t understand it, and when we talk   about it, it is very difficult  Publishing the funds rate projections would be highly transparent   and helpful  It could help us with troublesome language like our mid-2013 language in the   FOMC statement  The choice has been made here, and it’s a very effective presentation of the   data   The last thing, other than to simply say I support all of this, would be on this issue about   the funds rate projections and the reliability of those  This is a very broad point and is what is   missing from this discussion  Any time you put out a forecast, things happen between now and   when the forecast period occurs  And there are forecast errors—the history of forecasting is that   inflation is very difficult to forecast  The Minneapolis Fed has highly cited work on that  It is   hard to beat a random walk  Think about it this way  Let’s say we adopted a simple rule and it   had a Taylor-form structure to it, but we did not actually have our funds rate projections  If we   gave enough information in the SEPs, then we could run those output gaps and inflation   deviations through the simple Taylor rule and come up with everybody’s implied policy   projections  It would be an automatic algorithm  This is inevitable if you go a number of   different ways  For me the issue is  How do we sharpen it to get the best type of projections out   there in front of people?  The issue is not  Don’t do it  Thank you, Mr Chairman     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I just want to be clear that I support the   existing authority that the Markets Group and you have for actions 1 through 5  In Simon’s   response, he touched on something that I recall from previous videoconferences, which is that he   alluded to this group—I think you called it the TMPG—Treasury Management Planning Group,   or something like that  I assume that’s what that meant  We’re working under the assumption   that the markets either do know about this or they don’t know about this, but the New York Fed   talks to the market people all the time, and I thought I heard something like they are already   October 16, 2013 34 of 50    expecting us to use our authorities under 1 through 5, which seems to be more detail than many   of us know ourselves or thought about before  Could you provide some more clarity on that?      Okay  Thank you     Thank you, Mr Chairman  I agree with Vice Chairman Dudley’s   suggestion  I would be willing to give you the discretion to act on options 6 and 7 between   meetings if you thought that the markets really required that  In particular, option 7 makes a lot   of sense  The way I heard Vice Chairman Dudley describe this, it harkened back to the period in   the late ’80s and early ’90s when the Fed was targeting the funds rate and they gave the   Chairman discretion between meetings, if economic events warranted, to move the funds rate in   the direction that they thought the bias was  If short-term market rates are inconsistent with our   October 16, 2013 41 of 50    0 to 25 range for the funds rate, that strikes me as being very similar to past practices, and we   would very quickly get to another meeting where we could revisit that  I think repos are the way   to do it, because they’re temporary so they don’t necessarily have to be confused with more   permanent actions that we’re looking at  And I think that they would be conveying that we’re   interested in keeping market functioning going properly  So I support that   I will take note that option 6 included the footnote where it mentioned that an alternative   would be the Term Securities Lending Facility; we might want to think about that one a little   more carefully  If that’s an option, in some cases swapping security for security might be more   direct, and in certain cases, it might have also a beneficial effect on the rates for the other people   involved in that  Thank you
