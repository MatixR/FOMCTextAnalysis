 I will also]   Yes, Mr Chairman Earlier in the meeting Governor Partee expressed some confusion This being my first meeting, I hope you'll appreciate the dilemma I find myself in! If he's confused--   I have some sympathy for alternative II, much along the lines expressed earlier by those who were opting for that However, I also think alternative I would be the better position to take, particularly given the uncertainties about what really is going on It does indicate our willingness to continue the effort for restraint So, I would be satisfied with alternative I and I would probably be willing to take the ranges the way the staff has proposed them all the way through I also would stay to the left side of the  -127-    2/2-3/81  table and I would associate myself with Willis Winn's comments on how to try to explain it   I would go with "B" with the fed funds range shaded to 15 to 20 percent    I agree fully with you, Mr Chairman    Yes, Mr Chairman I share many of the concerns that have been expressed with respect to the forecast I think the economy is and probably will be a little stronger than is projected Possibly I'm influenced by the people I've talked to down in our part of the country where things tend to be a little stronger Also, I have a concern, obviously, about inflation in that there doesn't appear to be very much progress in that regard For the reasons that have already been discussed with respect to the uncertainty about M-1B and also for the arguments that Steve presented on M2, my inclination would be to put a little more emphasis on M2 at least for the time being I favor maintaining a fairly firm stance in the policy area and I do have some sympathy for alternative C    This is Boykin I would agree very much with what Tony Solomon has been saying    This is Boykin Paul, I would support that decision versus actually changing the range    Mr Chairman, we are hearing much of what Ed Boehne reflected We feel that the economy is continuing fairly strong We really don't have any specific disagreement with the Greenbook forecast, but our fear is that the figures on both the economy and inflation will probably be revised upward As for the comments that we're receiving from our directors, bankers, and businessmen in the District, they are expressing concern over the plight of the small businessman with these continued high interest rates They are expressing possibly some sense of frustration in that they really don't see any end in sight and they don't seem to have the feeling that we're making very much progress   Mr Chairman, I come down pretty clearly for "C" The arguments for that position have been stated and I will not take the time to restate them But just by way of summary The strength of the economy worries me; I wonder about the recent rapid growth in money and that it may not be temporary; also the expectations issue looms rather large in my thinking I think it's important to have a continuously firm policy    As far as inflationary expectations are concerned, people I've been talking to are really not convinced at this point that we'll make a lot of progress There seems to be more conversation about that possibility, but decisions are being made every day down our way based on expectations of [continued high] inflation  As for the economic outlook, we don't differ greatly with the Board staff's forecast Though we think the rate of inflation might be a little less in 1981, our 1982 forecast is just about where the Board staff is But we feel the economy in 1982 is probably going to be a bit stronger than the Board staff is forecasting   Yes, Mr Chairman I also would agree with the substantive comments that you made in your opening statement With respect to the strategy for the rest of 1981, I would tend to favor alternative 2 on page 8 I would not make any adjustments in the '81 ranges; I would just let those stand the way they are  As for the strategy for 1982-83, I would look to strategy 2 With respect to the ranges for 1982, I would go for a 1/2 point reduction in the M-1B range to 3 to 5-1/2 percent I would also be very inclined to leave the M2, M3, and bank credit ranges where they are currently It may be because I sit next to Frank Morris, but I'm beginning to find quite a bit of sympathy for looking a little closer at M2   Mr Chairman, I would go with alternative C, a borrowing assumption of $1-1/2 billion and a fed funds range of 16 to 22 percent    In the Eleventh District, we continue to enjoy a little stronger economy than other parts of the country In terms of housing, houses are still selling down our way Of course, we have people coming in all the time I've not seen anything that would resemble a price decline Commercial construction has been very strong, as you know The interesting thing there is that for the first time I have heard a couple of fairly large developers say they are beginning to wonder if there might be a bit of overbuilding in Houston and Dallas, and I haven't heard that kind of comment at all in the last several years Automobile sales are not all that strong but they're probably not as weak as in other parts of the country On the agricultural side, I have been told, particularly in regard to the [feed]lots, that the cattle going in are going to come out at loss situations now On the big ticket items you talked about on retail sales, that's the business is in; he calls me about once a month and he says nothing is slowing down Their sales are really still going strong   He is one of the ones who is thinking out loud that we may be into an overbuilt situation for a year or two I don't think it's interfering with what he is doing He's completing a  We have 7 buildings under construction in downtown Dallas that are 40 stories and above Two more have been announced that are going to be 70 stories each plus about a thousand room hotel along with it Plaza of the Americas, which you're familiar with, has just announced that they're going to start a new office tower next month   Yes, but then there's another 60-story building being built in Greenway Plaza by a competitor   Well, the height is limited by FFA regulations because they are in the flight path The two 70-story buildings in Dallas are across the street, so they are going to squeeze by   No, Governor, I don't I'm trying to recall the figure for the new cars hitting the streets of Dallas every day   Well, there are very few people I can talk to anymore who can understand me!   We had an aberration for one month in that the statistics showed 6-1/2 percent [unemployment] We corrected that very, very quickly   After tax    I'm a little embarrassed; I was trying to hold off for a while It's obvious from our comments in the Redbook that the Eleventh District economy continues to be a bit of an outlier We haven't really seen any major change in economic activity down our way in recent months It's still pretty strong The drilling boom for oil and gas just seems to keep right on going We don't see any signs of weakening there   No, it's the [unintelligible]  -14-    10/5-6/81   Yes   The unfortunate thing is that they don't always [succeed] I know of one plot that was a dry hole  Nonresidential construction continues very strong And there are a number of local government construction projects under way Just as an example, in Dallas at the end of last year we had a little over 41 million square feet of office space We are projecting an additional 29 million in the next four years Most of that is under construction or firmly announced, so we'll be up to 70 million square feet Houston, of course, is now as strong as Dallas or even stronger It's going on in San Antonio [and] even out in Midland, Texas, in the western part of Texas; a lot [is related to] oil activity On the [unintelligible] they're putting up a 40-story building; I just hope it will stand up when a sand storm comes As for manufacturing strength, it's just concentrated in those industries supplying the energy and nonresidential construction sectors On the financial side, I've not heard what Ed has heard I will say, as opposed to questions of immediate concern, that I do sense that people are beginning to wonder a bit about what the next few months are going to hold down our way But, as far as any specifics, we don't have any I was talking to one small businessman in the franchising business and he said they've slowed down a bit because they're trying to franchise nationwide and it's a little slow in other parts of the country but in Texas they're still opening new stores   Yes, Mr Chairman, I would associate my views clearly with Governor Schultz I think alternative C is where we should be He did a very fine job expressing the reasons, so I won't be repetitious by going through them again But I'm strongly for "C"    I've been sitting here, Mr Chairman, trying to be sure I had the strength of my convictions If I can figure out what my convictions are, maybe I'll have the strength! I would like to comment very briefly on the economy down our way, particularly since I have a slightly different story to tell this time around I think there has been a decided change in attitudes in the Eleventh District over the last six weeks We see weakness starting to spread in our area Of course, like the rest of the nation, retail sales, autos, and housing have been weak for some time We are starting to see some increased layoffs in the manufacturing area--in the aircraft and the electronics industries Also, there are some early signs of possible weakness in the energy industry The drilling boom seems to be slowing a little I'm told that one can actually see a few rigs  -29-    11/17/81  stacked in the yards, and that has not been the case for quite some time, although the demand for the deep offshore rigs remains strong We have had unusually heavy rains, particularly in the north central Texas area, and that is going to cause quite a bit of crop loss, particularly in cotton and wheat People are estimating a loss of about $25 million in that area Also, we're beginning to hear concerns expressed about the possibility of over-building in the commercial area, particularly in the Houston and Dallas markets As far as the staff's outlook on the economy, that is about the way I would see it It's a reasonable outlook and it's consistent with what I'm hearing  On the policy side, a very sharp decline in [the federal funds rate] right now would cause me a lot of concern, particularly for the implication for the long-term rates [As for] credibility and perceptions, I think there's more likelihood of serious criticism from the majority of people on the interest rate side rather than on not meeting the stated targets Steve's explanation of how alternative C was constructed and what it's intended to do I find very persuasive, and I'll line up on alternative C   Yes, that does seem awfully high On the other hand, we get a few scattered reports of some shutting in going on, just not producing They know it's there and ready to go but are holding back because of the supply side   Yes   Yes   Yes, I think it almost has to be, Fred We heard a report, and the Chairman heard it also, of some deep wells down in the Laredo area where [it cost] about $4 million to drill one well and $8 million to drill another As the director who was reporting on that said, somebody has to be thinking something that he was not aware of I would think they have to be betting on decontrol   But isn't there still a question of whether it's interstate or intrastate?   We were told the other day by one energy economist that there are 17 different price levels for gas, if you can believe that It's based on all kinds of combinations, as you say the depth, the age, whether it's going interstate or intrastate But there are 17 different price brackets  SPEAKER(?) Is it also based on how it smells?   That's right The world doesn't stop  -41-    11/17/81    I reported at our last meeting that there seemed to be a slight slowdown in the energy area, particularly in drilling activity I'm told now that that has reversed There were two rigs in the pen last time but those are out They tell me that has turned around a little, although they are expecting a bit of a slowdown in the rate of increase for 1982 In the manufacturing end, we really don't have all that much [change]; but in the semiconductor business, which is a large employer, they are taking an extended Christmas holiday They are shutting down until January 11 The agricultural area, though, is an area of concern As we know, the prices to the farmers are not good; the crops have been very good We are told that our agricultural banks probably are going to have to carry over more farmers than they ever have And they can probably carry them this year, but without some improvement there are going to be some very serious liquidation problems   Yes, they have the room But the question is how comfortable they feel, even though they have the money, about how long can they stay with [agricultural borrowers] in the expectation of a repayment because of the price problem   I think so, a break in the sense that the sales of farm lands are going down I have heard of a few instances of a little price concession, but there is not a lot moving right now  -12-    12/21-22/81   Back to the credibility problem In terms of the long-term ranges, it seems to me that the tentative ranges that we have published and that have been discussed and seem to be understood on the outside probably should not be changed at this point simply because I don't think we know enough to improve that in any way I am not saying they are the best; I doubt that we know what is the best right now But M1-B and M2 at least as of midyear seemed to be giving more consistency in terms of a relationship Whether that will hold up remains to be seen I think we should hold to [seeking] a gradual reduction [of these ranges] over time; it's a perception that I still think is very important, particularly to those who are less sophisticated, and we should hold to that What is actually going to happen with regard to the innovation that is coming is mere speculation on our part, as we can tell from going around the table here And I agree very much with Tony Solomon that the time to make an adjustment is when we have some pretty firm facts or a basis for doing it and doing it in a supportable way rather than by conjecture The idea of giving the first signal that this will be rethought has a lot of appeal to me I don't think the fact that we have never made a midyear shift should [mean] that we never would, if the facts are there and a change is supportable So, I would be inclined to stay where we said tentatively we were going to be and let events unfold; and I'd be ready to make adjustments or changes in definitions, or whatever will be necessary, but based on more knowledge than we have now   Well, whether we do it at midyear or do it before then or after, it seems to me that it would be incumbent upon  -42-    12/21-22/81  the Committee to reach a judgment and make a determination when the facts support it, whatever point in time that is   I'm trying to remember the numbers Tony gave originally I don't think I got them down right   No   Okay That's what I wanted to be sure of Yes, I would find that acceptable   Yes, I would find that acceptable   [If we say] 4 to 5 percent and 9 to 10 percent, I have a little problem with the understanding that we are not going to be that concerned if it comes out higher That is a bit of a difficult bridge for me to get across because I would find acceptable the 4 and 9 percent with the understanding that you talked about earlier but I am a little uncomfortable with it So, to go to 4 to 5 and 9 to 10 makes me even more uncomfortable    I was just going to say, but I really can't add anything, that we tested the corporate balance sheet question and the representations were that there was nothing unusual, just the traditional [window-dressing] The only thing I did find, which I don't think has any bearing at all, was a relatively small bank that had a very large upswing Inquiring about it, we were told it was simply the liquidation of a very sizable estate; temporarily several million dollars were put in, but the funds were being distributed   I want to align myself with Fred Schultz I also am very impressed with the perception, based on what I'm hearing from everyone I've talked to, that if we make any changes in the ranges, it could be misinterpreted I would much prefer to see us hold with the tentative ranges that we have set One thing that has a little appeal to me--we're not sure what is happening right now and you mentioned that things might look differently in March and April-- is the thought that was expressed at the last meeting I think by Tony Solomon, who made some reference to the midyear review That is an opportunity to reassess and take a look It seems to me, if we're going to make a change [in the 1982 ranges], that rather than doing it now we ought to defer it for 4 or 5 months at least and we would have more information on all these changes that are occurring Certainly, we might have a better explanation of what is happening to the money supply So, given my perception of how [a change] would be interpreted, I would prefer to leave the tentative ranges and then have some kind of caveat that we could make a fairly serious [adjustment at our] midyear review   I would be in agreement with the way you specified it and with the second alternative on the language of the directive   I vote no  SEVERAL No   I would be in agreement with that, provided that-- Well, you said something about the ranges as specified or close to it Do you mean as specified?    Given the conditions in the Eleventh District, I guess it'd be fair to say that the level of concern is considerably greater In a way, one has to take this in perspective given where we were and where it looks as if we might be going The pessimism seems to be centered primarily in the energy business where the decrease in oil prices has produced quite a bit of concern Drilling activity has slowed I mean by that a slowdown in the rate of increase as opposed to an absolute slowdown Part of it--   Not from the information we have Part of this is attributable to what those in the industry call seasonal factors They look for a little pickup in a couple of months, but not anything like we have had The closing of refineries is causing quite a bit of concern As one person in the industry said, most of those are the "tea kettle" type of operations that probably should have been closed anyway But even some of the major refineries are cutting back on their production There is growing concern in the commercial real estate development area It now appears that some projects that were  -29-    3/29-30/82  announced are going to be deferred The petrochemical industry seems to be under some pressure The media, of course, are picking this up in our area with headlines saying that the recession has come to the Sun Belt Layoffs that are occurring, while not significant, are receiving quite a bit of publicity and obviously are affecting opinions and attitudes In the electronics and the semi-conductor business there have been some layoffs Of course, we have the Braniff problem that stays in the headlines down our way And I might also mention that with the decrease in the price of oil, the bank stocks, particularly those of our larger bank holding companies, have incurred about a one-third decrease in their price over the last six weeks, which concerns them They think the concern of the analysts who are looking at the [exposure in] energy loans is unjustified  On the other side, though, we've had just a little improvement in the housing area, but nothing really significant, and a little improvement in autos I was talking on Thursday to the individual who oversees and he said the economy turned ten days ago and that the recession--   The recession ended ten days ago He said that up until then the markets were very poor But the markets have improved substantially and there's a lot of buying activity and lot of orders being written in the markets now Again, I don't know whether people down our way are over-reacting in one sense because we are now finally seeing some of the effects of the slowdown And we are more or less seeing that for the first time, which might cause a bit of an over-reaction I think the fundamentals down our way really don't look that bad Agriculture has already been mentioned, and we have basically the same situation in agriculture   Yes, we've had a lot We're also now beginning to get stories--the press are making a lot of it, or at least are writing about it a lot--about people who have come down to the land of milk and honey and are unable to find jobs and they are living in campers, are out of money, and don't have enough money to go back home That's pretty isolated But yes, we've had a lot of in- migration   Well, Mr Chairman, I would favor alternative B Given the uncertainties and what we don't know about April and what we don't know about the NOW accounts and many other things, alternative B would seem to me to represent a prudent course that would at least position us to address the situation as it becomes clarified without an abrupt change in direction With respect to the conversation about a change in the ranges, it seems to me that any change should be a very forthright decision as opposed to a de facto working in that direction, which I think alternative A might do So, at this point in time at least, alternative B seems to me the prudent place to be  -49-    3/29-30/82    I think it would be fair to characterize our economic situation in the Southwest as somewhat sluggish The oil sector is still in decline; the rig count was down further in April But there does seem to be a growing feeling that [the oil sector] is probably near the bottom if it's not there, much as Roger indicated [for his District] Refining operations are below capacity utilization, and unemployment in that sector is down about 12 percent since December We have had a little pickup in housing starts, but they are still at a low level Unemployment in the State of Texas rose to 64 percent in April and that causes us some concern We are not used to those kinds of numbers Growth in bank credit slowed in the last couple of months The demise of Braniff recently, while it might not have made a ripple in New York, caused quite a bit of consternation down our way In fact, I wasn't sure I could get here for this meeting   In our immediate area that involved about 4,600 jobs that disappeared overnight On agriculture, again I think Roger described that very well Our commercial construction seems to be holding up fairly well There have been some pullbacks on announced projects but there are still a lot underway and some of the larger [announced] projects still plan to go ahead In a subjective sense, I read the comments of the people I've been visiting with very recently much the way Larry Roos is reading them Attitudinally, I think the feeling is that if we can just make it [through] another 3 or 4 months, the picture is probably going to look a bit better I've not heard the concern that you were expressing, Ed--that you are now beginning to hear [expressions of] pessimism about the longer term or "out years" Just to end on a positive note One straw in the wind is that my favorite retailer--some of you know he deals in luxury goods and in fact he says he sells absolutely nothing that anybody needs--did give me a call just to update me He said he was a little disappointed that instead of his usual 30 to 35 percent monthly increase, it had dropped to about 17 or 18 percent He attributed it to the peso devaluation But he said that in looking at the reports that had arrived in the last two days, he thought maybe that had turned around too    5/18/82   Briefly, I would opt for alternative B I would do it in a fairly firm way I don't think I'd want to see it shaded toward "A" I would accept the borrowing assumption of $800 million It seems a little low, but I would accept that    Mr Chairman, Jerry in general terms said pretty much what I've been thinking Obviously, the downside risks are there I have a feeling that I don't view the risks as quite as great as most of you around the table I happen to think that we're doing pretty well where we are For 1982 I would reestablish the targets where they are I'm very sympathetic to Nancy's point about flexibility I would love to be flexible if I can ever find a reason for it I think the course we've charted really isn't all that bad In fact, I would like to see us actually come within the target range that we specified by year-end I think it's doable It is supported by the staff's forecast, with which I really don't have any quarrel Looking longer term I think we will be in a much better position if that actually occurs, assuming that we still have an economy after that!   I guess I would say this, Frank I think I know where we ought to be; the issue is whether we can get there from here   For 1983, I would differ from Jerry I would be inclined, much as Bob Black was, to reduce the ranges a little for '83 with a very clear understanding that whether that would hold or not would depend on developments and would be firmed up at year-end   Well, in terms of our stated long-term objective of a gradual reduction in the growth rate of money, this is an extremely critical time That's very obvious But I don't think anything has occurred to this point that should deter us from that over the long term And I would have some concern if we were giving preliminary signals that it may not be the thing to do at this point But depending on what happens between now and next February, if the circumstances certainly indicated that we shouldn't reduce the ranges or should maybe even raise them, I think it would be much more understandable and much more justifiable The credibility issue is    6/30-7/1/82  extremely important I'm inclined to give quite a bit of weight to the perceptions problem myself   Well, Mr Chairman, I would line up with those who are arguing for alternative B, for the reasons they've already given, with an initial borrowing assumption of around $900 million    Well, Mr Chairman, when I came to the meeting this morning I was pretty much of the view that Bob Black and to some extent Bill Ford expressed I must say that your review of the world situation prior to the coffee break woke me up   I agree in that I don't believe rates should go up As far as the shift in emphasis on M2, that seems to me a fairly logical extension of what we did with the NOW account situation It is a little bigger and maybe not quite as subtle, but I don't think it would be that hard to explain, really, what we are doing There is some precedent for that aspect of it In terms of understandability of what we are likely to be doing, [I was comforted by] the comment you made that you would have an opportunity in the not too distant future [to explain this] That would be extremely important in terms of how this is actually perceived, certainly in the short run, before people have an opportunity to analyze the record in some detail So, I would come out with those who certainly don't want rates to go up and who want even some decline As far as the wording of the directive, I don't think I could make very much of a contribution to that There are a number of subtleties being expressed and I'm not sure I appreciate all of them I couldn't improve on any of them   That's down to about $75 million now  month  They ought to be out by the end of the week    Well, I would pretty much be where Roger and Jerry are My overall reading of the Eleventh District [based on] our own internal forecast that we've just gone through at our Bank is slightly more optimistic certainly than the Board staff's forecast I don't know how much of this is hope But I see things that I find very hard to understand This is strictly anecdotal, but with regard to housing, Sunday afternoon out of curiosity I visited two housing developments in Dallas At one, the builder apparently was pretty optimistic; he had just completed 10 specialty homes beginning at $375,000 And the crowds [were so big] you could hardly get in the houses I was impressed with that, so I went across the road to another new development, and the lots began at $250,000   The lots   Three homes had just been completed and were on show and we could not get in them because of the crowd They begin at $1 million and they have "for sale" signs on them   But what builder has that kind of financing and that kind of optimism to build a million dollar [spec house]? And one that is about half completed is going to be priced at $18 million   The rig count has improved There is a question of whether it is a real improvement or seasonal for tax purposes and so forth But the rig count is up slightly On the other hand, the seismic surveys are not showing that much improvement, so it does raise the question of whether it will hold   In trying to balance the risks, the down side is very frightening There is a possibility, though, that there is a little [risk] on the up side Obviously I'm influenced somewhat by a slightly more optimistic view of where the economy is heading With regard to the lag effect, the argument has been made that we really have not had time to see the full effect of recent policy actions I find that to be a fairly persuasive argument [so] the cautionary approach also has appeal to me I think we can remain cautious and not take a very overt action at this point to deliberately try to bring rates down So, if I were voting today, I would vote for "B"   In fairness to Nancy, her argument, though, is that publication might tend to cause something that we were trying to make happen anyway happen just a little sooner    In our District, of course, things are still weak but residential construction, which has already been mentioned, is coming on very strong The National Association of Home Builders is looking for Houston to lead the nation and Dallas to be second in 1983 in residential construction Office construction is still slow but other nonresidential seems to be picking up a little and so are retail, the state, and other businesses The energy sector, which was also mentioned, is reviving somewhat The rig count is up in November and it does appear to be up a little more than we would expect on a seasonal basis The unemployment rate was down in Texas in November; we don't have a lot of confidence in the state figures but at least it's in the right direction The weak areas are the ones that we would expect manufacturing, particularly the durable goods sector, and the farm sector, which still has its problems Loan demand is weak, with a less-than-seasonal rise in November; retail sales for the District as a whole are not overly promising, although sales in Dallas, Houston, and Austin are looking pretty good   I also would agree with the consensus that M2 is probably about the best we can do I'm not ready to concede that M1 will no longer be viable On whether to commit to returning to M1, I guess I would like to; but realistically that might be slightly premature I would couch it in terms of a presumption of returning to M1 if that proved feasible as we gain more experience In terms of the public's perception, it does seem to me that the explanation that you gave in October of what we were doing could carry forward right into February We will place less emphasis on M1 and more emphasis on M2, with the explanation of the institutional changes that are taking place and have been discussed That's all people read about I think it's pretty understandable I think a consistent story, much along the lines of what we used in October, would carry us through at least until midyear    I would agree with those who are advocating a continuance of targeting Ml, M2, and M3 I would not favor dropping Ml I don't have the exact wording of how to handle it, I guess I would not be quite as strong as saying that we are not going to pay very much attention to it and rely more on M2, based on the very recent evidence that we have that Ml seems to be behaving a little better in this transition period I would probably be inclined to look a little more at Ml but I also agree that flexibility is essential because we're dealing in a very, very uncertain time, with the numbers apparently changing with each report that comes through  -28-    2/8-9/83   The only question I would raise as far as numerical sequencing is Why not address the Ml situation up front-- address it first? I realize it's being downplayed   I guess my basic problem is that I wonder if I would give it quite that much less emphasis   But the fact that we are talking long term is why it seems to me that just the sequencing of it gives a little more weight to [its deemphasis] I'm not arguing about the qualifying language but since we are looking out for a year, if what Jerry says does materialize, it seems more logical to be consistent and address Ml, M2, and M3 as we traditionally have I think it would leave the impression at least that M1 is not as abandoned as it apparently is right now  -71-    2/8-9/83   I'm not arguing for jumping that far; I'm just arguing for acknowledging that there is such a thing now    We're looking at 7-3/4 percent versus 7-1/4 or 7-1/2 percent a couple of weeks ago But it's not close to 10 percent   Money market deposit accounts   Either that or I'm in the wrong bank   Mr Chairman, we have revised our own forecast up just slightly We tend to line up much as Governor Gramley and Mr Black did On balance, I rather like Governor Partee's position that the staff forecast presents a pretty good working document We do have developments in our District that are causing some concern-- certainly the energy situation and the implication that has for our    3/28-29/83  banks down there This past week most of our major bank holding companies have been making their public announcements about decreased earnings and increases in loan loss reserves And unemployment picked up in February from 82 to 88 percent, which by our standards at least seems awfully high In Houston, where nothing can go wrong, unemployment went from 91 up to 97 percent in February   That doesn't sound too high by national standards, but if you remember it was just half that a year ago I was told last week that in Houston there are 30 million square feet of office space in commercial real estate construction that either is completed or is in the process of starting I'm also told by one of the large developers that an estimated 65 percent of the office space in Houston is energy-related in some way So, with what is happening in energy, that raises a question We have an overbuilt situation in Dallas for commercial office buildings We just started a 70-story building last week to cure that! The people in the energy business who feel that they're in it to stay, and we find fewer of those, say that stability in price is probably more important than the actual price level--that is, within a reasonable [range] of, say, somewhere between $25 and $29 per barrel They would not get overly upset if it just stabilized, because [the instability] causes them difficulties in doing their planning We know that the supervisory and regulatory groups are quite concerned about energy portfolios There are some special [examinations] going on, as I understand it, in the major energy-lending banks just to take a look at the energy portfolio So, being that close to what is a drag [on the economy] tends to color my thinking somewhat But we still have some positives in areas that have already been mentioned, such as housing On balance, for the economy as a whole I feel relatively optimistic that growth will be somewhere in the 4 to 5 percent range That sounds reasonable   I don't think we would, Mr Chairman I would not anticipate a great deal of added activity There are those engaged in that business who say that we will probably see drilling pick up again in the latter half of the year Some of it is for tax purposes if for no other reason I was talking to a pipe supplier to the energy business who says he basically is not doing anything but in talking to the majors--and these are the people he supplies primarily --they tell him just to hold still and that come summer and on into the rest of the year they have their budgets planned and they will spend that; he will get the orders At that same meeting there was an independent oil man who has a pretty big business and he said that is the difference between the independents and the majors The independents are not going to be going in   Oh, yes    3/28-29/83   It is; it's a lot cheaper to drill But also the price is lower and there are a lot of rigs laid over There is a question of whether one wants to wear that rig out right now on relatively cheap oil because some think that this may turn around next year So, they're hedging their bet and figure they are better off keeping the rig down rather than pulling it up and wearing it out   Yes The cost of labor and all of the cost components are substantially--   Yes, you can get a rig at a really cheap price I might even have one or two before too long!   If I could just tack on, Bill, I got a report from one of our major banks that they are seriously putting a group together to bring up some REITs in the not too distant future   Not in rigs, but in office buildings--they believe that there are some really good deals out there   Well, Mr Chairman, I certainly share all of the uncertainties about trying to decipher what information we have But emotionally, in giving my view of the economic forecast, I tend to agree with Lyle Gramley and Bob Black that somewhere between "B" and "C" is the more appropriate posture to be in I recognize the risks that have been pointed out, but what we have done over the last several weeks seems appropriate If I were going to err, I would err a bit on the restraint side at this point So, "B" or somewhere between "B" and "C" is where I would come out On the directive, I would go to Roman numeral II or alternative B, primarily as an indication, as Karen would say, that we are trying to move back in that direction    In a general sense, we pretty well agree with the Board staff's forecast Also, I think the risk is that it might be slightly low Attitudinally I'm hearing much of what Ed Boehne said In general there's a better feeling, but we still have a bit of a mixed picture If you look at the middle corridor of our District-- that is, through Dallas, Austin, and San Antonio--it looks pretty good But if you get a little to the west or a little to the east, where you encounter the energy or energy-related activities, you still see the concerns on the coast in petrochemicals and refineries While there is some improvement, there still are a lot of expensive rigs sitting there in the Sabine River If you get out in the west Texas area, I think they have some very significant special problems and that is still going on Of course, along the border of the Rio Grande, it's still pretty depressed, with unemployment up 25 to 30 percent and that sort of thing But in spite of the special problems, I do feel that we are seeing a recovery Part of our problem is that we find ourselves in a little different situation than we're used to We're usually feeling good about everything But I think energy is tempering our judgment a little   Mr Chairman, I came to the meeting pretty well convinced that the policy should be steady as it goes I will have to confess that I have had a change in attitude in listening to the debate I think those who are arguing for some snugging or some leaning against what is happening probably make sense And having come some distance, I would continue on that line and I would argue for about $400 million on the borrowing assumption rather than $300 million    I would support "B," pretty much for the reasons that have already been set forth I won't bother to repeat them    Mr Chairman, in the Eleventh District we are seeing the economy very much the way Jim outlined it If there is a surprise, it is that [economic activity is] coming back a little stronger and probably a little faster than we had originally anticipated In housing, of course, single-family housing is very strong, particularly in the Dallas/Fort Worth area and that's expected to continue; in multifamily housing, we're probably getting into a dangerously overbuilt situation Our consumer sales are running along pretty well In energy there seems to be a turnaround In Texas, we had a 22 percent increase in rig count last month and in New Mexico a 20 percent increase Of course, that was from very, very low levels; but there is activity in the oil patch again In terms of [drilling] permits, in July we had about 2500 permits in Texas and in August we had 10,000 We attribute that to the fact that starting September 1 there was a $100 permit fee to drill a well versus $25, and apparently the people who drill oil wells worry about $75 I'd find it a bit surprising if that would really account for that large an increase In agriculture, of course, the drought has been mentioned It's a mixed situation; on balance in agriculture we still might have a fairly good year down our way I guess it depends on whether you're east of the Pecos or west of the Pecos Those west of the Pecos, particularly the cattlemen, are having some very, very severe difficulties I was talking to and he told me he was taking a thousand head of cattle to market this week because he just didn't feel he could afford to feed them He said he expected to get about $300 a head and what really upsets him is that when he goes back to restock next year he figures he will be paying $600 a head I sympathize with him, but then he has 2,000 head east of the Pecos that he thinks he can try to get through the winter As they say down there in the South Some people lose a thousand head and the big boys really get hurt So, we'll see how that turns out  In talking of the crowding out and whether we are looking past 1984 to 1985, I have a couple of comments I picked up last week The conversation among home builders, particularly in Texas, is that    10/4/83  they are going to be doing all they can for the rest of this year because 1985 is going to be a disaster in home building That's the type of terminology they were using Then, I was talking to the president of an electronics firm and he said [business] this year is better than anticipated Their plans call for a very good 1984, but they don't know how to plan for 1985 They are very, very concerned So, the overall sentiment seems to be that things are going along well, the economy is coming back, and this will continue through 1984 But the very real question mark seems to be what 1985 is going to be    Mr Chairman, as far as the Board staff's forecast, we would not have a whole lot of difference in views In terms of the risk If it's wrong, it's probably a bit wrong on the down side; I think the economy is possibly a little stronger than the staff has indicated I'm hearing much of what Jerry is hearing; there does seem to be a real concern about the possibility of inflation reaccelerating if the pressures are not already there Looking at it from our part of the country, it still is a bit of a mixed bag We are getting strength now from some of the areas that had been slow coming back [from the recession] Of course, housing has been one of the strong factors [in the expansion] and that is levelling off And that is a good sign because I think we had gotten ourselves into an overbuilt and risky situation in terms of the land boom I know this has been commented on before, but it is still is going on The newspaper has been running a series of articles on what is apparently a real scandal involving condominiums [Developers] built over 5,000 condominiums in just one little area out by a lake but increased [prices] 600 percent in one day through land clipping They are selling the condominiums at a rate of 42 units a month, so they have a 6- or 7-year supply The small savings and loans around the state have been drawn into this They are very exposed; even the good operators--or those who were supposed to be good--seem to be caught up in it The president of a title company told me--and he sees a lot of  -20-    12/19-20/83  these deals in north Dallas--that he bought a piece of property for $17 million He was going to close on it a week ago last Friday Before he closed, he sold it for $34 million and that transaction was closed last Friday I don't know what somebody sees in it that the seller wasn't seeing!  On the energy side, drilling in particular is showing a little strength In the natural gas area, which has been quite a problem, there is some feeling that the bubble is about to [burst] and that maybe by late '84 that will have leveled out a bit On the agricultural side, by the time one puts together the pluses and minuses it turns out to be a little better than was anticipated Again, though, it's pretty uneven if you look at our District as a whole Northern Louisiana and New Mexico are showing a little improvement; it's still rather tough out there On the unemployment situation, we're below the national rate, but the state of Texas as a whole has an unemployment rate of 74 percent while for Dallas/Fort Worth it's 4-1/2 percent and going down So, my bottom line would be that there is some strength and that we are seeing some sectors beginning to come back that are taking up the decline In housing, we are anticipating that the financial side will be a concern; of course, our banks and other major institutions are not reporting very good results for the fourth quarter and they are making rather substantial loan loss provisions for 1984 There is a lot of concern that 1984 is going to be a bit hard, primarily [because of concern] that the turnaround in energy will not occur before the operators, the service companies, and so forth are going to have to [unintelligible]   Mr Chairman, I think the concept of price stability should be the overriding objective And having said that, I think whatever words we use for 1985 obviously should reflect that I also would not want to use specific numbers But it does seem to me that the targeting for 1984 comes at a very critical juncture, certainly in terms of credibility We have said that we will bring inflation down through a gradual reduction in the growth rate of money In order to solidify that position and make it believable, I would be inclined to bring the Ml range down more in line with what Bob Black was suggesting, possibly to 3 to 7 percent I think that would be a very clear signal that we do remain committed I happen to be willing to put more emphasis on Ml, and I think it is more believable, and thus that it would be positive to do that I think that [range] would also be consistent with enough [Ml growth] for the 9 percent nominal GNP growth On the M2 range, I would be inclined to shade it down to 6 to 9 percent since the 6-1/2 and 9-1/2 percent doesn't represent any real reduction And on M3, I would probably go back to the 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent because its growth just always is 9-1/2 percent It seems to me that would give a better picture But I would argue very strongly for shading down the Ml target for 1984   I would align myself with those--I think Jerry Corrigan said it very well and others--who would start moving against [inflation] now with a $750 million initial borrowing assumption    Mr Chairman, I would also put more emphasis on M1, particularly if it were used as Governor Wallich described how he would do that All of the uncertainties that we have in both the foreign and the domestic situations lead me to fall back on at least what I feel fairly certain about, and that's what the long-run objective should be price stability In looking at the various alternatives, alternative I as prescribed in the Bluebook is at least to me more consistent with that than the other two And I find the rationale used in the Bluebook for explaining alternative I very appealing From the standpoint of flexibility and judgment, I strongly favor that I'd favor it even more if it were solely mine! But given the fact that it isn't, it does seem to me that history shows that this Committee has exercised flexibility and judgment as circumstances dictate, so I don't have a great deal of concern that we wouldn't So, in this uncertain world let's stay with what we've said our primary objective is and that is price stability over time And if things don't work out under alternative I, we'll do something else  -34-    1/30-31/84   I think it has been pretty darn good   No   What I was saying is that as far as I'm concerned it is the objective   There are sold signs everywhere in Dallas    Mr Chairman, the Eleventh District economy is growing, although somewhat unevenly The weakness in the energy sector has caused manufacturing to be sluggish, but most economic reports indicate that both residential and nonresidential construction have continued their strong growth In the District, the S&L situation, which has been in the national news, is a matter of concern In Texas the S&Ls had a 32 percent increase in assets in 1983 and the federally insured S&Ls from Texas closed about $20 billion in loans in 1983 as compared to $9 billion in 1982 Of course, we had the closing of Empire Savings in Mesquite, Texas, which is out where I had mentioned earlier the land switching that was going on   Well, it's right out there next to the cowboys It's the largest S&L closure in the history of the corporation My notes say that it was caused by funding questionable real estate development loans with a deposit base that consisted of 90 percent jumbo CDs and 10 percent core deposits and that about $9-1/2 million, or roughly 3 percent, is uninsured Office construction continues strong Just to cite Dallas as an example In January we had 15 million square feet of office space under construction compared to a 3-year average rate of about 8 million square feet Vacancy rates in Dallas are around 22 to 23 percent and in Houston are 26 percent Most people we talk to seem quite concerned about the whole real estate picture, particularly that there has been so much built in the multifamily area; but a lot of that concern is now beginning to shift to single-family construction, although the pace of activity doesn't seem to slow down There are anecdotal comments such as that the Mesquite situation was the tip of the iceberg and that there are some real problems in the making out there Land prices continue to jump-- and jump daily wanted to buy a little piece of    3/26-27/84  land in downtown Dallas for a parking lot The owner was asking $40 a square foot He offered $38 and the seller didn't take it and two weeks later he bought it for $52 So, it's moving pretty fast  On the agriculture side--and on the call the other day some question was raised about agriculture--our feeling is that credit conditions at our District agricultural banks are characterized by mostly improved cash flows for District farmers who are cotton farmers and ranchers who are livestock producers; both now enjoy profitable price levels for their products The feed, grain, and wheat farmers are probably faced with over-production The rate of loan repayment seems to have quickened and farmers are requesting fewer renewals and extensions right now, although the longer-term outlook still causes us a little concern, Mr Chairman   Well, Mr Chairman, we did get an improvement in the rig count; it has backed off a little but it seems to be coming back slightly It's still a difficult situation but what I see at least is that whatever movement there is seems to be a little on the positive side I'd say that there is not further deterioration   Well, I would think that reflects the demand We had a little uptick in drilling and that has slackened off a bit I don't have any specific knowledge of the price but I know there is an abundant supply stacked up in the yards So, if the price is trending down, people might not be able to hold those things forever   It's difficult for me, as I say, to get a feel for this The banks tell us that they don't feel exposed--that what they are doing is good and that it will be all right The S&Ls, I think, have fully anticipated that there will be fallout from Mesquite and that there are a number of other S&Ls--   Right And the largest increase was a thousand and some odd percent  -34-    3/26-27/84   Mostly it seems to be brokered deposits, and about half of the money is going into construction loans as opposed to just the mortgages at the end They are taking equity positions They are--well, like Mesquite They were building up the value daily, two or three transactions a day, and getting it up to the price where they wanted it and then packaging it and selling it out to less sophisticated small S&Ls out in the country   Yes   The vacancy rate is about 22 percent in office buildings; I was told by a broker that the warehouse construction seems to be doing a little better Prices had been going for about $200 a square foot right before the first of the year and now those prices are up to $235 to $250 a square foot I'm trying to remember what the absorption rate percentage is and I really can't, but the feeling is that the absorption is picking up   A lot of optimism and the fact, first of all, Mr Chairman, that the funds are available Take the big build-up in funds in S&Ls, for example We know they are going to have to do something with that money and they are trying to shove it out as fast as they can On the office building side, there seems to be enough activity to continue to encourage developers and builders   Well, there have been a lot of concessions made If you want a year's free rent, that's not too hard to get on a five- year lease There has been some shaving of prices but I would say the price is pretty well holding at around the $20 a square foot level but with incentives such as paying moving costs or maybe a year's free rent or something like that That is the way they have been doing it I heard fairly reliably that a small insurance company went out to the Los Galenos area close to Dallas-Fort Worth and took a very long-term lease and got the first 5 years free   No We just started a hole for the first of two of our Twin Towers The excavation is underway There is a bank that's going to be the lead tenant of that A 55 story building was just topped off for [unintelligible] Mercantile Bank has announced their 60 story building The InterFirst building is a 70 story building; the steel is about half way up There continue to be new announcements about an area we call the "crescent development" They just dug the biggest hole that has ever been dug in Dallas and it's on the north side outside the loop It's going to have a really first class hotel and three office buildings of over 20 stories, another hotel, shops, and an underground parking garage for about 2600 cars And that [project] is underway   New houses are selling Used houses are turning over now Three of four sold in my neighborhood that had been on the market three or four days   No, but now in the multifamily area it does seem to me that we really are overbuilt The condos built at Faulkner point, which the Mesquite Empire Savings & Loan was behind, consist of over 6,000 units, which is estimated to be about a 7- to 12-year supply They have over 6,000 vacant and they are selling them at a rate of about 20 a month   Mr Chairman, I basically agree with Governor Gramley's description of the economy and what he thinks is likely to happen I agree that if the staff forecast is wrong, it's probably on the conservative side It seems to me that the increase in interest rates that has occurred recently is really a reflection of economic strength rather than any policy actions I remain quite concerned about the long-run implications for inflation; I sense that inflationary expectations are building I think timing in terms of a policy move is very critical Intuitively, I would go to alternative C But I also agree that it would be quite a shock at this time and would probably be a bit strong, so I would come out between "B" and "C" Mention has been made of the discount rate, so I'll go ahead and put in my two cents' worth Frankly, I think there should be a discount rate change I could be persuaded to accept alternative B if there were some feeling that there would be a discount rate change, but I'd leave the alternative B specifications as specified, which effectively--as you said, Nancy--would take the fed funds rate probably to 11 percent   8 to 12 percent  -73-    3/26-27/84   I would prefer 6, 7-1/2, and 8 percent, Mr Chairman   In just a presentational sense, Jerry, if you accepted the numbers that I'm suggesting, the asymmetry is less important You could get it more the way it is worded if you just reduced the numbers   Oh, you're talking substance now!   Technically, Mr Chairman, can the borrowing assumption be changed other than by the Committee?   All the time?   My point is that those of us who don't vote on the discount rate would have nothing to say about what was done with the borrowing assumption   That was the question I wanted to ask If we take "B" as specified and say 7 to 11 percent, have we done anything?   That's the way I'm reading it  SPEAKER(?) That's a matter of opinion   Yes, I know, but--    I have a slightly different view in the Dallas District than what I'm hearing this morning Either I don't understand the situation or I'm talking to the wrong people! We seem to be maintaining our economic recovery and are showing steady improvement overall Roger mentioned the energy sector It is not increasing spectacularly, but nevertheless it has been increasing steadily Our Texas manufacturing output is growing steadily; it's not as fast as the rest of the nation, but it is growing Our housing permits in the first quarter were below a year earlier and this is primarily because of declines in multifamilies I think that's healthy because our area has been very overbuilt And our retail sales have been growing from a year earlier in most of the District  On the agricultural side, our information says that District farmers are better off this year than last year and that prices for both crops and livestock are generally higher than a year ago Now, I would condition that statement by saying it's a little better in a very bad situation overall We have not seen the kind of liquidations that others talk about in the Midwest In talking with some of our people involved in that industry, they do fear that it is coming but it just hasn't come In looking at agriculture, it's pretty hard to talk about it if you don't talk about the weather because that is awfully important Our District is pretty well divided between places where it has rained and where it hasn't rained The southwestern part is reminiscent of the dust bowl of the '30s Sustained winds are greater than they have been in the last 37 years; whatever little grass there is coming up on the ranges is being blown away by the wind when it comes up There are liquidations going on We did have some good rain over the weekend; I don't know how widespread that was, but among those who got rain I'm sure the sentiments are better today than they were last week  Subjectively, my sense of the state of the economy on a broader basis is that it's possibly a little stronger even than the staff forecast I know it's our job to worry and be concerned but that we may be coming into a slowdown is what we've been looking for, it seems to me I think we would acknowledge that the rate of growth    5/21-22/84  in GNP in the first quarter is not sustainable I think what is happening is what I, at least, would like to see happen overall The question, obviously, is whether the economy is really turning down or gradually tapering off But I don't sense the same degree of concern in our area that I'm hearing [here] Commercial real estate, which has been very strong, is down a bit but is still going along at a pretty fast pace Projections are that vacancies in office buildings in Dallas that are either up or being constructed will be absorbed in a three-year period In Houston it is much more difficult; they are projecting about an 8-year period to absorb what they have But one still sees holes being dug and new announcements coming along   Mr Chairman, I would be more inclined to go closer to "C" myself in trying to look through the immediate problem to the longer term, which I recognize is difficult to do But I do think there are even broader considerations than Continental, and my view of the strength of the economy and so forth would lead me toward "C" I would go ahead and take that step now and make whatever adjustment might be necessary as future events unfold But I think the risk to the economy is greater than the risk to one or two financial institutions   Well, I would say that what happened to the economy and what we went through in trying to bring down inflation was considerably more difficult; it represented dislocations of a much larger segment of this economy than what we're looking at right now Therefore, I would guard against what I perceive to be the [risks in the] broader picture    I'm no more confident in my own forecast than others are [in theirs] In terms of real growth, we're about where the Board staff is; we have a little higher nominal GNP and are higher on the deflator When we are as uncertain as we are, maybe we can learn something from history just from the standpoint of where we are in the cycle We are going into the third year of recovery; inflationary pressures tend to increase at that point Looking at it today, it feels considerably different But we've said that, [thus far] at least, this recovery is pretty well tracking a normal recovery So, it makes one wonder if it really is going to be that  -15-    7/16-17/84  different as we go forward I have some real concerns about the exchange value of the dollar If the drop-off does materialize, that will likely bring inflation pressures back on the domestic side Given capacity utilization and the other things that we normally look at, it just seems to me that pressures are going to start building as we get into 1985 Therefore, I'm not as optimistic on inflation as the staff   Well, Mr Chairman, being a bit of an outlier in terms of the forecast, I don't think it is overly surprising that alternative III has appeal to me I'd take 4 to 7 percent for the M1 range and M2, M3 and --   I would take the [alternative III] M2, M3, and debt ranges as presented in the Bluebook I will concede that Tony's  -42-    7/16-17/84  argument, in terms of the presentation and the flexibility it would give us, has some appeal If we were doing this in February, I would feel much stronger in that view than I do right now But I lean toward "III"   Well, Mr Chairman, I would come out probably at "B-" I recognize the very real risks that you described, and they are real On the other hand, I think there are risks on the other side A perception that we were accommodating a lot of things could be almost as bad I think, as Ted said, the markets have discounted quite a bit I could see certainly holding where we are and maybe slightly more restraint I would be inclined to go even farther except for the fact that our next meeting is coming up fairly soon and we will have another opportunity to discuss it and, obviously, we'll know more then than we know now On the borrowing level, I'd probably opt for about $12 billion or $125 billion   If that were interpreted as a bias, I would view that favorably because I think that's where the bias should be   Well, my response to that is--   Well, governor, it seems to me the conversation has been that ex all of these other overriding considerations at the moment--LCDs, fragility, and so forth--the sentiment is that, all other things being equal, we would be [tightening]    Mr Chairman, if I understood Tony right, I would stay right where we are I would leave the borrowing assumption right where it is and I wouldn't change the specifications I agree that this is not the time   Yes   And the borrowing at the same level    In the Eleventh District, Mr Chairman, we are seeing some slowdown Primarily what we see is a climate of weakness in the energy industry, particularly the processing portion Refining and [unintelligible] actually are showing absolute declines both in employment and production This summer drilling also declined on a year-over-year basis, although very recently there has been a little pickup there Housing is ebbing Non-residential construction is flattening out, and I really don't think that's too bad down our way We do have a number of areas of strengths On unemployment, of course, we're below the national average, which really still suggests to us a fairly tight labor market This is borne out at our own Bank where we continue to see our turnover rate increasing It's always fairly large, but it is picking up again The excessive inventories in oil field equipment are being worked off and production and employment as a matter of fact are beginning to increase there Defense contracting is helpful as is electronic equipment In retail sales, we continue to make gains but anecdotally some retailers we talk to seem a bit pessimistic The told me that they were getting increases of 17 and 18 percent and now it looks like 7 or 8 percent and he's not too sure what will occur as we go through the year On the agricultural side in our District, while prices aren't that good, increased production has pretty well offset that At least for this year, we think the District agricultural situation is not going to be all that bad overall, although it's not uniform The drought areas, of course, are severely hurt My bottom line is that this seems to me more of a pause right now, and I agree with those who think that maybe that's not too bad a development I would anticipate that the fourth quarter might be a little better and that 1985--barring all these really terrible things that have been mentioned--shouldn't be all that bad   I said during the summer there was an uptick in Texas; the actual rig count was still down a little in New Mexico and parts of the country he's talking about There have been rather substantial increases over the last month and we have begun to get a little uptick even in Texas But comparing now to a year ago, it's still down a little   Mr Chairman, in my view, it's a little premature to try to do any further easing right now The status quo has a lot of appeal to me Therefore, alternative B as specified in the Bluebook, with a $750 million dollar borrowing assumption, would be very acceptable to me   Yes, that's what I think    Mr Chairman, I think it is fair to characterize the situation in the Eleventh District as one where we are continuing to see some improvement Employment is increasing, industrial production is still moving up, and retail sales look fairly good I will say that we have had slowdowns from earlier in the year Weakness, of course, continues in the energy industry, and that might be getting a little worse We also have had a downturn in construction but, as I indicated last time, I really don't think that's all that bad I would pretty well agree with the Board staff's forecast I would expect the fourth quarter obviously to look a little better than the third quarter At least from the people I've talked to down our way, I have not picked up any real concern about a recession on the horizon as we go into 1985 The confidence factor, at least my own confidence factor, is not quite as strong as it was earlier So, I'm not really complacent On the other hand, my degree of discomfort, if you will, is probably not as great as that expressed by a number of people here It seems to me that we're just coming into a period when there is uncertainty and when decisions become very difficult I think there is an awfully great risk of overreacting to what might or might not happen   Mr Chairman, as I indicated a little earlier, my view of the economic outlook is not quite as pessimistic as some I find myself in a dilemma because I find myself agreeing with the last speaker regardless of what he has said! Intuitively, the uncertainty that we all share, which is obvious, tells me that we shouldn't do very much that is different from what we are doing at this point I really agreed with Karen Horn's description of the situation except that I come to a different conclusion about what to do about it I would remain where we are, alternative B as prescribed, and then as events unfold move to a little more ease if necessary as opposed to going the other way to a bit more ease now in the recognition that we could move policy back I would not go that way On the borrowing assumption, however, I would not feel as strongly that it has to remain at $700 million I rather agree with Roger Alternative B as prescribed but with an initial borrowing assumption of $600 million would be all right with me   Governor Partee's comment that this would be done in the context of alternative A disturbs me a bit I can probably agree to what you're saying in the context of alternative B   I just could not let his comment go without additional comment    Mr Chairman, unless I'm missing something, it seems to me the issue is not rules versus discretion but rather rules for exercising discretion I think the discretionary aspect is certainly there--at least that's what I'm interpreting Steve to be saying It's pretty much a confirmation of what has been going on but with just a small amount of added comfort level to the staff in terms of doing what they have had to do It seems to me that giving staff just the slight amount of latitude that Steve's talking about makes sense I think anything excessive or any apparent trends or anything unusual would certainly come to the Committee and would come very quickly I just think there's a certain degree of comfort level here that would be helpful to the staff, but I don't think it would be giving anything away from the standpoint of what the Committee is trying to accomplish My bottom line is that I don't have any real problem with this   I didn't comment on M1 I would not be prepared to restore it to its original grandeur On the other hand, Lyle, I think more of it than I have in recent times I feel it's probably as good an indicator as we have now So, I would put a little more emphasis on M1 now   It would be awfully important, but I would still want to keep my eyes open to--   Okay   Well, Mr Chairman, with respect to the economy, my own position would be that growth is likely to be closer to 4 percent than to 29 or 3 percent I don't say that with a great deal of confidence but that's where my bias seems to be For one thing, I'm not entirely sure what the full effect will be of the ease that we've undertaken recently I don't think we've seen the full effect of that I think we're seeing some positive effects, but I'd be a bit cautious in terms of trying to do a whole lot more at this time until we can assess that a little better Reference has been made to all the uncertainties over which we have no control, uncertainties about which it is questionable exactly what, if anything, monetary policy could do  As for the long-term ranges for '85, they continue to look okay to me I don't have a strong view one way or the other on Tony Solomon's point about the cosmetics of M3, but basically I'm satisfied with the tentative ranges that have been established I do think M1 is important I wouldn't characterize it as primarily important It is something, though, that I would be inclined to pay a little more attention to On the operating procedures, as I tried to indicate yesterday, I think the conduct of operations has been really quite satisfactory; if a slight adjustment would help the mechanical day-to- day process, I wouldn't have any really serious question about doing that  On the exchange rate problems, I agree with the views that have been expressed It's one of the most serious issues that we have out there It's a very, very real dilemma because anything that we do will cut both ways I just have no satisfactory solution to suggest, although I have some feeling, much as John Balles said, that maybe we ought to be trying to do something about that over which we do have some control, which is our own domestic situation My bottom line, Mr Chairman, is that the word that keeps coming to me is patience I think we're in a period now where patience is extremely important There's always the desire to do something and I'm in favor of doing  -54-    12/17-18/84  something provided that we get the desired result Since I'm not sure what doing something would mean, I would be inclined to be very hesitant and, as Tony said, if we do anything, to do it very carefully and in very small steps   I would certainly agree with what Lyle says As you said a little earlier, Mr Chairman, you don't see much difference  -69-    12/17-18/84  between $250 and $300 million [on borrowing] Why don't we just go for $300 million?   No, I agree with Lyle because of his very astute analysis   No, I just think he says it better than I can; I just agree with what he's saying    Here in Dallas    Mr Chairman, I'm inclined to join those who are probably a little more optimistic than the Board staff, although I think the staff's forecast is very reasonable and I would be willing to accept it As for concern about all of the problems, I feel much as you did, Ed I felt very good until I got here Those problems are all there and they are all very real possibilities I guess the worst of all worlds would be if every one of them really came to pass; maybe just one of them will We will just have to wait and see what's going to happen on the deficit problem The dollar problem is pretty much of an unknown, and depending on how that develops--or if some of these things happen--I think we would all be shifting our views entirely  -19-    2/12-13/85  On agriculture, I tend to agree with Roger I really don't know what we, sitting around this table, can do there  In the discussion, someone mentioned the oil price going to $16 or $15 dollars a barrel Several months ago, in discussing what the effect would be on our financial institutions if we got a pretty good drop in the price of oil, the feeling was that if the price got to $25 a barrel, that was going to cause some very serious problems Now that that is a very real situation, they are saying "Well, when it gets to $20 we're going to have some real problems" So, it's hard to judge just where that level is I don't believe it's quite as difficult at $25 now as they thought it was going to be--not that it's easy; it isn't And now they are thinking maybe $20 is where the difficulty is--   No But I think it's becoming more and more of a reality that it's going to get there Therefore, in the conversations, the assumption is that it's likely to get there so they question where the next down point is But no, it's not there yet Overall, looking at the situation today, I would certainly go forward with a great big smile on my face and keep my fingers crossed as I kept going   Well, Mr Chairman, I would join those who are arguing for alternative II, and I would be willing to take it the way it's specified in the Bluebook I really have no additional justification for that other than I think it allows for adequate money growth I do think that the perception is always important and it is certainly important right now I think that would convey the perception that I'd like to see us convey   I would go with "B" also    Mr Chairman, it's becoming increasingly difficult to remain optimistic  SPEAKER(?) Gee whiz!   In our District, the economy continues to advance slowly There are areas of concern Obviously, the energy picture is pretty cloudy right now; you've all read about that Rigs in Texas are down close to 9 percent over a year ago While there has been a little stability in the oil price situation, most of the people I've talked to are not very optimistic The construction side, on balance, is fairly stable; but that's rather misleading because multifamily units have taken a real nose dive On the other hand, our commercial construction activity is picking up and that had been going at a fairly torrid pace down our way anyway  The banks, in increasing their lending, have shown rather significant expansion in loans and in the real estate area Chuck made reference to one of our major banking organizations getting in the press They have, of course, but that came right on the heels of the Ohio situation But our other bank holding companies, both major and second-tier, also have been in the press We had a fairly significant merger called off because [unintelligible] the condition of the two marriage partners, and they decided they had better go their own way Our largest bank holding company has been in somewhat of a holding pattern and is trying to remain as quiet as possible In the second-tier group, we have holding companies in Dallas that have all of their problems, including the infighting within their managements, being aired in the newspapers We have a similar situation with a holding company out in New Mexico where the chief executive officer has been ousted and he has filed a $35 million lawsuit All of this is just being spread everywhere and that doesn't instill confidence  On the economy generally, I have not picked up many comments indicating that there's real concern that we're going to go into recession I have had a few rather disturbing comments made to me-- and this is certainly anecdotal--along the lines that, well, maybe right now is a time where a little inflation wouldn't be all that bad This is coming primarily from real estate developers The first- quarter GNP was below my expectations I do remind myself, though, that we have had little surprises from time to time; whether this one is going to stick or whether it's going to bounce around, I guess is highly debatable On the fragility side, much as Jerry said, I'm not  -20-    3/26/85  too sure that monetary policy can do very much about that, at least in the current circumstances I would be satisfied personally to stay just about where we are on policy Any tilt on that would probably be in the direction of a bit of concern about the growth in money   I would favor alternative B with a modification to 6 percent [on M1 growth], making it 6, 7, and 8 percent, with borrowing of around $400 million    Mr Chairman, I don't really have anything positive to bring to the table today The situation in the Eleventh District pretty well mirrors what has been going on [in other Districts] We obviously had a slowing in the first quarter of 1985 In the fourth quarter of 1984 we were pretty well paralleling the nation in terms of economic growth but our rate of increase has slipped below the pace of the nation in the first quarter, in part because of absolutely declining activity in energy, electronics, and construction Reference already has been made to office building construction and that sort of thing Of course, we have had an awful lot of construction in our area as I've reported in the past The problems in Houston are very well known; they are not unforeseen problems; they have been trying to live with their problems for a couple of years We are getting reports that now there is concern in Austin, which has been a very strong boom area; that seems to be slowing very significantly As an example, based on a recent survey, we had about 18 million square feet of office space sitting empty in Dallas in March--a vacancy rate of a little over 21 percent But on top of that in March we had another 25 million square feet of office space under construction The conclusion of the survey was that we  -15-    5/21/85  are now approaching the end of a real estate cycle I think I can accept that statement Agriculture remains weak Our preliminary indication on our latest survey of agricultural land prices actually showed a little increase in 1984 but the first quarter now is beginning to show a little decline So, it looks as though those who said we are about a year to a year and a half behind the Midwest might be right  Having said all that, I would also share the view expressed by a few others regarding a little concern about overreacting on the side of ease, despite all the gloomy reports The uncertainty is very, very great and I still think it remains to be seen which way the economy is going to turn   I would find alternative B acceptable In my view the borrowing assumption as a minimum should be $350 to $375 million I would not go below that    Well, [when Roger] was talking about commodities, he didn't mention cotton We grow a lot of cotton down our way, but the price of cotton is down from 706 cents a pound in May of last year to 49 cents a pound   That is a big drop On the energy side, the rig count numbers were down about 25 percent from a year ago, which is fairly significant I noticed in the staff's forecast [an oil price drop from] $26 to $24 a barrel The talk among the bankers--those who are lending in the energy business--is that they think they could manage fairly well down to $25 a barrel or possibly $24 a barrel Now, last year they were saying that was extreme--that they'd have a hard time going down that far Now they have decided that they could manage a little better going down there But the energy side is very, very uncertain My own view is probably a little more optimistic than the Board staff's I am inclined to line up more with Frank Morris; I don't know whether it's just out of habit! Our problem is that we are adjusting mentally--or I am adjusting--to what's happening in the rest of the country We are about where the rest of the country is, which puts us in a rather unusual position--at least for the last ten years or so  I think a lot has been done in terms of interest rates and in terms of money growth I personally don't have a great deal of  -15-    7/9-10/85  concern that we are going to fall into a recession What is an acceptable rate of growth? I know we are not debating that, but 3 percent or so certainly by historical standards has been close to the long-run trend It seems to me that, given where policy has been, the Board staff's forecast is reasonable As I say, I'd probably put it slightly higher and I think most of the reasons already have been stated, one way or another I still have some confidence in the consumer; I have confidence on the housing side  Now, commercial real estate construction I obviously have a lot of concerns about All I know is that I still see holes being dug--figuratively speaking, probably I hear about the concessions that are being made in real estate We have been sampling the local market because we are going to have to lease some more space At least on the first go-round, it doesn't seem that optimistic when we talk to them Now, we haven't gotten down to horse trading, so that's probably different I remember we were looking for space this time last year and we will be for a number of years! [Laughter] Last time, I made three final decisions! When you talk the first time, everybody tells you what their deal is; then when you tell them you are not going to take it and you are ready to take another deal all of a sudden they say "Yes, but you haven't heard the best deal" We finally had to shut it off because we had to go ahead and make a commitment I do agree that there are going to be some serious problems But at least in terms of construction activity, it is continuing to show some strength If you talk to an individual developer, he will tell you his project is all right There is a lot of equity in it and his firm is prepared for the long term and he is worried about the fellow down the street And I haven't run into the fellow down the street yet!   Well, Mr Chairman, I am having a little difficulty following some of the discussion from the standpoint of rebasing or raising ranges, and so forth I still don't have a sense --maybe I am missing it--of whether or not we want to address this very large growth in M1 and address it forthrightly I am leaning in that direction in my own view It seems to me that once that basic point becomes clear, how we structure our ranges then becomes a little easier I am not comfortable at this point in knowing where we really stand in terms of Are we going to try to do something about M1 or are we going to accept it the way it is and just let whatever happened happen? And based on what we think [the answer to] that might be, then decide to rebase or change the range? I guess what I am saying is that I would like to see, however it is constructed, some movement to reduce the rate of growth in M1   To some extent, I would be inclined to do that looking longer term, because I have a very uneasy feeling that we are building major problems as opposed to the difficult problems that we have right now   The major problem, it seems to me, would be the possibility of inflation coming back and coming back very strongly    7/9-10/85   Yes   Yes   Don't misunderstand me I am not talking about [unintelligible] it I am just talking about moving in the direction of some restraint   Well, I don't think we're coming to a recession   Well, that is what I am searching for--not how we present it In the final analysis it will become rather transparent I think the big question out there--at least in the layman's mind--is that we have had this excess of M1 money growth and are we going to do something about it or not?   Well, quasi-laymen   I agree All I am saying is--and maybe you got ahead of me--that I didn't sense that that really had been answered    There is not anything down our way that leads to a whole lot of optimism Just about everything--   That's for sure The major thing, of course, is uncertainty in energy We talked about that Texas A&M University is predicting a 40 percent drop in farm income for this year The Bureau of Business Research at the University of Texas is saying that Texas is already in a recession There are uncertainties developing Our unemployment rate has matched the national average, which is not all that bad, but it is rather bad compared to what we are used to The whole sense, in an anecdotal way, is for not very much--   No, nothing that I am aware of, other than [lingering] concern and predictions, at least, of further softening in oil prices I don't think we are hearing quite the same scary scenario of [a decline to] something less than $20 a barrel, but we still are expecting some further decline   The drilling activity is down The rig count is down about 25 percent from what it was a year ago, I believe It's approximately that in Texas   It's up slightly, but for the nation--   For Texas--   I was thinking we were still running about [the same as] last time, which was about 25 percent--   From a pretty low number, yes   I would also look at "B," obviously for all the reasons that have been stated My tilt--and it would be a very slight tilt--would be toward "C," which would be a very slight increase I do have concern about the credibility problem; what is happening to M1 is extremely difficult to explain I think some stability, if you will, in interest rates would not be bad I start getting a little nervous when I hear words that seem to say that we need to peg the fed funds rate I get uncomfortable with that That would not be the objective, but some stability would be good Borrowings of about $450 million would be all right with me    Mr Chairman, in the Eleventh District, we are probably a little more pessimistic, and certainly more pessimistic than is traditional for us I just completed a swing around the District and found the following in Houston, no optimism given the energy and real estate situation; in San Antonio and in Austin, a little more optimism; and in Midland Texas, where our El Paso Branch Board met--and that covers eastern New Mexico--all of the uncertainties on energy prices have them quite worried Si mentioned agriculture I heard one report up in the Panhandle area of cows coming out of the feed lot at a loss of $125 to $150 a head, so it's going to take a lot of volume to make that up In Dallas, I guess there is probably a little more optimism, although I worry about it I've talked about the commercial real estate situation to the point where you all are tired of hearing about it But the Chamber of Commerce did a report a couple of weeks ago which said that there is more vacant office space in Dallas, Texas than there is office space in Philadelphia And that has to be a big problem down the road  In a broader context, my own view is that there is a little improvement in the economy I would pretty well agree with Jim's forecast On the policy side, I guess I have some sympathy for what Bob Black was saying; I would probably be somewhere between "B" and "C" myself    Mr Chairman, I can't bring in any great amount of optimism to this discussion Our part of the country, I think it is fair to say, is pretty sluggish It is uneven; it depends on where you happen to be sitting We had an unemployment rate for Texas last month of 81 percent, which is very unusual The unemployment rates in Louisiana and New Mexico are even higher In the various sectors of the economy, there is really not anything positive that seems to be happening We continue to feel that the energy situation will remain [poor] even though there has been some firming in the price We think that is temporary and that the price will start sliding as we get through the winter In our latest survey of our agricultural banks it is fairly obvious that the tone has changed and that some of those problems now are starting to materialize From that last survey, the decline in land values now is estimated to be about 10 percent, which doesn't sound like all that much compared to what is happening in the    11/4-5/85  Midwest But that is the first time that I have seen a number that large from our respondents The only thing that is really happening, and this was mentioned earlier, is in non-residential construction We just had another major office building announced in Dallas by Republic Corporation; it is going to be a 60- story building that they are going to build with a developer--Vantage Company--and in the process they are going to reduce their occupancy costs; they have really made a very nice scenario on how all that's going to work out I was reading in the paper coming up on the plane yesterday that Prudential, which now owns the second tallest building in Dallas, one of the newer ones--InterFirst Tower II, which InterFirst sold--is going to spend $50 million putting a new facade on that building so it will look prettier I guess that is a good business decision; I don't know But it just keeps on We set new records in August in terms of the amount of commercial construction Even in Houston--and I think I mentioned this before--there is a $250 million building coming out of the ground in downtown Houston But that developer is going to catch the curve right; he is going to come on stream just at the right time I am inclined to agree with Pres in terms of the outlook 3 to 5 years out that there still seems to be the conviction that you can catch the turning point and it will pay off    Mr Chairman, you mentioned that no one wanted to tighten   I think that is true But the thought strikes me--you referred to 1928-29--and I just wondered if we're not rationalizing ourselves into an even more difficult situation   The practical problem in terms of ranges and so forth is what several others, including Gary Stern, have said To do a complete change to me would throw even more uncertainty into a very uncertain environment   At midyear we tried to make some adjustment in recognition of what has actually happened--rebasing, widening the ranges It is true that the behavior of M1 has not improved, but it seems to me that keeping the M1 range--downgrading it through words or monitoring it or whatever you want to call it--and widening the range some would be the only prudent thing to do right now, until some of this other work could be done and we know a lot more than we do [now] I don't think I could say with any assurance that things might not return over the next six or eight months   Well, Mr Chairman, the economy in Texas and in the Eleventh District has continued to grow at a sluggish pace That's due in large part to a further deterioration in the energy sector For example, the rig count is at its lowest level in ten years The District's construction activity in 1985 has shown more rapid growth than that for the nation as a whole, but that relationship is expected to flip-flop in the year ahead Even the growth of the service sector is like that of the nation, and no turnaround is in sight Both the economy and the economic mood have continued to deteriorate, and I am hard pressed to find any sources of potential optimism In short, the District's economic problems are pervasive and extend far beyond those attributable to the energy sector  Having said that about the Eleventh District, our view of the economy as a whole for next year is that we would anticipate probably a little better year than we had in 1985 Our GNP number probably would be closer to 3 percent than to 2 percent   Well, Mr Chairman, just briefly going back to the recitation you made in your opening comments, they indicated to me  -54-    12/16-17/85  at least that we certainly have been accommodative any way you want to look at it In terms of what is going on now--speculation, if you will--in the stock market and possibly some other areas, I would be very concerned to further fuel what [seem] to be the excesses Certainly the debt side of it is excessive, from my view point at least Every meeting is a critical meeting, but it seems to me this is probably one of the more critical meetings because the wrong turn right now could have very far reaching consequences My view, as I expressed earlier, in terms of what I see for the economy for 1986 is slightly more optimistic than the Board staff's forecast Having said all that, I would much prefer to stay right where we are which, if I read it right, would be alternative B The ability to bring the discount rate down, if that should work out, I would find acceptable provided that that type of action wouldn't lead to too much euphoria otherwise But I think that's manageable from the Desk side So I would stay right where we are; I would stay with "B"    Well, Mr Chairman, I guess I am wearing two hats On the broader picture, I have just a couple of comments We see the economy generally pretty much as the Board staff does We see a little more strength than we first thought because of the oil price developments; my own guess is that if we are wrong, we probably are not seeing it quite as strong as it's going to turn out to be On the inflation situation, while that has been doing very well and looks like it is going to do very well, I have a little problem about becoming very complacent because that could change, and I think it could change fairly rapidly  Reference already has been made to the fact that we have a micro problem, so I will take just a minute and talk about that In the Dallas District, [business conditions] continue to deteriorate; while the steep decline in the price of oil is on balance beneficial for the US economy, it's depressing economic activity in parts of the Eleventh District I should add, however, that while the price declines are unprecedented in modern times, they are not as great yet as is usually alleged by the media, which typically focuses its attention on spot and futures markets where only a small fraction of oil is traded and where prices tend to be highly volatile Most oil is traded at prices posted by refineries; and that market, while a lot more stable than the spot market, is still disorderly For example, posted prices on West Texas Intermediate last Friday ranged from $18 to $2385 a barrel Posted or contract prices have fallen by 25 percent from November levels, in contrast with more than a 50 percent drop in spot prices over the same period Adjusted for inflation, oil prices are probably about where they were in 1974  Adding to our District's economic difficulties is the overhang of office and other commercial buildings We had expected construction activity to decline for some time The volume of new construction contracts plunged by 25 percent in the fourth quarter; it's down by 40 percent from August 1985 and this downtrend is expected to continue The weakness in construction and energy, of course, is causing financial strains on our District's financial institutions Manufacturing activity, especially that related to energy and construction, has been declining Retail sales growth is weak Furthermore, the agricultural outlook is dim in some areas and even foreboding in others In spite of all of the negatives I have just outlined, we have experienced some employment growth in the District, perhaps about one percent That [could be maintained] if oil prices remain at current levels Any further drop in oil prices would produce zero or negative employment growth in the District Mr Chairman, that concludes my rather gloomy report on what's going on in the Eleventh District  -19-    2/11-12/86   Just in early 1986, looking year over year   Mr Chairman, I also would keep M1 and give it the attention that we have been giving it On the Ml range, I share a lot of the uncertainties--   I beg your pardon?   I don't know [unintelligible] different But I still think that M1 is important and that we ought to look at it As Gary Stern said, when it's not behaving at least that causes us to rethink periodically, so I would pay attention to it As for the range, I share all of the uncertainties [alluded to by others], and moving the upper end to 8 percent would be acceptable to me [For the lower end] either 3 or 4 percent is okay   Right   Alternative B, $300 to $400 million, would be my position   I would    Mr Chairman, I don't have a whole lot to add to the comments I made [at the dinner] yesterday evening, but I'm trying to keep it in perspective at least It is true that things are not going particularly well down our way On the other hand, I do think that the press might be overplaying this a little; I'm not sure that it is quite as dire as is being reflected in the press There is overall economic growth, and it is continuing, but the gains are becoming less and less widely spread We do have some increase in our non-agricultural employment, but not to the same extent as the rest of the nation Of course, we picked up that 2-point jump in the unemployment numbers, which we tried to explain a couple of weeks ago --rationalizing at least that it probably wasn't all that great What I have been reading and hearing since two weeks ago--though I'm not too sure I want to see the March number--is that that 2-point jump was in fact on the high side  We also have a tremendous amount of refinancing going on I'm hearing of delays anywhere from 6 weeks to 2 months before one can get a refinancing done But we also have, particularly in a couple of our metropolitan areas such as Houston and even up in Dallas, a lot of homes still being auctioned off that have been foreclosed on We have a lot of concern about the thrift industry down our way There are a lot of problems and, of course, having in the press the report that the Home Loan Bank is bringing in 250 examiners from around the country to help out doesn't give one a lot of confidence that there aren't problems On the energy issue and the effects on inflation, I would agree with Jim--if I understood him correctly--that the major benefit is in this year and [what will happen] next year remains to be seen Jerry referred to investment and at least the short-term effects of all of this cutback in energy, oil, and gas That [sector] has been a very heavy user of investment funds So at least in the short run, that's not beneficial I am inclined to want to believe all of these forces that have already been identified that point to better growth in the second half of the year I certainly hope that that comes about I have a little reservation in terms of confidence that it's really going to work out as well as it would appear   The consumer might figure the financing looks so good that it offsets the price increase   Who pays sticker?   Mr Chairman, I would lean toward "B" with a little to the "B+" side I recognize that fine tuning and so forth is not overly successful, but it does seem to me that at least for the first quarter and the second quarter the economy doesn't look that strong I recognize there are lags, but we do meet again in May; and I would just lean a bit on the high side of "B" until we have more information, which we will tomorrow and the next day, [or] until we meet here in May If that subtle move were a mistake, I think it could be undone, probably subtly I would be slightly in favor of "B+ "    Well, Mr Chairman, our picture is a little different in that it is not looking too good Economic activity is declining The data for the first quarter show that while the decline has been modest it certainly is widespread We expect the deterioration to be more severe in this quarter and also in the third quarter The energy sector has been referred to already; of course, it has been very hard hit The rig count is the lowest since WWII The employment in that area, though, has not come down quite as much as one would have anticipated; it was down about 7 percent in March so our view is that we still have a lot more of that coming as we go along Oil prices have come back a little, but it doesn't seem that the increase, at least yet, is enough to give drillers much encouragement We would anticipate that prices probably could turn back down as we get on past summer Construction is continuing to subside, particularly on the nonresidential side The value of contracts has been sliding for several months Employment has remained pretty strong and in fact is about at historically high levels in nonresidential construction; so here again we expect to see a sizable reduction in the work force as the projects come off and there are no new ones that are going to be replacing them Other sectors of our economy are stagnant or declining Manufacturing is affected by the weakness of energy and construction, and agriculture continues to do poorly The financial position of many of our farmers also has been weakened further by the decline in oil prices because they are not getting the royalty payments from the oil wells that they have on their farms Residential construction has been holding up fairly well but we would be more comfortable, as far as our financial    5/20/86  institutions are concerned, if multi-family construction would drop off a bit  In sum, Mr Chairman, we just are not really seeing very much on the positive side in the Eleventh District We share part of Louisiana--the part that Mr Forrestal doesn't have--and he reported how that state is doing New Mexico we share with the Tenth District and that is not doing all that great either So, we are a little negative   Strangely enough, in far north Dallas I was out on the weekend and went into 14 houses, brand new, that are on the market for sale at prices ranging from $475,000 to $800,000 And they think they are going to sell them!   Oh no, I just like to see what they are doing That is way out in the country   Well, Mr Chairman, I also would agree on alternative B for all of the reasons that were given On the directive, I agree with Frank and Manuel's point of staying neutral; it seems to me that alternative III does that much more than alternative I, as was discussed earlier It does not use numbers; it's very straightforward In fact, it says we don't know We do have July coming up and that's a traditional point at which we take a new look at this This [directive] would not become public until after the July meeting, which I assume would be pretty close to the time that you would be testifying You would have the opportunity to explain it all It seems to me this signal of not putting any numbers in right now, as in draft directive III, is the best indication of consistency, [acknowledging] that we are a bit confused And it seems to me it gives you the opportunity to say whatever needs to be said come July I would very strongly go with option III    Jim, on your $16 a barrel [price assumption for oil], does that mean an average or the price at the end of the forecast period?   Well, Mr Chairman, it seems to me that the immediate problem is probably more one of form than of substance We talk about honesty, and I guess that's in the eyes of the beholder I would think that would be a straightforward change in the range--not dropping it and not rebasing it--to the money growth we would anticipate, much as Gary said I would just do a straightforward change in the range at this point and say this is what we anticipate M1 will do--without having to say that it's a monitoring range or that we don't know what it's doing or that we are not going to be paying very much attention to it The numbers might look a little large-- larger than we are used to seeing--but I would be pretty straightforward on that For 1987, I would keep Ml; there again I would be inclined to make the best judgment we could about what money growth numbers we anticipate, and I would construct the ranges around them Again, they might be a little large, but I would do that here at midyear, because before we have to really settle on that early next year we would have the opportunity--if more normal relationships develop--to make an adjustment downward I would rather go to the up side now and come down [later] rather than shoot low and have to go over Those are good economic terms!   Well, Mr Chairman, as I have been reporting, things have not been going all that well in our District The Eleventh District economy seems to be about the weakest in the country Not only has our situation gotten a little worse, we expect it to deteriorate even further and possibly at a bit faster pace The Texas unemployment rate in June rose to 10-1/2 percent, and that's the highest level in modern times, certainly, for Texas New Mexico and Louisiana expect to show increases in unemployment when their data become available The last report for Louisiana was 13 percent and that's probably on the way up As conditions worsen in energy, construction, and manufacturing, that is having some fairly severe effects on our financial institutions If you read the papers, it's pretty hard not to see one of our Texas organizations being featured in one of the articles Their performance has really not been all that good! Looking at it from a supervisory standpoint, we don't [rate] our major bank holding companies very high from a supervisory level! Those that seem to be doing a little better we wonder about, because some of their major subsidiaries haven't been examined for a year or year and a half and that makes us a little concerned over what the true situation might be  Now, I tried very hard to find some positive elements of strength in our District to report this time, but I just was not successful Aside from this regional report, though, I continue to feel with regard to the broader picture that there will be some modest pickup in the second half of this year Our forecast is in the middle of the forecasts of the Reserve Bank presidents And we think this is sustainable into 1987, if there's some monetary stimulus that comes about to offset the economic drag of the uncertainties that are inherent in the fiscal environment   There's a way around this, if the Board wanted us to leave for a few minutes    Jim, one question on your forecast The positives are fairly heavily weighted on the improvement in exports As I think you know, our folks have been doing a little research trying to figure out what has really happened to the dollar and our judgment seems to be that it has declined somewhere between 7 to 9 percent as opposed to 25 to 30 percent If that should be true, that would tend to postpone this improvement I would just raise--   Mr Chairman, on the national level I'd be slightly less optimistic than the staff's forecast, but it's pretty close On the District level, I'm having a little change of heart; I think my attitude is changing from one of pessimism to cautious optimism I don't want to damn this by faint praise but I, too, think that we are seeing signs that we may be reaching the trough in the Eleventh District The big increases in unemployment rates seem to be over In Texas, in both July and August, rates were below the rates for May and June Those July and August rates, however, were very high August was 92 percent compared with the 68 percent national average, but that's down from the 10+ percent that we had a little earlier Unemployment rates [are high] in Louisiana; Bob Forrestal mentioned that New Mexico is about the same as Texas Our nonfarm employment may be near the end of its major decline We did see a little rise in July in Texas and New Mexico and that comes after five consecutive months of decline So, hopefully, we're seeing a turn there The manufacturing sector remains weak but may be close to bottoming out Some areas of strength we're seeing include electrical and electronic equipment as well as aircraft and parts Our construction contracts seems to be stabilizing, at least for now Construction values remain about 20 percent below year-ago levels The most pronounced reduction in the energy sector activity also appears to be behind us Our rig count is flat or rising slightly-- from very low levels, of course Our energy sector employment now is declining slowly in contrast to massive layoffs just a few months ago Even in agriculture, the livestock producers are feeling a little better because of higher beef prices So in summary, Mr Chairman, I would say that maybe we have a little cautious optimism for the Eleventh District now   My view is the same, "B"    Mr Chairman, I don't have very much new or different to report for the Eleventh District Things have continued pretty much as they have been We do think that we're at the trough, as I reported last time, or certainly very close to it I guess you'd say it has stabilized or has become stagnant, whichever term you want to use As hard as we're looking, we really don't see any visible evidence of an upturn but neither are we finding evidence that it's getting worse As a result of our District's economic conditions, the banking situation doesn't seem to be improving Looking at the national economy, we don't have any real issue to take with the staff forecast We might tend to be a little less optimistic on real    11/5/86  growth--but not anything very significant--and to a certain degree on the inflation outlook than they projected   There are other things going on, too, that the numbers might not capture Talk about the incentives on the commercial side! There are a lot of incentives on multifamily units, as evidenced by the signs in front of a lot of these projects saying "The move is on us!" with a picture of a moving truck They say they will pick up the moving expenses, give free rent the first six months, and then talk about the rental rate later There are all kinds of incentives at work, so it may be that for reporting purposes the [true cost of a] rental is not actually being shown By the time you work in--   Jerry Corrigan talked about the very rapid price movements in homes, and we are having that too In Dover a friend of mine just offered $100,000 less than the asking price and the owner took it before my friend could even back off   It was just a $300,000 house    I agree pretty much with what Tom Melzer has just said I would set a range and I would try to explain it It seems to me that whatever credibility we had on Ml we have lost The markets have adjusted to that loss of credibility They seem to be accepting the fact that we don't know If we come up with something else, it would be an implication that we know what we are doing If we lose on that, we double our credibility loss I would rather ride with what we have for a while and, obviously, be looking for better ways But I guess I have not heard anything proposed that gives me a lot of confidence that it would be any better than what we have been doing over the last several months   Mr Chairman, the Eleventh District has remained much the way it was when we reported at the last meeting We continue to think that we are at the trough, statistically at least; we think there is going to be some improvement in 1987 We just did our own forecast for the District and we think we will do about half as well as the national forecast That does key off the national forecast, because we think that's where most of our strength is going to be--the spillover effect from that--and we do pretty much agree with the staff's forecast Also, if oil prices are in the $1300 to $1600 range we have a little optimism there, and that's built into our forecast We have had a little improvement in non-ag employment in the District, although the Texas unemployment rate is still holding at 9-1/2 percent versus 7 percent for the nation Of the eight highest unemployment rates [for cities] around the country, we have five of them in Texas It depends on where you happen to be; if you are in McAllen, Texas it's 19 percent Agriculture presents a bit of a mixed bag If you are in the livestock business, it's looking pretty good; if not, it still looks bad or not very encouraging The high-tech and related areas look pretty good  One reason I said that, statistically, we think we are at the trough is that, anecdotally, we are about the only ones who think that Comments of our directors and reports from around the District tend to be more negative in that we get very little encouragement In trying to figure out why that is, I think it is probably that our directors don't have the same view of the national economy's growth that we have In other words, they have a feeling that growth is not going to be as strong as we think it will So, while there is not anything really to brag about openly, we are going to go along and gradually improve   I'd say two things about that it's an unusual plant and it's an unusual individual   That he is going to find out   "B" and symmetrical    In his District, big banks don't borrow because they do not want it known that they may have come to the window for other reasons So, the big institutions don't come in   Well, Mr Chairman, optimism or pessimism is a relative thing Having been through a series of meetings over the last several weeks--with our own board of directors, our advisory councils for small business and agricultural, our financial institutions' advisory council, and a few others--I thought I was being rather optimistic in sending in [a forecast of] 2-1/2 percent real GNP because that isn't what I was hearing anecdotally from our people However, based on what I have seen, it's probably under the others; it's certainly a little under the staff forecast My own staff, I think, would encourage me to shave that up slightly, based on their analysis and, certainly, the current information One thing that is tending to influence us in the Eleventh District is the fact that in the survey that we just did on the effects of the decline in the value of the dollar, we probably have not received the benefit--or certainly not the same benefit--that other Districts have been reporting There is optimism, although it's cautious optimism; it's a sense that we just don't think we are going to slide down any further and we can see a few glimmers of hope If anything, I have been a bit pessimistic in terms of the 1987 performance on the real economy and  -22-    2/10-11/87  inflation, although we are not seeing a great amount of indication that inflation is getting to be a problem To me, at least, it's time to observe that very, very closely, because the possibilities are such that we could see a little pickup there I don't know whether it will materialize or not; we will just have to wait and see But it's something that I would hope we'd be observing very closely   Alternative II    Do you figure in very much of a kick from the home equity loans, from the standpoint of consumption? Do you see that helping very much?   The banks seem to be trying to push them pretty hard I wondered whether or not that would be successful and what it would lead to  SPEAKER(?) Jim, how about some of the price indices that you follow in a more current sense--commodities indices and so forth What are they showing in terms of recent behavior?   I did look real hard for something positive I was able to leave the District for a few days! Mention has been made on the manufacturing side of exports and the effect of the dollar That is, or appears to be, a positive factor in the Eleventh District --lumber, paper, and chemicals seem to be responding Attitudes, which I think really are important, have not changed all that much I would say that some people are not quite as pessimistic although I certainly would not consider people optimistic at this point Looking at some of the negatives that remain in the Eleventh District, construction, which I've reported on, is a big thing, of course We don't see much possibility for a turnaround in that In commercial construction Houston had a negative absorption Dallas does have a higher vacancy rate than Houston but our absorption is doing better The thinking was that we probably were two or three years away from a major announcement on a new building Now that has been extended to probably three or four years, indirectly, because we have had a major announcement of 900,000 square feet coming on the market in downtown Dallas with the InterFirst-Republic Bank combination; they are going to free up that much space--their prime or best space--through that consolidation The rig count is off slightly after growing steadily for about six months Retail sales are weak I can confirm what you say, Roger, about leasing In Oklahoma we just leased a little mineral interest that the Bank has there and we got $105 an acre but we went out for five years and I think it amounted to about $3,000   No, this goes back to the '20s and '30s We were given quitclaim deeds and we haven't been able to get rid of this We should have given it to you when you took Oklahoma, Roger! The employment numbers have been a surprise for us in Texas because we have been reporting eight consecutive months of growth in employment Those numbers have now been revised and, as a matter of fact, we have had eight consecutive months of decline   I would also favor alternative B for the reasons that have been given--the uncertainties I do like Jerry's approach of starting with $300 million borrowing but being prepared to move fairly rapidly a little higher It seems to me that what is really important right now in this very current environment is what's happening to the exchange rate, and that can move awfully fast In terms of the response and implementation of policy, I differ a little with Frank Morris simply because of the logistics of taking whatever action might be required I would be willing to go along with an understanding of being prepared to move and to move very quickly toward a little more restraint Likewise, then, I would make the exchange rate a little more prominent in the directive because that's kind of what's guiding the policy decision right now, at least in my mind   Couldn't the M2 and M3 growth be handled, in view of what goes before it, by saying that the action is expected to be consistent with growth in M2 and M3 over the period at annual rates "around 6 percent"? Just say "around" that We don't really know   In trying to be consistent, we are becoming inconsistent simply because we are saying that we don't want anything to change But then we are saying if we have to change, the M2 and M3 growth rates relate to no change We don't know what the monetary aggregates would do when we respond because we don't know what the response would have to be   Not [unintelligible] at this point in time   In the wording, these numbers are associated with our action to maintain, which is the first sentence So, I don't think we have to put in ranges or other numbers because we are talking about something that might happen   If you change the word to approach, then 6 percent or less I can live with very well; in fact, I would favor it    Mr Chairman, with respect to the staff forecast, in principle, I pretty much go along with it, although it's hard to be looking at it from the perspective of our District, which causes me to think that, if anything, it might be a little on the high side But it's probably about right On the inflation issue, I do share the concern that has been expressed by the staff, particularly in the Greenbook, about the rise in inflationary trends I'm especially worried about that if it should translate into wage pressures next year  Our Eleventh District economy would be characterized as being flat and stable at a pretty low level, certainly for us If the US economy can maintain the 2-1/2 to 3 percent growth, I think that we have some possibilities or potential for our District A few of the sectors that have been performing poorly have begun to show a little sign of improvement Of course, what's happening to energy prices has caused a bit of encouragement, although to get a great amount of recovery there I think prices of oil are going to have to go higher In agriculture, we think the financial strains are not quite as great as they were; certainly, the livestock prices and cotton look pretty good We do think that we're probably seeing now the bottom of the decline in land prices, both in ranching and agriculture In manufacturing, we're seeing some signs of general improvement with defense and electronics leading the way there In real estate, I think we're seeing a little change in psychology as opposed to any real change in substance Most people involved in real estate are saying that by year-end we will see rental prices and rental rates starting to move back up and some improvement in the price of land We had a very real psychological impact with JC Penney moving out of New York to Dallas For some reason, that seems to have convinced everybody in the metroplex that our worries are over now I think there has been a bit too much euphoria regarding the interest of companies in moving to Houston and Dallas because of attractive real estate properties and other incentives that are there Of course, we have had the sharp drop off in construction; we're feeling that  -12-    5/19/87  Banking conditions continue to deteriorate We're leading, certainly, in bank closings In Texas so far there have been about 27 and we're looking for maybe 3 or 4 this week We don't see very much slowdown on that, although our new branching law in Texas has certainly made it much easier to find potential buyers and resolve these problems On the whole, we don't have a lot of cause for optimism, but certainly, we think the economic conditions are no longer deteriorating in our part of the world   I would agree with what Bob Parry just said and I really can't add very much to it Alternative C does look like the best alternative to me A lot of reference has been made to inflation and that it is probably not real; but there is some expectation there and it seems to me that what we really need to move against is the expectation That was what was probably so hard to wring out the last go-round So, I would go to alternative C Likewise, I would probably favor an increase in the borrowing assumption from $400 million to $600 million versus a discount rate change right now   Yes Primarily with what is going on that we just want to--   But we didn't start out there; we actually started out with $300 million, leaning in favor of moving that up depending on what happened to the dollar   I think I would because I think it would make a difference Not knowing what the Board will do on the discount rate, I would go for the $600 million borrowing assumption If I knew the rate was going to change, I would go for the $400 million   I think the comment on the discount rate should be there for those of us who don't get to vote on that--that at least we have it in mind as a possibility   I am arguing yes   There is the further question If we go with the $500 million and then the discount rate change doesn't happen, when do we go on to $600 million?   That is what I am trying to get at At least as I see it, some confirmation of additional tightness is desirable-- whether it is through open market operations or the discount rate I'd argue for going through open market operations right now, particularly given whatever is going on today That seems to me to be the way to start out today It may be a little different tomorrow    Yes My comments can be brief, Mr Chairman, primarily because for all practical purposes we're right where the staff forecast is--for 1988 at least We're slightly less optimistic for the remainder of this year; rather than the 3 percent, we see something more like 2-1/2 percent We question whether there's quite that much strength there We do see a little price pressure for next year--not anything particularly great, but slightly higher prices On balance, we pretty much agree with the staff forecast that was just given   Mr Chairman, I would not change the ranges here at midyear; most of the reasons have been given One other thing does occur to me it seems that if we did, say, want to go to alternative II, it would limit us somewhat as to what we were going to do for 1988 If we do the midyear correction, the change would imply some precision; I would rather wait and make that judgment In the final analysis, looking out to 1988 and given my view of the economy for the second half of this year, I would not want to do anything that would give a signal that would imply possibly higher interest rates So I would leave it alone   Alternative II is where I would be I have a preference for going down the half point, although I am not totally hung up on it I could go with a point, but my preference would be the half point   I agree   I think we need it because we address it for 1987 and now we're talking about 1988   Yes    Mr Chairman, our forecast also is pretty much in agreement with the staff forecast We have strengthened our outlook for the national economy for the rest of this year and going  -14-    8/18/87  into next year We think we do have a rate of expansion that is sustainable Subjectively, it is a little hard for me really to believe all that, given what has been going on in our particular part of the country While we are seeing a little improvement, we certainly are lagging the rest of the country Both anecdotally and statistically, we can kind of show that we are working through the trough; but the recovery, to the extent that there is one, is so fragile that it would not take very much to have us continue the downturn that we've been in for the last couple of years Reference has been made to energy We have seen a little improvement there, certainly, in terms of perceptions There has been a little improvement in construction, but it's not in building; it's in roads, public construction, that sort of thing Manufacturing looks pretty good In agriculture, we are continuing to see cropland values decline and we are not through yet; of course, we came into this a year or two after the Midwest, in particular And, of course, everybody reads about the conditions of the financial institutions One concern that we are hearing, primarily from people in mid-sized and small businesses, is that they're very concerned that they're not going to get credit And without credit, they're not going to be able to grow and expand and create jobs This is something that we're hearing more and more The banks are not willing or able to lend, and a cutoff of credit has occurred; and they don't see very much end to it   That's a lot of it, Jerry The bankers say that there just is not any loan demand The small and mid-sized businessmen say we have the demand but banks won't take the risk So, I think it's probably somewhere in between--the banks are not seeing the kind of demand in the loans that they are willing to make   Mr Chairman, I would favor alternative B I would favor basically no change from current policy, and I say that because I guess I am not totally convinced that the economy is going to be quite as strong as perhaps some others believe I question that inflation is a problem at this point Granted, when you determine or realize it is a problem, you are pretty far down the road, so that a certain amount of anticipation is desirable But, given the fact that the interval between this meeting and the September meeting is pretty short compared to some of the intervals, and that the need for a policy shift is less than convincing--to me, at least--I would stick with alternative B, the $500 million borrowing assumption Rather than being symmetrical, though, I would have a sentence in there that would allow a little tightening by the Desk, if that should become necessary    Mr Chairman, I guess it's somebody's turn to say something not quite as positive as we have been hearing I guess it falls to my lot, being from the Eleventh District I would characterize our economy in the Eleventh District as still somewhat sluggish and a little fragile, although there have been tentative signs of improvement Businesses around the District that serve a national or international market all seem to be saying that they are seeing some improvement These would be primarily in electronics, livestock, chemicals, and defense There is a little more optimism there The businesses that serve their own local area or region,  -22-    9/22/87  though, say that their business remains flat; they really have not seen any signs of improvement Obviously, there is a correlation in attitudes and sentiment related to oil prices, since oil is so important in our region With the improvement there, and with the increase in the oil rig count and additional activity going on, there is more optimism There is a little more activity in related businesses; all but construction-related manufacturing are growing Agriculture is stabilizing, and cotton and livestock farming are doing fairly well Our retail sales remain fairly flat We continue to worry somewhat about the condition of our financial institutions Pick up a newspaper and you'll still find reports of foreclosures and bankruptcies continuing Last week in Austin, which was really the bright spot for the last several years in Texas, there was the posting of a foreclosure of a fairly major hotel-office complex that was pretty new There were foreclosure postings in Houston, also, of two or three fairly well known good projects This doesn't mean the foreclosures will actually occur; the postings could be part of a renegotiation Nevertheless, it is upsetting We saw a report last week that Dallas had lost 40,000 jobs over the last year That seems awfully high to me, but those are the kinds of reports we are hearing Though we hope that we are on a comeback trail--and, if oil prices hold, I think we will be--I don't think we have seen the bottom of our commercial real estate problem I think we probably are going to be worrying about that for at least two years, possibly three, before we can work through that  On the national picture, and possibly I'm somewhat influenced by our own Eleventh District, we would come out--looking out through the rest of this year to 1988--a little below where the Greenbook is this time Although we moved our own forecast up slightly, we didn't come as far as the Board staff has in the Greenbook On the long-term rate, I don't know that I have any particularly useful insight into that except that the evident concern about inflation does not seem to be quite as deep among the people I've talked to; certainly, in our District, there is not really [unintelligible] to the problem   That's my policy prescription four square    Mr Chairman, uncertainty certainly prevails down my way In looking at what might be appropriate for forecasting, we really would not have much basis for argument [with the staff forecast], but in our own forecast we have come down a full point; that is very judgmental, obviously As far as the effect on our District economy, our initial reaction is that probably whatever the effect, it is likely to be a little less in the Eleventh District than in the rest of the country, simply because we are so much farther behind the rest of the country We have seen signs of sluggish growth in the District We think the situation continues to be extremely fragile The real estate problems keep coming up and are a pervasive cloud in the psychology The earnings reports that we have just gone through with our financial institutions, and the added provision for loan losses--most of it triggered by real estate--just put another damper on that The cautious optimism that I tried to express for a couple of meetings seems to have abated somewhat I'm not sure we can even be cautiously optimistic right now   Mr Chairman, I'm right along with everyone else I favor the 6-3/4 percent funds rate, which I guess I would have described as "A-" or "B+" going in [to this discussion], but your description of "B" puts me there, so I don't have any problem with that On the borrowing number I was thinking $300 million, but I guess that becomes whatever it becomes, given the funds rate that we're looking for On the language, I favor Variant I; I think saying as well as we can what is going on is important Of course, that won't be released for about six weeks and that's a while down the road If any misinterpretation seems to be going on in the markets as to what we are doing, maybe another statement such as the one released earlier would be called for I thought that was very, very appropriate I like things even on both sides as a rule, so symmetric language always appeals to me    That's also what we hear   I agree that the longer we wait, the more difficult it is I agree with going to alternative (3), which I would interpret as a gradual move back, but certainly one with enough latitude to back off if we're not getting the right reaction With respect to how to do it, I don't know that we can be this precise--and maybe this is an oversimplification--but I would say go for alternative (3) but postpone it until after year-end I would stay where we are for the next couple of weeks, or certainly through the year-end, and then start the gradual move At that point, there would be enough flexibility that we could back off if we're not getting the reactions in the market that we're anticipating   It's one situation where we go out once a year and advertise come on in and see if you can qualify   Also, we don't have very many takers on seasonal   Mr Chairman, as far as the national economy, we certainly agree with Mike Prell's presentation In our District, we're seeing some slight improvement, we think Of course, with what little improvement we do see, we're growing at a slower pace than other parts of the country There is considerable improvement in manufacturing employment; in fact, we're keeping pace with the national statistics in that regard We don't see the possible $2 or $3 drop in the price of oil doing a great amount of damage to our District in terms of oil exploration, primarily because most of the planning has been done assuming an oil price of about $15 However, there are implications other than just for exploration in terms of revenues to the state and subsidiary effects that could go along with that The peso reevaluation is probably a somewhat neutral [event] because we've had diversification along the border, with not so much reliance just on the retail side While that does affect retail sales [negatively], it improves the myceladora, the twin plant concept So that turns out to be somewhat of a wash We feel pretty good about agriculture; it has been considerably better this year Energy, so far at least, has held its own Construction, we think, is leveling out Granted, energy is at the bottom and nothing is going on, but no further deterioration is indicated Manufacturing plus services are remaining fairly even, although we may see more improvement in services than we are forecasting So, while it's not a really bright picture, I do think and hope that, aside from the situation of our financial institutions, we are at the bottom and that there is improvement coming along  -52-    12/15-16/87   I would go with option (3) and begin the movement when it seems appropriate I'd go with alternative "B" and probably a $300 million borrowing assumption I would assume that it could be adjusted up the same way it was adjusted down in the interim between our meetings And I would have symmetric language   About where it is now    Mr Chairman, I think the Eleventh District, in many ways mirrors the national economy, although the plane that we are on is lower than the plane where the national economy is now We have had a little improvement, although I think that our uncertainty remains, and if anything, may be increasing a little Our employment gains continue at slightly less than the national rate Our construction sector remains the weakest sector and that's really no surprise Just as an example for the whole state of Texas in  -18-    2/9-10/88  December, we had permits issued for 100 apartment units, which is pretty much next to nothing   However, our manufacturing continues to show signs of improvement, and that's mostly related to the lower dollar, of course Construction-related and energy-related manufacturing are exceptions We think our principal vulnerability is to national recession more so than to the possibility of lower energy prices Anecdotally, with regard to perceptions and attitudes--which I think do get to be important, certainly at the margin--in terms of how you're going to [unintelligible] concerned with the condition of our financial institutions, which remains somewhat of a drag I've had two or three business people visit with me from our small business advisory group, and they are concerned because they don't feel that our financial institutions are in a position to meet their credit needs This is a drag in terms of the credit that they need to move along I think in many ways our business people are more optimistic, but the timidity of the financial people to make loans is a real concern And then the question is What do we do about it? You talk to the bankers and, of course, they will tell you that there aren't any good loans out there There is just not any loan demand  The Southwest plan that we've been reading about--that the Federal Home Loan Bank has to try to do something with savings and loans that are in trouble, a large portion being in Texas--I think is being greeted with mixed views I guess we are coming to the point, or at least I am in my own thinking, [that I'd like to see] any plan as long as something would happen as opposed to just talking about it Now, in talking with savings and loan people and with other investors who have proposals pending to try to become involved in this, they say it's extremely difficult to get anything to happen The fact is that they think there seems to be a pretty heavy overlay of politics when it gets to the Washington level, with respect to getting some of this restructuring done But I think sooner is much better than later There is a mixed view on whether, if we get a restructuring plan working, it will reduce the effects of the premiums that it costs to fund, which is not only hurting the savings and loans, but certainly also the banks I think hopefully it will help; it certainly will not hurt Real estate, which I've reported on, we read about But in visiting with a chairman of savings and loan association, his judgment is that there is at least $100 billion of really troubled real estate in Texas, if you really face up to it Now that's one person's [view]   Even in Texas And it's a lot bigger than it used to be  SPEAKER(?) That's book value, right?   A lot of it And I don't know whether I said this a while ago or not, if I did forgive me--but this same individual told me that his institution owns 10,000 apartments and they just reassessed their loan portfolio and they're getting ready to own another 10,000 You know, that says--  SPEAKER(?) But who put those 100 building permits in?   Well, Mr Chairman my speech was just made basically by Roger and others I would favor alternative II--not the substance but the appearance of it--and hope we make the best translation from the substance It does reflect a march down--maybe not at the pace some would argue for--but it's a half a point less than what we had for 1987, and it's consistent with our direction in reducing the ranges, at least If you go to alternative III, as Tom Melzer said, I wonder if that's not a bit of a conflicting signal versus what we generally are perceived to be doing, which might lead to some confusion Alternative II permits us, I think, to do whatever it is that we need to do And it would reflect, to me at least, a continuing commitment to guarding against inflation So, I would stay just where we put it tentatively I would not rebase either   Don, as I read the write-up, alternative A would accommodate a discount rate reduction My question is, technically, would alternative B accommodate a discount rate reduction?   Mr Chairman, for the short term, I favor alternative B, and the $250 million borrowing assumption, with the understanding that it would be interpreted as Don explained In the longer term, my preference would be to remain with alternative II as specified--that is, 5 to 8 percent on M2 I could accept 4 to 8 percent if that's where the majority was It does seem to me that maintaining the 8 percent on the top side still represents a downward move of a half a point [from the range for 1987], which indicates that we continue to be concerned about inflation If you throw in another half a point on top--which, in effect, would knock a full point off-- that might be, in my judgment, a little overkill in showing our determination    Mr Chairman, I'm not a proponent for changing anything we're doing I'm satisfied with where we are and, therefore, I really have nothing to contribute to this discussion I assume that nothing's going to change; and if that's so, I'll be satisfied  SPEAKER(?) Except the discount rate   Mr Chairman, on the national economy, we would line up pretty well with the Greenbook forecast We've felt for the last several months that on the national level we [unintelligible] fairly good performance Looking at the District level, and I guess more particularly at Texas, about the only bright spot that we can find is in manufacturing, where we are seeing improvement We're having employment in the manufacturing area as great as, if not greater than, other parts of the country; and of course, the services industries related to that are doing well Having said that, I've said about all of the good that I can The overall unemployment rate in Texas, for example, is well over 8 percent, which is considerably above the national rate Agriculture did have a good year; it is hoped that it will have another one I think drought conditions might be developing and are causing us to wonder slightly about that  Obviously, one of the major things going on down our way is the bank and financial conditions, which I understand we will get into  -44-    3/29/88  later in some detail But it's a very, very heavy overhang in terms of attitudes and willingness to take on new ventures There's certainly concern over the ability to obtain financing from financial institutions in the local area The real estate situation obviously has contributed very significantly to these problems and there is no short-term solution to that It's going to be more long-term, as opposed to immediate, as far as what's going to be happening in Texas I think it's going to be a very close race between the ability of our local financial institutions and businesses to improve their balance sheets and get a little sounder footing and the onset of a downturn in the national economy at some point If we do encounter such a downturn before we are able to position ourselves a little better, we are going to have even bigger problems than we already have    I agree with the position that has been stated by you, Mr Chairman, and others I'm a "B-", "C+", however you characterize it, with the $100 million increase in borrowing I guess I would be inclined to move sooner rather than later on the $100 million If I had the real courage of my convictions, as Lee Hoskins does, I would really like to line up with him I guess I just don't have that much courage, given the situation I have down there in the Southwest But, I think he makes a very, very good point that policy, and what it is that we can do, has to be viewed in the longer run And I think when we temporize and rationalize some of the short-run problems we think would result from taking actions, that's not really communicated and tends to compound the problems over the longer range    Mr Chairman, in the Eleventh District, not a great deal has changed I think I reported that we had some improvement in the Eleventh District economic picture over the last half of last year It seems to have flattened out over the last several months--at least that's what our statistics are saying It's a little confusing, though, because in talking with business people around the District I'm probably hearing more optimism, other than in banking and real estate, than I've heard in the last couple of years I think expectations are pretty [unintelligible] in the Houston area, and there the expectations, as well as the statistics, are becoming more consistent than throughout the rest of the District  Looking at the District and trying to project ahead, we think possibly we are poised to resume some upward movement Our portions of New Mexico and Louisiana are both showing some growth, but I think for the states as a whole, most of that growth really is in Roger Guffey's and Bob Forrestal's parts of those states Manufacturing has leveled off and that's where we were getting most of our improvement last year and fairly early this year That seems to have peaked a bit Energy has been stable We've seen considerable job loss in retail trade and financial services; and, of course, construction remains our weakest sector  We're having a little negative impact from the drought, but it's not anything compared to what's happening in other parts of the country We have some dry spots, although judging from reports earlier this week the dry spots in our District have all had pretty good rains; and those that have had pretty good rains were missing them, so it's kind of evening out The drought, though, is pretty much of a regular feature down our way and our people know how to handle it and prepare for it and expect it--so maybe we're not quite as exposed  I did meet with a group of investment bankers and nonbank lenders last week and they confirmed what we've been hearing otherwise, and what the statistics have been showing--that there's really little or no new lending to the small and medium sized  -20-    6/29-30/88  businesses And we think that this capital shortage is likely to be an impediment to the continuation of even the weak recovery So, that is a matter of concern  On the wages, I really have no insight into that, Mr Chairman In fact, it's not something that I'm hearing discussed too much down our way Job security and hopefully trying to get a little more job growth are what we're hearing about, as opposed to conversation about pressures or moving wages On the national picture, we're pretty close to where the Board staff is on that   I'd stay where we are for '88, alternative III for '89   I would go with your prescription    Mr Chairman, this is Bob Boykin in Dallas I would be inclined to go ahead and make a move right now Without looking strictly at the perception side of it--that has been discussed a little--it seems to me that with the market [unintelligible] and with our establishment of considerable credibility about our willingness to guard against inflation, the fact that a move would play into the market's expectations would probably be a positive right now And I think it would have less of an effect on the dollar than if we had to do something a little more stringent or significant two or three weeks from now    Well, Mr Chairman, I'll start with the Eleventh District and get the less-than-good news out of the way early I would say that the perception of what's happening in the Texas economy, and the Eleventh District generally, is improving somewhat I think we are beginning to see some evidence showing through in the statistics We did have growth in our District in the last half of last year that had kind of plateaued or stalled out during the first half of this year But now we do think that we are seeing some renewed or resumed growth in the District and this is reflected in the employment numbers and that is primarily centered in Texas  Those categories where we are not seeing much improvement, of course, remain in the construction side of it, finance, and insurance We do have our real estate remaining weak We've had fairly good rains in our District, although somewhat spotty, but the feeling is that the rains have ameliorated the drought effects The information that we are getting from our bankers around the District is that they don't see a major threat to timely repayment of agricultural loans in the District  We are somewhat nervous, I guess, about oil prices If we do get a decline there, that obviously will be a negative However, there has been so much adjustment to lower oil prices that it would not have the same effect as earlier declines had Given the fact that our economy seems to be so much more closely linked to the national  -13-    8/16/88  economy, and given the fairly good forecast for the national economy, we feel that that will continue to be a pull for us and will be positive  Attitudinally, as far as the financial situation is concerned, I think there is a great deal of relief with the approach to the resolution of the First Republic situation, and that has received very good press, has been very well received Now the remaining speculation is whether the last big one will have to have some kind of relief   Mr Chairman, I also would go with "B", a $600 million borrowing assumption, and the asymmetric language because I do think the next move will have to be up As for the placement of the aggregates, I'm rather ambivalent on that at the present time Having tightened the position, which would lean towards moving to a little more restriction, I must confess I have a little discomfort I share many of the concerns that Governor LaWare pointed out Given the situation that we have in the Southwest, and having I guess the bulk of the thrift problem centered down there as well as other things, I'm a little uncomfortable as rates move up--as credit becomes a little more restrictive--about what the full implications are going to be I think it's going to make it fairly difficult for us However, since there can only be one monetary policy and it has to be a national policy, I fully support the direction of what we are doing    Mr Chairman, I'll lead off As far as the Eleventh District economy is concerned, we're looking at what's happening or might happen in energy--which over the past year or so is showing a little bit of improvement and turning into more of a neutral factor for us As far as the outlook for the economy generally, the overall mood of the people that we've talked to very recently has been  -10-    9/20/88  a little more positive, although it's difficult for them--or for us-- to point to specifics that show that something's happening  If we do get a sustained price for oil in the $14 range, that would probably indicate that we have no growth at all in our District economy, whereas we currently have a forecast of sluggish growth of something around 1 percent or less for next year We are getting reports of substantial capital investments that are planned or that are under way in petrochemicals, particularly in Houston--the upper Gulf Coast area And they are, of course, benefiting from the lower price of oil  We were fortunate over the last several days to have missed some of the rather devastating effects of Hurricane Gilbert Although there were tornadoes and there was some damage, it wasn't anything close to what had been anticipated The real estate area continues, of course, to be the biggest drag that we have And I do have a real- -as opposed to an anecdotal--comment on that About five years ago, we had our bank property appraised in connection with a study that we were doing The appraiser came up with a value in excess of $30 million, which a couple of our directors--particularly our then- Chairman who was in the real estate business--felt was low We've just had our property reappraised in connection with another study we're doing The same professional independent appraiser group did it this time They're telling us that our property now is worth between $6-1/2 and $8-1/2 million You know, that's something else   Well, there are special factors The key--and this is not the place to make this statement--but I'll make it anyway What they're saying is our building is totally used up in terms of its usefulness   But I thought that was very, very significant Granted, we have special circumstances; nevertheless I have a better appreciation of what the commercial banks have been having to deal with as they get new appraisals and reappraisals And I don't believe anybody knows what real estate is worth any more   That's all I have   I would just express agreement    In the Eleventh District, Mr Chairman, things are pretty much as they were in September We are continuing to see some modest growth Manufacturing is leading the improvement that we have The unemployment rates in our three states have been moving downward but only Texas is making any progress compared to the national rate in closing the gap In Texas we've got unemployment of 68 percent; in New Mexico it's 8-1/2 percent; in Louisiana it's 10 percent The lower oil prices are a real source of concern and could undermine the modest recovery that we've been experiencing I think further declines would probably cause us to look for zero growth in    11/1/88  1989 compared with the 1-1/2 percent or so rate of growth that we've been forecasting over the last several months Other sources of concern for us include a noticeable slowdown of orders in the electronics industry And there continue to be a few pockets on the foreign side and [some] that tend to be drought-related Of course, we continue to worry about and try to deal with the financial situa- tion in our District, both on the thrift side and the banking side   I would agree with your policy prescription, Mr Chairman    Could I?   One thing back on the price of oil and the way it's figuring in, you were saying that you are now looking at a $2 to $250 increase in the price of a barrel At a recent meeting, I guess it was October, we were looking for a decline and it seemed that energy was a fairly significant factor in the inflation outlook--that is, a better outlook for inflation And now that has kind of come back around to where we've been running $15+ a barrel As I understand what was said, it doesn't seem to have the same adverse effect on inflation on the upside Am I misunderstanding something here?    12/13-14/88   Mr Chairman, in the Eleventh District I think we are beginning to see a two-tier economy emerging I think there is a little more optimism than we've had in the past Those outside of the real estate construction and banking sectors are participating in a reasonably strong recovery now Of course, energy is a swing factor, and the apparent stabilization of energy prices--or at least the lesser likelihood of a precipitous decline--bodes well for our part of the country, although from the inflation side people might wonder a little This dichotomy kind of shows up in manufacturing, where industries related to foreign trade are doing well, while activities related to energy and construction are not doing all that well Also, on the agricultural side, livestock producers are going to be squeezed somewhat because of the higher drought-related feed costs, yet the farmers with cash crops are doing pretty well We think that employment growth in our three District states has been about 1-1/2 percent over the last year which is considerably better than the declines that we had in 1986 and 1987 Perceptionwise, anecdotally, and attitudinally, things really are improving As I've  -38-    12/13-14/88  reported earlier, in Houston the improved attitude started I'd say 6 or 7 months ago It's beginning to filter up from the coast to the Dallas area We've had some fairly visible announcements made such as GTE relocating their telephone operations into the Dallas area out of Connecticut They are talking 4,000 to 5,000 jobs and about 1,000,000 square feet of office space; they are going to build a big campus- style facility A Japanese firm just made an announcement that they are going to build a manufacturing plant They are talking about 1500 jobs in telecommunications manufacturing out there north of Dallas Of course, the announcement on the super collider just thrilled everybody It probably will never happen and won't get funded, but everybody is really happy about it   Everybody that counts   That's the way a lot things can go out our way Also, there's quite a bit of optimism given what appears to be a fairly significant Texas influence coming into the Washington arena with a new Administration   Yes, I'm not sure that's going to mean a whole lot, but it's being talked about as good for Texas maybe On the national side,  SPEAKER(?) You're supposed to be quiet about that, Bob   Okay, tell all the secrets, right?   On the national side, we are pretty much in agreement on the staff forecast I think there is obviously a chance that the economy will be even stronger than the forecast We are a little more pessimistic on the inflation side That being the case, I would be inclined for the reasons that have already been expressed to put in a little more restraint, and I'd be inclined to do it sooner rather than later   Mr Chairman, my position would be to move on the discount rate I think that would be the much preferable way to  -61-    12/13-14/88  go If the Board doesn't see it that way, then certainly alternative "C" And I'd move pretty fast on the borrowing    Well, Mr Chairman, in the Eleventh District I think you have to look at the Louisiana portion by itself because it does seem that Louisiana is continuing to deteriorate, with the unemployment rate there rising to about 104 percent in December If you shift over to Texas and our part of New Mexico you continue to see some improvement; it's modest and slower than the rest of the nation, but at least it's going in the right direction On a sectoral basis the split is equally pronounced, with the energy and construction industries still pretty weak and manufacturing and services continuing to improve The energy industry is performing as though the expected price of oil is in the $15 to $16 range rather than the $17 to $19 trading range that we've seen over the last 8 weeks or so The downturn in our construction activity now seems to be centered on the nonresidential construction As for agriculture, there is some mention of concern about drought I guess we did not suffer quite as much last year but we are beginning to have a little concern Our winter wheat is already hurt and we're hearing fairly pessimistic reports from out in the farm areas Overall, manufacturing continues to improve In the first three quarters of last year, most of the gains were centered on the more trade sensitive industries; we've now seen that the less trade sensitive product lines are improving Retail sales have been improving in both autos and other goods Overall, we're looking for some strengthening of the regional economy in 1989 relative to 1988 So, that does make us feel a little better  On the national scene, about the only place we really have any difference with what Mike was saying is on inflation We feel there certainly is a little more inflationary pressure now and in prospect than the staff is seeing   Mr Chairman, has the date of the testimony been set yet?   Mr Chairman, my preference would be for alternative "II," primarily for the reason that we feel we would be at the lower part of the [alternative "I"] range If we really believe that, it seems to me we ought to establish a range that gets a little more centered Also, my impression is that there has been less difficulty in explaining overruns than underruns And, at least the way I look at the long-run strategies--if you look at what happens to inflation and if there is a relationship between money growth and inflation--then it seems to me we aren't really doing very much over the next three years or so where inflation is concerned The comment was that the rhetoric has been good because [unintelligible] and look at what we do as opposed to what we say It seems to me that if we also confirm what we say with what we actually do, then that enhances our credibility Keeping inflation at the current levels, or even at projected levels as we're looking at it through 1991, seems to me almost to create the impression that we're accepting that as the norm And I have problems with that So my preference would be to go to alternative "II"   It seems to me that if we do that, which I would favor, then on page 20 that very first sentence should say "The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability"--we say "over time" Why don't we strike "over time"? Our objective is to foster price stability And then with what Governor Angell is suggesting that confirms it because here we are setting our objectives As for that "over time" we've been at it a long time  SPEAKER(?) Time is running out!   Really, we prefer--   Well, Mr Chairman, I find myself in the usual dilemma when it comes to this point, given where I live all the time except for a couple of days every seven or eight weeks here in Washington It's hard for me to rationalize being a little more restrictive or a little tighter, given the risks of what that might do to the Southwest since it seems that most of the problems have been and are still pretty much centered down there The arguments, I think, have been well stated on both sides of the issue Intuitively, I would be in favor of moving toward "C" now I'm not so confident of that, though, that a two or three weeks' delay to get us a little better reading on what's going on is that important But I remain concerned, as I indicated earlier in the meeting, about the level of inflation and what appears to me to be a fairly timid approach to reducing that in a fairly significant way I just think it's too high But I would be supportive of the proposition that you put out    Well, Mr Chairman, I really don't have any questions or any real disagreement with the staff forecast  Looking at the District, our recent performance and the near- term prospects for our economy continue to improve Over the last year and a half the gains in the Dallas District have been concentrated primarily in manufacturing services More recently, we've seen some gain from the energy sector The contraction in construction seems to be nearing the bottom Agriculture remains a bit of a concern, primarily because of the uncertainty of the drought situation As I've reiterated over the last six months, most of my contacts outside the banking and real estate industries have been sounding increasingly optimistic I had a group of investment merchant bankers in for a breakfast meeting last week and most of them agreed that the Texas economy and even that of Louisiana, which has been one of the weakest states, are beginning to demonstrate increasing strength In fact, a few who represent very large companies with considerable capital from both national and international sources are beginning to look upon the region as a ripe opportunity because of the reduced competition coming from the banking sector On the whole the regional economy is improving but growing slower than the nation Banking, real estate, and now agriculture are the exceptions to this pattern Within the District no one is noting price or wage pressures but there have been a few signs over the last two or three months of some shortages of engineers, first in Houston and now in Dallas Overall, I think we're feeling a little more optimistic down our way than we have for quite some time   I would favor alternative B as you suggested And I would strongly favor asymmetric language I would do that because I think projections are extremely important right now I'm not sure that we will know by the time of the next meeting whether we are in the pause or whether we're heading a little differently And when this policy record becomes public, following the next meeting, I think it could lead to some confusion in terms of our commitment to having inflation in the forefront of our thinking I think it could send the wrong signal    Mr Chairman, in the Eleventh District our economy continues to grow Even in Louisiana, where for the first time in quite some time the unemployment rate has slipped down to    5/16/89  single digits, it's looking a little better Growth is getting increasingly closer to the national rate; part of that, of course, is some of the slowing of the US rate We are seeing more and more signs that we are looking more like other Federal Reserve Districts; we're not quite the outlier that we were Labor shortages of specific types are cropping up Engineers, for example, are in very short supply We're even seeing help wanted signs appearing throughout Dallas Unemployment rates in many Texas cities are now in the low 5 percent area Nonetheless, the greatest strain still is centered along the Gulf Coast area--Houston in particular--and in the lower Rio Grande Valley We still have problems in some of the other areas of the District Banking and real estate are still dragging us down a little in Dallas, Austin, Shreveport and similar areas Manufacturing continues to grow above the national rate And in the services sector employment was matching the national growth In sum, Mr Chairman, we feel a little more optimistic about our area Having been burned as badly as we were, we don't want to overstate that We are coming from a fairly low figure but people really are feeling better   We're familiar with that term   Mr Chairman, I would agree with "B" and the $600 million My preference really would be to remain asymmetric or "as-symmetric," as Mr Syron says The [weak] money growth is troublesome; but the forecast is for some rebound and if that holds true, that's fine But it seems to me that more or less what I'm hearing is the commitment for a conference call before the next meeting, which gives the opportunity to make any slight adjustment if that's wrong But I would still lean toward "B," asymmetric    Mr Chairman, the Eleventh District economy continues to show modest improvement overall Much as Roger indicated for the Tenth District, we do have to keep in mind that we were coming off a very low growth base of economic activity Even though we are getting modest improvement we continue to show weakness in construction activity, and I guess that would be expected for us Single-family housing is the only area of construction that does show some improvement While the energy sector has shown a little growth in the last few months in response to the higher oil prices, the gains are very small Drilling and related activity are still below the depressed levels of a year ago Recent rains have improved the agricultural outlook for this year in some parts of our District But nonetheless, we still expect farm income to be a little below last year's We are seeing continuing gains in the manufacturing sector, with nondurable goods showing the greatest strength The outlook in our area is at best guardedly optimistic as cuts in defense spending, slowing in overall demand nationally, and an inability to expand output in chemicals, petro-chemicals and paper all combine to restrain [the prospects for] growth in coming months Orders growth has been slowing in several industries Retail sales, including autos, continue to show year-over-year gains down our way And Houston continues to be kind of the shining example for us, which is a considerable change over a couple of years ago Price and wage pressures remain well below the national average in that regard I am glad to report on the financial side that in the first quarter our District banks just about broke even for the first time in over two years Nonperforming [loans] and charge-offs continue to move in the right direction; but part of this is a statistical illusion as many of the loans in recapitalized banks are put back to the FDIC All in all, we think the banking sector is still several quarters away from  -23-    7/5-6/89  supporting business expansion We haven't noticed or detected any real inventory problems in the District With respect to the national outlook, the Greenbook [forecast presents a reasonable picture of] what we're going to be facing   Mr Chairman, I would go with alternative III because if we don't do that I think there could almost be an implied reading that we're willing to accept inflation in the 4 to 5 percent range And I'm not sure that we want to leave that implication I think we all are having a bit of a sense of foreboding regarding what the economy is actually going to do But it's still a little anticipatory I think to reverse what we have set in place over time is probably going to be read as a little more significant than some of the others think If it becomes necessary early next year to make an adjustment and to move the ranges up, it seems to me that that would be done on the basis of knowledge in fact existing at that time, as opposed to tone and feel and a suspicion at this point And I could justify an upward move if circumstances, in fact, were there to dictate that   I would concur    Mr Chairman, our District economy continues to underperform the nation We are now estimating that we're doing about two-thirds as well; we had been doing about half as well This improvement, though, is primarily because of the slowdown in the growth at the national level; on a [regional] level we're doing about the same Geographically, the mix of growth seems to be a little different Texas now appears to be growing more slowly than either Louisiana or New Mexico Within Texas, Houston of course continues to be the bright spot Having been down there recently, listening to the anecdotal information coming out of Houston, the mood is totally different One large developer in home building said it was quite refreshing to worry about drainage ditches as opposed to other types of drainage In the District, manufacturing activity has remained our strongest sector; employment has been growing in that area while it has been declining nationally Textiles, apparel, plastics, rubber, and wood products have been doing particularly well Most durable goods products have been sluggish; electronic components have been particularly soft and transportation equipment is a bit of a concern from our standpoint Our GM plant in Arlington, Texas is going to be down for a while We wonder about the GM truck assembly plant over in Shreveport Bell Helicopter remains somewhat in doubt And of course with the B-2 bomber, General Dynamics as well as LTV have some concerns Construction remains the softest sector and is showing signs of bottoming out Agriculture has been hurt by moisture conditions; we either had too much or too little moisture I'd say all-in-all, our sluggish growth continues from a very low base And outside of Houston and a few border towns on the Rio Grande Valley there is little or no sense of optimism Of course, on the financial scene, we have had all of our major bank holding companies with their problems addressed in various fashions Something good always comes out of something bad; we've had an opportunity to widen our acquaintanceships considerably We've spent a lot of time meeting folks out of the Cleveland District and out of New York and out of Richmond and out of San Francisco   On the national economy, basically we wouldn't have a great deal of difference on the forecast If we would differ it is that for some reason we have a hard time being quite as    8/22/89  optimistic on the national picture Our guess would be that if we're going to err, it's probably that we are not going to get quite as strong a performance as projected Of course, the inflation side is still worrisome; indeed [we don't see a] significant improvement for the next year and a half on the inflation front   "B" and I would stay symmetric Although my opinion is that if there's any change it would be toward ease, I'm not so convinced of that that I would want to put it in the directive at this point    Mr Chairman, on the national picture our view would be pretty well along the lines of the Greenbook We would not find anything about which we would have serious disagreement As several others have pointed out, the forecast of inflation running through 1991 remains quite troublesome--certainly to me  Looking at our District, it's very difficult to come up with adjectives to characterize what is going on If I were an optimist I'd say we were having modest growth If I were a pessimist I'd say it has turned very sluggish Not knowing which I am, I'll try to describe a few of the elements Where we had had some strength in manufacturing, those gains are slowing The slowdown in electronics seems to be in line with expectations In petrochemicals, inventories have been building and prices have been soft, with a result that several plant expansions either have been delayed or canceled Retail sales have shown modest improvement with the exception of auto sales, which had been stronger and now are showing declines in many areas Two of our weakest sectors, energy and construction, have begun to show small gains; but residential construction continues weak as does agriculture--both cattle and crops The statistical data continue to show what I would say is modest growth We have had rather extensive discussions over the last couple of weeks with various businessmen and others in our District The attitude has changed, even in Houston Growth seems to have leveled off there as it has [in Southern Texas]; and they were two particularly strong areas The way that they are characterizing the situation is that they think our economy either has stalled or is shortly headed for a stall   That could be a factor!  SPEAKER(?) He's back   Well, a considerable difference--   I favor alternative B My preference also would be for symmetric language    Mr Chairman, in the Eleventh District there is not very much new to report I think it's fair to say that the expansion--what little we have had--has slowed Private nonfarm and farm [income] was basically unchanged between July and September The  -11-    11/14/89  Texas index of leading indicators has fallen for four consecutive months The declines have been moderate, suggesting continued weak growth rather than a recession The declines have been led by durable goods manufacturing; nondurable goods manufacturing is holding up a little better Services have been strong, with growth in business services especially strong The construction sector does appear to have bottomed out finally I guess the best words we are hearing are around the Houston and Gulf Coast area, although those words are not quite as good as we were hearing several months ago   Mr Chairman, I would agree with alternative B; I have a fairly strong preference for symmetric language Also, I agree with those who have already expressed the view that the inflation forecast that we have in the Greenbook doesn't show very much progress there Granted, we have risks on the down side of the economy; but on the other hand, I'm not sure that we've had the opportunity to see all of the effects flowing through of what we have done in terms of ease over the last few months I guess I'm hoping that that will keep us from slipping into recession But I think we would make a bad mistake if we really didn't keep inflation fairly high in importance    Mr Chairman, Wayne Angell and Lee Hoskins pretty well asked my question but I'd like to ask it slightly differently I'm looking at Exhibit 8 When you look at the four charts there you have the GNP deflator at zero in 1995; you have the unemployment rate in 1995 at 7 percent but the line is heading down; you have real GNP above potential growth; and you have interest rates coming down Using the assumptions that are behind this, it seems to me that if all of that would happen it would be a very favorable picture The question then, of course, is What happens after 1995? I know you haven't done that work But at this point do you know whether you would expect continued decreases in the rate of unemployment, continued growth of the GNP above the potential rate, and interest rates possibly coming down a little more if we could reach this point by 1995?   Well, I guess I would always assume, maybe erroneously, that of course we would make the right policy decisions And with the unemployment rate holding steady there for 3 or 4 years and the downward slope of that line, I wondered whether we could expect that to continue   Yes, but it's the right direction   On the first question, targeting a stable inflation level would bother me because that implies we can come up with a specific number and I don't think we have any historical basis for assuming that we could maintain that particular number It seems to me we would have more explaining to do using the zero inflation In my mind, at least, that implies the definition that's already been advanced as far as inflation not entering into the business decision It seems to me that we give the Committee a little more latitude by taking into account facts and circumstances as they are developing at any particular time In my mind we do not get a locked-in mentality; that might not be the appropriate thing to do So I would favor the concept of moving toward zero inflation with the understanding of what that really meant I also think that a timetable is important It's important to give us credibility and it's also important on the other side of it to give us a lack of credibility It seems to me that the idea Jerry was talking about--saying the mid-'90s or something like that--would put us in the position of being able to take into account what was actually going on without doing any serious damage But direction is important And, given the inflationary [bias] both in the economy and probably within the FOMC, at least on an historical basis, it appears that if we don't formulate good policies to try to get to where inflation is not a factor in making business decisions our decisions are going to lead us inadvertently toward more inflation   Well, just to put a little different light on this, I think we're probably selling the American public a little short I don't want to overplay this But having been through a depression recently in the Southwest that was more than just the very minimal, all through the very difficult period that we've been through I did not have one business person or anybody pick up the phone and call me and lay the problem at the feet of the Fed I think there's a little greater understanding out there of the imbalances and a recognition that fiscal policy-- Now, I don't want to minimize the political aspects of it and what a constituency is As far as the politicians themselves are concerned, I've spent my career running from them and I try not to talk to them; I don't really understand their mentality But in terms of the individuals who suffered through this, as devastating as it was, I've had people that have totally gone out of business not lay the blame at the feet of the Fed The only thought I'm trying to get across here, without minimizing the difficulties, is let's not beat up on ourselves too hard I think there's a little more understanding out there than I'm hearing expressed around here There are always risks, but given what we see as the objective, I'm not too sure that those risks, on a calculated basis, aren't worth taking   Mr Chairman, with respect to the national picture, we concur with the Greenbook projection for weaker economic growth combined with stubborn and [unintelligible] inflationary pressures  Looking at our District, the Eleventh District economy seems to have weakened in recent months, both in relation to its rate of growth earlier this year and in relation to the declining rate of the national economy Overall District growth is positive but [barely] perceptible Within the Dallas District, New Mexico has been growing faster than the nation; Texas has been growing at about half the national rate; and Louisiana has been declining absolutely What is interesting about the economic performance in the District is the almost complete reversal in the areas of strength and weakness in the  -73-    12/18-19/89  economy at the present time versus, say, a year or two ago Durable goods manufacturing is declining and that is the sector of our economy that led us into the modest recovery two years ago Nondurable manufacturing has been holding up quite well The chemicals and rubber products, plastics, and apparel all are showing employment gains between 2 and 3 percent The energy sector has been a stabilizing influence on the District economy The rig count and energy employment are both expected to contribute slightly to growth in the near future Construction, which has been declining absolutely for the past several years, has stabilized and even has shown a little growth over the past several months The strength in the construction figures has been dominated by the construction of new chemical plants, but there also has been some pickup in multifamily residential construction in a few markets where occupancy rates and rents are firm Overall, District agriculture is not doing very well; we're anticipating that farmers' net cash receipts will be about 20 percent below last year's level Growth in the services sector has slowed considerably outside of government jobs In short, the Dallas District economy has shown spreading signs of weakness recently and business confidence outside of the Houston area has reverted to the very low levels of two or three years ago   I would concur with your formulation, Mr Chairman One thing strikes me I don't know whether it will hang together or not but I almost have the sense, tactically speaking, that the modest move that is being recommended right now probably puts us in a better position to resist a stronger move later on, because at least we could show that we had been responsive If, in our judgment down the road, it really isn't the time to move, I think we're better positioned to resist that at that point   Okay    Mr Chairman, I'm in a bit of an unusual position of being more optimistic than the Greenbook concerning developments on the real side of the economy I see real growth this year coming in at 21 percent--I don't know what that means--and considerably more inflationary pressures I am very pessimistic about the inflation outlook  Our District economy has been improving recently--actually to a greater extent than I had anticipated We thought that the weakness in the national economy would depress growth in our District more than it has To our surprise this has not happened, which seems to show that there may be some underlying strength down our way Our employment gains have exceeded the national rate during the last few months for which data are available That may not be sustainable, although we do have some anecdotal evidence that suggests that the attitude in this regard has shown improvement In agriculture, we're still reeling from the freeze The lower Rio Grande Valley really has been devastated The citrus damage I think was greater than in Florida, although we do have some insurance that will help tide growers over and cover some of that damage The retail sector is not    2/6-7/90  robust but it has had a reasonably good year; there are year-over-year gains Our national retailers show much better gains in the District than in the rest of the nation Manufacturing is not doing very much We have a little concern about the anticipated layoffs in the defense- related areas Construction seems to be stabilizing and there is talk of the first signs of liquidity coming in We were told that some of the Houston improvements, certainly in real estate, probably have moved up our way We've been told that raw land is actually selling in the Dallas-Fort Worth area primarily for residential development The energy situation is pretty stable, with possibly some improvement there I'll sum it up by saying that in our District, at least, the overall outlook is improving I can't resist saying, in listening to my friend Dick Syron--   I remember several years ago I gave a very comparable report and my good friend Ed Boehne leaned across the table and said "Boykin, that's a Texas problem" So, maybe that's just a Northeast problem   Mr Chairman, I lean a little toward alternative III Governor Angell's comments appealed to me strictly in terms of the Humphrey-Hawkins testimony and a careful explanation that we really are not willing to settle for what we have and we're not losing sight of our objectives With that kind of assurance, then I can accept alternative II I also liked Governor Angell's point on debt that probably a little further reduction on the debt figure would be possible That had some appeal to me   I just wanted to ask about the wording in the directive In the first sentence in that wording we had price stability first In the last sentence in the directive we have price level stability last I would suggest that we move the progress toward price level stability up to the first item in that last sentence, for reasons of substance as well as consistency   I'm on page 24 This is on the 1990 ranges The first sentence says "The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability, promote growth" etc The last sentence on that page says "The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of movements in their velocities, developments in the economy and financial markets, and progress toward price level stability" I'm suggesting that we say "The behavior of the monetary aggregates will be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets"   Yes   Mr Chairman, I come out somewhere between "B" and "C," as a matter of fact, recognizing all of the concerns that have been expressed Financial fragility--we've experienced some of that; credit rationing--we've experienced some of that, and we're still there Granted, the players sure have changed   If our view is right--and obviously we're an outlier on the up side--that there's probably a little more strength in the economy than the consensus feeling, and given that we're not quite as optimistic on inflation as the staff is, it does place me somewhat in a dilemma If we wait until we get confirmation of which way it's going, obviously, it's always too late In trying to figure out what I would do in this kind of situation, I guess alternative "B," [is appropriate] But when we start talking about the directive--and this certainly would be somewhat of a nuance--I would be inclined to go asymmetric on the side of greater restraint    Well, Mr Chairman, the economy in the Dallas District continues to mend Slowly but surely economic conditions are showing mixed signs of improvement Finally, we even see Louisiana being able to reflect slightly better conditions However, with regard to the improvements that we're seeing, while they're pretty much across the board, the extent of the gains is highly variable Energy and construction continue to show modest improvement The rig count in Texas has shown some significant gains A lot of this is attributable to the horizontal drilling that's going on The manufacturing picture has been somewhat mixed On the construction side, while we have seen gains, they are possibly a little tenuous as construction values have fallen lately On the other hand, this appears to be a correction related to potential overexpansion in petro-chemical capacity down along the Gulf Coast The weakest sector of our economy is agriculture; that continues to be hurt by drought and other weather-related conditions On the so-called credit crunch issue, we also hear some anecdotal evidence; but it's not all that different from what we have heard for quite some time with respect to our small businesses And given where we've been in our District, we've been hearing this for quite some time On a little broader issue, if the rationing really is going on and it seems to be primarily related to real estate concerns, I would question whether a slight change in interest rates one way or the other really would address that particular problem  On the national picture, I feel pretty good about the staff's current forecast It seems a little more in line at least with what we've been thinking and we would not take issue with it I would associate myself with those who are expressing concern about the long- term prospects for inflation I think that maybe something ought to be done about that   Mr Chairman, I would lean somewhere between "B" and "C" but I'm certainly willing to accept the arguments of what the possible effects might be on foreign exchange rates That being the case, though, I would feel pretty strongly about going asymmetric on the directive Roger pretty well made that speech It does seem to me that it positions us, if later events call for an actual upward movement in the fed funds rate If that became necessary, we could move; or if that were delayed and had to come even after the next meeting it seems to me that that would tend to minimize a bit the surprise element that seems to be a matter of concern If later information indicates that the economy and other factors are not what  -42-    3/27/90  I at least anticipate--if policy doesn't actually change over the intermeeting period--the markets would be able to read that; and following the next meeting, if nothing happens, they could tell that pretty quickly So, I don't see any significant risk in going asymmetric, but I think there are a lot of good arguments for going that way   I don't think we have a luncheon    Mr Chairman, it's not too often that anecdotal and statistical information seem to be pointing in the same direction, but in our case for the first time in over two years they are beginning to match In contrast to previous reports that I've been giving, where District performance had been marked with some strong and some very weak sectors, there is now improvement and it's more broadly based District manufacturing continues to outperform the nation We had increases in manufacturing employment in the fourth quarter of 1989 and the first quarter of 1990 while it was declining nationally In wholesale and retail trade, District employment increased at about a 4-1/2 percent rate in the first quarter Employment in the services sector is still growing at a healthy rate, with particularly strong gains in the areas of finance, insurance, and real estate In the energy sector, all field activities continue to improve; as for the long-term outlook, there is considerable optimism for continued improvement District construction activity has been strong recently, though it's likely to slow some from its current pace of nearly 10 percent Recent rains have improved the outlook for agriculture except, of course, in those areas where we've had some very, very severe flooding, which I'm sure you've seen on the news  Our bottom line is that we do appear to be coming out of what we call our great recession in the District, and the improvement and growth seem to be widespread Also, I think it's becoming quite evident that our economy is much more diversified Having said that, I'm inclined to conclude that we may be getting away from the historical boom-bust type of activity that we've had There may be some disappointment for those who are waiting for the next boom, having gone through the bust But I'm inclined to think that for the longer term it's going to be a much more healthy situation economically  With respect to the national picture, we're in substantial agreement with the forecast that you have, Mike   Mr Chairman, I am obviously more uncertain today than I have been in the past couple of meetings I could support alternative "B" I would have a fairly strong preference for asymmetric language Your prescription of a narrative in the policy record reflecting inflation concerns and that sort of thing is okay, but if we're talking about credibility and sending some signals, that brings in a lot of nuances and subtleties it seems to me I think an asymmetric directive would give credibility to the verbiage that would be in the policy record and for that reason I think we would have some opportunity to strengthen at least the credibility [of our inflation effort]    Mr Chairman, on the national picture our view is not very different from the staff's forecast We see slightly more strength for the rest of the year and about the same for 1991 I don't quite share my friend Bob Black's and others' optimism on inflation I continue to remain a little pessimistic there  With respect to the District, the economic recovery continues but its strength seems to have diminished in the last two months At the May meeting I spoke about how, for the first time in three years, the recovery in the Eleventh District had time finally to spread across all sectors and all geographic regions in the District A    7/2-3/90  definite slowdown has occurred recently, probably in response to the slower growth nationally Our manufacturing industries are still out- performing the nation We actually have slow-to-modest employment growth, but the gains have been concentrated in chemicals and energy- related manufacturing Electronic equipment, apparel, paper and several other sectors that had held up manufacturing strength have slipped recently Defense contractors, of course, have been cutting back heavily In spite of lower energy prices, drilling activity has continued to increase significantly and all the leading indicators suggest that this should continue for several months to come Retail sales have softened and construction contracts have declined Most disturbing, however, is the noticeable slowdown in the service-related sectors This has been an area of persistently strong growth, but the most recent three-month period marks the weakest growth this group of industries has exhibited since a recovery began three years ago In spite of what I've been saying, for some strange reason business sentiment seems to have improved a little lately, perhaps because steady slow growth in a stable, predictable environment has finally come to be viewed as preferable to an uncertain stop-and-go environment Nonetheless, the talk of credit shortages--and I'm not just talking here about real estate nor just for the smallest firms-- is becoming more widespread down our way To keep [my report] balanced, I guess I should say that our directors are probably not quite as optimistic as I am   Well, Mr Chairman, I will have to confess that the arguments are very persuasive for leaving the ranges the way they are for 1990 or for changing them!   Being forced to have to take some [position] here, I would lean a little toward the alternative of reducing [the ranges for] 1990, although I don't know how to sort through how to explain that and how it would be read So, that's a slight but not a strong preference; I could certainly accept leaving the 1990 ranges the way they are Now, I do have a little more definite feeling on 1991 Of course, I agree with continuing to indicate our long-term commitment toward reducing inflation And I would favor 1991 ranges of 2 to 6 percent for M2, 0 to 4 percent for M3; and 4 to 8 percent for debt   Mr Chairman, I would favor alternative "B" Coming into the meeting I had felt that symmetric language would be preferable However, the explanation that you gave would cause me to accept asymmetric language But I do want to say that I agree with about 85 percent of what you said, Governor Angell I share a lot of sympathy for not letting go prematurely just as we're about there I don't know what the next week or week and a half is going to show, but I have a slight uneasiness in the sense that it's almost preordained that there's going to be a downward move shortly That may be necessary and it may be what's called for; I just can't read that But I would accept asymmetry    Mr Chairman, as seems to be the case for the nation as a whole, economic conditions in our region are showing signs of slowing There are special factors here and there that keep the overall growth numbers positive After fairly strong employment gains in the first quarter of the year, our three-state District would have experienced employment losses in the second quarter had it not been for a strong growth in government jobs Our manufacturing employment had been growing slightly while conditions nationally deteriorated In the last few months, however, manufacturing employment has declined in each of our three states Weakness has been concentrated in transportation equipment--mainly defense-related--apparel, and electrical equipment While employment gains were experienced in chemicals and petroleum refining, we expect some slowing in these industries with the higher price of energy-related input Employment in the services sector has been extremely weak outside of government employment The government employment gains were for all government entities and were not just related to federal census workers  -18-    8/21/90  In private services, the main areas of strength were in transportation and public utilities, both of which will be adversely impacted by higher energy prices The one area where higher energy prices should help the District economy is in drilling activity, but any positive response that does occur will be with a long lag time First, inflation-adjusted oil prices are only about half the peak level reached in 1981, and the rig count is highly correlated with real oil prices Second, almost half the drilling activity in the Dallas District is for natural gas which has a long way to go before gas prices catch up with oil prices Third, drillers have to be convinced that higher energy prices will persist for several years And lastly, even if everything on the price side fell in place--and as Bob Forrestal found out--we simply do not have the capacity to increase drilling activity since about half of that capacity exited the industry over the last four years I did see on local TV that they reinstituted a rough-neck school out in west Texas to teach people how to drill oil wells So, somebody has a little optimism In the short run, the negative effects of higher energy prices in the District will predominate over the positive effects I might add, however, that the weak picture for retail sales that has existed lately should be helped somewhat by the sharp boost in royalty and partnership income which is proportional to oil prices  Following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, we did do another round of Beigebook contacts As a result, the anecdotal evidence has shifted from [an outlook for] slow but steady growth to one of great uncertainty Even the focus of agriculture down our way has shifted from too little or too much moisture into marketing uncertainties in the new environment With respect to the national picture, I really don't have views that would be considered different from the Greenbook forecast   Mr Chairman, I'm fully supportive of your position    Mr Chairman, this is Boykin We really have not observed any change since the last meeting that shows a clear direction one way or the other I also would be supportive of the position that you're taking of just standing by and not doing anything right now    This is Boykin, Mr Chairman Looking at the District, I would say that we're certainly quite [unintelligible] To some extent the oil situation is a bit of a positive, but it's still too soon to get very much of a reading on that In my mind, the external aspects of what policy should be tend to override the domestic concerns at the moment As Jerry Corrigan and others have said, I think it's going to rest pretty heavily on what, if anything, comes out of this budget effort So I would be a little hesitant to move right away    Mr Chairman, the economy in the Dallas District seems to reflect many of the national trends, but overall we may be doing just slightly better than the nation now The picture is quite mixed, however, and virtually all segments of the region's economy are growing more slowly than earlier in the year The higher energy  -25-    10/2/90  prices help fewer people and hurt more people in our District than was the case years ago So, the net impact is less certain Residential construction activity has shown a modest pickup from the extremely depressed levels of the last several years, but nonresidential construction is flatter now, with the exception of the Houston area Retail sales have shown some very slim gains in recent months The refining petro-chemical business has held up relatively well lately Other areas of manufacturing have been somewhat weak We did meet with our advisory council on small business and agriculture a few weeks ago Our agricultural conditions seem to have improved, certainly in recent weeks Outside of the issue of credit availability, which incidentally is not a new issue with us, the economy may be doing considerably better than it had been over the past several years of meeting with that group  Looking at the national economy, I have no real disagreement with the staff's Greenbook forecast Intuitively, I wonder if the third quarter will be quite as strong as they're indicating, but I would not have a great quarrel with it We don't see any evidence that we're heading into a cumulative downturn As a matter of fact, as I look at Mike's forecast and think about that outcome, it would not be a bad result, if it could actually be accomplished It seems to me that the assumption is that a steady monetary policy would accomplish that result So, in spite of all the uncertainties and concerns, I would tend to pay a bit more attention to the inflation picture rather than [to the possibility of] the economy slipping over too far   Well, Mr Chairman, as much as I would like to support what you're recommending, I have some difficulty doing it I guess to me the Greenbook forecast looks a little more realistic than it does to others I'm afraid we might lose sight of the inflation situation I'm more concerned that the timing would be premature by  -54-    10/2/90  several weeks if we did make a move It seems to me that the last 1/4 point move was tied to the credit situation And I have to confess I don't fully understand--we'll discuss it at lunch--but if you do the reserve requirement change, it's to address that That seems to me at least a nod in that direction So, if that is a nod, I would want to wait a while longer and let the economic data come through before doing what is being contemplated So, I would not favor it    Well, Mr Chairman, I really don't take much exception to the staff forecast through the first quarter of next year I do wonder a little, as others have, about the bounceback of growth in the second quarter and thereafter on the inflation side I hope it turns out to be the way that it's forecast I guess I have slightly less optimism in that regard  As far as developments in the Dallas District, it does seem that conditions down our way, at least on average, are reflecting the same set of weaknesses that are affecting the rest of the country Higher oil prices are supposed to improve matters in Texas, Louisiana, and New Mexico but so far we're not seeing any of the benefit For example, neither drilling activity nor employment in the oil and gas industries has increased significantly Manufacturing employment is down; construction is down slightly; employment growth is stalling in the private producing sectors; agricultural incomes are lower than expected because of increased fuel costs Government is the only robust sector, and to me that's a bit of a negative Uncertainty is a major factor that seems to be depressing economic activity in the District The volatility in the oil markets leaves oil and gas producers uncertain about the future price of oil and, therefore, cautious about expansion In addition, there seems to be heightened uncertainty about the health of the national economy, interest rates, the tax load, and the possibility of war in the Middle East All of these factors seem to be leading consumers to postpone purchases, particularly purchases of real estate and durable goods  Within the District, growth patterns are very uneven New Mexico, which had been showing the strongest growth of our three states, has shown actual declines in employment and other economic measures through 1990 Louisiana had been laggard in the recovery in the Southwest but has been showing steady growth and improvement Texas, particularly in the last few months, seems to be slowing almost to a standstill We had a joint meeting last week of all four of our boards of directors and the comments made at that meeting certainly confirmed what our statistics are saying There was very little optimism expressed at that meeting In short, the near-term outlook is on the pessimistic side; but looking further out, we can expect to see some improvement only if higher oil prices are sustained   I concur, Mr Chairman I do feel a little of the sentiment that Tom Melzer expressed    Don, do you expect the change in reserve requirements to affect the money situation in any way?    12/7/90   Thank you    Well, Mr Chairman, about the best that we can say about the Dallas District is that it's pretty flat This is what our statistical evidence is saying and it has been confirmed by our board of directors at our meeting last Thursday and by other anecdotal information that we've been getting lately It is increasingly difficult to find a segment of our District economy that is doing well Most of our contacts are mentioning either mild declines or slight gains Manufacturing activity has been weak, particularly in electronics and defense-related industries Construction activity has picked up slightly, but most of that pickup represents a completion of major petro-chemical projects begun about two years ago Our retailers are telling us that the Christmas season has been slow, with merchandise not moving except at post-Christmas-type discounts Overall, the outlook for the District economy is for little or no growth over the next few months    12/18/90  With respect to the national picture, I certainly would not take issue with Mike's forecast, particularly since he added somewhere along the line that the risks are certainly on the down side   I would support your recommendation, Mr Chairman I would also hope that there is a discount rate cut The only comment I would make is that I hope you would exercise considerable discretion in going any further in the intermeeting period unless something very unusual happens
