9,1987-08-18," Mr Chairman, our forecast also is pretty much in agreement with the staff forecast We have strengthened our outlook for the national economy for the rest of this year and going  -14-    8/18/87  into next year We think we do have a rate of expansion that is sustainable Subjectively, it is a little hard for me really to believe all that, given what has been going on in our particular part of the country While we are seeing a little improvement, we certainly are lagging the rest of the country Both anecdotally and statistically, we can kind of show that we are working through the trough; but the recovery, to the extent that there is one, is so fragile that it would not take very much to have us continue the downturn that we've been in for the last couple of years Reference has been made to energy We have seen a little improvement there, certainly, in terms of perceptions There has been a little improvement in construction, but it's not in building; it's in roads, public construction, that sort of thing Manufacturing looks pretty good In agriculture, we are continuing to see cropland values decline and we are not through yet; of course, we came into this a year or two after the Midwest, in particular And, of course, everybody reads about the conditions of the financial institutions One concern that we are hearing, primarily from people in mid-sized and small businesses, is that they're very concerned that they're not going to get credit And without credit, they're not going to be able to grow and expand and create jobs This is something that we're hearing more and more The banks are not willing or able to lend, and a cutoff of credit has occurred; and they don't see very much end to it   That's a lot of it, Jerry The bankers say that there just is not any loan demand The small and mid-sized businessmen say we have the demand but banks won't take the risk So, I think it's probably somewhere in between--the banks are not seeing the kind of demand in the loans that they are willing to make "
10,1987-08-18," Mr Chairman, I would favor alternative B I would favor basically no change from current policy, and I say that because I guess I am not totally convinced that the economy is going to be quite as strong as perhaps some others believe I question that inflation is a problem at this point Granted, when you determine or realize it is a problem, you are pretty far down the road, so that a certain amount of anticipation is desirable But, given the fact that the interval between this meeting and the September meeting is pretty short compared to some of the intervals, and that the need for a policy shift is less than convincing--to me, at least--I would stick with alternative B, the $500 million borrowing assumption Rather than being symmetrical, though, I would have a sentence in there that would allow a little tightening by the Desk, if that should become necessary "
62,1987-09-22," Mr Chairman, I guess it's somebody's turn to say something not quite as positive as we have been hearing I guess it falls to my lot, being from the Eleventh District I would characterize our economy in the Eleventh District as still somewhat sluggish and a little fragile, although there have been tentative signs of improvement Businesses around the District that serve a national or international market all seem to be saying that they are seeing some improvement These would be primarily in electronics, livestock, chemicals, and defense There is a little more optimism there The businesses that serve their own local area or region,  -22-    9/22/87  though, say that their business remains flat; they really have not seen any signs of improvement Obviously, there is a correlation in attitudes and sentiment related to oil prices, since oil is so important in our region With the improvement there, and with the increase in the oil rig count and additional activity going on, there is more optimism There is a little more activity in related businesses; all but construction-related manufacturing are growing Agriculture is stabilizing, and cotton and livestock farming are doing fairly well Our retail sales remain fairly flat We continue to worry somewhat about the condition of our financial institutions Pick up a newspaper and you'll still find reports of foreclosures and bankruptcies continuing Last week in Austin, which was really the bright spot for the last several years in Texas, there was the posting of a foreclosure of a fairly major hotel-office complex that was pretty new There were foreclosure postings in Houston, also, of two or three fairly well known good projects This doesn't mean the foreclosures will actually occur; the postings could be part of a renegotiation Nevertheless, it is upsetting We saw a report last week that Dallas had lost 40,000 jobs over the last year That seems awfully high to me, but those are the kinds of reports we are hearing Though we hope that we are on a comeback trail--and, if oil prices hold, I think we will be--I don't think we have seen the bottom of our commercial real estate problem I think we probably are going to be worrying about that for at least two years, possibly three, before we can work through that  On the national picture, and possibly I'm somewhat influenced by our own Eleventh District, we would come out--looking out through the rest of this year to 1988--a little below where the Greenbook is this time Although we moved our own forecast up slightly, we didn't come as far as the Board staff has in the Greenbook On the long-term rate, I don't know that I have any particularly useful insight into that except that the evident concern about inflation does not seem to be quite as deep among the people I've talked to; certainly, in our District, there is not really [unintelligible] to the problem "
63,1987-09-22, That's my policy prescription four square 
121,1987-11-03," Mr Chairman, uncertainty certainly prevails down my way In looking at what might be appropriate for forecasting, we really would not have much basis for argument [with the staff forecast], but in our own forecast we have come down a full point; that is very judgmental, obviously As far as the effect on our District economy, our initial reaction is that probably whatever the effect, it is likely to be a little less in the Eleventh District than in the rest of the country, simply because we are so much farther behind the rest of the country We have seen signs of sluggish growth in the District We think the situation continues to be extremely fragile The real estate problems keep coming up and are a pervasive cloud in the psychology The earnings reports that we have just gone through with our financial institutions, and the added provision for loan losses--most of it triggered by real estate--just put another damper on that The cautious optimism that I tried to express for a couple of meetings seems to have abated somewhat I'm not sure we can even be cautiously optimistic right now "
122,1987-11-03," Mr Chairman, I'm right along with everyone else I favor the 6-3/4 percent funds rate, which I guess I would have described as ""A-"" or ""B+"" going in [to this discussion], but your description of ""B"" puts me there, so I don't have any problem with that On the borrowing number I was thinking $300 million, but I guess that becomes whatever it becomes, given the funds rate that we're looking for On the language, I favor Variant I; I think saying as well as we can what is going on is important Of course, that won't be released for about six weeks and that's a while down the road If any misinterpretation seems to be going on in the markets as to what we are doing, maybe another statement such as the one released earlier would be called for I thought that was very, very appropriate I like things even on both sides as a rule, so symmetric language always appeals to me "
177,1987-12-15," That's also what we hear   I agree that the longer we wait, the more difficult it is I agree with going to alternative (3), which I would interpret as a gradual move back, but certainly one with enough latitude to back off if we're not getting the right reaction With respect to how to do it, I don't know that we can be this precise--and maybe this is an oversimplification--but I would say go for alternative (3) but postpone it until after year-end I would stay where we are for the next couple of weeks, or certainly through the year-end, and then start the gradual move At that point, there would be enough flexibility that we could back off if we're not getting the reactions in the market that we're anticipating   It's one situation where we go out once a year and advertise come on in and see if you can qualify   Also, we don't have very many takers on seasonal "
178,1987-12-15," Mr Chairman, as far as the national economy, we certainly agree with Mike Prell's presentation In our District, we're seeing some slight improvement, we think Of course, with what little improvement we do see, we're growing at a slower pace than other parts of the country There is considerable improvement in manufacturing employment; in fact, we're keeping pace with the national statistics in that regard We don't see the possible $2 or $3 drop in the price of oil doing a great amount of damage to our District in terms of oil exploration, primarily because most of the planning has been done assuming an oil price of about $15 However, there are implications other than just for exploration in terms of revenues to the state and subsidiary effects that could go along with that The peso reevaluation is probably a somewhat neutral [event] because we've had diversification along the border, with not so much reliance just on the retail side While that does affect retail sales [negatively], it improves the myceladora, the twin plant concept So that turns out to be somewhat of a wash We feel pretty good about agriculture; it has been considerably better this year Energy, so far at least, has held its own Construction, we think, is leveling out Granted, energy is at the bottom and nothing is going on, but no further deterioration is indicated Manufacturing plus services are remaining fairly even, although we may see more improvement in services than we are forecasting So, while it's not a really bright picture, I do think and hope that, aside from the situation of our financial institutions, we are at the bottom and that there is improvement coming along  -52-    12/15-16/87 "
179,1987-12-15," I would go with option (3) and begin the movement when it seems appropriate I'd go with alternative ""B"" and probably a $300 million borrowing assumption I would assume that it could be adjusted up the same way it was adjusted down in the interim between our meetings And I would have symmetric language   About where it is now "
241,1988-02-09," Well, Mr Chairman my speech was just made basically by Roger and others I would favor alternative II--not the substance but the appearance of it--and hope we make the best translation from the substance It does reflect a march down--maybe not at the pace some would argue for--but it's a half a point less than what we had for 1987, and it's consistent with our direction in reducing the ranges, at least If you go to alternative III, as Tom Melzer said, I wonder if that's not a bit of a conflicting signal versus what we generally are perceived to be doing, which might lead to some confusion Alternative II permits us, I think, to do whatever it is that we need to do And it would reflect, to me at least, a continuing commitment to guarding against inflation So, I would stay just where we put it tentatively I would not rebase either "
242,1988-02-09," Mr Chairman, I think the Eleventh District, in many ways mirrors the national economy, although the plane that we are on is lower than the plane where the national economy is now We have had a little improvement, although I think that our uncertainty remains, and if anything, may be increasing a little Our employment gains continue at slightly less than the national rate Our construction sector remains the weakest sector and that's really no surprise Just as an example for the whole state of Texas in  -18-    2/9-10/88  December, we had permits issued for 100 apartment units, which is pretty much next to nothing   However, our manufacturing continues to show signs of improvement, and that's mostly related to the lower dollar, of course Construction-related and energy-related manufacturing are exceptions We think our principal vulnerability is to national recession more so than to the possibility of lower energy prices Anecdotally, with regard to perceptions and attitudes--which I think do get to be important, certainly at the margin--in terms of how you're going to [unintelligible] concerned with the condition of our financial institutions, which remains somewhat of a drag I've had two or three business people visit with me from our small business advisory group, and they are concerned because they don't feel that our financial institutions are in a position to meet their credit needs This is a drag in terms of the credit that they need to move along I think in many ways our business people are more optimistic, but the timidity of the financial people to make loans is a real concern And then the question is What do we do about it? You talk to the bankers and, of course, they will tell you that there aren't any good loans out there There is just not any loan demand  The Southwest plan that we've been reading about--that the Federal Home Loan Bank has to try to do something with savings and loans that are in trouble, a large portion being in Texas--I think is being greeted with mixed views I guess we are coming to the point, or at least I am in my own thinking, [that I'd like to see] any plan as long as something would happen as opposed to just talking about it Now, in talking with savings and loan people and with other investors who have proposals pending to try to become involved in this, they say it's extremely difficult to get anything to happen The fact is that they think there seems to be a pretty heavy overlay of politics when it gets to the Washington level, with respect to getting some of this restructuring done But I think sooner is much better than later There is a mixed view on whether, if we get a restructuring plan working, it will reduce the effects of the premiums that it costs to fund, which is not only hurting the savings and loans, but certainly also the banks I think hopefully it will help; it certainly will not hurt Real estate, which I've reported on, we read about But in visiting with a chairman of savings and loan association, his judgment is that there is at least $100 billion of really troubled real estate in Texas, if you really face up to it Now that's one person's [view]   Even in Texas And it's a lot bigger than it used to be  SPEAKER(?) That's book value, right?   A lot of it And I don't know whether I said this a while ago or not, if I did forgive me--but this same individual told me that his institution owns 10,000 apartments and they just reassessed their loan portfolio and they're getting ready to own another 10,000 You know, that says--  SPEAKER(?) But who put those 100 building permits in? "
243,1988-02-09," Don, as I read the write-up, alternative A would accommodate a discount rate reduction My question is, technically, would alternative B accommodate a discount rate reduction?   Mr Chairman, for the short term, I favor alternative B, and the $250 million borrowing assumption, with the understanding that it would be interpreted as Don explained In the longer term, my preference would be to remain with alternative II as specified--that is, 5 to 8 percent on M2 I could accept 4 to 8 percent if that's where the majority was It does seem to me that maintaining the 8 percent on the top side still represents a downward move of a half a point [from the range for 1987], which indicates that we continue to be concerned about inflation If you throw in another half a point on top--which, in effect, would knock a full point off-- that might be, in my judgment, a little overkill in showing our determination "
302,1988-03-29," Mr Chairman, I'm not a proponent for changing anything we're doing I'm satisfied with where we are and, therefore, I really have nothing to contribute to this discussion I assume that nothing's going to change; and if that's so, I'll be satisfied  SPEAKER(?) Except the discount rate "
303,1988-03-29," Mr Chairman, on the national economy, we would line up pretty well with the Greenbook forecast We've felt for the last several months that on the national level we [unintelligible] fairly good performance Looking at the District level, and I guess more particularly at Texas, about the only bright spot that we can find is in manufacturing, where we are seeing improvement We're having employment in the manufacturing area as great as, if not greater than, other parts of the country; and of course, the services industries related to that are doing well Having said that, I've said about all of the good that I can The overall unemployment rate in Texas, for example, is well over 8 percent, which is considerably above the national rate Agriculture did have a good year; it is hoped that it will have another one I think drought conditions might be developing and are causing us to wonder slightly about that  Obviously, one of the major things going on down our way is the bank and financial conditions, which I understand we will get into  -44-    3/29/88  later in some detail But it's a very, very heavy overhang in terms of attitudes and willingness to take on new ventures There's certainly concern over the ability to obtain financing from financial institutions in the local area The real estate situation obviously has contributed very significantly to these problems and there is no short-term solution to that It's going to be more long-term, as opposed to immediate, as far as what's going to be happening in Texas I think it's going to be a very close race between the ability of our local financial institutions and businesses to improve their balance sheets and get a little sounder footing and the onset of a downturn in the national economy at some point If we do encounter such a downturn before we are able to position ourselves a little better, we are going to have even bigger problems than we already have "
351,1988-05-17," I agree with the position that has been stated by you, Mr Chairman, and others I'm a ""B-"", ""C+"", however you characterize it, with the $100 million increase in borrowing I guess I would be inclined to move sooner rather than later on the $100 million If I had the real courage of my convictions, as Lee Hoskins does, I would really like to line up with him I guess I just don't have that much courage, given the situation I have down there in the Southwest But, I think he makes a very, very good point that policy, and what it is that we can do, has to be viewed in the longer run And I think when we temporize and rationalize some of the short-run problems we think would result from taking actions, that's not really communicated and tends to compound the problems over the longer range "
380,1988-06-29," Mr Chairman, in the Eleventh District, not a great deal has changed I think I reported that we had some improvement in the Eleventh District economic picture over the last half of last year It seems to have flattened out over the last several months--at least that's what our statistics are saying It's a little confusing, though, because in talking with business people around the District I'm probably hearing more optimism, other than in banking and real estate, than I've heard in the last couple of years I think expectations are pretty [unintelligible] in the Houston area, and there the expectations, as well as the statistics, are becoming more consistent than throughout the rest of the District  Looking at the District and trying to project ahead, we think possibly we are poised to resume some upward movement Our portions of New Mexico and Louisiana are both showing some growth, but I think for the states as a whole, most of that growth really is in Roger Guffey's and Bob Forrestal's parts of those states Manufacturing has leveled off and that's where we were getting most of our improvement last year and fairly early this year That seems to have peaked a bit Energy has been stable We've seen considerable job loss in retail trade and financial services; and, of course, construction remains our weakest sector  We're having a little negative impact from the drought, but it's not anything compared to what's happening in other parts of the country We have some dry spots, although judging from reports earlier this week the dry spots in our District have all had pretty good rains; and those that have had pretty good rains were missing them, so it's kind of evening out The drought, though, is pretty much of a regular feature down our way and our people know how to handle it and prepare for it and expect it--so maybe we're not quite as exposed  I did meet with a group of investment bankers and nonbank lenders last week and they confirmed what we've been hearing otherwise, and what the statistics have been showing--that there's really little or no new lending to the small and medium sized  -20-    6/29-30/88  businesses And we think that this capital shortage is likely to be an impediment to the continuation of even the weak recovery So, that is a matter of concern  On the wages, I really have no insight into that, Mr Chairman In fact, it's not something that I'm hearing discussed too much down our way Job security and hopefully trying to get a little more job growth are what we're hearing about, as opposed to conversation about pressures or moving wages On the national picture, we're pretty close to where the Board staff is on that "
381,1988-06-29," I'd stay where we are for '88, alternative III for '89   I would go with your prescription "
440,1988-08-16," Well, Mr Chairman, I'll start with the Eleventh District and get the less-than-good news out of the way early I would say that the perception of what's happening in the Texas economy, and the Eleventh District generally, is improving somewhat I think we are beginning to see some evidence showing through in the statistics We did have growth in our District in the last half of last year that had kind of plateaued or stalled out during the first half of this year But now we do think that we are seeing some renewed or resumed growth in the District and this is reflected in the employment numbers and that is primarily centered in Texas  Those categories where we are not seeing much improvement, of course, remain in the construction side of it, finance, and insurance We do have our real estate remaining weak We've had fairly good rains in our District, although somewhat spotty, but the feeling is that the rains have ameliorated the drought effects The information that we are getting from our bankers around the District is that they don't see a major threat to timely repayment of agricultural loans in the District  We are somewhat nervous, I guess, about oil prices If we do get a decline there, that obviously will be a negative However, there has been so much adjustment to lower oil prices that it would not have the same effect as earlier declines had Given the fact that our economy seems to be so much more closely linked to the national  -13-    8/16/88  economy, and given the fairly good forecast for the national economy, we feel that that will continue to be a pull for us and will be positive  Attitudinally, as far as the financial situation is concerned, I think there is a great deal of relief with the approach to the resolution of the First Republic situation, and that has received very good press, has been very well received Now the remaining speculation is whether the last big one will have to have some kind of relief "
441,1988-08-16," Mr Chairman, I also would go with ""B"", a $600 million borrowing assumption, and the asymmetric language because I do think the next move will have to be up As for the placement of the aggregates, I'm rather ambivalent on that at the present time Having tightened the position, which would lean towards moving to a little more restriction, I must confess I have a little discomfort I share many of the concerns that Governor LaWare pointed out Given the situation that we have in the Southwest, and having I guess the bulk of the thrift problem centered down there as well as other things, I'm a little uncomfortable as rates move up--as credit becomes a little more restrictive--about what the full implications are going to be I think it's going to make it fairly difficult for us However, since there can only be one monetary policy and it has to be a national policy, I fully support the direction of what we are doing "
490,1988-09-20," Mr Chairman, I'll lead off As far as the Eleventh District economy is concerned, we're looking at what's happening or might happen in energy--which over the past year or so is showing a little bit of improvement and turning into more of a neutral factor for us As far as the outlook for the economy generally, the overall mood of the people that we've talked to very recently has been  -10-    9/20/88  a little more positive, although it's difficult for them--or for us-- to point to specifics that show that something's happening  If we do get a sustained price for oil in the $14 range, that would probably indicate that we have no growth at all in our District economy, whereas we currently have a forecast of sluggish growth of something around 1 percent or less for next year We are getting reports of substantial capital investments that are planned or that are under way in petrochemicals, particularly in Houston--the upper Gulf Coast area And they are, of course, benefiting from the lower price of oil  We were fortunate over the last several days to have missed some of the rather devastating effects of Hurricane Gilbert Although there were tornadoes and there was some damage, it wasn't anything close to what had been anticipated The real estate area continues, of course, to be the biggest drag that we have And I do have a real- -as opposed to an anecdotal--comment on that About five years ago, we had our bank property appraised in connection with a study that we were doing The appraiser came up with a value in excess of $30 million, which a couple of our directors--particularly our then- Chairman who was in the real estate business--felt was low We've just had our property reappraised in connection with another study we're doing The same professional independent appraiser group did it this time They're telling us that our property now is worth between $6-1/2 and $8-1/2 million You know, that's something else   Well, there are special factors The key--and this is not the place to make this statement--but I'll make it anyway What they're saying is our building is totally used up in terms of its usefulness   But I thought that was very, very significant Granted, we have special circumstances; nevertheless I have a better appreciation of what the commercial banks have been having to deal with as they get new appraisals and reappraisals And I don't believe anybody knows what real estate is worth any more   That's all I have "
491,1988-09-20, I would just express agreement 
546,1988-11-01," In the Eleventh District, Mr Chairman, things are pretty much as they were in September We are continuing to see some modest growth Manufacturing is leading the improvement that we have The unemployment rates in our three states have been moving downward but only Texas is making any progress compared to the national rate in closing the gap In Texas we've got unemployment of 68 percent; in New Mexico it's 8-1/2 percent; in Louisiana it's 10 percent The lower oil prices are a real source of concern and could undermine the modest recovery that we've been experiencing I think further declines would probably cause us to look for zero growth in    11/1/88  1989 compared with the 1-1/2 percent or so rate of growth that we've been forecasting over the last several months Other sources of concern for us include a noticeable slowdown of orders in the electronics industry And there continue to be a few pockets on the foreign side and [some] that tend to be drought-related Of course, we continue to worry about and try to deal with the financial situa- tion in our District, both on the thrift side and the banking side "
547,1988-11-01," I would agree with your policy prescription, Mr Chairman "
610,1988-12-13," Could I?   One thing back on the price of oil and the way it's figuring in, you were saying that you are now looking at a $2 to $250 increase in the price of a barrel At a recent meeting, I guess it was October, we were looking for a decline and it seemed that energy was a fairly significant factor in the inflation outlook--that is, a better outlook for inflation And now that has kind of come back around to where we've been running $15+ a barrel As I understand what was said, it doesn't seem to have the same adverse effect on inflation on the upside Am I misunderstanding something here?    12/13-14/88   Mr Chairman, in the Eleventh District I think we are beginning to see a two-tier economy emerging I think there is a little more optimism than we've had in the past Those outside of the real estate construction and banking sectors are participating in a reasonably strong recovery now Of course, energy is a swing factor, and the apparent stabilization of energy prices--or at least the lesser likelihood of a precipitous decline--bodes well for our part of the country, although from the inflation side people might wonder a little This dichotomy kind of shows up in manufacturing, where industries related to foreign trade are doing well, while activities related to energy and construction are not doing all that well Also, on the agricultural side, livestock producers are going to be squeezed somewhat because of the higher drought-related feed costs, yet the farmers with cash crops are doing pretty well We think that employment growth in our three District states has been about 1-1/2 percent over the last year which is considerably better than the declines that we had in 1986 and 1987 Perceptionwise, anecdotally, and attitudinally, things really are improving As I've  -38-    12/13-14/88  reported earlier, in Houston the improved attitude started I'd say 6 or 7 months ago It's beginning to filter up from the coast to the Dallas area We've had some fairly visible announcements made such as GTE relocating their telephone operations into the Dallas area out of Connecticut They are talking 4,000 to 5,000 jobs and about 1,000,000 square feet of office space; they are going to build a big campus- style facility A Japanese firm just made an announcement that they are going to build a manufacturing plant They are talking about 1500 jobs in telecommunications manufacturing out there north of Dallas Of course, the announcement on the super collider just thrilled everybody It probably will never happen and won't get funded, but everybody is really happy about it   Everybody that counts   That's the way a lot things can go out our way Also, there's quite a bit of optimism given what appears to be a fairly significant Texas influence coming into the Washington arena with a new Administration   Yes, I'm not sure that's going to mean a whole lot, but it's being talked about as good for Texas maybe On the national side,  SPEAKER(?) You're supposed to be quiet about that, Bob   Okay, tell all the secrets, right?   On the national side, we are pretty much in agreement on the staff forecast I think there is obviously a chance that the economy will be even stronger than the forecast We are a little more pessimistic on the inflation side That being the case, I would be inclined for the reasons that have already been expressed to put in a little more restraint, and I'd be inclined to do it sooner rather than later "
611,1988-12-13," Mr Chairman, my position would be to move on the discount rate I think that would be the much preferable way to  -61-    12/13-14/88  go If the Board doesn't see it that way, then certainly alternative ""C"" And I'd move pretty fast on the borrowing "
673,1989-02-07," Mr Chairman, my preference would be for alternative ""II,"" primarily for the reason that we feel we would be at the lower part of the [alternative ""I""] range If we really believe that, it seems to me we ought to establish a range that gets a little more centered Also, my impression is that there has been less difficulty in explaining overruns than underruns And, at least the way I look at the long-run strategies--if you look at what happens to inflation and if there is a relationship between money growth and inflation--then it seems to me we aren't really doing very much over the next three years or so where inflation is concerned The comment was that the rhetoric has been good because [unintelligible] and look at what we do as opposed to what we say It seems to me that if we also confirm what we say with what we actually do, then that enhances our credibility Keeping inflation at the current levels, or even at projected levels as we're looking at it through 1991, seems to me almost to create the impression that we're accepting that as the norm And I have problems with that So my preference would be to go to alternative ""II""   It seems to me that if we do that, which I would favor, then on page 20 that very first sentence should say ""The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability""--we say ""over time"" Why don't we strike ""over time""? Our objective is to foster price stability And then with what Governor Angell is suggesting that confirms it because here we are setting our objectives As for that ""over time"" we've been at it a long time  SPEAKER(?) Time is running out!   Really, we prefer-- "
674,1989-02-07," Well, Mr Chairman, in the Eleventh District I think you have to look at the Louisiana portion by itself because it does seem that Louisiana is continuing to deteriorate, with the unemployment rate there rising to about 104 percent in December If you shift over to Texas and our part of New Mexico you continue to see some improvement; it's modest and slower than the rest of the nation, but at least it's going in the right direction On a sectoral basis the split is equally pronounced, with the energy and construction industries still pretty weak and manufacturing and services continuing to improve The energy industry is performing as though the expected price of oil is in the $15 to $16 range rather than the $17 to $19 trading range that we've seen over the last 8 weeks or so The downturn in our construction activity now seems to be centered on the nonresidential construction As for agriculture, there is some mention of concern about drought I guess we did not suffer quite as much last year but we are beginning to have a little concern Our winter wheat is already hurt and we're hearing fairly pessimistic reports from out in the farm areas Overall, manufacturing continues to improve In the first three quarters of last year, most of the gains were centered on the more trade sensitive industries; we've now seen that the less trade sensitive product lines are improving Retail sales have been improving in both autos and other goods Overall, we're looking for some strengthening of the regional economy in 1989 relative to 1988 So, that does make us feel a little better  On the national scene, about the only place we really have any difference with what Mike was saying is on inflation We feel there certainly is a little more inflationary pressure now and in prospect than the staff is seeing   Mr Chairman, has the date of the testimony been set yet? "
675,1989-02-07," Well, Mr Chairman, I find myself in the usual dilemma when it comes to this point, given where I live all the time except for a couple of days every seven or eight weeks here in Washington It's hard for me to rationalize being a little more restrictive or a little tighter, given the risks of what that might do to the Southwest since it seems that most of the problems have been and are still pretty much centered down there The arguments, I think, have been well stated on both sides of the issue Intuitively, I would be in favor of moving toward ""C"" now I'm not so confident of that, though, that a two or three weeks' delay to get us a little better reading on what's going on is that important But I remain concerned, as I indicated earlier in the meeting, about the level of inflation and what appears to me to be a fairly timid approach to reducing that in a fairly significant way I just think it's too high But I would be supportive of the proposition that you put out "
740,1989-03-28," Well, Mr Chairman, I really don't have any questions or any real disagreement with the staff forecast  Looking at the District, our recent performance and the near- term prospects for our economy continue to improve Over the last year and a half the gains in the Dallas District have been concentrated primarily in manufacturing services More recently, we've seen some gain from the energy sector The contraction in construction seems to be nearing the bottom Agriculture remains a bit of a concern, primarily because of the uncertainty of the drought situation As I've reiterated over the last six months, most of my contacts outside the banking and real estate industries have been sounding increasingly optimistic I had a group of investment merchant bankers in for a breakfast meeting last week and most of them agreed that the Texas economy and even that of Louisiana, which has been one of the weakest states, are beginning to demonstrate increasing strength In fact, a few who represent very large companies with considerable capital from both national and international sources are beginning to look upon the region as a ripe opportunity because of the reduced competition coming from the banking sector On the whole the regional economy is improving but growing slower than the nation Banking, real estate, and now agriculture are the exceptions to this pattern Within the District no one is noting price or wage pressures but there have been a few signs over the last two or three months of some shortages of engineers, first in Houston and now in Dallas Overall, I think we're feeling a little more optimistic down our way than we have for quite some time "
741,1989-03-28," I would favor alternative B as you suggested And I would strongly favor asymmetric language I would do that because I think projections are extremely important right now I'm not sure that we will know by the time of the next meeting whether we are in the pause or whether we're heading a little differently And when this policy record becomes public, following the next meeting, I think it could lead to some confusion in terms of our commitment to having inflation in the forefront of our thinking I think it could send the wrong signal "
805,1989-05-16," Mr Chairman, in the Eleventh District our economy continues to grow Even in Louisiana, where for the first time in quite some time the unemployment rate has slipped down to    5/16/89  single digits, it's looking a little better Growth is getting increasingly closer to the national rate; part of that, of course, is some of the slowing of the US rate We are seeing more and more signs that we are looking more like other Federal Reserve Districts; we're not quite the outlier that we were Labor shortages of specific types are cropping up Engineers, for example, are in very short supply We're even seeing help wanted signs appearing throughout Dallas Unemployment rates in many Texas cities are now in the low 5 percent area Nonetheless, the greatest strain still is centered along the Gulf Coast area--Houston in particular--and in the lower Rio Grande Valley We still have problems in some of the other areas of the District Banking and real estate are still dragging us down a little in Dallas, Austin, Shreveport and similar areas Manufacturing continues to grow above the national rate And in the services sector employment was matching the national growth In sum, Mr Chairman, we feel a little more optimistic about our area Having been burned as badly as we were, we don't want to overstate that We are coming from a fairly low figure but people really are feeling better   We're familiar with that term "
806,1989-05-16," Mr Chairman, I would agree with ""B"" and the $600 million My preference really would be to remain asymmetric or ""as-symmetric,"" as Mr Syron says The [weak] money growth is troublesome; but the forecast is for some rebound and if that holds true, that's fine But it seems to me that more or less what I'm hearing is the commitment for a conference call before the next meeting, which gives the opportunity to make any slight adjustment if that's wrong But I would still lean toward ""B,"" asymmetric "
867,1989-07-05," Mr Chairman, I would go with alternative III because if we don't do that I think there could almost be an implied reading that we're willing to accept inflation in the 4 to 5 percent range And I'm not sure that we want to leave that implication I think we all are having a bit of a sense of foreboding regarding what the economy is actually going to do But it's still a little anticipatory I think to reverse what we have set in place over time is probably going to be read as a little more significant than some of the others think If it becomes necessary early next year to make an adjustment and to move the ranges up, it seems to me that that would be done on the basis of knowledge in fact existing at that time, as opposed to tone and feel and a suspicion at this point And I could justify an upward move if circumstances, in fact, were there to dictate that "
868,1989-07-05," Mr Chairman, the Eleventh District economy continues to show modest improvement overall Much as Roger indicated for the Tenth District, we do have to keep in mind that we were coming off a very low growth base of economic activity Even though we are getting modest improvement we continue to show weakness in construction activity, and I guess that would be expected for us Single-family housing is the only area of construction that does show some improvement While the energy sector has shown a little growth in the last few months in response to the higher oil prices, the gains are very small Drilling and related activity are still below the depressed levels of a year ago Recent rains have improved the agricultural outlook for this year in some parts of our District But nonetheless, we still expect farm income to be a little below last year's We are seeing continuing gains in the manufacturing sector, with nondurable goods showing the greatest strength The outlook in our area is at best guardedly optimistic as cuts in defense spending, slowing in overall demand nationally, and an inability to expand output in chemicals, petro-chemicals and paper all combine to restrain [the prospects for] growth in coming months Orders growth has been slowing in several industries Retail sales, including autos, continue to show year-over-year gains down our way And Houston continues to be kind of the shining example for us, which is a considerable change over a couple of years ago Price and wage pressures remain well below the national average in that regard I am glad to report on the financial side that in the first quarter our District banks just about broke even for the first time in over two years Nonperforming [loans] and charge-offs continue to move in the right direction; but part of this is a statistical illusion as many of the loans in recapitalized banks are put back to the FDIC All in all, we think the banking sector is still several quarters away from  -23-    7/5-6/89  supporting business expansion We haven't noticed or detected any real inventory problems in the District With respect to the national outlook, the Greenbook [forecast presents a reasonable picture of] what we're going to be facing "
869,1989-07-05, I would concur 
930,1989-08-22," Mr Chairman, our District economy continues to underperform the nation We are now estimating that we're doing about two-thirds as well; we had been doing about half as well This improvement, though, is primarily because of the slowdown in the growth at the national level; on a [regional] level we're doing about the same Geographically, the mix of growth seems to be a little different Texas now appears to be growing more slowly than either Louisiana or New Mexico Within Texas, Houston of course continues to be the bright spot Having been down there recently, listening to the anecdotal information coming out of Houston, the mood is totally different One large developer in home building said it was quite refreshing to worry about drainage ditches as opposed to other types of drainage In the District, manufacturing activity has remained our strongest sector; employment has been growing in that area while it has been declining nationally Textiles, apparel, plastics, rubber, and wood products have been doing particularly well Most durable goods products have been sluggish; electronic components have been particularly soft and transportation equipment is a bit of a concern from our standpoint Our GM plant in Arlington, Texas is going to be down for a while We wonder about the GM truck assembly plant over in Shreveport Bell Helicopter remains somewhat in doubt And of course with the B-2 bomber, General Dynamics as well as LTV have some concerns Construction remains the softest sector and is showing signs of bottoming out Agriculture has been hurt by moisture conditions; we either had too much or too little moisture I'd say all-in-all, our sluggish growth continues from a very low base And outside of Houston and a few border towns on the Rio Grande Valley there is little or no sense of optimism Of course, on the financial scene, we have had all of our major bank holding companies with their problems addressed in various fashions Something good always comes out of something bad; we've had an opportunity to widen our acquaintanceships considerably We've spent a lot of time meeting folks out of the Cleveland District and out of New York and out of Richmond and out of San Francisco   On the national economy, basically we wouldn't have a great deal of difference on the forecast If we would differ it is that for some reason we have a hard time being quite as    8/22/89  optimistic on the national picture Our guess would be that if we're going to err, it's probably that we are not going to get quite as strong a performance as projected Of course, the inflation side is still worrisome; indeed [we don't see a] significant improvement for the next year and a half on the inflation front "
931,1989-08-22," ""B"" and I would stay symmetric Although my opinion is that if there's any change it would be toward ease, I'm not so convinced of that that I would want to put it in the directive at this point "
994,1989-10-03," Mr Chairman, on the national picture our view would be pretty well along the lines of the Greenbook We would not find anything about which we would have serious disagreement As several others have pointed out, the forecast of inflation running through 1991 remains quite troublesome--certainly to me  Looking at our District, it's very difficult to come up with adjectives to characterize what is going on If I were an optimist I'd say we were having modest growth If I were a pessimist I'd say it has turned very sluggish Not knowing which I am, I'll try to describe a few of the elements Where we had had some strength in manufacturing, those gains are slowing The slowdown in electronics seems to be in line with expectations In petrochemicals, inventories have been building and prices have been soft, with a result that several plant expansions either have been delayed or canceled Retail sales have shown modest improvement with the exception of auto sales, which had been stronger and now are showing declines in many areas Two of our weakest sectors, energy and construction, have begun to show small gains; but residential construction continues weak as does agriculture--both cattle and crops The statistical data continue to show what I would say is modest growth We have had rather extensive discussions over the last couple of weeks with various businessmen and others in our District The attitude has changed, even in Houston Growth seems to have leveled off there as it has [in Southern Texas]; and they were two particularly strong areas The way that they are characterizing the situation is that they think our economy either has stalled or is shortly headed for a stall   That could be a factor!  SPEAKER(?) He's back   Well, a considerable difference-- "
995,1989-10-03, I favor alternative B My preference also would be for symmetric language 
1054,1989-11-14," Mr Chairman, in the Eleventh District there is not very much new to report I think it's fair to say that the expansion--what little we have had--has slowed Private nonfarm and farm [income] was basically unchanged between July and September The  -11-    11/14/89  Texas index of leading indicators has fallen for four consecutive months The declines have been moderate, suggesting continued weak growth rather than a recession The declines have been led by durable goods manufacturing; nondurable goods manufacturing is holding up a little better Services have been strong, with growth in business services especially strong The construction sector does appear to have bottomed out finally I guess the best words we are hearing are around the Houston and Gulf Coast area, although those words are not quite as good as we were hearing several months ago "
1055,1989-11-14," Mr Chairman, I would agree with alternative B; I have a fairly strong preference for symmetric language Also, I agree with those who have already expressed the view that the inflation forecast that we have in the Greenbook doesn't show very much progress there Granted, we have risks on the down side of the economy; but on the other hand, I'm not sure that we've had the opportunity to see all of the effects flowing through of what we have done in terms of ease over the last few months I guess I'm hoping that that will keep us from slipping into recession But I think we would make a bad mistake if we really didn't keep inflation fairly high in importance "
1110,1989-12-18," Mr Chairman, Wayne Angell and Lee Hoskins pretty well asked my question but I'd like to ask it slightly differently I'm looking at Exhibit 8 When you look at the four charts there you have the GNP deflator at zero in 1995; you have the unemployment rate in 1995 at 7 percent but the line is heading down; you have real GNP above potential growth; and you have interest rates coming down Using the assumptions that are behind this, it seems to me that if all of that would happen it would be a very favorable picture The question then, of course, is What happens after 1995? I know you haven't done that work But at this point do you know whether you would expect continued decreases in the rate of unemployment, continued growth of the GNP above the potential rate, and interest rates possibly coming down a little more if we could reach this point by 1995?   Well, I guess I would always assume, maybe erroneously, that of course we would make the right policy decisions And with the unemployment rate holding steady there for 3 or 4 years and the downward slope of that line, I wondered whether we could expect that to continue   Yes, but it's the right direction   On the first question, targeting a stable inflation level would bother me because that implies we can come up with a specific number and I don't think we have any historical basis for assuming that we could maintain that particular number It seems to me we would have more explaining to do using the zero inflation In my mind, at least, that implies the definition that's already been advanced as far as inflation not entering into the business decision It seems to me that we give the Committee a little more latitude by taking into account facts and circumstances as they are developing at any particular time In my mind we do not get a locked-in mentality; that might not be the appropriate thing to do So I would favor the concept of moving toward zero inflation with the understanding of what that really meant I also think that a timetable is important It's important to give us credibility and it's also important on the other side of it to give us a lack of credibility It seems to me that the idea Jerry was talking about--saying the mid-'90s or something like that--would put us in the position of being able to take into account what was actually going on without doing any serious damage But direction is important And, given the inflationary [bias] both in the economy and probably within the FOMC, at least on an historical basis, it appears that if we don't formulate good policies to try to get to where inflation is not a factor in making business decisions our decisions are going to lead us inadvertently toward more inflation   Well, just to put a little different light on this, I think we're probably selling the American public a little short I don't want to overplay this But having been through a depression recently in the Southwest that was more than just the very minimal, all through the very difficult period that we've been through I did not have one business person or anybody pick up the phone and call me and lay the problem at the feet of the Fed I think there's a little greater understanding out there of the imbalances and a recognition that fiscal policy-- Now, I don't want to minimize the political aspects of it and what a constituency is As far as the politicians themselves are concerned, I've spent my career running from them and I try not to talk to them; I don't really understand their mentality But in terms of the individuals who suffered through this, as devastating as it was, I've had people that have totally gone out of business not lay the blame at the feet of the Fed The only thought I'm trying to get across here, without minimizing the difficulties, is let's not beat up on ourselves too hard I think there's a little more understanding out there than I'm hearing expressed around here There are always risks, but given what we see as the objective, I'm not too sure that those risks, on a calculated basis, aren't worth taking "
1111,1989-12-18," Mr Chairman, with respect to the national picture, we concur with the Greenbook projection for weaker economic growth combined with stubborn and [unintelligible] inflationary pressures  Looking at our District, the Eleventh District economy seems to have weakened in recent months, both in relation to its rate of growth earlier this year and in relation to the declining rate of the national economy Overall District growth is positive but [barely] perceptible Within the Dallas District, New Mexico has been growing faster than the nation; Texas has been growing at about half the national rate; and Louisiana has been declining absolutely What is interesting about the economic performance in the District is the almost complete reversal in the areas of strength and weakness in the  -73-    12/18-19/89  economy at the present time versus, say, a year or two ago Durable goods manufacturing is declining and that is the sector of our economy that led us into the modest recovery two years ago Nondurable manufacturing has been holding up quite well The chemicals and rubber products, plastics, and apparel all are showing employment gains between 2 and 3 percent The energy sector has been a stabilizing influence on the District economy The rig count and energy employment are both expected to contribute slightly to growth in the near future Construction, which has been declining absolutely for the past several years, has stabilized and even has shown a little growth over the past several months The strength in the construction figures has been dominated by the construction of new chemical plants, but there also has been some pickup in multifamily residential construction in a few markets where occupancy rates and rents are firm Overall, District agriculture is not doing very well; we're anticipating that farmers' net cash receipts will be about 20 percent below last year's level Growth in the services sector has slowed considerably outside of government jobs In short, the Dallas District economy has shown spreading signs of weakness recently and business confidence outside of the Houston area has reverted to the very low levels of two or three years ago "
1112,1989-12-18," I would concur with your formulation, Mr Chairman One thing strikes me I don't know whether it will hang together or not but I almost have the sense, tactically speaking, that the modest move that is being recommended right now probably puts us in a better position to resist a stronger move later on, because at least we could show that we had been responsive If, in our judgment down the road, it really isn't the time to move, I think we're better positioned to resist that at that point   Okay "
1180,1990-02-06," Mr Chairman, I lean a little toward alternative III Governor Angell's comments appealed to me strictly in terms of the Humphrey-Hawkins testimony and a careful explanation that we really are not willing to settle for what we have and we're not losing sight of our objectives With that kind of assurance, then I can accept alternative II I also liked Governor Angell's point on debt that probably a little further reduction on the debt figure would be possible That had some appeal to me   I just wanted to ask about the wording in the directive In the first sentence in that wording we had price stability first In the last sentence in the directive we have price level stability last I would suggest that we move the progress toward price level stability up to the first item in that last sentence, for reasons of substance as well as consistency   I'm on page 24 This is on the 1990 ranges The first sentence says ""The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability, promote growth"" etc The last sentence on that page says ""The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of movements in their velocities, developments in the economy and financial markets, and progress toward price level stability"" I'm suggesting that we say ""The behavior of the monetary aggregates will be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets""   Yes "
1181,1990-02-06," Mr Chairman, I'm in a bit of an unusual position of being more optimistic than the Greenbook concerning developments on the real side of the economy I see real growth this year coming in at 21 percent--I don't know what that means--and considerably more inflationary pressures I am very pessimistic about the inflation outlook  Our District economy has been improving recently--actually to a greater extent than I had anticipated We thought that the weakness in the national economy would depress growth in our District more than it has To our surprise this has not happened, which seems to show that there may be some underlying strength down our way Our employment gains have exceeded the national rate during the last few months for which data are available That may not be sustainable, although we do have some anecdotal evidence that suggests that the attitude in this regard has shown improvement In agriculture, we're still reeling from the freeze The lower Rio Grande Valley really has been devastated The citrus damage I think was greater than in Florida, although we do have some insurance that will help tide growers over and cover some of that damage The retail sector is not    2/6-7/90  robust but it has had a reasonably good year; there are year-over-year gains Our national retailers show much better gains in the District than in the rest of the nation Manufacturing is not doing very much We have a little concern about the anticipated layoffs in the defense- related areas Construction seems to be stabilizing and there is talk of the first signs of liquidity coming in We were told that some of the Houston improvements, certainly in real estate, probably have moved up our way We've been told that raw land is actually selling in the Dallas-Fort Worth area primarily for residential development The energy situation is pretty stable, with possibly some improvement there I'll sum it up by saying that in our District, at least, the overall outlook is improving I can't resist saying, in listening to my friend Dick Syron--   I remember several years ago I gave a very comparable report and my good friend Ed Boehne leaned across the table and said ""Boykin, that's a Texas problem"" So, maybe that's just a Northeast problem "
1182,1990-02-06," Mr Chairman, I come out somewhere between ""B"" and ""C,"" as a matter of fact, recognizing all of the concerns that have been expressed Financial fragility--we've experienced some of that; credit rationing--we've experienced some of that, and we're still there Granted, the players sure have changed   If our view is right--and obviously we're an outlier on the up side--that there's probably a little more strength in the economy than the consensus feeling, and given that we're not quite as optimistic on inflation as the staff is, it does place me somewhat in a dilemma If we wait until we get confirmation of which way it's going, obviously, it's always too late In trying to figure out what I would do in this kind of situation, I guess alternative ""B,"" [is appropriate] But when we start talking about the directive--and this certainly would be somewhat of a nuance--I would be inclined to go asymmetric on the side of greater restraint "
1248,1990-03-27, I don't think we have a luncheon 
1249,1990-03-27," Well, Mr Chairman, the economy in the Dallas District continues to mend Slowly but surely economic conditions are showing mixed signs of improvement Finally, we even see Louisiana being able to reflect slightly better conditions However, with regard to the improvements that we're seeing, while they're pretty much across the board, the extent of the gains is highly variable Energy and construction continue to show modest improvement The rig count in Texas has shown some significant gains A lot of this is attributable to the horizontal drilling that's going on The manufacturing picture has been somewhat mixed On the construction side, while we have seen gains, they are possibly a little tenuous as construction values have fallen lately On the other hand, this appears to be a correction related to potential overexpansion in petro-chemical capacity down along the Gulf Coast The weakest sector of our economy is agriculture; that continues to be hurt by drought and other weather-related conditions On the so-called credit crunch issue, we also hear some anecdotal evidence; but it's not all that different from what we have heard for quite some time with respect to our small businesses And given where we've been in our District, we've been hearing this for quite some time On a little broader issue, if the rationing really is going on and it seems to be primarily related to real estate concerns, I would question whether a slight change in interest rates one way or the other really would address that particular problem  On the national picture, I feel pretty good about the staff's current forecast It seems a little more in line at least with what we've been thinking and we would not take issue with it I would associate myself with those who are expressing concern about the long- term prospects for inflation I think that maybe something ought to be done about that "
1250,1990-03-27," Mr Chairman, I would lean somewhere between ""B"" and ""C"" but I'm certainly willing to accept the arguments of what the possible effects might be on foreign exchange rates That being the case, though, I would feel pretty strongly about going asymmetric on the directive Roger pretty well made that speech It does seem to me that it positions us, if later events call for an actual upward movement in the fed funds rate If that became necessary, we could move; or if that were delayed and had to come even after the next meeting it seems to me that that would tend to minimize a bit the surprise element that seems to be a matter of concern If later information indicates that the economy and other factors are not what  -42-    3/27/90  I at least anticipate--if policy doesn't actually change over the intermeeting period--the markets would be able to read that; and following the next meeting, if nothing happens, they could tell that pretty quickly So, I don't see any significant risk in going asymmetric, but I think there are a lot of good arguments for going that way "
1311,1990-05-15," Mr Chairman, it's not too often that anecdotal and statistical information seem to be pointing in the same direction, but in our case for the first time in over two years they are beginning to match In contrast to previous reports that I've been giving, where District performance had been marked with some strong and some very weak sectors, there is now improvement and it's more broadly based District manufacturing continues to outperform the nation We had increases in manufacturing employment in the fourth quarter of 1989 and the first quarter of 1990 while it was declining nationally In wholesale and retail trade, District employment increased at about a 4-1/2 percent rate in the first quarter Employment in the services sector is still growing at a healthy rate, with particularly strong gains in the areas of finance, insurance, and real estate In the energy sector, all field activities continue to improve; as for the long-term outlook, there is considerable optimism for continued improvement District construction activity has been strong recently, though it's likely to slow some from its current pace of nearly 10 percent Recent rains have improved the outlook for agriculture except, of course, in those areas where we've had some very, very severe flooding, which I'm sure you've seen on the news  Our bottom line is that we do appear to be coming out of what we call our great recession in the District, and the improvement and growth seem to be widespread Also, I think it's becoming quite evident that our economy is much more diversified Having said that, I'm inclined to conclude that we may be getting away from the historical boom-bust type of activity that we've had There may be some disappointment for those who are waiting for the next boom, having gone through the bust But I'm inclined to think that for the longer term it's going to be a much more healthy situation economically  With respect to the national picture, we're in substantial agreement with the forecast that you have, Mike "
1312,1990-05-15," Mr Chairman, I am obviously more uncertain today than I have been in the past couple of meetings I could support alternative ""B"" I would have a fairly strong preference for asymmetric language Your prescription of a narrative in the policy record reflecting inflation concerns and that sort of thing is okay, but if we're talking about credibility and sending some signals, that brings in a lot of nuances and subtleties it seems to me I think an asymmetric directive would give credibility to the verbiage that would be in the policy record and for that reason I think we would have some opportunity to strengthen at least the credibility [of our inflation effort] "
1365,1990-07-02," Well, Mr Chairman, I will have to confess that the arguments are very persuasive for leaving the ranges the way they are for 1990 or for changing them!   Being forced to have to take some [position] here, I would lean a little toward the alternative of reducing [the ranges for] 1990, although I don't know how to sort through how to explain that and how it would be read So, that's a slight but not a strong preference; I could certainly accept leaving the 1990 ranges the way they are Now, I do have a little more definite feeling on 1991 Of course, I agree with continuing to indicate our long-term commitment toward reducing inflation And I would favor 1991 ranges of 2 to 6 percent for M2, 0 to 4 percent for M3; and 4 to 8 percent for debt "
1366,1990-07-02," Mr Chairman, on the national picture our view is not very different from the staff's forecast We see slightly more strength for the rest of the year and about the same for 1991 I don't quite share my friend Bob Black's and others' optimism on inflation I continue to remain a little pessimistic there  With respect to the District, the economic recovery continues but its strength seems to have diminished in the last two months At the May meeting I spoke about how, for the first time in three years, the recovery in the Eleventh District had time finally to spread across all sectors and all geographic regions in the District A    7/2-3/90  definite slowdown has occurred recently, probably in response to the slower growth nationally Our manufacturing industries are still out- performing the nation We actually have slow-to-modest employment growth, but the gains have been concentrated in chemicals and energy- related manufacturing Electronic equipment, apparel, paper and several other sectors that had held up manufacturing strength have slipped recently Defense contractors, of course, have been cutting back heavily In spite of lower energy prices, drilling activity has continued to increase significantly and all the leading indicators suggest that this should continue for several months to come Retail sales have softened and construction contracts have declined Most disturbing, however, is the noticeable slowdown in the service-related sectors This has been an area of persistently strong growth, but the most recent three-month period marks the weakest growth this group of industries has exhibited since a recovery began three years ago In spite of what I've been saying, for some strange reason business sentiment seems to have improved a little lately, perhaps because steady slow growth in a stable, predictable environment has finally come to be viewed as preferable to an uncertain stop-and-go environment Nonetheless, the talk of credit shortages--and I'm not just talking here about real estate nor just for the smallest firms-- is becoming more widespread down our way To keep [my report] balanced, I guess I should say that our directors are probably not quite as optimistic as I am "
1367,1990-07-02," Mr Chairman, I would favor alternative ""B"" Coming into the meeting I had felt that symmetric language would be preferable However, the explanation that you gave would cause me to accept asymmetric language But I do want to say that I agree with about 85 percent of what you said, Governor Angell I share a lot of sympathy for not letting go prematurely just as we're about there I don't know what the next week or week and a half is going to show, but I have a slight uneasiness in the sense that it's almost preordained that there's going to be a downward move shortly That may be necessary and it may be what's called for; I just can't read that But I would accept asymmetry "
1424,1990-08-21," Mr Chairman, as seems to be the case for the nation as a whole, economic conditions in our region are showing signs of slowing There are special factors here and there that keep the overall growth numbers positive After fairly strong employment gains in the first quarter of the year, our three-state District would have experienced employment losses in the second quarter had it not been for a strong growth in government jobs Our manufacturing employment had been growing slightly while conditions nationally deteriorated In the last few months, however, manufacturing employment has declined in each of our three states Weakness has been concentrated in transportation equipment--mainly defense-related--apparel, and electrical equipment While employment gains were experienced in chemicals and petroleum refining, we expect some slowing in these industries with the higher price of energy-related input Employment in the services sector has been extremely weak outside of government employment The government employment gains were for all government entities and were not just related to federal census workers  -18-    8/21/90  In private services, the main areas of strength were in transportation and public utilities, both of which will be adversely impacted by higher energy prices The one area where higher energy prices should help the District economy is in drilling activity, but any positive response that does occur will be with a long lag time First, inflation-adjusted oil prices are only about half the peak level reached in 1981, and the rig count is highly correlated with real oil prices Second, almost half the drilling activity in the Dallas District is for natural gas which has a long way to go before gas prices catch up with oil prices Third, drillers have to be convinced that higher energy prices will persist for several years And lastly, even if everything on the price side fell in place--and as Bob Forrestal found out--we simply do not have the capacity to increase drilling activity since about half of that capacity exited the industry over the last four years I did see on local TV that they reinstituted a rough-neck school out in west Texas to teach people how to drill oil wells So, somebody has a little optimism In the short run, the negative effects of higher energy prices in the District will predominate over the positive effects I might add, however, that the weak picture for retail sales that has existed lately should be helped somewhat by the sharp boost in royalty and partnership income which is proportional to oil prices  Following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, we did do another round of Beigebook contacts As a result, the anecdotal evidence has shifted from [an outlook for] slow but steady growth to one of great uncertainty Even the focus of agriculture down our way has shifted from too little or too much moisture into marketing uncertainties in the new environment With respect to the national picture, I really don't have views that would be considered different from the Greenbook forecast "
1425,1990-08-21," Mr Chairman, I'm fully supportive of your position "
1480,1990-10-02," Mr Chairman, the economy in the Dallas District seems to reflect many of the national trends, but overall we may be doing just slightly better than the nation now The picture is quite mixed, however, and virtually all segments of the region's economy are growing more slowly than earlier in the year The higher energy  -25-    10/2/90  prices help fewer people and hurt more people in our District than was the case years ago So, the net impact is less certain Residential construction activity has shown a modest pickup from the extremely depressed levels of the last several years, but nonresidential construction is flatter now, with the exception of the Houston area Retail sales have shown some very slim gains in recent months The refining petro-chemical business has held up relatively well lately Other areas of manufacturing have been somewhat weak We did meet with our advisory council on small business and agriculture a few weeks ago Our agricultural conditions seem to have improved, certainly in recent weeks Outside of the issue of credit availability, which incidentally is not a new issue with us, the economy may be doing considerably better than it had been over the past several years of meeting with that group  Looking at the national economy, I have no real disagreement with the staff's Greenbook forecast Intuitively, I wonder if the third quarter will be quite as strong as they're indicating, but I would not have a great quarrel with it We don't see any evidence that we're heading into a cumulative downturn As a matter of fact, as I look at Mike's forecast and think about that outcome, it would not be a bad result, if it could actually be accomplished It seems to me that the assumption is that a steady monetary policy would accomplish that result So, in spite of all the uncertainties and concerns, I would tend to pay a bit more attention to the inflation picture rather than [to the possibility of] the economy slipping over too far "
1481,1990-10-02," Well, Mr Chairman, as much as I would like to support what you're recommending, I have some difficulty doing it I guess to me the Greenbook forecast looks a little more realistic than it does to others I'm afraid we might lose sight of the inflation situation I'm more concerned that the timing would be premature by  -54-    10/2/90  several weeks if we did make a move It seems to me that the last 1/4 point move was tied to the credit situation And I have to confess I don't fully understand--we'll discuss it at lunch--but if you do the reserve requirement change, it's to address that That seems to me at least a nod in that direction So, if that is a nod, I would want to wait a while longer and let the economic data come through before doing what is being contemplated So, I would not favor it "
1541,1990-11-13," Well, Mr Chairman, I really don't take much exception to the staff forecast through the first quarter of next year I do wonder a little, as others have, about the bounceback of growth in the second quarter and thereafter on the inflation side I hope it turns out to be the way that it's forecast I guess I have slightly less optimism in that regard  As far as developments in the Dallas District, it does seem that conditions down our way, at least on average, are reflecting the same set of weaknesses that are affecting the rest of the country Higher oil prices are supposed to improve matters in Texas, Louisiana, and New Mexico but so far we're not seeing any of the benefit For example, neither drilling activity nor employment in the oil and gas industries has increased significantly Manufacturing employment is down; construction is down slightly; employment growth is stalling in the private producing sectors; agricultural incomes are lower than expected because of increased fuel costs Government is the only robust sector, and to me that's a bit of a negative Uncertainty is a major factor that seems to be depressing economic activity in the District The volatility in the oil markets leaves oil and gas producers uncertain about the future price of oil and, therefore, cautious about expansion In addition, there seems to be heightened uncertainty about the health of the national economy, interest rates, the tax load, and the possibility of war in the Middle East All of these factors seem to be leading consumers to postpone purchases, particularly purchases of real estate and durable goods  Within the District, growth patterns are very uneven New Mexico, which had been showing the strongest growth of our three states, has shown actual declines in employment and other economic measures through 1990 Louisiana had been laggard in the recovery in the Southwest but has been showing steady growth and improvement Texas, particularly in the last few months, seems to be slowing almost to a standstill We had a joint meeting last week of all four of our boards of directors and the comments made at that meeting certainly confirmed what our statistics are saying There was very little optimism expressed at that meeting In short, the near-term outlook is on the pessimistic side; but looking further out, we can expect to see some improvement only if higher oil prices are sustained "
1542,1990-11-13," I concur, Mr Chairman I do feel a little of the sentiment that Tom Melzer expressed "
1604,1990-12-18," Well, Mr Chairman, about the best that we can say about the Dallas District is that it's pretty flat This is what our statistical evidence is saying and it has been confirmed by our board of directors at our meeting last Thursday and by other anecdotal information that we've been getting lately It is increasingly difficult to find a segment of our District economy that is doing well Most of our contacts are mentioning either mild declines or slight gains Manufacturing activity has been weak, particularly in electronics and defense-related industries Construction activity has picked up slightly, but most of that pickup represents a completion of major petro-chemical projects begun about two years ago Our retailers are telling us that the Christmas season has been slow, with merchandise not moving except at post-Christmas-type discounts Overall, the outlook for the District economy is for little or no growth over the next few months    12/18/90  With respect to the national picture, I certainly would not take issue with Mike's forecast, particularly since he added somewhere along the line that the risks are certainly on the down side "
1605,1990-12-18," I would support your recommendation, Mr Chairman I would also hope that there is a discount rate cut The only comment I would make is that I hope you would exercise considerable discretion in going any further in the intermeeting period unless something very unusual happens "
