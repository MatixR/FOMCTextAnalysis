8584,2008-10-28,"4  I’m referring to the next exhibits that are attached to the material you   are already looking at  Since the September FOMC meeting, financial market distress  has intensified and has spread around the world, threatening many emerging market  economies that previously had been less affected by the US and European credit  crisis  As shown in the top left panel, equity prices have fallen sharply in Europe,                                                     4 The materials used by Ms Kole are appended to this transcript (appendix 4)   October 28–29, 2008 51 of 206    Japan, and the United Kingdom  Indeed, the Nikkei is at a 26-year low today  The  carnage has been just as pronounced in emerging markets, shown on the right  Credit  spreads between industrial countries’ risky corporates and government bonds (plotted  in the middle left panel) soared, especially in the euro area; and as shown in the right  panel, credit default swap premiums on sovereign debt in many emerging market  economies have skyrocketed  The widespread pullback from risk led to safe-haven  flows into dollar assets; as shown in the bottom left panel, the dollar appreciated  nearly 11 percent against the major currencies (the black line) despite a 9 percent  depreciation against the yen (the red line) as carry trades were unwound  The dollar  strengthened 9 percent against the currencies of our other important trading partners   As shown on the right, effective exchange values of the currencies of Brazil, Mexico,  and Korea were particularly hard hit     In your next exhibit, the top left panel shows the extent to which investors fleeing   risk have been liquidating emerging market equity funds  Several foreign  governments, notably Russia’s, have fought related currency pressures by drawing  down their reserves (the top right panel)  For instance, since the peso fell sharply  against the dollar in early October, the Bank of Mexico has deployed 15 percent of its  reserves to shore up its value  China and Russia have even intervened to stem the fall  in their equity prices  Following the collapse of Lehman Brothers, credit markets  seized up, and dollar funding needs intensified  Since then, governments around the  world have taken several steps to support their banking systems (the middle panel)    Some central banks have injected massive amounts of liquidity, and many have cut  policy rates or reserve requirements or both  In addition to the countries joining the  Fed in a coordinated 50 basis point rate cut on October 8, a wide range of other  economies have eased policy lately  Note that there have been a few exceptions  Hungary, Iceland, and Denmark increased rates to counter currency pressures   Governments have also expanded bank deposit insurance and guaranteed new bank  lending in order to improve confidence and liquidity  Following a similar initiative in  the United Kingdom, euro-area governments announced plans to guarantee the  issuance of new medium-term senior debt by banks and to directly assist their  recapitalization if necessary  In recent weeks, authorities have announced capital  injections into a number of banks whose financial soundness was in question  The  swap lines extended by the Federal Reserve to foreign central banks have been  expanded  The ECB approved a €5 billion swap line for Hungary and a €12 billion  one for Denmark, and several Asian countries are currently negotiating swap lines  with each other as well  Private firms in several emerging market economies have  confronted pressures in rolling over foreign currency funding, and authorities there  have also raised deposit guarantees, guaranteed bank lending, and injected capital into  vulnerable banks  Finally, several countries have applied to the IMF for assistance     The bottom left panel shows median credit default swap premiums for banks in   Europe, the United Kingdom, and the United States  The declines since the beginning  of this month suggest that the announcement of these plans has improved confidence  in banks’ safety, even if they have not restored confidence in broader economic  prospects  As shown by the implied OIS forward rates in the bottom middle panel,   October 28–29, 2008 52 of 206    market participants expect considerably more monetary policy easing in Europe than  they did at the time of the last FOMC meeting  We assume that further cuts in  official rates (shown on the right) will be forthcoming as output falls short of  potential and inflation recedes       As can be seen in exhibit 3, highly stressed global financial conditions and the   weaker US outlook have led us to take a whack out of our outlook for foreign  growth  Comparing lines 1 and 2, we have marked down our estimate of total foreign  growth for the third quarter more than 1 percentage point, and we have slashed our  forecast even more for Q4 and 2009  We project outright recessions in the advanced  foreign economies (lines 3 through 7) and in Mexico (line 12)  In other emerging  economies, we foresee growth rates well below potential  Chinese real GDP growth  (line 10) is estimated to have slowed considerably in the third quarter  We expect  some payback in Q4, but beyond that we have revised down our outlook  As can be  seen in the middle left panel, exports fell in August in many of our largest trading  partners, though they still chugged along in China through September  The black line  in the middle panel shows that the volume of exports from Canada has been falling  for some time, but exports had held up in Japan and Germany until the third quarter,  when they fell  Industrial production in Japan (the red line in the middle right panel)  has fallen nearly 5 percent below its year-ago level, and IP has also fallen over the  past year in the United Kingdom and the euro area  As global demand has slumped,  oil prices (the black line in the bottom left panel) have plummeted, and nonfuel  commodity prices have fallen as well  The decline in commodity prices along with  slackening economic activity is projected to help bring down inflation in all of the  regions shown (on the right)       Exhibit 4 focuses on the outlook for Europe  Banks remain leery of lending to   each other, as evidenced by the growing amount of funds parked at the ECB’s deposit  facility  The latest BoE bank lending survey (the top right panel) pointed to further  tightening of UK lending standards in the third quarter and suggested that banks  expected to tighten them somewhat further in the fourth quarter (the striped bars)   Notably, this survey was taken before Lehman failed  A confidential conversation  with a contact at the BoE who had talked with a few bankers more recently suggested  that the latest survey considerably underestimated the recent tightening of standards   The quarterly growth of UK loans to nonfinancial corporations (the red line in the  middle left panel) fell from double-digit paces for the past two years to 5 percent in  the third quarter  Credit expansion to households (the dashed line) declined as well   Loan growth in the euro area (the middle panel) also slowed  Europe has clearly  moved into recession  The middle right panel shows that house prices have fallen  over the past year in the United Kingdom and Ireland and have also slowed in other  European locales  But it is not just the property sector that has slumped  Business  confidence (the bottom left) has disintegrated  Total economy purchasing managers’  indexes (the middle panel) are in the downturn range in both the United Kingdom and  the euro area  Unemployment rates have increased, especially in France and Spain,  where construction activity has slowed sharply       October 28–29, 2008 53 of 206    Your next exhibit takes a quick tour through the rest of the world  In Japan,  business confidence (the red line) has plunged, partly because lending terms faced by  firms, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises, have become more restrictive   Investment intentions (not shown) have deteriorated as shipments (the black line) and  exports have declined  The labor market has deteriorated, with the ratio of job offers  to applicants (in blue) falling to its lowest level in the past four years  The Bank of  Japan recently downgraded its outlook and stepped up measures to deal with financial  market stresses  In China, investment spending (the black dashed line in the top right  panel) continued to be strong through September, and retail sales accelerated   However, industrial production (middle left panel) slowed this summer partly because  of efforts to reduce pollution in Beijing during the August Olympics but also because  of declining steel production, suggesting further slowing  Industrial production has  also slowed in Korea and Taiwan, and export orders (shown on the right) are falling  in China, Brazil, and Singapore  As shown in the bottom left panel, Mexico has  suffered a steep fall in remittances, flattening industrial production, and declining  auto exports  Oil revenues (not shown) are down as well  Finally, global PMI and  new orders indexes, which aggregate data for 26 major countries, are both in  contractionary territory but have not yet reached their depths at the trough of the 2001  recession       Exhibit 6 reviews the main elements of the US external outlook  As shown in   line 1 of the top panel, net exports contributed 18 percentage points to growth in the  first half of this year, but we expect this contribution to drop off considerably in  coming quarters as exports (line 3) slow with foreign growth and imports (line 5)  remain flat  Total foreign growth (the black line in the middle left panel) is now  projected to dip down about as much as US growth, while the dollar (shown on the  right) is well above the level we projected in the September Greenbook  As shown in  line 3 of the table, we now expect export growth to move down sharply starting in the  current quarter and to remain well below what we’d written down in our last forecast   Although lower US demand caused us to lower import growth (line 5), the projected  contribution of net exports to GDP growth has, on net, been revised down a bit over  the forecast period  The bottom panel gives a longer perspective on US external  deficits  The non-oil trade deficit (the dashed orange line) and current account deficit  (the red line) have continued to narrow over the past year and a half although oil  imports have remained large  The current account deficit to GDP ratio is forecast to  fall below 3 percent in 2010, a level last reached in 1998  Brian Madigan will  continue with our presentation       I think that in many of the major foreign countries there is room for fiscal   stimulus  That may be a bit of an upside risk to our forecast because, for example, China has   already put some things in place  They have increased exporter rebates, and they are also putting   more money into homebuilding and trying to prop up the construction industry  Japan just   announced a bigger package  I’m not so sure if it will go through  Korea has announced—and   even some of the oil producers are announcing—plans to put money into the system  I don’t   October 28–29, 2008 64 of 206    think we have fully incorporated that  Maybe we have thought about it in China’s case because   we think that they will do everything they need to do to keep that economy growing at a—    Right  I think that the United Kingdom, too, is expanding fiscal policy    Europe hasn’t really announced much yet, but perhaps they will do more as well  "
