2448,1983-11-14," At this point in the business cycle we're seeing increases that are largely cyclical in nature We try as best we can to look through these increases and see what underlying trend that type of behavior would be consistent with And that's basically how we came up with it Now, you're right, that during the last recession we saw a lot of shedding of labor, a lot of changes that kept productivity growing--even last year during a period when normally it would decline So, to some extent, these developments that you talk about could be once-and-for-all changes in the productivity level that wouldn't become embodied in a continued improvement in the growth rate But to the extent that business is making an attempt to invest in new technology and really change on an ongoing basis some of those undefined things--things that we couldn't define during the '70s very well--then, yes, we could be too pessimistic I think the coming year will be the critical year for evaluating where we are on this productivity path because generally what shows up in the second year of recovery is a sharp deceleration toward a trend rate of growth If we keep getting information that tells us that the productivity is doing better than 1 percent, that will firm up the view that perhaps the trend is changing and could be closer to 2 percent or whatever  Well, certainly, some reversal of the problem of having inexperienced workers contributed to moving [up] 1/2 percentage point to 11 percent Looking ahead, yes, the demographics could help us out a bit There has been an ongoing trend For example, women who entered the labor force in the '60s or '70s now have career attachments to jobs or are staying in the labor force all year and are likely more productive than the new entrants to the labor force That could help us out; that sort of change occurs very slowly and gradually over time  The bulk of the research that was done, as we discussed earlier, was unable to pin that down for the 1970s Most of the research showed that productivity slowed in service industries as well as in manufacturing industries The pattern of the slowdown was at least the same across different types of industries, so we were unable to pin this productivity slowdown on the growing services sector Looking ahead and having the services sector be one of the growing sectors, I'm not sure that that should detract from the things that seem to be important in the productivity slowdown, however undefined they may be There are some technological changes that could affect the services sector as well as manufacturing  That the market could be--  Oh yes, that's a possibility In fact, we have to take into account rising import prices--that there would be domestic goods that compete with imports, and normally you would expect [producers] to be able to raise their prices But if that competition is great, the market is limited and they may not be able to do that  Correct  The staff projection through 1984 has something close to a 5-1/2 percent increase on hourly compensation Now, the data that we've seen on contract settlements so far this year have been on average about 4-1/2 percent, I think, rather than 6 percent But I don't deny that there are some industries that are returning to profitability where workers are going to be looking for larger settlements Within the context of our forecast, in 1984 the petroleum industry bargains in January and then there's nothing very much going on until we get to the auto [industry negotiations] By the time we get to the end of '84, moving into '85, we will start to see some of these contracts turn over where there had been concessions and some recognition that profits were low And we would expect by 1985 to start to see larger wage settlements I haven't thought through exactly what we're going to put down when we extend our forecast, but we would be looking for larger settlements  --the staff projection In the staff projection, we had consumer prices in 1984 up around 5 percent  Chart 18 is not a staff forecast, necessarily  Well, to some extent the Phillips curves in Chart 7 move across the page as the natural rate is rising and shift up to the extent that inflation expectations were higher in the '70s than in the '60s  In the quarterly model?  The quarterly model is in the 6-1/2 to 7 percent area as well; that's the natural rate implicit in the model  Right To the extent that we get better productivity performance, that should lower it And to the extent  -16-    11/14-15/83  that the demographics favor less of the sort of frictional unemployment that was associated with the rapid rise in the labor force in the '70s, that should bring the natural rate down  That weighted average that's on Chart 13 is just geometrically declining weights It's similar to most of the econometric [models with] distributive lags, and that's 4-1/2 to 5 percent  Chart 18 is not the staff projection Chart 18 is the model projection, not the staff forecast as shown in the Greenbook projection Chart 15 represents our forecast  No, as a matter of fact, on income support programs there has been some cutback--more stringent eligibility requirements introduced on unemployment insurance and benefits--which should work to reduce the natural rate Those sorts of things are hard to estimate And to the extent that we have seen some improvement in work rules and labor/management relations, that makes the labor market a little more flexible [Those are] conditions that would help But that has been continuing as the recovery goes on  Well, I think the sharp [deceleration] of productivity growth was far more important in and of itself in the '70s than the demographics, in terms of the percentage points that added to the natural rate On the demographics I think the story is a little uncertain You have to assume that all these workers who have come into the labor force have been getting work experience and have developed career attachments to jobs As that happens they improve their job performance  Oh, in terms of the major unemployment rate, yes "
3652,1989-06-05," [Statement--not transcribed]  Well, on a year-over-year basis there really hasn't been much acceleration in the hourly earnings index For the last year or so we've been seeing quarterly numbers that fluctuate anywhere from 3 to 4 percent And, as Governor Johnson just said, if we were continuing to get more and more widespread shortages we would expect to see more on the wage side We had thought that perhaps some of that supply constraint was showing up in the productivity numbers But I'm not certain we'd be ready to give that interpretation to it right now "
8929,2011-01-25,"4  Thank you  I’ll be referring to the “Material for Briefing on  FOMC Participants’ Economic Projections”   In broad terms, as shown in the top panel of exhibit 1, you are expecting a  sustained recovery in real economic activity over the next three years, marked by a  noticeable step-up in the rate of increase in real GDP this year followed by further  gradual acceleration during 2012 and 2013  Although you anticipate that the decline  in the unemployment rate—the second panel—will remain relatively modest in the  coming year, you project a more noticeable tilt down in joblessness as the expansion  strengthens  Regarding inflation—the bottom two panels—the central tendency of  your projections shows total PCE inflation relatively stable over the next three years   However, your projections show a gradual uptrend in core inflation over the period   Exhibit 2 provides more detailed summary statistics for your projections and  compares them with those that you made in November and with the staff Tealbook  forecast  Starting with the change in your near-term projection since November, as  shown in the first two lines, you have marked up your expectations for the increase in  real GDP this year, with the central tendency now nearly 3½ to 4 percent  Many of  you indicated that the stronger-than-expected data on production and spending that  we have accumulated since November, along with the passage of the fiscal package,  led you to view the recovery as having gained some strength that should carry  through 2011  A number of those who did not change their forecasts significantly  noted that the recent news had led them to shift their assessment of the balance of  risks surrounding their forecasts from weighted to the downside to broadly balanced   That said, the recent news did not alter significantly the central tendencies of your  expectations for the pace of real activity in 2012 and 2013, which call for real GDP to  increase between 3½ and 4½ percent in 2012 and between 3¾ percent and 4½ percent  in 2013  This general pattern of revisions is also reflected in the updates to the  Tealbook forecast since November   Your projections suggest that real GDP will increase at above-trend rates over the  next three years, supported by accommodative monetary policy and improving credit  and financial market conditions  A number of you noted that fiscal policy should  provide some temporary stimulus this year but should be a drag in 2012  Your  narratives indicated that many of you believe that the ongoing expansion will be led  by sustained increases in consumer and business spending, and a number of you  suggested that improvements in household and business confidence and in labor  market conditions should help to reinforce the rise in private demand  Nonetheless,  many of you commented that, while the recovery appears be on a firmer footing, the  headwinds from the limited improvement in the labor market, lingering household  and business uncertainty, and problems associated with the weak housing and  nonresidential real estate markets are likely continue to exert some drag on economic  activity over the forecast period                                                     4 The materials used by Ms Zickler are appended to this transcript (appendix 4)   January 25–26, 2011 79 of 282              Your projections for the unemployment rate—the second set of statistics—trace a  steady downward path over the next three years that is quite similar to the projections  that you submitted in November  The central tendency of your forecasts calls for a  decline from about 9¾ percent at the end of 2010 to 8¾ to 9 percent at the end of this  year and then to 6¾ to 7¼ percent at the end of 2013  The staff Tealbook forecast,  which is also little changed since November, falls in the middle of your central  tendencies   Turning to inflation—the bottom two sets of statistics—you can see that the  central tendencies of your projections for total and core PCE inflation are similar to  those you provided in November  The same is true for the Tealbook, which continues  to forecast inflation at the low end of your central tendencies  As I noted earlier, your  projections suggest an uptrend in core inflation over the 2011-13 period   Nonetheless, more than half of you expect that total PCE inflation in 2013 will  remain below your estimates of its longer-run rate  Some of you noted that the  persistence of a wide margin of slack in resource markets would help keep inflation  relatively low over the forecast horizon  And a number of you indicated that  appropriate monetary policy, combined with well-anchored inflation expectations,  would help keep inflation in check   Your longer-run projections—detailed in the column at the right—continue to  anticipate that, over time, the annual rate of increase in real GDP will converge to  2½ to 2¾ percent, with an unemployment rate of 5 to 6 percent and total PCE  inflation between 1½ and 2 percent  Most of you indicated that this would most  likely occur within five or six years, although a number of you noted that the decline  in the unemployment rate could lag the convergence of the rate of increase in real  GDP and inflation to their longer-run rates  Moreover, the central tendency for your  projections of the unemployment rate in the longer-run remains relatively wide—a  result that is likely consistent with the range of views on structural unemployment  expressed earlier   Regarding your monetary policy assumptions, half of you—a somewhat larger  proportion than in November—conditioned your outlook on a less accommodative  stance of monetary policy than assumed by the staff  Specifically, those respondents  indicated that they thought that the appropriate policy would involve an earlier start to  normalizing the balance sheet than assumed in the Tealbook, an earlier increase in the  federal funds rate, or both   Your final exhibit summarizes your assessments of the uncertainty and the risks  that you attach to your projections  As indicated in the two panels on the left-hand  side of the page, most of you continue to judge that the uncertainty attached to your  projections for both real GDP and inflation—as well as for the unemployment rate  (not shown)—is greater than the level of uncertainty that prevailed on average over  the past 20 years  This judgment was attributed to uncertainty related to the nature of  recoveries from financial crises, the effects of unconventional monetary policies,  structural dislocations in the labor market, the sustainability of fiscal policy, and the  global economic outlook   January 25–26, 2011 80 of 282              Although your level of uncertainty was little changed from the November SEP,  you now view the risks to your forecasts—summarized in the panels to the right—as  noticeably more balanced than in November  In particular, almost all of the  participants who previously saw downside risks to their projected increases in real  GDP now view them as balanced, and several of you now see upside risks to your  forecasts  The most frequently mentioned upside risk to GDP growth was the  possibility that the recent strengthening of private demand marked the beginning of a  more normal cyclical rebound in economic activity  To the downside, a number of  you cited the recent declines in house prices and the problems in real estate markets,  which could have greater-than-expected adverse effects on consumers and on credit  availability, and the possibility of more serious spillovers from fiscal austerity and  sovereign debt problems in Europe   On inflation, the shift in the distribution was similar to that for real GDP, with  several of you moving your assessment from risks weighted to the downside to  balanced risks and with one additional participant now judging inflation risks to be to  the upside  Several of you cited large resource gaps and the possibility of a slower- than-expected economic expansion as downside risks  However, a number of you  commented that you saw the likelihood of deflation or further unwanted disinflation  as having lessened  Some of you noted that highly accommodative monetary policy  posed an upside risk to inflation, and several saw another upside risk in the possibility  that prices of energy and other commodities would continue to increase faster than  anticipated  This concludes my prepared remarks  "
