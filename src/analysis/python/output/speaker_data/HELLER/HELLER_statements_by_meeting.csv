25,1987-08-18," Can I follow up on that one? Both in Germany and Japan, do you see the run-up in rates as mainly a result of policy actions taken or do you see it as a result of general economic conditions in the country changing? "
26,1987-08-18," Michael, in the federal deficit reduction to $123 billion that the Administration is projecting, can you provide us with more details? Is it mainly on the expenditure side or the revenue side?   On your handout, there is a drop from $158 billion to $123 billion, and then you say with policy action--   Thanks   Thank you, Mr Chairman I think the overall numbers, which are rather satisfactory, are good not because the aggregate economy is really good, but because the sectors which have been weak so far are the sectors that are picking up If you keep that in mind, I think the inflation picture also will look a little different than it does when looking at the aggregate economy as a whole We are eliminating the sectoral imbalances in trade and in the government sector as well as in the regional sectors that were pointed out before Overall, I think that makes for a healthier economy because, in essence, we are pulling the weak sectors up without really hurting the strong sectors at the present time Consumers are still moving forward but at a rather subdued 4-1/2 percent pace in the overall forecast And I agree with what President Morris said earlier that the investment picture may actually be a little better than the numbers of 38 to 42 percent next year suggest I'd be slightly more optimistic there, but not all that much On the export front, I think also that our growth will be sustained in the double- digit area; 12 percent in the Greenbook is certainly sounding good  Turning to the price area, because we're having that pickup in sectors that previously were very subdued, we should not experience the burst in prices that would be associated with an overall Phillips curve Therefore, I also think the employment gains which have been achieved are in areas and in sectors, such as manufacturing and agriculture, that were previously very, very depressed indeed Overall, I think the producer price index, as has been pointed out, is rather stable And I agree with what Mr Corrigan just said the final user prices, the GNP prices, are drifting up at a 45 percent rate But then again we have to ask ourselves--this really should be reserved for the next part of our discussion, but let me bring it up-- if we're having monetary growth right now of 5 percent and we're having price increases of 4 to 5 percent, what does that mean for the real economy if you want to make that equation square? I certainly disagree with the view of the world that we're having a zero growth So something else will have to give Either we have to produce a lot more money or price increases will not be sustained at a very healthy consolidation phase of the economy; and I don't really see very major risks on either side   Got the message? "
27,1987-08-18," Basically, I am for no change, as I said earlier I believe that we are in a period of sectoral catchup and the monetary growth is very subdued at the present time So, I would like to keep it at alternative B with a $500 million borrowing target and I would do two changes 1) I would upgrade the importance of inflation, and maybe give it sole prominence in the first sentence; and 2) I would downgrade the dollar, as Presidents Forrestal and Black mentioned earlier We are way above the lows that the dollar reached earlier, and to say that we want to react now to weakness in the dollar would probably be inappropriate   Let me speak on the other side I don't think we're writing here for the press release only; we're talking about the operational paragraph If we have the dollar right up front, as soon as we get the kind of weakness that we are getting now, if sustained for another day or two, it could be seen as an indication that we have to tighten monetary policy And that is not what the majority, at least of the voting members, was agreeing to So, I agree with the Chairman in moving the dollar to a lower position Let me note that it still is in the same sentence We haven't split it into two sentences, as we have done many times before So, it's a very modest downgrading; it's just the order in which we are reading it rather than a cardinal distinction   As long as we don't read a move to 3 to 6 percent as an indication that we are aiming for 4-1/2 percent, or something like that, and that is where the policy should be directed   I think that this is something we should consider sometime in the future That 4 to 8 percent is such a barn door; it's very wide At some future time we may want to narrow that down a little   Wrong direction   $525 million    8/18/87   $536 million is the average!   If you start out with a base of $600 million and then you have the language with the tilt, it gives you a very different environment than if you start with a base of $500 million and have the tilt in $500 million with a tilt in it gets you right to the range where everybody may well want to be--in the $520 to $550 million range, or whatever--while $600 million with a tilt in it would get you a lot closer to--  -36-    8/18/87   Roughly unchanged "
79,1987-09-22," Mike, you spoke about the sharp increases in business equipment spending How does that break down between additional capacity and efficiency enhancing?   Wait a minute You say that interest rates wouldn't be rising; but you can also come up with that scenario of a continued stable dollar that comes about because we are raising interest rates in this country Then, how would your answer be different?   I still think the hallmark of the recovery is really a better balance in the economy as a whole The sectors that have been strong in the past are not growing quite as rapidly, or are actually shrinking, and I think that is something that we should keep in mind If you look, for instance, at the projections in the Greenbook for 1987 and 1988, you still see quite a few minus signs Durables are contracting this year at a 23 percent rate; nondurables are only up 08 percent; nonresidential structures are -27 percent; residential structures are -55 percent; and federal spending is -32 percent So, there are quite a few sectors that are certainly not characterized by boom conditions, while others like agricultural, business equipment, and so on, are doing quite well As a result, you get that better balance Also, as many speakers pointed out, the great improvement in federal revenues, together with the restrained federal spending, really does a lot on the fiscal deficit side and brings a better balance on that score I think it would be a mistake to hold up the dollar with further tightening of monetary policy, because we would be inviting a slowdown in those sectors that, at the moment, are really carrying the economy real estate would be further depressed, and the capital sector would slow down And, we also need the exchange rate change that is projected in the Greenbook in order to get that improvement in the trade balance that we are all hoping for  Turning to the the long-term bond question, I agree with most of the things that have been said before, but let me add one additional factor If you look at the increase in interest rates that we have had over the last year, you see that there were noticeably sharper increases in the long-term Treasury bonds than in long-term mortgage bonds and long-term corporate bonds I would put a lot of that, which amounts to 50 to 100 basis points, at the door of the many  -30-    9/22/87  debt moratoriums that we have had, or the nonrenewal of the debt ceilings, in the last five months I think there have been four of those episodes; and that certainly must have a chilling effect, particularly on foreign investors who are looking at the United States with a jaundiced eye and putting us in the same league with countries that can't service their debt So, that certainly has been a factor contributing to higher long-term Treasury rates in addition to the real increase and the high inflationary premium we have had "
80,1987-09-22," I fully agree with these last remarks I think we are at $500 million and, therefore, we should probably stay around $500 million rather than do further tightening Let me make one further remark some data that I have just scratched up indicate that, yes, there have been [similar] episodes before As a matter of fact, there is a precise duplication of our current situation as far as the exchange rate changes are concerned And that is that Germany and Japan, between 1980 and 1985, had exactly the same drop in exchange rates What was their policy? The discount rate was lowered in Japan from 7-1/4 percent in 1980 to 5 percent in 1985; in Germany it dropped from 7-1/2 percent to 4 percent in that period of declining exchange rates Interest rates on three-month money dropped from 11 to 6-1/2 percent in Japan and from 9 to 5 percent in Germany As for the one thing that we all worry about--inflation--the CPI in 1980 in Japan was 8 percent and in 1985 it was 2 percent; in Germany it went from 54 to 22 percent So, I don't think that the exchange rate really should be driving our policy And in Germany and Japan, which successfully navigated that period, the exchange rate certainly wasn't taken as a cause to tighten monetary policy   In real terms what?   They what?   Real interest rates you are saying? I haven't looked at real rates; so far they have always been--   So taking that into account--and for me it is important not to get overly tight on the exchange rate question--I would go with the $500 million, which is current policy, I would argue  -35-    9/22/87   Mr Chairman, did you have symmetric language in there?   I didn't catch it   Are they both ""somewhat""? "
135,1987-11-03," Let me go back for a second to Germany I think you are quite right There has always been a split between the    11/3/87  Finance Ministry and the Bundesbank The Finance Ministry, as well as all the regional presidents of the State Central Banks, has always wanted to have a strong dollar because they were more concerned about the employment effects, while the Bundesbank clearly was more concerned about inflation I think it is questionable whether President Poehl would have a majority on that council if he wanted to have a policy that would defend the exchange rate at the present time So, in essence, he has to give in to a majority on his governing board As far as the dollar is concerned, however, I disagree with you a little, Jerry The danger of the dollar falling out of bed has been very substantially reduced during the last week because we now have [an exchange rate against the mark of about] 170, and not even the [unintelligible] that will go below 160 When you are on the high perch, the danger of falling is not much higher; so a freefall becomes less and less of a likelihood because the markets will support the dollar at some level I think we are getting reasonably close to that level   Like the stock market, I think it's going to bounce back   Well, 4 to 8 is closer to zero "
136,1987-11-03," One number that surprised me a little in the Greenbook--especially the contrast between the 1988 number and the 1987 number--was the capacity utilization in manufacturing, which is inching up If you look at producers' durable equipment, it is still going up at a rate that is in excess of real GNP The unemployment rate, as you pointed out, is leveling off Is the driving force just the composition of imports--that they have such a heavy weight in manufacturing? Or what explains the increase in the utilization rate?   But that's higher than your GNP number That's precisely the point   At the last meeting, I argued that we were moving toward a much better balance in the real economy and I think that is still on track I think we now are moving also toward a better balance in the financial economy While there is uncertainty around, we have eliminated some of the excesses that Frank Morris was taking about a minute ago If you look at the stock market, after all, we came from a high of over 2700, so the glass has been drained by about 25 or 30 percent but it is still three quarters full And that is not a bad position Essentially, we are back to where we were at the beginning of the year In one fell swoop, we have wiped out inflation, or sharply reduced inflationary expectations, and that has given us a lot more breathing room on the interest rate front as well And now I think what's in train is a better balance in the world economy as well, with exchange rates now getting very close to levels that would be sustainable on a long-term basis; and the imbalances in the world economy will be reduced, as a lot of people have talked about before By the way, on the budget deficit side, the lower interest rates also clearly will help in holding the budget deficit to approximately current levels And nobody has been talking about the threat of protectionist legislation; that has also gone away, I think, to a large extent So, I think there are a couple of bright spots in a gloomy situation that we shouldn't overlook I agree that there is all this uncertainty but, if we keep following that path, I think we will see the light of day pretty soon "
137,1987-11-03," I'm also in favor of ""B"" and I like the Corrigan language Like Mr Keehn, I'd go with the asymmetrical version But on the fed funds rate, I think we should narrow it just a bit You know, 5 to 9 percent--that's a barn door I think the old practice of centering it around the expected value is useful So if we narrow it a little--and everybody seems to be saying 6-3/4 percent--and insert 5-3/4 to 7-3/4 percent we have a 2 percentage point range rather than a 4 percentage point range Maybe that gets a little of that feeling in there without moving to a very narrow fed funds rate specification   Well, I'm in favor of making policy clear rather than obfuscating   It's a very minuscule point in the draft directive with the brown [Class I] cover, lines 20-21, we say ""business capital spending was strong in the third quarter and forward indicators pointed to continuing gains"" I think that's a little strong It's certainly getting a lot slower Maybe we could just drop ""forward indicators pointing to continuing gains""   Yes, ""pointed""   Yes but pointed to continuing gains, though   Well, I certainly misread it and I think others may misread it too   Well, mine is not a strong feeling but I just thought there was a--   I think it sets the wrong tone a little; that ""continuing gains"" is what bothers me Maybe you want to say And while forward indicators pointed to continuing gains, this is no longer true "
188,1988-03-29," Thank you I also have very much enjoyed reading the papers But I think there's a semantic unresolved conflict that becomes apparent--in the paper itself, too--that's at the bottom of what both Manley Johnson and President Black have been talking about For instance, if you look at page four, it is very clearly stated that fluctuations in the funds rate can at times ""lead to a misperception of the Federal Reserve's intentions"" That's at the top of the page And on the next page it is argued that ""Movements in the federal funds rate can convey information to policy makers about expectations and other aspects of financial market conditions"" And then it says a little lower down that ""A narrow focus on the funds rate tends to smother such market-generated reactions"" Either we see the fed funds rate as a signal to the markets or we see the rate as a signal to us If we are trying to get both types of signals out of the same number, or we perhaps get the two of them confused, I think that we do have a bit of a problem  The second point is that I find it very difficult to believe that a $200 million or $250 million borrowing target is something that is so precise that we can steer the entire economy with it It is something that is so minuscule in comparison to the markets that I continue to marvel at the good job that we are doing on it The seasonal factors and the other things that influence our required reserves are just overwhelmingly large compared to that small number And then we are arguing here in the Committee about going from $200 or $225 million--you know, it's just something so small in the entire economy that I find it difficult to believe that that is really the entire fulcrum on which we can influence what happens in the country at large There's also the problem that the reluctance to borrow sometimes--I guess you can have the converse as well--would very strongly influence the $200 million dollar number, as we have seen in the last couple of weeks and months in connection with the Texas situation  Overall, I must say that I'm very satisfied with what has actually happened And so I'm torn here We have a procedure, but I don't really fully understand why it is producing the good results-- results that I like There hasn't been a convincing argument, I think, as to what brings that about On the other hand, I'm reluctant to say let's get rid of this procedure if it will continue to produce these good results But I'm not convinced that it will actually do that Suddenly, we may be off the track and we may be flying that airplane right into the ground And we'd still be wondering what happened, because we had such a nice borrowing target, but somehow or another the whole growth path of the aggregates isn't doing what we'd like it to do  Now, there are really two papers in front of us--one by Ms Meulendyke, in which there is a nice quick discussion of the procedures that existed in the 1970s It says the FOMC ""instructed the Desk to raise the federal funds rate within a limited band if the monetary aggregates were well above the tracking path or lower the funds rate within that band if the aggregates were below the tracking path"" It sounds an awful lot like what Mr Melzer has proposed, except that he was talking about the monetary base instead of the aggregates But there isn't a lot of discussion about why that  -13-    3/29/88  procedure was abandoned It just says factually that in 1972 modifications were made and, like many of us, I wasn't there I'd really like to have heard a bit more about why that particular procedure would be an unsatisfactory one I guess that's perhaps something Mr Sternlight can enlighten us on   Because there was a reluctance to adjust in order to--in essence, we were not following this early 1970s procedure the way it was laid out?   So, it wasn't a bad procedure, you would argue It was sort of a lack of moral fiber that--   ""After you, fellow"", right?   Well, you're talking about slightly different things I think Jerry is talking about getting rid of the monetary growth targets totally, right?   And you're thinking that, too?  -20-    3/29/88   You're keeping it, right?   So you have that little thing that goes up and down It's like a little boat, and you have enormous waves bobbing it up and down We don't know; we say as long as we stay two feet above water, we're fine   You have the shortest commute   If I look at the chart here correctly, in 1985 there were 10 changes in the borrowing assumption Were they all phone calls? They weren't all FOMC meetings; were they phone calls?   Yes   And they're plotted here as official changes?   But how can you have an official change without a vote being taken?   Oh, I see   Yes   Yes, the box   And what is plotted here?   Borrowing assumption by the Committee or by the Desk?   Without a Committee vote?   No, no, I just--  -32-    3/29/88   I was just asking for the facts; I wasn't trying to criticize anything I was just trying to find out the factual information as to whether the line here reflected Committee votes or whatever you actually put into the path   What was actually in the path   Well, I was looking at the chart because I thought these were Committee votes   But there's a difference between long-run and short-run policy, too I think Jerry was addressing that earlier If you're setting your long-run monetary growth targets, and in order not to change your long-run policy you're making a short-term adjustment-- let's say in borrowing targets--to get closer to that, you can argue that your long-run policy is unchanged, and therefore, you've got to change your short-term tactics I think that's where the ambiguity comes in "
189,1988-03-29," I think I would agree with the pretty satisfactory description of the overall economic growth picture, of unemployment, and the good investment outlook as well Some people have pointed to some weakness And, while we are making enormous strides in the external sector, let's remind ourselves that we still have a long way to go there Therefore, we can't let the domestic boomlet get totally out of hand, because we have to shift resources to the export sector in the years to come to get that external imbalance removed On inflation, there is one number that nobody has really talked about much--I'm glad I was able to look over Mike Kelley's shoulder and take it away from him--   The Producer Price Index hasn't moved at all for the last half year, and I think it's important to keep it that way The price pressures that others here have been talking about are certainly there--for example, in the metals sector Monetary growth is higher than we have targeted and the dollar is under pressure So, while I am very satisfied with the overall operation of the real economy, I think it is important to keep it that way "
190,1988-03-29," Let me just ask a quick question, which has to do with the same problem I was talking about before We have fed funds rates still at fairly high limits I'm not talking about current policy now, but what if you wanted to have a fed funds rate around 3 or 4 percent? If we're close to that [unintelligible] barrier, as far as the borrowing is concerned, what's going to do it?  SPEAKER(?) Discount rate   Yes   Well, yes But I always-- "
229,1988-05-17," I'd like to get back to the middle of the target range for the monetary aggregates--not do it instantly, but gradually I fully agree with the Chairman's views alternative B with asymmetric language and $100 million on borrowing   At some point--you feed it in slowly   It's drifting up   Yes, that's good   Are you talking about the Committee or the whole group?   Two weeks ago   I found both papers very interesting and really helpful I think it would be very confusing to the public at large, and especially to Congress, if we had two different types of monetary control procedures--one a target and the other one a constraint If  -22-    5/17/88  we ask ourselves why monetary targets were introduced in the first place, they were certainly not introduced or requested by Congress because they thought those were just some guidelines that we could flop over and under There was clearly the intent that they be some kind of constraint, however binding And if we suddenly introduce a second set of numbers--one set a constraint and one set a target--I think the public legitimately will ask what we are doing Which one do you really take seriously? So the confusion that would result, I think, would be great I think it would be useful, however, to include the monetary base among the other monetary targets, but I'd treat it on the same level as the existing targets And one thing that's important, too, is what Don Kohn was saying--namely, that the behavior is likely to change once you introduce it as a target For certain, once you introduce it as a constraint, the old statistical relationships probably won't hold anymore In any case, that's where I would come out I'd treat the two the same I'd be in favor of having something on the short end, and because M1 probably misbehaves a little more than the base, the base is the better candidate at the short end of the spectrum   Well then, let's rename all the targets; let's call them all constraints or something like that You know, I take the range seriously as [the growth rates] get closer to the borders, it influences the way I vote on the current monetary targets But I don't take them as an absolute, if all other things would indicate going the opposite way As President Morris was saying earlier Would you go voluntarily into a recession that would otherwise not be necessary only to stick to that constraint? And the answer would be no Immediately, you already set up these escape clauses too So, I think they are very much the same as the monetary targets; and if they're not the same, then we should take the monetary targets as seriously as we take the constraint I'm in favor of looking at it; among the various options that you have there, I would be strongly inclined not to call them two different things   Yes, Mike is saying you look at the first month, but then you're really--   But the demand for money has gone through--  -35-    5/17/88 "
264,1988-08-16," Mr Truman said part of what I wanted to say, but I think there's an important distinction between the types of intervention The kind that just dribbles $50 million in every day, which seems to me at least to have virtually zero effect, is the kind of intervention that shows up in the Jurgensen Report as having very little effect On the other hand, if you're hitting a one-way market with a certain relatively large intervention, then you really get the market impact that you're talking about But I think what you've got to ask is whether by doing that you're also creating uncertainty I think you are And by creating the uncertainty you're reducing the incentive to take positions, because they're built on the one-way certainty Then you've got to ask yourself the broader question of whether a central bank is contributing to increasing or decreasing the uncertainty Clearly, we like to think that we are moving the market towards the ultimate equilibrium, thereby somehow or other reducing fluctuations But I think that is really tough to substantiate econometrically because you're dealing by necessity with small samples and periods that are very difficult to compare   Yes, but, Sam, that is not the relevant number for intervention purposes What is relevant, I think, is the size of the open position in the market   And clearly no one knows, but that's what you're trying to do   Did you say bond markets were down 3/4? "
265,1988-08-16," I was wondering whether Ted Truman could say a few more words about the economic, and particularly the monetary policy, assumptions that he has underlying the dollar forecast in other countries, especially Japan and Germany?   What they will do in the future or they--   Thanks   Let me start out by observing that there's an enormous difference between the tone of this discussion and the tone of the discussion that you would hear, for instance, in the OECD economic policy committee or WP3 When foreigners are talking about the United States these days it is generally with admiration Gee, I wish I were in your shoes--with the possible exception of the Japanese I listen to this discussion here, and it is probably the most pessimistic discussion I've heard for the last two years around this table I'm not exactly sure what accounts for that difference except that people look a lot more skeptically at their own future  Overall, I still think everything is going more or less according to plan If you look at the various components of GNP, we continue to have the best progress in the export sector and the investment sector, and that's exactly the way it should be We had growth last quarter of gross domestic purchases of 11 percent If you look at the projections out--23, 14, 27, 17, and 12 percent-- they are all in that ballpark range So, certainly it's not going to be a runaway economy in any sense of the word Yes, there are certain    8/16/88  areas where we do see shortages; quite a few people have talked about skilled labor shortages But I fail to see how a tight monetary policy will produce more skilled workers to alleviate that particular shortage  Actually, I saw a very interesting article produced by the Chicago Fed research department that was arguing essentially that the wage pressures wouldn't be as pronounced as many people were going to expect I don't like the PPI increases any more than anybody else; I think that is a worrisome index indeed But on the other hand, as Governor Angell just pointed out, the commodity prices which are even further down the pike, are again very well behaved and roughly on the level that they were exactly one year ago I think the difference between the GNP deflator and the fixed-weight price index isn't only due to base periods and things of that sort It's due to the fact that Americans are smart and they are shifting away from the expensive products to the less expensive products As a result, actual inflation is less than the inflationary pressures which are emanating from some sectors  The dollar continues to be strong as well I think overall if you have to make a judgment on whether you really want a much stronger economy, you would say no Do you really want a much weaker economy? I certainly would say no And, therefore, I've come up with the conclusion that we shouldn't tinker all that much   If you're looking at the Federal Reserve index, it's within a fraction of a percentage point from the level a year ago Is that correct?  -26-    8/16/88   Especially some indexes that are weighted   Domestic "
266,1988-08-16," Obfuscation   I think the problem that a lot of people perceive--and that's why it's on the table for a third time I guess-- is precisely the problem that Joan was describing earlier, where the market was perceiving one thing and then the Federal Reserve was almost led along the path by the market And unless we chose to do the opposite, in essence, we were caught And that, I think, made some people uncomfortable  I think the other problem is that quite often you do have these technical problems Recently, there haven't been any technical operating problems; but get a computer failure or encounter rainstorms in certain areas of the country, and borrowings are all over the map, and as a result, it gets difficult to really see what's going on In addition, as Don Kohn was talking about, the reluctance of bankers to borrow or maybe a tighter administration of the window--which has not been suggested recently, but had been raised earlier--was perhaps influencing the amount that was actually being borrowed  I think overall I'd be in favor of moving closer, as President Melzer said just a minute ago, to the reserve targeting, because that's what we ultimately want to do Obviously, there are problems [with that approach] too So, if we can devise a procedure that gets us to a 5 or 6 on Ed Boehne's scale, I'm certainly willing to listen But technically I haven't exactly figured out what that procedure would be   But, Mr Chairman, the one thing that you can't fail to wonder about is why the relationship is better again than it used to be Maybe it is because we are doing something close to fed funds targeting And in that environment, you may see the money supply and GNP relationship being reestablished And [perhaps] as soon as you start controlling ""M"" again then that relationship will tend to break down the famous Goodhart's law   Yes, but in a short-term operational sense   When I joined the Board somebody told me that alternative ""B"" was always the correct one I'm grateful to the staff that there are alternatives ""B"" and ""C"", so ""B"" is still the correct one   You've got to make it easy I'm happy to support alternative ""B"" And I think the Ms are right in the middle of the target range; that's very good I think we should avoid  -39-    8/16/88  adopting a stop-go policy so we are not overdoing it on the tight side and see that danger would be there I think I'd go along with Governor Angell on giving the monetary aggregates a bit more prominence I'm not sure I want to move it to the first spot, but somewhere in the middle is fine I think that that would be very good in front of foreign exchange and domestic financial markets Overall, I support $600 million borrowing and I'd prefer symmetric language but be happy to go along with asymmetric   You say 3-1/2 and 5-1/2? "
315,1988-09-20, We'll take it!  END OF MEETING     
316,1988-09-20," I agree with your recommendation   Keep us [unintelligible], right?   The sandwiches aren't made yet "
372,1988-11-01," Can I make a comment?   You know the dollar is falling, and it's now [blamed] on the weak US economy Late last year, the dollar was falling and it was blamed on the strong US economy because it meant that more imports were being sucked into the country and therefore the  -12-    11/1/88  dollar had to go down I'm getting a little confused, not by what Mr Cross was saying but by the way the world is reacting One day undoubtedly the dollar will be falling, and we will be called upon to tighten policy which undoubtedly will send the economy a little bit further down, and presumably the dollar will go up   It's probably the differential between the two larger--   Probably it's the differential between the two that counts, right?   I think the only thing I meant to say was that we shouldn't overdo it It's all that Mr Cross and Mr Truman were saying earlier also in response to Lee Hoskins I really agree with the way you present the case We shouldn't overdo it as far as the  -15-    11/1/88  strength of the economy and the dollar are concerned And I think one very important factor in the current dollar slide clearly was the disappointing trade numbers released a month ago I'm not sure whether the slide started on that day or roughly a week or-- I think it started a day or two earlier because there were some reports that the numbers were going to be bad   But your 1 percent market limit must limit it to some extent, even to less than 50   Do you have an idea where that--   Well, that's different "
373,1988-11-01," Well, it's getting pretty late, and I really have nothing to add, so I'll pass Thank you "
374,1988-11-01," Don, how long do you think that that slowdown in Ml and also to an extent in M2 can be sustained without really having an impact on the real side? You talked a bit about velocity, but if you're looking at M1, we're really looking at zero growth out for the period that you're talking about   You can argue the other way around, too You can stretch a rubber band only so far, or you're taking up the slack that really exists there   How about the takeover activity, how does that affect the--   Thanks   I can certainly support that suggestion You didn't say anything about the federal funds rate associated with it I would hope that would be back into the middle of the range that we  -45-    11/1/88  had anticipated for the federal funds rate when we approved the last directive   Thanks   What I'm really saying is supporting the funds rate at somewhere, well at about 1/8th   Abstain "
433,1989-03-28," Peter, I heard you use a term a little earlier that I think I have never heard used before the indexed level of borrowings   No, I understand that But it is not formally indexed or linked to any other variables   Okay I thought you had some construct there   Thanks   So move  -11-    3/28/89 "
434,1989-03-28," If you look at many models in their unadjusted state--just running the pure models whether they're monetarist or  -15-    3/28/89  [unintelligible]--over a fairly broad spectrum they tend to come up with a negative growth rate in the first half of next year And then you judgmentally massage the models The main difference that I can see is whether the conditions that are implied tend to have no recession How confident are you that the no recession scenario is judgmentally right--that it will prevail over the simple unfettered models?   How low do they get there?   How would you describe the path at the beginning?   And real?   Well, the skepticism is whether the errors will average out over the--  -16-    3/28/89   Thanks, Don   A lot of that activity is in the District of Columbia as well   Mike Kelley wants to speak   I think the general reluctance, Mr Chairman, is indicative of the fact that we all like where we have been and we don't like where we are going Maybe Mike Prell said it best when he said we're in danger of overshooting the runway and when you overshoot the runway you tend to get stuck in the mud or something So, with regard to the general picture of the economy that's unfolding here, I'm not particularly fond of the declining investment activity, which doesn't build additional capacity nor of the export picture not being as good as it could be, although we continue to make progress I see the export picture mainly as a problem of different regions in the world economy and relative exchange rates rather than our absolute exchange rate levels towards Europe We are in an approximate balance now or actually are running very, very small surpluses, but [not] toward Japan and Korea; obviously that's where the problems are located And I'm not sure that exchange rate changes are the right way to go at that particular problem So it isn't going to be very pleasant But it's all we've got, right?   Sounds better than anything else, right? "
435,1989-03-28," I think President Black gave my speech; I'm for ""B,"" asymmetric "
498,1989-05-16," Thank you First of all, I think it is a good time for us to accumulate reserves We are not--well, I don't want to speak about what's going to happen later today--but I certainly wouldn't think that we are ready to ease in a very major fashion at the present time Neither are the Germans and Japanese ready to tighten Those policy moves would be counterproductive as far as helping the international adjustment process is concerned, which is still a very major problem confronting the world economy So, while the basic principle that one shouldn't undo with the right hand what the left hand is doing is certainly valid, I think we have a classic situation here where we have an external problem on the one hand and various domestic problems on the other hand that call for different policies With intervention you can overcome some of those difficulties and try to reconcile those conflicting goals But I do have also a very quick question In the data, Mr Cross, you have    5/16/89  Japanese yen holdings of $11 billion; does that include the special transaction with Japan? Is that already in there?   Okay, thanks   Sorry, I meant to say also that I'm in favor of Ed Boehne's suggestion to give a broader limit   Mr Chairman, what is the proper way to go for the $18 billion? Should we amend that motion now?   Okay, I'd like to amend the motion to $18 billion   Ed Boehne doesn't even second the amendment  SPEAKER(?) He can't vote   That's all right   Aye   Nevertheless, we got the votes   Going back for a second to the primary dealers In total, how many are foreigners and do you have any idea about their rough market share as far as trading volume is concerned?   Associated or whatever? "
499,1989-05-16," Mike, what did you say? I didn't hear you By the end of the year--   Thank you, Mr Chairman I don't have much to add on the US economy but let me just call your attention to developments abroad because they do have a significant impact Overall, I think you can say that after a surprisingly strong 1988 foreign economies are now slowing down as well In particular, you see a significant weakness in industrial production in our major trading partners where about half the monthly changes now are in the negative range among the 10 leading industrialized countries At the same time inflation abroad has been higher than expected, which is leading to a tightening of policies by many of our trading partners And that is partly due to the oil price increases and partly due to the exchange rate deterioration that they have seen in the past Add to that weakness abroad the rather strong dollar at the present time and I think we will see a significant slowdown in export growth While last year we were comfortably in the double-digit range as far as real export growth was concerned, it is probably going to slip to something in the 3 to 5 percent range by early next year So, that means that our strongest single sector in the economy will be a lot weaker than it has been in the past Combine that with the tight monetary policies and low M growth and I think we'll see a very, very shallow expansion indeed "
500,1989-05-16," Excuse me for asking the question maybe in a slightly different way from the way it has been asked before The Greenbook built in a 3/4 percentage point increase in the fed funds rate   You're putting in a $100 million technical adjustment in the borrowing   And yet you are projecting a rather significant turnaround in monetary growth Would you tell me what brings that about? I don't quite get it Maybe that's an easier way to answer the question about what caused the very significant drop in the Ms, especially Ml, that we were seeing before and the flatness and more recent drop in M2   I'm sorry, that still is my question, in a way Now we're going to increase the fed funds rate more   The Greenbook--   The Greenbook is the same as the ""C"" alternative   Endogenous, right?   What?   Okay, thanks   I'm a little confused about what current restraint means Does it mean the fed funds rate or does it mean the money growth that is currently underway or does it mean the borrowing, which it has been suggested should be revised upward? I favor alternative B if it means keeping the fed funds rate at about 9-3/4 percent, with symmetric language I would not throw in the $100 million more [on borrowing] if it could possibly be interpreted as meaning a move up in the fed funds rate  -41-    5/16/89   No, but I mean if it could be interpreted by the Desk as leaning toward restraint Mr Chairman, you indicated earlier in your remarks that this was the time to watch the Ms carefully You also said that you didn't want to change the order [in the directive]; but if the order means anything, then I think this is the time to give the aggregates a little more prominence, maybe   It goes inflation, then expansion, then the Ms   How about adding--   How about adding ""and in particular the behavior of the monetary aggregates""?   Well, but you keep the order and then give it some additional emphasis   Sure   But that doesn't get published, right?   Oh, that Okay   Mr Chairman, why don't we change it to $550 million?   I think the Committee's exactly down the middle   [Unintelligible] "
