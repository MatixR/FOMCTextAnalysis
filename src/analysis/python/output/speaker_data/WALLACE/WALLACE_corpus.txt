  No, Mr Chairman, it really wasn=t  Conversations between our staff and   members of the New York Bank staff indicate that changes are being made to correct the  difficulties that we pointed out  I believe Miss Young from our staff, who did this examination,  and Mr Ozog at New York have worked out whatever these differences were  So I think Mr  Volcker=s comment is correct       Bob, if I could comment on that particular question  Our staff is looking at  a side issue of this and that is the possible development of a System-wide facsimile transmission  system that would be far superior to anything that we have now      May I ask a question for clarification on this natural rate of unemployment? With respect to the factors that you've listed on chart 8 here Is it your assumption that on balance the thrust of those factors would reduce the natural rate in the year ahead rather than the productivity that you talked about?   Jim, the retained earnings of corporations have apparently been an important factor recently in holding down the rise in interest rates I notice in the flow-of-funds tables that this has changed or is changing in the second half of '83 Has that changed or has the financing gap become positive at this point?   I was looking at line 6 on the highlights in table 1   Mr Chairman, I could echo the kind of bullish report that you heard from Bob Forrestal and Jerry Corrigan as far as our District is concerned Of course, I'm talking primarily about the state of Texas; the recovery is very much in evidence there It was fueled initially by the construction industry, which remains a strong element of that recovery, at least on the commercial construction side I think residential construction has plateaued at this point but now we're seeing strength developing more generally from the industrial side of the economy That is in evidence in such industries as aluminum, copper, and steel; and although the evidence in the high-tech electronics industries is spotty, that is still a source of strength And we're beginning now to see some evidence of recovery in the energy sector though, of course, it's also not as much as in the District economy generally But we are seeing evidence in the variables we tend to look at such as the active rig counts, which have shown a 23 percent increase since July, and the seismic crew counts in the District, which have increased 20 percent since September This is occurring throughout the four-state region that we look at but, again, primarily in Texas So, there is evidence of some upturn in activity in that industry That does not indicate that we will see relief any time soon in the sense that some of the bad loans in regional banks that have been very much in the news recently will necessarily get paid off, but at least over a long period of time it should provide some relief there The services side of the energy industry is still very much depressed--the mud suppliers, the welders, the truckers and all that goes along with it That has not shown any evidence of picking up yet Of course, this is attributable to several things but it's not attributable to any prospect, at least at this point, of higher oil prices It seems to be resulting from lower production costs and the fact that the economy in general is showing some increased strength Certainly, the weakest part of our economy at the moment continues to be the border region, which I think we would have to say is still in a state of depression There has been some improvement in the economy in the El Paso region but not in areas farther down such as Laredo, Brownsville, McAllen, and so on Those cities are flat on their backs The city of Laredo at this point has  -46-    11/14-15/83  the distinction of having the highest unemployment among those cities recorded in the labor statistics  We have noticed some curious activity in certain parts of the District One of the questions that you raised with us when you were down there last week was about land prices, and we talked with a few people in this area Some prices of raw land are being bid up on the basis of the prospective development of retail strip shopping centers and that sort of thing We've uncovered a few instances of land changing hands as often as 3 or 4 times a day in this process, which we hope is not a usual situation, but that was the latest--   It could be  SPEAKER(?) But not in Texas   For example, there are instances of land as far as 25 miles out from the central business district of Dallas where prices have been bid up to $5 to $6 dollars per square foot on the anticipation that these properties will be prime sites for shopping center developments and that kind of thing That, of course, would be along major highways One of the members of our staff attributes this to unsophisticated developers being fueled by unsophisticated lenders, primarily in the thrift industry Unfortunately, this is not a very favorable development But I think on balance the economy of the Eleventh District is very strong at this point, and I certainly would agree with Jerry Corrigan's comment that the risk is on the up side, and I think we will continue to see increasing inflationary pressures in the months ahead   I don't want to leave you with the impression that this is a common everyday occurrence; on the other hand, I don't know that it's not either   That's right $5 to $6 dollars a square foot is $250,000 to $300,000 an acre   Mr Chairman, if I may be permitted a somewhat different view I come out very supportive of the position that Governor Wallich just expressed, although I think that perhaps some move is called for It is becoming increasingly clear that the recovery is more robust than we expected earlier, and I think that combined with the prospects of continued high deficits will put upward pressure on interest rates, notwithstanding Secretary Regan's position I think we will see increased inflationary pressures As Governor Partee has observed, inventory building is going to continue; the inventory/sales ratio is low; corporate retained earnings are ceasing to be a factor holding rates down So, I'm inclined to  -56-    11/14-15/83  believe that the best thing that we can do now is to let the funds rate move up closer to the 10 percent level and send a signal to the market that we continue to be concerned about future inflation Therefore, I would come out in favor of a "B-" position or "B" perhaps with a higher borrowing assumption that would carry a clear indication that we would like to see the funds rate move higher I might add parenthetically that my preference would be to see the record stated in terms of that rate But knowing that that's not an option we have, I would opt for "B" or "B-"   Mr Chairman, I want to raise a question with Jim about his forecast that is unrelated to the trade issue Jim, you've mentioned that your forecast is based on an assumption of a $16 oil price by early 1987 Are you assuming that there will be stability at that level and that that will be reflected in economic activity in 1987--that is, increased exploration and drilling and so on? Our people, for example, feel that there's going to be some considerable lag before an increased oil price is really going to be felt in the economy   Mr Chairman, as you know, we have supported a further discount rate cut and, therefore, I would support the approach that others have expressed around the table However, in the absence of that, in view of what I would regard as continued weakness in the economy--especially from where I sit--I would favor an action such as alternative A I think we should use this window of opportunity to let interest rates move down further before we are faced with the reality of a resurgence in the inflationary [unintelligible] But if the discount rate cut is in prospect, then I would favor [that]
