 I would like to draw an analogy As you may know, we use the  VAR model to measure market risk The danger is that this analysis does not cover potential  losses in extremely volatile situations In those markets we have to do stress testing to uncover  what exposures are there The same distinction is important here, and I think it lies at the heart  of the problem LTCM is using a VAR-type model, the same basic technology as our VAR, to  measure potential future exposure But that model estimates exposure in normal markets on the    9/29/98  basis of one-day movements, perhaps at a 95 percent confidence level It does not deal with the  kind of markets we are seeing today The latter are extremely volatile and currently very illiquid  For example, Peter Fisher talked about equity option positions Now, suppose investors have to  close those positions out and try to replace them by going into the market There is no liquidity  whatsoever in that market It is completely illiquid I think this emphasis on initial margin  actually is misplaced The reason is that if investors had decided to collect initial margin, they  would have collected enough margin to cover their estimate of potential future exposure By  hypothesis, they seriously underestimated that exposure, so they would be still left with a serious  shortfall in their margin  6  Thank you, Mr Chairman  The first exhibit provides some  background on efforts to analyze the policy issues raised by recent financial developments  and an overview of today’s briefing  As indicated in the top panel, in response to a request  from the G-7, at its meeting last September the Financial Stability Forum (FSF) created a  Working Group on Market and Institutional Resilience  The working group’s mandate calls  for it to develop a diagnosis of the causes of the recent financial market turmoil, to identify  weaknesses in markets and institutions that merit attention from policymakers, and to  recommend actions needed to enhance market discipline and institutional resilience  The  working group has been asked to prepare a report for consideration by the FSF at its meeting  in March so that the FSF can complete a final report to the G-7 in April  The President’s  Working Group on Financial Markets (PWG) is conducting its own analysis along the same  lines and will ensure coordination among the US members of the FSF working group   Chairman Bernanke, Vice Chairman Kohn, and President Geithner asked the Board’s Staff  Umbrella Group on Financial Stability to organize and coordinate staff support for their  participation in the FSF working group and the PWG’s effort  Specifically, they asked the                                                     6 The materials used by Mr Parkinson, Mr Gibson, Ms Hirtle, Mr Greenlee, and Mr Angulo are appended to this  transcript (appendix 6)   January 29–30, 2008 158 of 249    staff to analyze the nine sets of issues listed in the middle panel  Subgroups of staff from the  Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York were formed to address each set of issues,  and work is well under way on all of them  The first four of these issues will be discussed in  today’s briefing     As shown in the bottom panel, today’s briefing will consist of three presentations  I will   start by presenting a diagnosis of the underlying reasons that losses on US subprime  mortgages triggered a global financial crisis  This diagnosis will suggest that among the  most important factors were (1) a loss of investor confidence in the ratings of structured- finance products and asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP), which caused structured-credit  markets to seize up and ABCP markets to contract, and (2) the resulting losses and balance  sheet pressures on financial intermediaries, especially many of the largest global financial  services organizations  In the second presentation, Mike Gibson and Beverly Hirtle, to my  left, will present an analysis of issues relating to credit rating agencies and investor practices  with respect to credit ratings  Then, further to my left, Jon Greenlee and Art Angulo will  make the final presentation, which will focus on risk-management weaknesses at large global  financial services organizations and the extent to which bank regulatory policies contributed  to, or failed to mitigate, those weaknesses  I should note that also at the table today we have  Norah Barger, who worked with Art Angulo on the regulatory policy issues, and Brian  Peters, who worked with Jon Greenlee on the risk-management issues     Turning to the next exhibit, the diagnosis begins with the extremely weak underwriting   standards for US adjustable-rate subprime mortgages originated between late 2005 and  early 2007  As shown by the solid line in the top left panel, as housing prices softened in  2006 and 2007, the delinquency rate for such mortgages soared, exceeding 20 percent of the  entire outstanding stock by late 2007  In contrast, the dashed line shows that the delinquency  rate on the stock of outstanding fixed-rate subprime mortgages increased only 2 percentage  points over the same period, to around 7 percent  Nearly all of the adjustable-rate subprime  mortgages were packaged in residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS), which were  structured in tranches with varying degrees of exposure to credit losses  The top right panel  shows indexes of prices of subprime RMBS that are collateralized by mortgages that were  originated in the second half of 2006  The blue line shows that prices of BBB minus tranches  already had fallen significantly below par in January 2007 and continued to decline  throughout last year, falling to less than 20 percent of par by late October  Prices of AAA  tranches (the black line), which are vulnerable only to very severe credit losses on the  underlying subprime mortgages, remained near par until mid-July, but they slid to around  90 percent of par by early August  After stabilizing for a time, they fell more steeply in  October and November and now trade at around 70 percent of par      As shown in the middle left panel, from 2004 through the first half of 2007, increasing   amounts of subprime RMBS were purchased by managers of collateralized debt obligations  backed by asset-backed securities—that is, ABS CDOs  High-grade CDOs purchased  subprime RMBS with an average rating of AA, whereas mezzanine CDOs purchased  subprime RMBS with an average rating of BBB  The middle right panel shows the typical  ratings at origination of high-grade and mezzanine CDOs  In the case of high-grade CDOs,  5 percent of the securities were rated AAA, and a further 88 percent were “super senior”   January 29–30, 2008 159 of 249    tranches, which would be exposed to credit losses only if the AAA tranches were wiped out   Even in the case of the mezzanine CDOs, the collateral was perceived to be sufficiently  strong and diversified that 14 percent of the securities issued were rated AAA at origination  and 62 percent were super senior  As delinquencies mounted and prices of RMBS slid well  below par, the credit rating agencies were forced to downgrade (or place on watch for  downgrade) very large percentages of outstanding ABS CDOs  The bottom left panel shows  that such negative actions were quite frequent throughout the capital structures of both high- grade and mezzanine CDOs, even among the AAA-rated tranches  Moreover, the  downgrades frequently were severe and implied very substantial writedowns, even of some  AAA tranches  When this became apparent to investors, they lost not only faith in the ratings  of ABS CDOs but also confidence in the ratings of a much broader range of structured  securities  Likewise, sophisticated investors who relied on their own models lost faith in  those models as writedowns significantly exceeded what the models led them to expect  As a  result, large segments of the structured-credit markets seized up  In particular, as shown in  the bottom right panel, issuance of all types of non-agency RMBS declined substantially over  the second half of 2007  Although comprehensive data for January are not yet available,  conversations with market participants suggest there has been very little or no issuance     Your next exhibit focuses on two other markets that were affected by a loss of investor   confidence—the leveraged-loan market and the ABCP market  The top left panel of that  exhibit shows that spreads on credit default swaps on leveraged loans (the solid black line)  already had come under significant pressure in June  By July these spreads had widened  about 150 basis points  Investors had become concerned about a substantial buildup of  unfunded commitments to extend leveraged loans (the dashed blue line), which in the US  market eventually peaked at $250 billion in July  As shown in the top right panel, as many  segments of the structured-credit markets seized up, issuance of collateralized loan  obligations dropped off significantly in the third quarter, adding to the upward pressure on  spreads on leveraged loans  Nonetheless, the CLO markets continued to function much more  effectively than the non-agency RMBS and ABS CDO markets  As shown in the bottom left  panel, from 2005 to 2007, the US ABCP market grew very rapidly  Much of the growth  was accounted for by conduits that purchased securities, including highly rated non-agency  RMBS and ABS CDO tranches, rather than by more traditional “multi-seller” conduits that  purchased short-term corporate and consumer receivables  As investors became aware that  some of the underlying collateral consisted of RMBS and ABS CDOs, they pulled back from  the ABCP market generally, even to some extent from the multi-seller programs  Between  July and December, total ABCP outstanding declined about $350 billion, or nearly one-third   The bottom right panel provides additional information on the growth of ABCP by program  type  As shown in the first column, during the period of rapid growth from 2005 to July  2007, ABCP issued by structured-investment vehicles (SIVs) and CDOs grew far more  rapidly than any other program type  The second column shows that, when investors pulled  back from the ABCP markets, those program types shrank especially rapidly  The only  program type that declined more rapidly during that period was single-seller programs  The  single-seller category included a significant amount of paper issued by nondepository  mortgage companies to finance mortgages in their private securitization pipelines, and this  paper has almost completely run off      January 29–30, 2008 160 of 249    The next exhibit focuses on how the seizing-up of structured-credit markets and the  contraction of ABCP markets adversely affected banks, especially many of the largest global  banks  As you know, a combination of balance sheet pressures, concerns about liquidity, and  concerns about counterparty credit risk made banks reluctant to provide term funding to each  other and to other market participants  The top left panel of exhibit 4 lists the principal  sources of bank exposures to the recent financial stress  leveraged-loan commitments,  sponsorship of ABCP programs, and the retention of exposures from underwriting ABS  CDOs  The top right panel shows the banks that were the leading arrangers of leveraged  loans in recent years  The three largest US bank holding companies (BHCs) head this list   As spreads widened and liquidity declined in the leveraged-loan market, these banks became  very concerned about potential losses and liquidity pressures from leveraged-loan exposures   Although these exposures were smaller at the US securities firms, those firms were even  more concerned because of their smaller balance sheet capacity  However, to date the  adverse impact on banks and securities firms from these exposures has been relatively  modest and manageable  The middle left panel shows the leading bank sponsors of global  (US and European) securities-related ABCP programs—that is, programs that invest in  asset-backed securities, including SIVs, securities arbitrage programs, and certain hybrid  programs  As the conduits that issued the ABCP encountered difficulty rolling their paper  over, many of these banks, fearful of damage to their reputations, elected to purchase assets  from the conduits or extend credit to them, which proved in many cases to be a significant  source of balance sheet pressures  This list is dominated by European banks  Indeed, the  only US bank among the top nineteen sponsors is Citigroup  However, Citigroup was the  largest sponsor of SIVs, which, in addition to issuing ABCP, issue substantial amounts of  medium-term notes  Citigroup, like nearly all SIV sponsors, eventually felt obliged to  provide full liquidity support for all the liabilities of its SIVs, which amounted to around  $60 billion at year-end  The memo item shows that some other US banks sponsored  securities-related ABCP programs that were relatively small in absolute terms but significant  as a share of their total assets       But losses from leveraged-loan commitments and conduit sponsorship have paled in   comparison to the losses some banks and securities firms have incurred from the retention of  super senior exposures from ABS CDOs  These include exposures that the underwriters  never sold, exposures that originally were funded by ABCP issued by the CDOs that was  supported by liquidity facilities provided by the underwriters, and relatively small amounts of  exposures purchased from affiliated money funds for reputational reasons  The middle right  panel shows the leading underwriters of ABS CDOs in 2006-07  Merrill Lynch, Citigroup,  and UBS head the list  Each of those firms has suffered very large subprime CDO-related  losses, and Citigroup and UBS still reported very significant exposures at year-end  As  shown in the memo items, among the other very largest US bank holding companies, only  Bank of America has suffered significant losses or still has significant exposures from  underwriting ABS CDOs  I should note that the exposures shown in the exhibit are net of  hedges purchased from financial guarantors, and most of these firms have hedged a  significant portion of their exposure  As you know, there are concerns about the ability of  the guarantors to honor their obligations under the hedging contracts  Indeed, some firms  have begun to write down the value of their hedges with the most troubled financial  guarantors   January 29–30, 2008 161 of 249      The bottom left panel shows total risk-based capital ratios for the four largest US bank   holding companies  All four remained comfortably above the 10 percent minimum for well- capitalized companies at year-end  Of course, Citigroup was able to do so only by raising  substantial amounts of capital at a relatively high cost, and each of the other companies also  announced capital-raising efforts  Moreover, Citigroup’s year-end ratio of tangible common  equity to risk-weighted managed assets was 57 percent, well below the 65 percent target  ratio that several of the rating agencies monitor and that Citigroup seeks to meet  The bottom  right panel shows credit default swap spreads for the three largest US BHCs  On balance,  spreads for all three have moved up about 60 to 70 basis points since the market turmoil  began  The spread for Citigroup has been elevated since October, when investors began to  become aware of its subprime CDO exposures  The spreads for Bank of America and  JPMorgan were in line with a broad index of bank spreads at year-end but jumped in early  January on Bank of America’s announcement of its planned acquisition of Countrywide and  JPMorgan’s announcement of substantial additions to its loan-loss reserves  Spreads for all  three companies fell back more in line with the index last week  Thank you  I will now take  your questions on this presentation before you proceed to Mike and Beverly’s presentation       Mike is going to address that in his briefing  I guess I’d prefer to delay   and just simply say that I think we can point to aspects of their methodology that look fairly weak so   that it wasn’t simply an ex post result but one that should have been foreseen at least to a degree if   they had had a stronger methodology ex ante  Obviously that’s Monday morning quarterbacking,   but still you can point to specific things that were weaknesses     I think that was the rating at origination     Yes     Yes  They reflect the developments in terms of the changes in their   financial statements during the fourth quarter until the year-end     Right  Well, particularly with respect to developments in the last   month or two, obviously the economic outlook is cloudier  As you know, I don’t think we try to   reflect that fully in the capital ratios, and there is an element of stress testing and whatnot, but your   other important effects are essentially looking through the cycle  So that may be part of it  Also, if   you look at the credit default swap spread behavior compared with that for lots of other financial   intermediaries out there, these look like very modest changes  I don’t know—if Mike or someone   could help me out—to what extent these would translate into significant increases in actual implied   default probabilities, but I wouldn’t think it would be all that large an increase     Well, partly what I would say, in general, about the pricing of risk is   that many, many people, including people in the Federal Reserve, were concerned about how   narrow spreads were, were concerned about some of the slippage of practices, and were predicting   that trouble lay ahead  But—and I’m certainly speaking for myself—I never expected this   magnitude of trouble  What I’ve been focusing on are some of the factors that essentially made a   bad situation much worse than we expected it to be  But there is no question that we entered the   period with risk being priced very cheaply and a fundamental reassessment of risk  Again, I think   that shouldn’t have surprised anyone, but almost everyone except the most extreme pessimists has   been surprised by just how much trouble that repricing of risk has caused  Some things that we   January 29–30, 2008 166 of 249    have focused on certainly were not anticipated, and we think they made the situation markedly   worse than we expected it to be     Thanks  I’m just going to go over the last few pages of the   handout you have, pages 13 through 15  Page 13 is just a table reminding you who  the primary dealers are and providing some basic information about their size,  borrowing activity, and regulatory status  As you probably know, there are currently  20 primary dealers, although as Art mentioned we’re about to lose two of them—Bear  Stearns and Countrywide  An important point to note, which ran through Scott’s  presentation, is that although the investment banks—the four firms that are subject to  consolidated supervision by the SEC under their CSE program—are among the  largest primary dealers, there are some very large bank-affiliated dealers, including  not only affiliates of US banks but also affiliates of German, Swiss, British, and  French banks  Also, if you look at column 3, you’ll see—and these are data that we  get from the two government securities clearing banks that facilitate tri-party repo,  JPMorgan Chase and Bank of New York—that it shows that the investment banks are  not, in fact, the largest borrowers in the tri-party repo markets  Rather that distinction  belongs to Deutsche Bank, Banc of America, and Barclays  I think that’s significant  because arguably the biggest threat from Bear’s bankruptcy was the impact on the   June 24–25, 2008 145 of 253    availability of secured financing, especially from money funds and other highly risk- adverse investors that provide tri-party financing to the dealers  So we have some  very large borrowings by those non–investment bank firms  Columns 4 and 5 provide  some information about how these firms are regulated  Essentially the legal entity  itself in every case but one is a broker-dealer regulated by the SEC, and in that case  it’s a government securities dealer regulated by the Treasury but the SEC really does  the enforcement of those Treasury regulations  Finally, all of these firms except one,  Cantor Fitzgerald, which is an inter-dealer broker, are subject to some form of  consolidated supervision by one or another consolidated regulator, although the  regimes can differ appreciably  The OTS has a regime for Countrywide, I guess  being a notable example itself, quite different from the one that we would apply     So with those facts in mind, turn to the next two pages  I don’t intend to go   through all these questions, but what we’ve done here is set out some issues for  discussion  Basically there are two sets, one relating to the future of our liquidity  facilities for the primary dealers and the other relating to the supervisory  arrangements through which we’re seeking to mitigate the moral hazard that those  liquidity facilities create  In each case, there are questions about what to do under  current laws, until such time as the Congress may change those laws  Then there are  questions about what legislative changes we might seek, particularly if the Congress  shows an inclination to legislate in this area  Our purpose for this list of questions is  to stimulate a discussion among you about these important issues and to provide you  with an opportunity to express any preliminary views you may have  With that, I  think we’d be pleased to answer questions on any of the three staff presentations   Thanks       I can’t answer that, but that’s a good question  I mean, the basic   problem here is that you have a tremendous demand for investments that have essentially the   characteristics of Treasury bills, but the supply of Treasury bills isn’t nearly as large as that demand   coming from money market mutual funds and from investment of cash collateral on securities   lending and other kinds of secured financing  Over time, the marketplace has come up with   synthetic Treasury bills of various sorts, but those short-term investments have been created outside   the banking system by and large because the inability to pay interest on demand deposits doesn’t   allow them to be provided by the banking system  Now, if that prohibition were removed, I think   you would see banks offering things that would be competing with overnight repos, overnight   commercial paper, and other sorts of things that are outside the banking system that are meeting   these needs   In terms of the effects on stability, whether that leaves us in a better place obviously would   depend on how good a job we do of regulating maturity transformation by the commercial banking   system  An interesting question there is—whenever I hear Art give his presentation and look at   June 24–25, 2008 149 of 253    these stress tests we’re applying to the investment banks, even under current conditions, when   they’re not offering overnight interest-bearing deposits—how well our banks would fare if we   tested them against these standards  But I think your observation and your question are good ones     I have in front of me data from Bank of New York, which facilitates   about two-thirds of the repos  At Bank of New York, 18 percent of the collateral is debt that’s   settled through DTC—so that would be non-government, non-agency debt—and another 6 percent   is equity  So about 25 percent is non-OMO things  The biggest chunk by far is agency MBS  Of   course, I think in extremis Bear was having trouble financing even agency debt, importantly given   the illiquidity that had developed in even the agency debt markets at that time, which was the   critical thing that made investors no longer willing to provide financing for that kind of collateral   with a shaky counterparty     Well, the other big category that we have been able to identify of   entities that are providing tri-party financing is the custodian banks that act as agents for securities   lenders  When someone lends out securities, they often take in cash collateral  Then they want to   reinvest that collateral, and the big bank custodians do that on their behalf and invest a portion of   that cash in tri-party  Interestingly, JPMorgan Chase and Bank of New York Mellon are two of the   big banks involved in that particular business  So that’s another category   I think maybe what you’re getting at is about dealing with the issues of the tri-party market   per se  We have to be very careful in our approach to these issues because the situation is still very   fragile, and until we get out of this period of turmoil, we first want to do no harm there  But any   solution can’t be focused solely or even primarily on the clearing banks and the way they process   these transactions, although that’s part of it  It also has to focus on the behavior of the borrowers   and the lenders, and the borrowers are basically all of these primary dealers and certain other big   broker-dealers  The lenders are more diverse, which makes them more difficult to deal with  But I   think there are certainly questions about whether they’re managing their risks effectively  If you’re   a money fund and you’re treating an overnight repo secured by illiquid collateral as the equivalent   of an overnight Treasury bill, there’s something problematic about that in terms of your own   thinking about the situation you’d be in if, in fact, the borrower were unable to repay     The repos are exempt from the automatic stay provisions of the   bankruptcy code  But if Lehman had gone into SIPA liquidation, they could have been subject to   a SIPA stay     No, I don’t think so  Again, I think the message, as Bill is saying,   from the investors and the issuers was that a three-year term would greatly enhance the chances   of success  Indeed, I think our friends in the Treasury Department, at least in the case of   government-guaranteed loans, would like to go even longer than that  But both the Board staff   and the New York staff thought that it would work best at three years     The lenders, I think he was saying  Some of the buyers vanished in   the sense that they were SIVs or a lot of them were actually securities lenders who were   reinvesting their cash collateral in this, and they have learned a lesson about doing that   December 15–16, 2008 223 of 284      But we could accelerate that process by raising the minimum rate at   which we would lend and so make it a higher spread above LIBOR  If we are going to do it through   an auction—there are still some questions about how to allocate the credit within this program—and   if there is a minimum rate at which we would make funds available in the auction (that would be the   December 15–16, 2008 225 of 284    spread over LIBOR) and we adjust that spread upward, we’re giving them more of a push to go   back to relying on market financing     Even of those who are saying that today they’re having trouble not   only placing the AAA but also placing the other tranches, a number say that, if you could start   pricing the AAA tranche, that would make placing the others a lot easier  Basically you’d be   determining how much of the spread income from the underlying assets has to go to the AAA, and   that tells you how much you have left to compensate the lower rated     Well, that’s the fundamental problem  Again, some of them were   these classes of investors, who are no longer around  Even if they were around, I don’t think we’d   want them around—the SIV and securities lenders et cetera  But then you have the pension funds,   the insurance companies, and so forth that are not in the market, and this really doesn’t do anything   at least initially to bring them back to the market  We have scratched our heads at some length   trying to figure out a program that the Federal Reserve could develop that would entice them into   December 15–16, 2008 228 of 284    the market  But I think the fundamental problem is that our tool is the ability to lend, and if we’re   lending, there has to be a borrower  If you’re talking about pension funds or life insurance   companies that are not leveraged investors, it’s just not clear how we can do much to help them get   enthusiastic again about buying these securities  In the longer run, the agenda of providing liquidity   to markets has to be joined with the reform agenda and figuring out what we can do to bring back   confidence in structured credit products by those types of investors  There are lots of   recommendations out there—from the President’s Working Group and the Financial Stability   Forum—and SIFMA came out with a long study about restoring confidence in the securitization   markets  All of that, unfortunately, is going to take a while to implement, and as with so many other   things these days, we’re in uncharted territory  Nobody knows for sure, I think, whether any of   those things, even though they make sense, will really be sufficient to bring those investors back    But as much as we try to come up with programs to address that, it seems at the moment to be   beyond our power     No     I think it comes back to the point that Bill made earlier  If you’re a   hedge fund, even LIBOR plus 500 is still not a rich enough return to that hedge fund unless you can   borrow against those securities and leverage it up into a higher return  And until 18 months ago you   could have gotten the financing from Deutsche Bank, the Swiss banks, or any of our fine US   banks; but it doesn’t appear at the moment that any of them are terribly interested in lending on a   secured basis even to the strongest of hedge funds  They’re simply hiding somewhere     I think the conduits were more important in some asset classes than   others  In credit cards, for example, the conduits were pretty important  But even there they were   important in recent years  I think they were important in recent years because spreads kept on   coming down and down and deterred the real money investors that traditionally invested in these   products—they were no longer interested  Yet the underwriters were able to keep the game going at   those low spreads by resorting to selling to conduits and securities lenders and those sorts of things    December 15–16, 2008 232 of 284    So over time, if we could deal with some of the issues around confidence and ratings and the other   things that may be deterring the real money investors from entering the market, there is a hope of   bringing them back and going back not to 2007, when it was conduits and that kind of stuff, but to,   say, 2002, when you had real money investors buying these securities     We’ve heard from practically everyone that’s not within the class of   consumer ABS and SBA loans  We have heard from the commercial real estate people and from   the auto dealers about their floor plan loans; we have heard from the banks that would like to get the   motorcycles and leases  But also corporate loans—the CLO (collateralized loan obligation) market   also is shut down  So there is no question  Again, we’re in a hard place because, if we weren’t   constrained in part by the TARP capital and our concerns about our balance sheet, we would maybe   be able to have a much broader program in which we didn’t have to make these kinds of decisions    But given that there’s only $20 billion of TARP capital and we’re willing at this point to go only to   $200 billion, you can’t really say we’ll take all these different asset classes
