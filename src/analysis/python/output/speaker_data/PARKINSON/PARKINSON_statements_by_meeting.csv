3508,1998-09-29," I would like to draw an analogy As you may know, we use the  VAR model to measure market risk The danger is that this analysis does not cover potential  losses in extremely volatile situations In those markets we have to do stress testing to uncover  what exposures are there The same distinction is important here, and I think it lies at the heart  of the problem LTCM is using a VAR-type model, the same basic technology as our VAR, to  measure potential future exposure But that model estimates exposure in normal markets on the    9/29/98  basis of one-day movements, perhaps at a 95 percent confidence level It does not deal with the  kind of markets we are seeing today The latter are extremely volatile and currently very illiquid  For example, Peter Fisher talked about equity option positions Now, suppose investors have to  close those positions out and try to replace them by going into the market There is no liquidity  whatsoever in that market It is completely illiquid I think this emphasis on initial margin  actually is misplaced The reason is that if investors had decided to collect initial margin, they  would have collected enough margin to cover their estimate of potential future exposure By  hypothesis, they seriously underestimated that exposure, so they would be still left with a serious  shortfall in their margin "
