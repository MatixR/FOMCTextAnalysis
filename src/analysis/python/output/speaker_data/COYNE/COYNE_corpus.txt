 That was recirculated to the Committee in May of 1988   It's the 24th   It has been released to three reporters, one of whom used it   Market News Service used it last week; we had a few requests--   Yes   That's right; they are aware They call it [unintelligible]   Oh, believe me, you will get asked! [Laughter]   I think it just takes a couple of minutes for the wires to get it on   It will be something similar, I think, to what we did in July   This goes back, I would say, 15 years when there was a lot of discussion in the press stemming from comments made by various members of the Committee both before and after an FOMC meeting Some of the papers liked to do a summary story immediately before the meeting They would do a round-robin, calling all 19 people They would compare answers and try to figure out what was going to happen We were asked to put together some informal guidelines These are not "rules" of the Committee They are simply guidelines that I have propagated to the Committee The purpose was to help the Committee deal with the press in sensitive periods One of the things we came up with, that the then-Chairman agreed with, was this blackout period People were not to talk to the press a week before and a week after a Committee meeting The purpose was to try to prevent all the speculation in the press and subsequently in the market about what the Committee would do Now, we still get that speculation, but we get it from commentators We do not get it from members of the Committee anymore It has worked to an extent It has not worked 100 percent But a lot of members of the Committee use the blackout period to avoid talking to the press during these sensitive periods   It has been very useful in my view If you are going to make the blackout period asymmetrical, I would say make it asymmetrical to the Friday following the meeting rather than for just two days If it is only two days, then everybody will jump on it after 48 hours, and we are still going to get a lot of different comments One of the problems is, if someone comments one way, as Mr Forrestal just said, somebody else is going to try to jump the other way Then we are going to get more and more people commenting   That is right   Someone asked whether it just covered monetary policy It was supposed to cover monetary policy and the economy--  -35-    1/31-2/1/95  things that the Committee discusses when it is formulating monetary policy   Fine   No, you did not   215 pm   430 pm   Our current practice is to release them at 430 pm on a Friday   Yes, we could Some options markets stay open beyond 400 pm
