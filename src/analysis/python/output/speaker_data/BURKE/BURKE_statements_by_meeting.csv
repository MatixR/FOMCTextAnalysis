8526,2009-04-28," Thank you, Seth Mr Chairman  I will now review the baseline  balance sheet projections, which are shown in exhibit 2  As Seth noted, assets  determine the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet over the next several years   If credit extended under 13(3) programs and through the liquidity swaps evolves as  assumed, the long-term asset purchases and TALF loans will be the dominant factors  driving balance sheet growth The baseline projection sees these programs expanding  rapidly over the remainder of this year, and consequently, total assets surge and  eventually peak at $34 trillion at year-end, an increase of about $12 trillion from  current levels  At that point, agency debt and agency MBS make up over 40 percent  of total assets, whereas Treasury securities represent less than a quarter of total assets,  much less than the roughly 90 percent share that Treasury debt represented in 2007   The increase in TALF loans also contributes to the very rapid expansion of the  balance sheet in 2009 Subsequently, however, with asset purchases having ceased  and TALF loans no longer being extended, the maturation and the prepayment of  assets cause a gradual contraction in assets until the end of 2015  At that point, the  Desk resumes open market operations to maintain reserve balances around the  $25 billion level   Because balance sheets balance, total liabilities increase along with assets this  year Given our assumptions for steady and moderate currency growth, the level of  reserve balances largely parallels the path of assets, although the substantial reserve- adding decline in Treasury account balances at the Fed further increases reserve  balances this year In the baseline scenario, reserve balances peak at $24 trillion at  the end of this year Thereafter, reserve balances decline, following the contraction in  assets, and approach zero in 2015 Because some positive level of balances is needed  for the implementation of policy, as noted above, we assume that the Desk resumes  its historical practice of open market operations to offset drains of reserve balances  caused by currency growth and maturing assets   We calculate the monetary base as the sum of currency and reserve balances  As  presented in exhibit 3, in the baseline scenario the monetary base grows rapidly in  2009 and into 2010 After the first quarter of 2010, however, the monetary base                          April 28–29, 2009 11 of 201  begins to contract as the liquidity facilities are winding down, new asset purchases  cease, and previously purchased assets begin to mature  The base continues to  contract until 2015, at which point the expansion of currency and the stabilization of  reserve balances lead to a resumption of growth   If economic conditions worsen or the Committee judges that greater stimulus is  warranted, an even greater expansion of the balance sheet would result  A more  aggressive path for asset purchases, like alternative A in the Bluebook, assumes an  additional $450 billion in purchases of Treasury debt in 2009  An even greater  escalation—along the lines of that assumed in the Desk memo of April 24, 2009, to  the Committee—assumes the same $450 billion in new Treasury debt purchases and  also assumes that TALF loans reach the $1 trillion limit  Moreover, for illustrative  purposes, the second wave of TALF loans is assumed to have a five-year maturity   The resulting path for the Federal Reserve’s assets is shown in exhibits 4 and 5   Under these alternative scenarios, assets peak at $37 trillion and $42 trillion,  respectively Similar to the baseline, after asset purchases stop and TALF loans reach  their limit, assets begin to decline  Under both alternative scenarios, the balance sheet  shrinks to the same size as in the baseline scenario in 2015  Given the greater amount  of assets, reserve balances are also larger in these two expansion scenarios  They  peak at the end of this year at $29 trillion and $32 trillion, respectively, but decline  in a manner similar to the baseline until the end of 2015  As was shown in exhibit 3,  the growth in the monetary base is qualitatively similar to that in the baseline   Under the Greenbook projection, the Committee is assumed to begin raising the  federal funds rate in 2013 At that point in the baseline, there is more than  $400 billion in reserve balances, and balances are even higher under the two  expansion scenarios  Thus, these projections implicitly assume that alternative tools  and operating procedures can be put in place to achieve the path for the federal funds  rate consistent with the goals of monetary policy even with elevated reserve balances  As Trish noted, these issues are under study by the staff and will be discussed at the  next meeting      The GSEs are selling fed funds, and banks are buying them, holding them,   and arbitraging the rate as you’re suggesting But roughly speaking, 80 percent of the brokered   volume that we’re seeing in fed funds is GSE sales  So in terms of what we’re seeing as actual   rates being reported and why those rates are where they are, I believe it’s a function of  GSEs                    April 28–29, 2009 42 of 201  selling and banks buying, where banks buy at 15 and hold at 25 and make that arbitrage  But   that doesn’t answer the question of why more banks aren’t buying more and then lending and   making an even bigger spread  The anecdotal evidence that the Desk has gotten from the banks   is that it’s a leverage ratio constraint  "
8592,2009-08-11," Thank you, Mr Chairman  The FOMC has discussed using  reverse repo operations in scale as part of its strategy for eventually draining reserves  and raising short-term interest rates from their current low levels  This briefing will  provide an update on operational readiness, describe some of the key aspects of the  program and their implications, and briefly discuss the importance of counterparties,  including a discussion of the special case of conducting reverse repos with the GSEs   An important operational aspect of large-scale reverse repos is the form of  settlement  There are three different types of settlement—delivery versus payment,  held in custody, and triparty The Federal Reserve has used all three, but for large- scale reverse repos, triparty settlement is the only feasible choice  In triparty repo,  both the borrower and the lender have cash and collateral accounts at the same  triparty repo agent, either JPMorgan Chase or Bank of New York Mellon  There are  several reasons why triparty settlement is required  Most important, it provides  access to the wide range of institutional cash investors who use triparty repo  In  addition, triparty agents provide collateral management services for term repo and  other services that current FRBNY systems are not set up to provide   A Federal Reserve reverse repo in the triparty structure, however, is not sufficient  to drain reserves, as at the end of the day the funds that the Fed borrowed are in the  Federal Reserve account of the clearing bank  To drain reserves, therefore, the  clearing banks must take the additional step of sending the funds to the Fed at the end  of the day, and because of the nature of triparty, the Fed must return the funds to the  clearing banks each morning  These additional steps create operational and legal  complexities for the program  As such, the staff believes that the Desk should  establish a complete operational and legal system for conducting reverse repos using  Treasury and direct agency debt first, before designing the ability to conduct reverse  repos using agency MBS collateral, which involves further complexities                         August 11–12, 2009 31 of 165  An initial reverse repo program with the capacity of as much as $100 billion,  using primary dealers as counterparties and Treasury and direct agency debt as  collateral, is expected to be available in early September  This has required the  establishment of new tools to manage the operational aspects of the program, new  legal documentation with both the clearing banks and the dealers, and negotiations  with the clearing banks on the fees involved  Because the main services that triparty  repo agents perform involve the management and pricing of collateral, the triparty  fees are paid by the collateral providers Even though the Federal Reserve has been  using the triparty system for repo transactions for years without paying fees, the use  of triparty repo to drain reserves will require the Fed to pay fees to the clearing banks   Initial discussions with the clearing banks suggest that annual triparty fees for a  reverse repo portfolio of $500 billion are likely to be in the range of $10 million to  $15 million  Current discussions with the clearing banks are focused on eliminating  the differences in proposed fees from the two clearing banks and reducing the final  fees Negotiations could take up to another month to complete and document   The legal and fee groundwork laid for reverse repos using Treasury and agency  debt should also cover the use of agency mortgage-backed securities  However, new  operational processes will need to be designed and implemented for agency MBS,  primarily because of our use of investment managers and custodial accounts for  managing our agency MBS holdings  We anticipate that the extension to agency  MBS collateral should be completed in the fourth quarter   The most important issue regarding the potential scope of the reverse repo  program is the set of counterparties  Our current open market operations are  conducted with only the 18 primary dealers  However, primary dealers tend to be net  borrowers, not net lenders, in the repo market, meaning that as a group they are a  poor fit as reverse repo counterparties  Further, dealers have limited capacity to act as  intermediaries between the Fed and other cash investors, as doing so would gross up  their balance sheets Based on discussions with about half the primary dealer  community, total dealer capacity for reverse repos is expected to be only about  $100 billion and perhaps only half of that on month-ends  Dealers simply do not have  the balance sheet capacity to handle the size of program being contemplated  Thus a  program of any size will require an expansion of the counterparty list  The  identification and establishment of an expanded set of counterparties, which is what  would enable the expansion of the program beyond its initial $100 billion size, should  be complete by year-end     One area of exploration related to expanded counterparties is a reverse repo  program focused on the GSEs, in particular Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, and the  12 Federal Home Loan Banks  Nearly all have expressed a willingness to consider  engaging in reverse repos with the Fed, and current estimates suggest that a program  targeted at these GSEs would be between $50 billion and $75 billion in size The  potential costs and benefits of a program of this nature, however, require more study,  as the magnitude of the effect on the federal funds rate is not yet fully clear  A  $75 billion program would not substantially reduce the overall level of reserve                       August 11–12, 2009 32 of 165  balances from their current and expected elevated levels  And while it may be the  case that removing these particular participants in the federal funds market would  help increase federal funds rates in general, that conclusion is not obvious  Staff  members at the New York Fed and the Board are working to better understand the  potential rate effects of such a program  In addition, removing the GSEs from the  brokered federal funds market would significantly shrink that market and make it  more idiosyncratic and perhaps a less relevant indicator of broader funding  conditions   These are issues that will have to be addressed when the FOMC considers the  scope of the reverse repo program and the way it fits into a broader strategy for  tightening financial conditions My purpose today was simply to indicate some of the  operational conclusions that we have reached to date and define some of the issues  that policymakers will have to take into consideration going forward  Thank you  Seth Carpenter will now update you on the term deposit facility    I guess a piece of it is going to have to do with their liquidity position  In   talking to them, I think they are feeling that they are being forced to hold more liquidity than   they would have chosen to hold on their own So as their future status changes, if they are   required to hold more liquidity, then they might be selling more into these markets, and then   these solutions would become more important  Or if their liquidity requirements were to   decrease, then they become a bit less of an issue    Our main tool for measuring the fed funds rate is the “fed funds   effective,” which is looking at just that subset of fed funds transactions that are brokered  And in   that market, the GSEs dominate  They are 80-plus percent of those transactions  So when you   start talking about doing something to those transactions, that is the backdrop to my statement   that, if you remove those, you leave a small and potentially idiosyncratic market from which you   are then calculating an effective fed funds rate  So, to Seth’s point, a $75 billion program        August 11–12, 2009 41 of 165  targeted at them is not much with a backdrop of $700 billion or $14 trillion in excess, but it may   be that their role and where they are trading and the visibility of their trades imply another   transmission mechanism affecting just them  That is one of the things that we are trying to   puzzle out     We have been working with our payment systems folks in New York,   who have been working on identifying the issues with the triparty platform and working on   alternatives to the triparty platform, which is, as you noted, based on those two institutions  As   we know with Bear and Lehman and the outcomes there, there are clearly issues with that   system  So, yes, we are somewhat concerned  And I think, with the PDCF sunset date coming   and the role that it is playing in backstopping triparty, clearly some issues are there  A number   of ideas have floated around Some are less difficult to implement than others, but we are going   to follow along with that work and, I hope, piggyback on that   We have started to think a bit about alternatives  The scale of our program is such that it   is going to carry a lot of weight whatever we do, so we are being quite cautious  But depending                 August 11–12, 2009 42 of 165  on who our counterparties end up being, it is entirely possible that we could create our own sort   of mini triparty with another clearing bank, say a State Street or something along those lines    There are an awful lot of issues with that  For that piece of the program, we would end up with a   single clearing bank that was working on it So it is absolutely an issue, it is a concern, and we   are concerned about it, but we will continue to follow the progress of other groups    Should I comment on the scale question?    There are clearly scale issues  The entire size of the triparty repo market   for collateral eligible for open market operations is not much more than $1 trillion  So clearly, if   we get into a market and start trying to double its size, there are going to be issues  We are   starting work now on how these tools might fit together  One assumption may be that reverse   repos would be one of a set of tools that we would use to achieve our objective  As you note, it   doesn’t seem likely that we’d be able to find a market to successfully reverse out $14 trillion in   assets    On a continuing basis  Notwithstanding that, we will have over $2 trillion   on our own balance sheet But an interesting side effect of our doing this amount of repo is that   we know the repo and the fed funds rates are very interconnected and that pressures in one flow   over into the other So the transmission mechanism may actually be that, as we do these reverse   repos and we drive up GC rates, that the increase in GC rates flows through and starts affecting   other rates So it may be with this tool that you do not necessarily need to drain all of the excess   out of the system before you start affecting short-term rates in general  That is another aspect of   this that we will be working on        August 11–12, 2009 45 of 165   I think it is a reasonable intuition  The discussions with the dealers   suggest that there is a limit to the size of their balance sheet “regardless of price”  That will be   something to test, I suspect  [Laughter]    But in principle you could establish a collection scheme by which you get   directly from the banks at the close of business each day the average rate and volume of business   that they have done and then aggregate it and get a more complete picture of fed funds rates      Until very recently, all of our evidence suggested that the brokered fed   funds market was just a good and representative subset of the overall market  Clearly, we are   under the impression that that has changed    Right  "
8646,2009-11-03," Thank you, Nathan Jim Clouse and I will now update the  Committee on staff work on reserve collateral accounts, reserve repurchase  agreements, and term deposits  I will start with reserve collateral accounts   Under a reserve collateral account, or RCA, a pair of institutions—a purchaser of  funds, generally a depository institution, and a seller of funds, typically a GSE—  would set up a special-purpose account at the Federal Reserve  The seller would have  control of the movement of funds into and out of the account  The buyer would be  required to hold the funds in the account, and those funds would both collateralize the  transaction and earn interest on excess reserves  The RCA would eliminate the credit  risk that would have been present in a fed funds sale transaction, allowing lenders  such as GSEs to deal with a greater number of counterparties and theoretically earn a  higher interest rate With line limits becoming less of a constraint on GSEs’ funds  sales, the linkage between the interest rate on reserves and shorter-term rates should  be tightened   Since the last FOMC meeting, we have discussed RCAs in detail with two GSEs,  several depository institutions, and the FDIC  Extrapolating from the feedback from                             November 3–4, 2009 18 of 201  Freddie Mac and the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco, there may be broad  interest from GSEs in lending funds using these accounts  The ability to mitigate  counterparty risk and engage a wider range of counterparties to attain higher interest  rates is understandably attractive to them  On the other hand, the feedback from the  depository institutions was mixed  Some were interested in creating RCAs, some  were indifferent, and some were not in favor of the accounts  Based on their  collective comments, the staff believes that it is possible that some banks would seek  to purchase funds using these accounts, primarily those banks that currently have  higher-than-average equity-to-asset ratios and that do not now borrow from the GSEs   The estimated range of interest rates that would likely be negotiated for sales into  RCAs varied from a high of 5 basis points below the interest rate on excess reserves  to a low of 18 basis points below the IOER rate, though one large money center bank  expressed the view that it would not participate for a spread of less than 50 basis  points   One significant outstanding issue with RCAs is how the FDIC would treat funds  in an RCA in the event of a borrower’s insolvency  In order for RCAs to be viable,  sellers require clear guidance about the disposition of funds in an RCA in this  situation Staff members at the FDIC understand that point but have stated that  further review is necessary We expect to hear back from the FDIC this week   At this point, while it is likely that RCAs could provide some benefits, the  effectiveness of this instrument in tightening our control of short-term interest rates is  difficult to forecast  Moreover, fully developing this instrument would divert staff  members from critical work on term deposits and reverse repos  Because the FOMC  has placed a strong emphasis on the development of those two tools, the staff  recommends that efforts on RCAs be put on hold until the other tools are closer to  fruition   Turning to reverse repos, given the successful testing of triparty reverse repos  with the primary dealers and clearing banks that has taken place over recent weeks,  the Desk now has the capability to settle reverse repurchase agreements in the triparty  system with primary dealers using SOMA Treasury and agency debt securities as  collateral  That said, the Desk recommends that this tool be used in a series of small,  real-value operations to have full confidence that all operational details have been  addressed before reverse repos are deployed in size  The reason is that the tests run to  date, while effective, do not allow for complete end-to-end testing  One possibility  would be for the Desk to conduct a $360 million operation the week of November 16,  and a series of operations the week of November 30 that would not exceed  $14 billion in aggregate at any one time  It would be very important to communicate  to market participants that these small-scale operations are merely an aspect of the  ongoing testing and do not signal that a firming of monetary policy is imminent   Such communication could come from the Desk rather than the FOMC to sharpen  this distinction In particular, the Desk could announce the small-scale operations in  the form of an operating statement, similar to the one issued on October 19                   November 3–4, 2009 19 of 201  The work just described applies only to reverse repos with primary dealers using  Treasury and agency debt securities as collateral  Work continues on establishing the  triparty reverse repo capability using agency MBS securities, as that has several  complicating dimensions to it  We are still some weeks away from finalizing a plan  with the clearing banks, our MBS custodian, and our investment manager, and it may  then take some months to implement the plan  A second set of real-value tests may  prove useful in early 2010, when the capability to reverse out agency MBS securities  is expected to become available   A broader issue regarding reverse repurchase agreements is determining the  appropriate set of counterparties for the Desk  The primary dealers tend to be net  borrowers of funds rather than net providers, which makes them unnatural  counterparties for reverse repos Moreover, there is currently no means for dealers to  borrow collateral from the Fed and then reverse out that collateral to cash providers  without grossing up their balance sheets and affecting their leverage ratios  As a  consequence, the current capacity of the primary dealer community to enter into  reverse repos with the Fed is limited  Based on a Desk survey of all the primary  dealers and a survey conducted by the Treasury Market Practices Group (TMPG),  system capacity appears to be in the range of $100 billion to $250 billion   The staff continues to explore options to expand reverse repo capacity, either by  enabling the dealers to participate to a greater extent or by expanding our  counterparties Dealer capacity might be expanded in a number of ways, including  the use of a netting facility such as the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation’s general  collateral finance repo facility, which would allow the dealers to net their reverse  repos with the Fed with their matching repos with the cash investors and thus keep  these transactions off their balance sheets  It is too soon to tell if any of these  approaches will bear fruit  In terms of providing regulatory relief for balance sheet  concerns, the news is not encouraging  Dealers have identified a host of constraints,  meaning that there is no single solution For example, seven dealers have bank  holding company tier-1 leverage ratio concerns; nine dealers have home-country  constraints (including France, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Japan);  and most dealers noted concerns regarding how credit rating agencies and market  analysts would perceive an increase in balance sheet assets and leverage  Although  solutions to these constraints may exist, many agencies, both foreign and domestic,  would have to coordinate responses As a result, this avenue does not appear to offer  much hope of relief in the short term   While we continue to pursue primary dealer capacity enhancements, we have also  begun to explore issues surrounding expanding reverse repo counterparties beyond  the primary dealers  We have performed an initial survey of the major cash  providers, the largest of which include the money market mutual funds, securities  lenders and custodians, banks, government-sponsored entities, and foreign central  banks Several of these types of firms have characteristics that make them appealing  counterparties The main issue, however, may be related to the number of Desk  counterparties and the logistics of putting a system in place in a timely manner                                      November 3–4, 2009 20 of 201  For practical reasons, the Desk prefers to set up a system in which it interacts with  a limited set of large firms  This would allow us to expand capacity significantly and  relatively quickly For example, based on our very preliminary exploration, we can  identify two dozen firms spanning the categories listed above that currently lend more  than $1 trillion in funds on a short-term basis, with a sizable portion of that taking  place in repo markets  It would be feasible to set up fairly quickly the systems and  arrangements needed to transact with those firms, giving us all the capacity we need   If the Desk must instead provide an opportunity for small firms to participate in  these operations, the logistics of counterparty vetting and trading would likely  become overwhelming, as the Federal Reserve has neither the systems nor the  manpower to reach out to hundreds or thousands of potential cash investors  Thus,  before continuing work on the subject, the Desk would like to solicit guidance from  the Committee on the approach to expanding counterparties  With such guidance, we  will be able to continue to explore potential counterparties with a greater degree of  specificity I’ll now turn it over to Jim to discuss term deposits    Yes    I think it is a sense of timing  We have collateral  We have the ability to   reverse out our Treasury and agency collateral today  Even without agency MBS, we could have   a program of $800 billion from a collateral perspective  The primary dealers, though, as noted,   are limited to something maybe more in the $200 billion range  But that does mean that today   we have $200 billion in capacity, and I think it’s going to depend on the Committee’s answer to   the counterparty discussion If we can deal with a small number of large firms, in very short   order I think we can bring the capacity of this tool to at least match the level of collateral that we   have to reverse out    A very preliminary guess might be somewhere in the year-end time   frame  We have the legal infrastructure in place  We have the authority to deal with the   counterparties So it’s a question of logistically arranging—doing the vetting of the individual   counterparties I think would be the biggest chunk of work there  We can already identify a   super-large, well-known money fund as having a lot of cash to invest  They already deal with   triparty We can already work in triparty  We have the authority to deal with that firm, so it is   getting in and doing the credit review, the regulatory review, and saying, “Okay We are good to   go” And then we can be investing or taking money from them in reverse repo transactions  So I   think in fairly short order If we have to cast a wider net for counterparties, though, it’s going to   be a very different ballgame      Well, I think the intent in my presentation, at least at my level, was to put   the question on the table  I am not sure of the formalities     Actually we want to affirm, if we can, the plan to put RCAs on hold until we   get the reverse repos and term deposits more fully squared away  We would like approval to do   some small, real-value test operations of the reverse repos and, if we are going to do that, maybe the   ability to issue another operating statement similar to the one on October 19    But the last one, as you mentioned, is on counterparties, whether we can   create a system by which we can select a small number of large firms to transact with or whether we   need to cast a wide net and allow small firms to participate                          November 3–4, 2009 34 of 201   Right    I think the context for these tools is that we are in an exit strategy with   rising rates The spreads are much larger than they are now when everything is compressed    The other side of that is, if we want banks to use the facility and be interested, our feeling was   that you need to allow them either to break the trade if they needed funds or to be able to pledge   it as collateral at the discount window if they needed funds  "
