2643,1984-10-02," Well, I can't add anything other than to say that we support the Ed Boehne concept We think things are going really well There's nothing wrong with sitting here right on target Our staff forecast has, as does the Greenbook, fourth-quarter growth more in the 4 percent range And we're optimistic about 8 percent nominal GNP growth next year I would only add to two things that have been talked about earlier In our District we also have agricultural problems, and I concur with Roger that these problems are going to show up in the first quarter of '85 and later And, of course, the thrift industry problems--and it seems we must have half of them, all arising at one time--are, as I think Jerry pointed out, in fact causing great concern in the financial community Bankers are huddling for strange reasons They have strange views about borrowing; they have strange views about a lot of things; and they're very nervous about the thrift industry   Mr Chairman, the Twelfth District supports the specifications of ""B"" and very much what Ted just said and what Bob Boykin said We think it's premature to make any change right now We don't [know] exactly where the stop point is And the point that Jerry Corrigan made our staff thinks is very important that if [rates] were to go down too much too quickly, we could find ourselves starting off 1985 with the whipsaw effect And for that reason we feel very strongly about the specifications of ""B"" as written "
2904,1985-12-16," Mr Chairman, I am going to pick up on Governor Seger's comments about simplification and maybe some mechanical problems that will make M1 worse I think the reason that banks have not simplified is very simple For the most part, most banks have little or no internal cost controls and don't know what [a deposit] costs them I know for the West Coast [banks] I can say that They have zero idea what it costs them to run a savings account Those that have looked at it recently have come up with staggering numbers I am talking about a hundred dollars a year to run a 5-1/2 percent savings account If you take that number on a $5000 deposit and you went up to 5-1/2 percent on an MMDA rate, up to 5-1/2 percent you would be better off; it would be cheaper to offer a higher rate of interest and get rid of the overhead cost to run a savings account   It's cheaper to run any type of account than a passbook savings account by virtue of some of the anomalies--for example, sending out quarterly statements, the mailing costs, and the fact that some still require passbooks, etc Yes, you can achieve some real economies of scale as far as trying to get one account that will enable you to have trailing balances I'm saying 2 or 3 things for information All I am suggesting is that the reason we haven't seen simplification is not because it won't occur, but when it does occur it will further complicate M1 It's simply because banks haven't figured out how much it costs them But probably more important than that In the 1980s banks, particularly the large banks -- [unintelligible] the East Coast banks, the large money center banks in the West--have not had the earnings necessary to spend the dollars, the millions of dollars, for automation redesign So I am just saying that I think this is going to occur and it's going to further complicate M1  The only other comment I have has to do with the staff paper, which we in San Francisco enjoyed reading and thought was well done also We take one exception, and we may be totally wrong, but would just point it out for Committee consideration The staff here says that they believe that the large debit risk overdraft program will  -20-    12/16-17/85  have little or no impact upon M1 That's on page 18 of the staff report We have trouble with that If you look at the total dollar amount of daylight overdrafts that are currently in existence, I in particular have trouble with a statement that it is not going to alter payments Our analysis would indicate in our own District--in any event, the first four or five banks that we have looked at who are pretty good performers from the staff point of view--that overdrafts are really caused by international payments Jerry could probably speak to this better than I, but the overdrafts are not caused by funding needs; they are primarily caused by the participation in CHIPS and things like that And we say, yes, it will affect things in either one or two ways Either somehow there will be fewer payments made per day or some alteration in the payments scheme of things or-- what we think is much more likely and what we are hearing from our banks--there will be a real push, frankly, by the commercial banks to get their depositor to pony up overnight liquid dollars to hold down these payments   As it stands today, I believe there will be some impact; as we press harder, and I am assuming pressing harder is sometime in later 1986, I think it is going to be significant But also I think we have to take into consideration that as yet we have no formal data for those banks that will come in with, let's say, self assessments of not anyone being unsatisfactory and therefore are given zero caps From the data we have there is going to be a considerable number of those across the country You are talking about a significant degree of either a slower payment system or causing corporate customers to pony up the liquid dollars I know it's early and we don't have the data; it's just intuitive And I am not knocking the staff report; I'm saying this as just a warning signal--   The Twelfth District staff forecasts a 3 percent GNP growth, but I would note that some of the assumptions used in that have been described this morning as fragile In our forecast we give a lot more credit to the depreciation of the dollar as [a factor stimulating] the trade account next year--a $15 billion improvement versus, I think, the Board staff's $6 billion We assume that there in fact will be a 50 to 70 basis point decline in the commercial paper rate But most importantly, thinking back to some earlier comments, we assume that whatever reduction of interest rates occurs will be front-loaded--that it will have to occur in the first part of the year to achieve any of this growth And, although less important, another assumption made in our staff forecast is that the price of oil will get to a low of $2150 by year-end 1986  As far as the Twelfth District is concerned, it is relatively unchanged from our report last time Unemployment is staying around 76 percent and we are continuing to experience significant [weakness], as you are well aware, in the wood products sector as well as in electronics, semi-conductors, and agriculture   I am personally totally uncertain as to what should happen But having discussed this with John Balles and no one else, and having listened to this conversation, I think we want to be on record as just a little concerned that the forecast that our staff is making for 1986 on growth, as I indicated earlier, depends upon lowering the short rates very rapidly--front-loading early in the year to offset what may be sluggish spending in the last half of the year So for that reason and other discussions that have gone on here about concerns that 2 percent growth may not be what we want to happen--or at least not sufficient or desirable--we find ourselves in the Guffey- Boehne camp at somewhere between alternatives A and B, with some ease I think we would feel a little more strongly that there ought to be a discount rate cut to get the short rates moving downward "
